This questionable success is reinforced by the fact that no party critical of the government entered into Parliament.
These elections are no indication of a common basis for relations between Europe and Russia built on democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
This discouraging final rehearsal does not bode well at all for the Presidential elections in March 2008 and at the same time shows us the importance of our understanding of values.
(ES) Mr President, thank you for your statement on behalf of our institution condemning the ETA murders.
Moving on to my question, I would like to say that last week I had the opportunity to meet with Mrs Yolanda Pulecio, the mother of Ingrid Betancourt, who as you know has been held as a hostage by FARC since 2001.
She conveyed to me, as I am now conveying to you, to Parliament and the Commission, to the European institutions, the need for the Union to play a fundamental role in supporting the mediation by both Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the President of Venezuela, and of President Sarkozy of France.
On 9 October, the European institutions, through the Portuguese Presidency, also supported this mediation.
This is very important, because a way is opening up for mediation, to put an end to the torment of many hostages that have been held for a long time and to begin to restore normality in the conflict in Colombia.
I therefore ask the European institutions not to let this call from Mrs Yolanda Pulecio, the mother of Ingrid Betancourt, fall on deaf ears.
(Applause)
Mr President, 23 November saw the first anniversary of the murder of my constituent, Alexander Litvinenko, in what was an act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism.
The substance used to kill him, polonium-210, is strictly controlled and is easily traceable back to its source in Russia, even down to the original batch from whence it came.
The crime could only have been authorised at the highest level in the Russian political establishment.
The British authorities have requested the extradition of only one person, Andrei Lugovoi, but the murder was not the act of an individual: a team of trained operatives were involved.
The British Government has ensured that Mr Lugovoi appears to carry sole responsibility, in order to divert attention from where guilt ultimately lies.
The finger of suspicion points straight back to the Kremlin.
If President Putin did not order the deed, he certainly knows who did.
(RO) Mr. President, at the end of the year, the European Commission draws up the report regarding the barriers imposed on access to the labour market.
In my opinion, this report should necessarily emphasize the following two issues: the restrictions imposed on the new Member States are not justified, since their accession has not caused any imbalances on the markets of the other European Union countries; secondly, these restrictions should not exceed the first two years specified by the European labour legislation.
The 2+3+2 formula tends to be used in the Member States as a response to certain current political requirements.
This is why I consider that a firm position of the European institutions from the first two years is necessary in order to stop the unjustified blocking of the labour force movement.
I also want to reaffirm the Community preference principle in the context in which the Parliament discusses the European Blue Card, which will create the possibility to import a labour force of over 20 million people from outside the European Union.
In virtue of this principle, it is abnormal to treat workers from the recently acceded European Union Member States more strictly than those of third countries.
Mr President, the enlargement of the Schengen area is a magnificent Christmas present for 21st-century Europeans, yet a new European curtain is being drawn for our neighbours Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and Belarus: a financial and bureaucratic one in place of the very old iron one.
Before, our neighbours could obtain free or reduced-price visas to travel to many new Schengen countries.
Now they must pay between EUR 35 and 60. This is a third of a monthly salary in some of these countries.
The financial gain from visa taxes is backfiring on the EU itself.
For ordinary neighbours the EU is becoming a distant land.
After all, the more people who visit the EU, the better they can see how we live, and, at the same time, our tourism industry will profit from it.
Also, financially, it is better to permit than to restrain.
We do not need the fortress of Europe.
I turn to my colleagues and to the President of this House and ask them to exert pressure on the Council to review the visa tax conditions for our eastern neighbours.
Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to a document that this House is about to work on: the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity.
It concerns me that the proposal from the Commission does not contain articles that would allow Member States to limit the import of electricity from third countries if environmental regulations there are weaker than the ones applied here in the European Union.
The European Union should not make any concessions to energy suppliers that produce electricity at a low price but with a disastrous impact on the environment.
This would be spineless disloyalty to our values, as well as unfair to European energy suppliers that comply with the necessary standards.
(PL) Mr President, referring back to two speeches by my fellow Members, I would like to comment on the elections in Russia.
It reminded me of the old joke about how every American has a choice of car as long as it is a black Ford.
I have the impression, though, that many European politicians gave a sigh of relief that there was some continuity, and that there was still someone in Russia they could talk to.
Of course, I understand the economic interests of individual EU Member States, especially the large ones, and of individual lobby groups and individual industries, but our silent consent to the failure to observe human rights in Russia, our European Union blindness and deafness, can only encourage the Russian authorities to keep on arresting more and more Kasparovs.
The quieter we are in the EU about what is going on in Russia, the less we say about it, the greater the policy of repression in that country - it is that simple; I therefore propose that we speak out about what is happening in Russia, and bad things are happening.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the situation of the Bulgarian art historian Martina Baleva and her German colleague from the Free University of Berlin, Ulf Brunnbauer.
Both have been subjected to death threats and hate campaigns in connection with, and as a result of, scientific work on a painting, specifically by the television station Skat TV and the radical Ataka Party.
More recently, at the end of Ataka's European election campaign, a billboard displayed a banner stating: 'Baleva on the scaffold - the German Jew tied to the stake!'
The complaint has not been processed by the Bulgarian public prosecutor's office since June owing to public incitement to murder.
For safety reasons Mrs Baleva is now staying in Germany; the TV station has offered a reward for information on her whereabouts.
The Bulgarian Government is not reacting and this is unworthy of a Member State and unacceptable!
(EL) Mr President, the EU-Africa Summit has taken place in Lisbon.
In the joint statement which was agreed, great emphasis was placed on cooperation agreements between the Union and the countries of Africa.
According to the Commissioners concerned, Mr Mandelson and Mr Michel, these agreements will give impetus to Africa's development.
Leaving aside the fact that for years we have been ignoring political assistance in favour of economic assistance, it is worth considering what more we can offer the countries of Africa, when we know, for example, that over the past 15 years, EU exports to the continent of Africa have increased by 84%, which has forced poor countries to use 57% of their GDP to import food which they could have produced locally.
The only ones to profit from all this cooperation are the big European companies.
Let us not delude ourselves, and let us be honest: we are giving money which we are taking right back.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Four MEPs of Hungarian nationality were given a mandate in the Romanian elections to the European Parliament: Magor Csibi, Csaba SÃ³gor, LÃ¡szlÃ³ TÅkÃ©s and Iuliu Winkler.
This is an outstanding result and a wonderful chance for the Hungarian community to fight for the same autonomy proven in practice throughout Europe, mother-tongue education and an independent Hungarian-language university.
I would especially like to mention Bishop LÃ¡szlÃ³ TÅkÃ©s, since all of us have been enriched by an honest, genuine Member who is committed to democracy and human rights.
He was elected as an independent, individual candidate, without any kind of party list, for which there are few precedents.
The fact that his campaign was honest and based on values relating to fundamental human rights played a great role in his electoral success.
Bishop TÅkÃ©s has become a sort of legend in Hungarian politics through his activities up to now, his role in the Romanian transition to democracy, and his persistent fight for the largest national minority native to Europe, the Hungarian community living in Romania.
On behalf of the delegation from the Hungarian People's Party, I feel a duty to welcome our compatriots as elected representatives of the Hungarian community living on the territory of Romania.
Thank you.
(EL) Mr President, today I would like to put the question of Olympic Airlines to the Plenary.
I believe that the Greek government has abandoned all attempts to negotiate on the future of Olympic Airlines, making the European Court's impending decision a foregone conclusion.
There is no justification for this unacceptable stance when it is known that as part of its regional policy the European Union has already recognised the need to strengthen the airline with modern equipment, to ensure daily connections with the isolated island parts of the country.
It is clear that the Greek Government, on the basis of a pre-judged decision, has thrown away every right and every opportunity to negotiate to save jobs, thereby creating an enormous social problem.
At the same time, all the requirements which would prevent the dispersal of Olympic Airlines' intangible assets, which are of considerable economic value, are being quietly dropped.
In this way, the Greek Government and the European Commission, in the name of competition, are making Greece a second-class destination.
This will be opposed by all the forces committed to the country's future as a serious tourist destination.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Yet again we have cause for concern about ethnic diversity in the Vojvodina region of Northern Serbia, since in many decisions the European Parliament has declared this to be a value to be protected.
In the sense of the Readmission Agreement that was otherwise unfairly forced on Serbia by the European Union, some estimates indicate that many tens of thousands of people who are staying illegally in the integrated Member States will have to be sent back to Serbia.
Since the Serbian Government has no strategy for socially and geographically reintegrating this mass, the Serbian Constitution in vain prohibits on paper any changes to the proportions of ethnic groups through settlement if those who are readmitted do not go back to the settlements from which they originally came but to Vojvodina, which is a more developed region.
It is no accident that even empty flats here are put on the police list.
In addition to this, the locals are rightly fearful of a wave of refugees from Kosovo.
The tensions are increased by the military censuses of the recent past, for which the Hungarians of Vojvodina qualify as loyal Serbian citizens but which are regarded as unjustified by a country that is a partner for peace in NATO and that is striving for a peaceful settlement in Kosovo.
Thank you, Mr President.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen.
Europe must not sacrifice security to liberalisation of the energy market.
At least not as long as third countries use energy as a foreign policy tool.
By buying up gas pipes in Moldova, Gazprom took advantage of the frozen conflict in Transnistria and cut off gas supplies and export channels.
In view of Moldova's vulnerability, I have no doubt that establishing further partnerships between different market regions, Member States and third countries which meet our criteria will enhance our energy security.
Smaller Member States have to do even more to ensure their security.
Estonia's economy and military might have succumbed time and again to those of our neighbour, and are many times smaller than those of the conqueror Russia.
Both energy production and distribution are of strategic importance to Estonia.
I believe that, in view of that situation, certain enterprises should not be unbundled and should remain in State ownership.
Please believe us when we say that this is very important for us.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to mention a brutal attack on an ethnic Greek journalist, which took place on 5 December in Istanbul.
The journalist in question is Andreas Robopoulos, correspondent of the Greek television channel MEGA and editor of the Greek-language newspaper ECHO.
He was clubbed on the back by purportedly unknown assailants, who may be known to the authorities, and as a result he suffered multiple fractures to his arms and head injuries requiring stitches.
This incident happened outside the ECHO offices in the Pera district.
The perpetrators left their victim lying on the ground, covered in blood.
This comes on the heels of many other incidents, such as the murder of the ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink on 19 January in Istanbul, and the events of 13 December, when bulldozers from the Turkish forestry department destroyed the Monastery of the Transfiguration on the island of Heybeliada (Halki).
I call on the European Parliament, which is the highest political expression of democracy in the European Union, to conduct a thorough investigation and respond vigorously, with a condemnation of such crimes on the part of a country which, while aspiring to join the European Union, attacks its own citizens.
Mr President, it is Human Rights Day today, and the world is plagued by a plethora of examples of human rights violations.
Amongst these examples is that of my tiny home country, Cyprus.
For 33 years, Turkish forces have occupied part of the island and kept 200 000 refugees away from their homes.
For 33 years, the Turkish army has held the uninhabited town of Famagusta and uses it to blackmail the Greek Cypriot community.
For 33 years, Turkish soldiers have imposed a Berlin-like division of the capital, Nicosia.
And all this because the Turkish military seem to dictate Turkish policy on Cyprus.
Let us hope that Mr ErdoÄan's new government, realising how unjustifiable it is to have an EU Member State occupied by its forces, will order his Turkish Chief of Staff, Mr BÃŒyÃŒkanÄ±t, to withdraw his forces from the island as soon as possible.
(PL) Mr President, it is difficult to describe the parliamentary elections in Russia that have just ended as anything other than a bad joke at the expense of democracy.
The results from the area of Chechnya, where there was 99% turnout and support for United Russia, are particularly disturbing.
The example of the Chechens is symptomatic.
People living in that country have no reason to vote for Putin's team.
The immensity of the suffering they have experienced from that team has been mentioned on numerous occasions.
Virtually 100% turnout and support for a governing group does not happen in any democratic country.
On the other hand it does vividly remind us of elections in totalitarian states.
There are further similarities.
The elections revealed that there is no longer any place for an opposition in Russia.
Freedom of speech is restricted and the media are controlled by the state.
The category of political prisoners is making a return.
This category is made up of those who have the courage to speak out openly against the regime, and democracy is becoming a facade behind which that pure-as-the-driven-snow democrat Putin can do exactly as he likes.
Mr President, in the run-up to Christmas, we would normally be in good humour.
But I have to say that, in Ireland at the moment, the country is quite shocked by young people who are dying from taking cocaine.
Just today a young girl is being buried, and it is the talk of the country because she was high-profile.
But I think it raises a very serious issue, not just for Ireland but for many Member States and their young people, and how drug-taking is now part of recreation.
The European Union, and Member States individually, need to tackle this head-on in two directions.
Obviously, we need to cut off the supply, but that may be extremely difficult.
It has got to be done by better policing and better work between Member States.
But we need to cut off demand and we need young people - indeed, all of us - to realise the dangers of drugs.
And those who promote legalising them should take note.
Finally, I would just urge those who are currently dabbling to please stop, and I would express my sympathies to the families in Ireland who have lost loved ones.
(RO) Mr. President, climate changes represent one of the most complex problems of the international community.
These days, the Bali Conference gathers delegations from 190 countries, hundreds of experts and non-governmental organizations and over 1,400 journalists.
The common objective is to establish a roadmap in order to reduce climate changes after 2012 as well.
We can respond to challenges related to climate changes by developing scientific research, adapting to climate changes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing and implementing a global energy strategy.
In the context of the Bali Conference, the European Union should undertake the role of leader in fighting climate changes.
The actions the Union has already taken in certain fields, such as aviation, promoting less-polluting vehicles, fuel quality and air quality will have effects both in fighting climate changes, and in stimulating economic development.
(SK) Mr President, during the totalitarian regimes the people of Eastern Europe often feared customs controls and membership of the EU is for many closely associated with the end of these controls.
Euro-regions, which through their activities supported cooperation in border areas, significantly facilitated the removal of barrier at border areas.
These cross-border associations encouraged us, the Members of Parliament, to put pressure on the parties concerned to stick to the original deadline for the expansion of the Schengen area.
I am happy that their expectations in that regard were fulfilled and that at midnight on 20 December the last remnants of the Iron Curtain will fall and the borderless Euro-regions will become a reality.
With the Slovak Republic's accession to the Schengen area and the opening of the borders with the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria, a new area for close cooperation will be created.
I hope that all the associations, villages and towns in the border areas will respond to the invitation of the Tatry region and on 21 December will celebrate at border crossings the greatest success of European integration, namely the elimination of the borders that used to divide them.
Mr President, I just want to rise ahead of Christmas to say 'thank you', for once, to the European Commission for having announced the aid of over EUR 170 million out of the European Solidarity Fund to help towards the clean-up operations after the floods in my country, and especially in my region, this summer.
I understand that, if it is confirmed, this will be the second-highest amount ever paid out of the European Solidarity Fund.
As MEP for one of the regions most affected, I can say that every contribution is welcome.
This gesture of solidarity from the rest of Europe will be most welcome in my constituency.
Normally the President does not comment on what speakers have said, but on my list it says 'EUR 170' and not 'EUR 170 million', so I am happy that the United Kingdom has nothing to criticise in this case!
(Laughter)
(SL) I would like to inform you of certain events on the Croatian-Slovenian border.
The Croatian side is once again engaging in the practice of faits accomplis as a way of settling unresolved border issues with Slovenia.
The Croats first started selling land in the disputed territory on the left bank of the Dragonja River and then built a bridge at Hotiza.
Recently they have very slowly moved the border in the SneÅŸniÅ¡ki Woods and their foresters have started felling trees.
In RazkriÅŸje they have quietly marked out a new border control building without the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs giving the Slovenian side advance notice of its intentions, even though it is required to do so under the agreements that it has entered into.
Nor has notice been given to the Slovenian owners of the plots of land on which it is intended to erect the crossing.
In spite of Slovenia's support in principle for Croatia's entry into the EU, Croatia should comply with the agreements that it has entered into with other countries if it wishes to justify its status as a credible candidate for EU membership.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, on this day in 1948 the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so today we can celebrate Human Rights Day.
I would like to ask, with all due respect, do we really have cause for celebration?
There is no doubt that the values formulated in the document still form the basis for the Union and for our Europeanness today.
But just because we are celebrating, we cannot ignore the phenomenon in many Member States of the Union, from Hungary to Greece and from Slovakia to the Netherlands - I could list the examples - where there are still in existence and on the increase political groups which hide in uniforms and which cast doubt on precisely these values, marching with the symbols of fallen dictatorships.
I entreat all responsible European politicians: let's make the celebration nicer; let's act together against extremist groups!
Hopefully my group will manage to propose a Parliamentary Decision to protest against manifestations of extremism.
There cannot be a better time for collaboration than on the international Human Rights Day.
Thank you very much.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to remind you that 5 December was the anniversary of the birth of a great Pole and European - Polish Head of State Marshal JÃ³zef PiÅsudski.
This charismatic figure was not only an excellent and heroic commanding officer, but also, above all, an authentic statesman who made a major contribution to the rebirth of the Polish state.
Under his leadership in 1920 the Polish army halted the march of the Bolsheviks, who were intent on subduing the whole of Europe.
He spoke out in favour of living in peace and harmony with neighbours, with respect for full sovereignty.
He also said that Poland was faced with a big question: should it stand on equal terms with other great world powers, or should it be a minor state that needed the protection of the powerful?
Poland has not yet come up with an answer to this question; it has still to sit that examination of its strengths.
A major effort lies ahead of us in that regard, and we, the current generation, will have to gird ourselves up for it.
These words remain relevant today, with Poland being one of the 27 Member States of the European Union.
(SK) Mr President, on 19 November 2007 the A6 motorway connecting Bratislava and Vienna was inaugurated.
I regard it as a historic event, which will significantly simplify the motorway links between the Slovak Republic and Austria.
After three years of intensive works on the A6, and once the Slovak Republic has joined the Schengen area, the contacts between the two countries will no doubt become even more productive.
I would like to thank Austria for having successfully completed the project, in collaboration with the Slovak Republic.
The opening of the A6 heralds the first time that the Slovak Republic has been connected to the trans-European transport corridors.
This will bring relief to the other transport routes that are already heavily used.
(DE) Mr President, last Friday more than 70 000 signatures in favour of tighter legislation on the transport of livestock were handed over to the President of the Austrian Parliament, Barbara Prammer.
A citizens' initiative was created by a small group of people, coordinated by one of my fellow countrymen, Helmut Schaupensteiner, and backed by a highly committed journalist, Maggie Entenfeller.
They managed to find these 70 000 signatures in the shortest possible time.
This initiative has my full backing and 70 000 signatures show that the population is no longer willing either to allow these tragic circumstances to pass without comment.
As a Member of the European Parliament I therefore regard it as my duty to inform you, ladies and gentlemen, about this splendid application of the initiative against the transport of livestock and to ask us all to finally do something here so that these things that are currently taking place on European roads will no longer be able to take place in future.
(SK) Mr President, on 4 December 2007 the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic deemed that the legislation on termination of pregnancy, which permits induced abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy without justification, and I repeat without any justification, does not infringe the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
The Constitution of the Slovak Republic nevertheless speaks about the safeguarding of human life even before birth.
I am sorry to say that this day will be written in the history of the Slovak Republic with the blood of the children who will not get the chance to be born and live.
I regret that the majority of the judges were unable to summon up enough courage to confirm the supremacy of the higher principle of safeguarding human life.
Condoning abortions of unborn children on the grounds of so-called human rights, or rather women's rights, which do not have anything in common with human nature and dignity, is regrettable and is to be condemned.
(EL) Mr President, we heard earlier about the concerns of the Greek people over the question of Olympic Airlines.
We must ensure that Olympic stays airborne.
However, there is another problem which concerns the Greek people, and it was discussed in the Greek Parliament on the initiative of the Vice-President (First Speaker), Mr Sourlas: the serious risk posed to young people by the use of technologies and computers.
Dependence on this new phenomenon causes illnesses in young people which make them unfit to participate in society, destroying their prospects for education or work.
At the same time, no safeguards are provided.
Our question, then, is: Why does free competition on the open market allow the production and import of video games from third countries, and the dissemination of such games, and the uncontrolled, 24-hour operation of Internet cafes?
How can this market be controlled?
What is the European subsidy for providing a safe internet for young people?
What measures are being taken to treat the illnesses which young people suffer because of their addiction to computers and the Internet?
And how are the competent law-enforcement authorities controlling electronic crime at European level?
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, On the eve of the launch of the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and the signing of the Chater of Fundamental Rights, I would like to draw your attention to Bulgaria and to the fact that, unfortunately, the Bulgarian Government, its administration and the reprsentatives of the ruling coalition in Parliament are still far away from the application of some of the underlying fundamental principles.
These are the principles of open governance, transparency and, above all, accountability in the decision-making process.
For the last few days, the Bulgagrian citizens have witnessed yet another attempt of the Government to apply obscure criteria so that to covertly re-dtsirbute the state budget surplus and enable the so-called "black coffersâ of the ruling parties to absorb funds in an unregulated manner.
This is one more example of the prevailing political practice over the recent years to come to and stay in power thanks to vote shopping rather than as a result of work well done.
Being a Member of the European Parliament and a representative of the biggest opposition party in Bulgaria and a right-wing political force sharing the values of the European People's Party, I believe that the existing status quo of the political model in Bulgaria alienates citizens from the decision-making process and increases their perceptions of corruption.
In the public awareness campaign related to the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we are prepared to promote the principles of the efficient and transparent governance and to persuade the citizens in the values enshrined in these two documents.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
This year, all 27 Member States of the Union have held a series of celebrations to commemorate the birth of the European Union and its 50th anniversary or birthday.
Most recently, at the beginning of December, I took part in such an event at MosonmagyarÃ³vÃ¡r.
MosonmagyarÃ³vÃ¡r is a town on the border of Slovakia, Austria and Hungary, so it is no surprise that there were very many mayors from all three countries.
The participating mayors cited an initiative that has been formulated for the European Parliament or for its President.
The essence of the initiative is that, following in the footsteps of the Ancient Greek traditions, the European Parliament should instigate a worldwide ceasefire for the first time in 2008 during the Olympic Games in Beijing.
Mr President, the motto for this invitation is '17 Days of Peace'.
The mayors started collecting signatures on 1 December and they would like to give the petition to you, Mr President, here in Strasbourg in the spring.
They asked me to extend this invitation to you, which I have now done.
Thank you.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, I have been approached by reprsentatives of the Bulgarian Confederation for Health Protection established by twelve patient organisations to defend the interests of one million Bulgarians with chronical diseases.
The pharmaceutical policy has been a source of serious concern in Bulgaria for the last few years.
Although the resources allocated for health care increase, less and less medicines can be purchased with them from year to year.
Unfortunately, their price includes also 20-percent VAT.
Bulgarian patients are worried that their reprsentatives are not allowed to participate in the monitoring and supervision of health care spending.
They insist on involvement in these processes so that to guarantee transparency.
Having tried to appeal to the Bulgarian Government for years on end, now they have decided to approach the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Over a million Bulgarians suffer from chronical diseases and they do not receive sufficient health protection.
Furthermore, the problems of the pharmaceutical policy affect the interests of more than 80 European pharmaceutical manufacturers who also seek greater transparency.
Therefore I appeal from this rostrum to the Bulgarian authorities and to the EU institutions to support the request of patient organisations for more transparency.
(SK) Mr President, I would like to address the issue of minority radio broadcasting in the Slovak Republic, which is about to cease its activities.
The statutory radio of the Slovak Republic is bound by law to broadcast in national minority languages.
Last week, however, the management of the radio decided to stop broadcasting RÃ¡dio PÃ¡tria in minority languages on medium wave due to a lack of funds.
This would mean an end to broadcasting in Hungarian, Ruthenian and Ukrainian.
If the Slovak Parliament, in approving the budget for the coming year, has not allocate funds for medium wave broadcasting, broadcasting in minority languages will end on 1 January.
In Slovakia this broadcasting has an 80-year-old tradition.
It has also been decided that the broadcasting will continue via the Internet, although it has been estimated that only 1% of listeners own a computer and use it to listen to the radio.
There are, however, alternative solutions...
Mr President, this weekend the European Council will also discuss energy problems, which have become the issue of common security.
Against this background, let me address three wishes to the European Council.
First, I would like the Council to support the Commission's proposals on ownership unbundling and restricting the majority hold of third countries' capital on the electricity and gas markets.
This is a key issue in securing fair competition and avoiding opaque deals between state monopolies.
Second, I would like Member States to be able to restrict their electricity imports from third countries in cases where this could substantially endanger long-term supply security.
Third, may I remind the Council of the European Parliament resolution on energy security from September, which proposes the post of an external official for energy security?
(PL) Mr President, today, at the beginning of the third millennium, the world is faced with problems from the past that are still unresolved, and these are accompanied by new challenges.
We can be proud that the European Union is a creator of change and that our greatest values are human rights, freedom, democracy, tolerance, a free market, an improved standard of living and care for the natural environment.
If we are to act effectively to put these ideas and aims into effect, our Union must be businesslike and efficient.
We are coming to the end of one particular phase of work: we are accepting the Reform Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon.
This is very fine, but life has sketched new challenges for us.
In implementing all the provisions of the Treaty, in upgrading the functioning of the EU and its institutions, we must talk about - and we want to talk about - the future, a better future for Europe, for our Member States...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I would like to continue my Strasbourg tradition of naming and shaming Member States who fail to comply with the Lisbon directives.
In 2005, all 27 Member States agreed to abide by the framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-using products.
By August 2007 only six Member States had declared that they had fully transposed this directive into domestic law.
The Commission began infringement proceedings against 21 Member States and, to date, 15 Member States have still failed to comply with this law.
So the list of shame includes: Germany, Italy, Luxembourg (once again), Portugal, Malta, Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Finland, Denmark, Estonia and Greece.
In this week when the Bali conference is occurring, it is a scandal that Member States are failing to conform with measures that they have already agreed with and which could already have had a significant impact on tackling the issue of climate change.
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, today is a turning point in the Western Balkans and also in the life of the whole European Union.
Today the UN deadline passes for the Serbs and Albanians to reach agreement.
We should have known in advance that the endeavours of the troika to achieve this were doomed to failure.
In all probability, Kosovo will declare its independence within two months, and it is still difficult to assess the consequences of this beyond the Western Balkan region.
Kosovo will be a protectorate of the Union.
The Kosovo settlement will be the definitive test of common foreign and security policy.
Will we be able to reach a unified position, or will we be the victims of bickering between America and Russia?
If the Union is not unified, this will pose a serious danger for the alignment and European integration of the region, so it is very important that there is a good, fair settlement in Kosovo.
This is the Union's responsibility.
(FR) Mr President, on 6 December the Strasbourg industrial tribunal issued its decision in the case of the European Parliament versus some of its employees.
I quote: 'Notes that the assignment contract between Manpower and the European Parliament is invalid; notes that the project contract between Manpower with the employees is invalid; states and rules that the contractual relationship between the applicant employee and the European Parliament should be put on a permanent contract footing'.
I applaud here the courage of the temporary officials, who ignored bullying and other provocation in order to have their rights recognised.
I dare to hope, Mr President, that the administration will very quickly be instructed to bring a definitive end to this case, since all it will have done is discredit our institution in the eyes of the employment world.
Mr President, today I intend to address the issue of the right balance between the fight against corruption and democracy.
The international image of corruption in some countries, Romania included, is so powerful that it has apparently generated the belief that, in order to fight it, even bending democracy is permitted.
Consequently, Brussels continuously calls for and salutes vocally the strengthening of the instruments to fight corruption, but usually keeps silent when those very instruments are abused, being primarily designed for internal political consumption.
Therefore, if the fight against corruption remains a priority - and it should stay so - the praise one gets from the keepers of democracy should be equally accompanied by criticism of exaggerations and breaking of fundamental citizens' rights.
Otherwise, under the pretence of fighting corruption, democracy itself will be gradually undermined, and, frankly, I consider that equally, if not more, damaging.
(EL) Mr President, 1 December was World AIDS Day, a day of remembrance for all the victims of the disease which remains the scourge of our planet.
The figures from the World Health Organisation's latest research show that the percentage of carriers of the virus remains at the same level, whilst the number of new cases has fallen.
In spite of this, the numbers are still far too high.
In a question I put to the European Commission, I proposed that a set of postage stamps should be issued to raise public awareness of AIDS, and the idea was then encouraged by Markos Kyprianou, the Commissioner responsible for health matters.
Kostis Hatzidakis - our colleague until a few months ago, an MEP and now the Greek Minister for Transport and Communications - approved my proposal, and Greece printed and released a set of AIDS remembrance stamps; proceeds from sales of the stamps will be used to buy drugs for those suffering from the virus.
The Commission encouraged all 27 Member States to take up the idea.
Greece has made a start!
That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Protection and conservation of the marine environment: Marine Strategy Directive (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) [09388/2/2007 - C6-0261/2007 - (Rapporteur: Marie-NoÃ«lle Lienemann).
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive that Parliament should adopt at its second reading is extremely important because it is the first directive that forces Member States to have an environmental strategy to restore the seas and oceans to a good ecological status.
When we looked at it, at its first reading, we stressed its importance given that recent scientific reports show that the survival of fish stocks and the biodiversity of the seas and oceans are under particular threat.
Some people are even saying that in fifty years' time there will be no more fish.
Furthermore, the oceans play a fundamental role in regulating the climate and by polluting them we are in danger of diminishing this regulating function and accentuating the negative effects of climate change.
It was therefore urgent and necessary for the European Union, having adopted the water framework directive, particularly regarding freshwater, to swiftly address the issue of seawater.
At its first reading, we demonstrated our willingness to improve the existing text.
First I will go over the structural points of this directive and the existing texts.
The first aim is to restore our seas and oceans to a good ecological status.
The second is to define the necessary steps to be taken by each Member State: firstly, to collaborate within Marine Regions or Sub-Regions; then to define the state of the water and of biodiversity in these seas; then to define a good ecological status and some priority environmental objectives; and finally to draw up a plan of action and some measures to be taken.
We were therefore positive about this directive, but felt it did not go far enough in the state it came to us from the Commission.
There are a number of points we have stressed.
The first is the need to make this directive tough.
Tough, both as regards resources and as regards results.
That has certainly been the most positive point of our collaboration with the Council and Commission: the directive is tough.
The second point is that we hope that good ecological status will be defined stringently, so that restoring this asset is not just all talk.
We have largely been satisfied in that the criteria for good ecological status have been extended to include pressure from all pollutants affecting an ecosystem and the need to evaluate them and reduce their impact with this aim of restoring good ecological status.
The third point is that Parliament is very keen on setting up protected marine areas, the types of reserve that should play a key role in restoring the diversity of this biotope and particularly in reconstituting fish stocks.
We would have liked a text that was more restrictive, more stringent, tougher about the need for these reserves, but the principle is still there; at any rate, the need for them to be sufficiently large to play a role in restoring biodiversity is still there.
Finally, Parliament wanted the scope of the directive to be extended.
In particular we wanted coastal waters to be properly taken into account, and we did not want any uncertainty to remain about the need to take account of all tidal waters.
At any rate, for a lot of them this has been the case.
We would of course have liked a slightly better definition of the land covered by tidal waters, but the text we have is adequate.
I would like to stress the importance of the consistency of strategies by geographical area: we would have liked the text to be tougher, but the need for consistency is affirmed.
Finally, our fellow Members from the Baltic wanted the Baltic to be a sort of pilot project enabling us to move more quickly, in view of the urgency of the situation.
They were not completely satisfied because the tradition in our institutions is not to single out any particular area.
Nevertheless, the idea of a pilot area has been kept, and I am sure the Commission would choose the Baltic to be this area.
Lastly, there is the matter of timescale: the main thing for us was that the directive should be binding, even if it meant slightly lengthening the amount of time the Member States were given to achieve it.
This was the compromise that was settled on in the end.
The deadline is 2020, but the Member States must not drag their feet because they need to have the directive transposed by 2010.
Anyway I would invite them not to waste time because, under the water framework directive, the delay is mounting up and our seas cannot wait.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I take this point on behalf of my colleague Mr Stavros Dimas, whose presence in Bali at the Climate Change Conference has prevented him from being here this evening.
I would first like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Lienemann, for her excellent work on the Marine Strategy Directive, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its positive and constructive contribution.
This directive marks the beginning of a new approach for protecting our seas and our oceans.
The next challenge will, of course, be its successful implementation.
The efforts of Parliament to enhance the ambition of this legislative initiative have borne fruit, and they have made sure that the agreed directive will be an effective instrument for protecting our seas and our oceans in an integrated manner.
The Commission is pleased that it was possible to reach an agreement at second reading.
I would like, in particular, to highlight the constructive role of the European Parliament in this process.
By preserving at all times its high political and environmental objectives, Parliament has played a helpful and constructive role to work towards this agreement.
The objective of the proposed directive is that Member States take the necessary measures to achieve good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020 at the latest. This will be done through the establishment and implementation of marine strategies in their marine waters.
Therefore, the directive contains a very demanding objective.
The Commission remains vigilant to ensure that all necessary measures are adopted to guarantee the effective protection of our marine environment.
On some important points, Parliament has succeeded in going beyond the original Commission proposal.
I would like in particular to underline three issues that have been central to the negotiations: ensuring an ambitious objective for the directive; defining in a more precise way what is meant by good environmental status, including a set of specific descriptors, and requiring the establishment of marine protected areas in the context of this directive.
Parliament has insisted, throughout the negotiating process, on the need to ensure that the directive has a strong ambition on all the essential points.
This directive sets out a new framework for working, for the first time, together in an integrated manner to protect our seas and oceans.
We will continue to build on this policy initiative in order to allow this Marine Strategy Directive to concretely deliver the environmental pillar of the marine policy of the European Union.
Therefore, the Commission can accept a compromise package in order to reach an agreement on this directive at second reading.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, as rapporteur for my group, it is with pleasure that I can say that the directive on which we have reached a compromise is one of those pieces of EU environmental legislation whose fruits our future generations will come to enjoy in a very real way.
It is time at last to focus attention on our marine environment, whose deteriorating state has been sad to witness, the Baltic Sea being the most shocking example.
This directive brings new hope to this situation, with its aim of halting the pollution of the seas and reviving their biodiversity.
The work over these two years has not always been easy.
Although the aim was the same for everyone, the means the political groups employed often differed.
One example of how our opinions differed related to the future prospects for a technique for carbon capture and storage.
Mrs Lienemann's opinion would in practice have prevented the development of such a technique.
We, on the other hand, thought that in the light of climate change it was necessary and that the Marine Strategy Directive should not therefore be laden with details which would render it impossible.
I believe that the compromise we have now reached is satisfactory to all parties.
It is ambitious in its targets, leaving the means of accomplishing them to the Member States, though obliging them to cooperate in each Marine Region for the best result.
The compromise text clearly describes what sort of good maritime environmental status we are looking for and what the possible threats to it are.
At the same time it will no longer specify in detail the various steps taken as being threats, since the list cannot be exhaustive, and it would accord the steps taken in the marine environment unequal status.
The wording now selected places an obligation on the parties but does not accuse, and prompts without unjustified coercive action.
The objectives are nevertheless clear, scientifically justifiable, and binding and so will also be effective.
I would like to thank my colleague, Mrs Lienemann, for her successful work.
She has been a good leader in the negotiations and has also listened to the other groups.
I am especially grateful that we managed to raise the profile of the serious situation in the Baltic Sea.
I am sure that the Marine Strategy Directive will be an excellent environmental pillar of a common EU maritime policy.
It brilliantly supports the aim of a common maritime policy to boost growth, employment and sustainable development, at the same time building on a firm knowledge base of maritime research.
This is the kind of legislation our Community needs.
Congratulations to the rapporteur on carrying out some important work.
I would like to state that I agree that a more strongly opinionated report would have been even more effective.
However, the strong opinions can wait until later; meanwhile, we can enjoy the compromise that had been achieved.
For some time now the protection of the seas and oceans has not been given due attention.
Marine resources have been used relentlessly, the ecosystem is being exhausted, and we have been treating the marine environment as if we are sawing off the branch we are sitting on.
That is why the establishment of marine protected areas is of great importance in terms of preserving living waters for future generations.
As is commonly known, the European Union's marine territory is larger than its land territory.
The wellbeing of all the EU regions and millions of EU citizens depends on the good environmental status and productivity of the surrounding seas and oceans.
Therefore, it is essential that in future the European Union considers environmental protection as a whole, knowing that it cannot be 'patched up' by making separate insignificant decisions.
When we reduce soil pollution, marine pollution is reduced as well.
We need to allocate more funds for the construction of drainage, and it is no less important to develop this outside the EU as well.
I welcome the fact that the European Union is taking on the role of global leader once again and is committed to achieving good marine environmental status in 13 years time.
The issue of the Baltic Sea has already been mentioned.
This sea is especially sensitive - its water changes only every 25-30 years, so the effect of pollution is stronger than average.
We are still feeling the consequences of decades of irresponsible application of chemicals.
Before starting oil extraction and making plans for the construction of pipelines in the Baltic Sea, we should consider the environmental issues.
We should make sure that the wellbeing of our children and grandchildren is not adversely affected by our decisions.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her efforts and the way she conducted the negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
I shall focus on some of the main positive issues.
The directive as a whole will place sufficient emphasis on the necessary measures for compliance and for achieving good environmental status, any deterioration in which will be avoided.
Although the European Parliament had originally called for 2017, the schedule for compliance by the Member States is now set to run until 2020, a realistic date which is proposed by the Council in coordination with the national representatives.
The Member States will provide an initial assessment up to 2012, defining good environmental status and declaring coherent environmental goals.
The European Parliament was able to obtain clear commitments from the Council for integrated policies and approaches which will encourage the Member States to cooperate in achieving EU-wide good environmental status.
This directive also takes account of the Common Fisheries Policy, providing for viable exploitation of fishery resources while at the same time respecting the integrity of ecosystems, so that they can be preserved or restored and, where necessary, egg-laying, shelter and feeding sites can be protected.
Lastly, as regards funding resources, implementation will apply to the existing funds within the scope of the financial resources and in line with economic prospects for 2007-2013, and will be renegotiated for the next period, given that the overall duration of the directive is until 2020.
(EL) Mr President, I shall likewise begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, on the excellent work she has done.
The directive aims to protect - as indeed it should - the marine environment.
However, as rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, there are a few things I would like to comment on.
The Committee on the Environment must put more emphasis on fishing and the problems facing it as a result of marine pollution.
Sailors and fishermen know the seas better than anyone.
They live on them and from them.
Their participation is needed in combating this problem.
I also wish to express my satisfaction at the enlargement of the protected marine areas.
To sum up, I shall say that success in safeguarding the marine strategy depends on four main factors: firstly, committing the parties to comply with the schedule laid down in the directive.
We cannot and must not allow postponements in our programme.
The targets must all be achieved by 2020.
If we do not achieve them then, it will be too late to remedy things.
Secondly, cooperation with third countries: the seas have no borders.
We should get round the table together and discuss things with all our neighbours.
Let us not forget that there are 27 countries around the Mediterranean, and only seven of them are Member States.
We should therefore all sit down together and see what we can do.
Thirdly, there should be adequate funds allocated for this purpose.
Fourthly, we should get fishermen to participate in this effort.
This is our only hope of success.
To conclude and round off these comments, I shall repeat that the Directive on Marine Strategy, if correctly applied, will contribute to viable, sustainable fisheries and a healthy sea, so that we have clean seas whose beauty we can all enjoy.
(SV) Mr President, let me begin by thanking Marie-NoÃ«lle Lienemann for her good work on the Framework Directive.
As a Swede living in Stockholm by the Baltic, one of the world's most polluted seas, I really welcome this Directive.
Forty per cent of Sweden's population live less than five kilometres from the coast, and tourism provides 71 000 jobs in our country, including our islands.
Fishing accounts for an additional 4 000 jobs.
Thanks to our fishing industry we can enjoy fish, which is so important to us Swedes.
A damaged marine environment leads to impaired quality of life for many and is an unwelcome development.
There is a risk that commercial and leisure fishing in boats, sea-bathing and marine recreation may disappear unless we in the EU do something together, here and now.
A common marine environmental policy will serve to strengthen and protect the marine ecosystem and to set up databases for monitoring and knowledge acquisition.
We in the European Parliament have higher ambitions than the Commission and I am glad that we have set the deadline for achieving a good environmental status at 2017 and not 2021.
I am also glad that the Member States are to present programmes of measures for the marine environment by 2015.
I should like to thank Commissioner Frattini for coming on board.
As a citizen with an environmental commitment, I would like to make faster progress, but if all 27 Member States put on some speed we can do something and make a start now.
This is a prime example of an area in which cross-border cooperation is necessary.
I hope that the Baltic can become a pilot area, since eight out of nine countries around the Baltic Sea are EU Member States.
It is our problem and our responsibility.
It is also important that we who are committed to environmental foreign policy cooperate with Russia on the Baltic Sea and the marine environment.
We have before us decisions in the field of both environmental and energy policy.
Let us make the marine environment the main focus of attention now!
(EL) Mr President, development under the Lisbon Strategy, guided by the principle of support for competitiveness, i.e. increasing the profitability of the monopoly business groups in the European Union, not only intensifies to the utmost the exploitation of the working class and of workers generally, but also severely aggravates environmental problems, by systematically destroying marine ecosystems and the biodiversity of the seas, and causing a steady deterioration in the quality of sea water.
In addition to the damage caused to sea water by pollution from ships, industrial pollution bears a huge share of the responsibility for the contamination of sea water.
It causes an incalculable level of contamination in the water table, and this is subsequently transferred to sea water.
Pollution from the ever increasing number of fish-farming units also places severe strain on the marine environment and the functioning of ecosystems.
The problems of the marine environment are seriously aggravated by the invasion of monopolies into a number of operations which were previously in public ownership, as a result of the privatisation of utilities and public infrastructures, and also by the commercialisation of public assets such as sea water.
Huge tourist complexes owned by monopoly groups are leading to a high-income model of tourist development, while public assets such as coastlines, beaches and sea water are being despoiled.
The pollution of sea water is no longer solely due to the discharge of waste and sewage from those tourist complexes into the sea, but also to the construction of industrial units to serve their business activities, including the installation of desalination units to irrigate golf courses and generally to serve their needs.
The consequences are dire for the residents of entire areas.
I would like to end, Mr President, by pointing out that the common position of the Council and the Commission report does not actually provide the solution which is needed, if we are to solve or at least mitigate serious problems relating to the environment.
(ET) The seas are the least studied and least well-known part of the biosphere.
More importantly, the exploitation of the seas should be based on the known precautionary principles of environmental protection.
Fortunately the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann shares that approach, and for that I thank her.
Hopefully at the second reading we will come to an agreement with the Council and a rapid start can be made to implementation of the marine strategy.
I also wish separately to emphasise my own support for Amendment 29 to the report, which seeks to establish the Baltic Sea Marine Region as a pilot area for implementing the European Union Marine Strategy.
Of all the seas surrounding Europe, the Baltic is undoubtedly the most vulnerable thanks to its shallow waters and the fact that there is little water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean.
As a result there is, for example, no construction of gas pipelines as there is in the North Sea or the Mediterranean.
If the Baltic Sea Marine Region were already a pilot area for implementing the European Union Marine Strategy, then it would probably not be part of the NordStream project.
Fortunately the European Union does not have to create the Baltic Sea programme of measures from scratch.
The Helsinki Convention, which established protection for the Baltic Sea, did the necessary groundwork to that end in the context of the Baltic Sea Action Plan.
As a result it is possible to use the Baltic Sea successfully as a pilot area for the marine strategy.
Another positive aspect is that, through HELCOM, Russia is also able to participate in the implementation of the Baltic Sea programme of measures; without Russia's involvement it is difficult to protect the Baltic and ensure good environmental status.
(RO) Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate Madam Rapporteur.
A fundamental element of the European maritime strategy is the recognition of the negative effects of human activity on the ecosystem and the increase of efforts to fight such effects.
Human and tourism development along the coasts has a major impact on the sea environment following the intensification of fishing activities, maritime transportation and recreational tourism.
Climate changes, waste, fishing activities, acoustic, biological and chemical factors threaten maritime waters and this directive represents an important step toward improving the integrity of ecosystems and preserving biodiversity.
The oil and sulphur pollution in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which has occurred recently because of a storm and has caused the sinking of several commercial ships, will affect us for at least 10 years from now.
The disaster occurred due to a system deficiency, since the ships were designed for river and not maritime shipping, which points out the absence of any efforts to prevent and protect the maritime environment.
This serious accident complicates the process of ecological improvement of these waters, which are already classified among the most polluted maritime areas in the world.
The degradation of the Black Sea water affects both public health and marine biodiversity, and considerable efforts are necessary in order to recover the ecosystem's integrity.
Moreover, maritime transport of hazardous cargo must meet the requirements of international conventions and ensure minimum safety in order to prevent any future similar disastrous accidents, which cause significant damage both to the marine life and to human life.
Through this directive, we will make sure that the European Union maritime environment is better protected and human activities and transportation will not affect the quality of water and biodiversity.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on the basis of the agreed texts, Member States will now have to establish marine strategies for their marine waters.
Such strategies will begin with an assessment of the status of marine waters and their existing impacts and pressures and will develop targets to find good environmental status.
The Member States will establish monitoring programmes and will then elaborate, as from 2015, programmes and measures necessary to achieve the objectives.
This series of steps will be taken again every six years on a cyclical basis.
A number of key elements have been included in the overall compromise package that is now proposed.
Most importantly, the objective of the directive is now clear and ambitious, as Member States are required to take the necessary measures to achieve good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020 at the latest.
The legislators have agreed on a definition of good environmental status, including a series of associated descriptors, which will have to be met.
A revised timetable has now been agreed, which in fact is more demanding than what was included in the Commission's original proposal, but at the same time providing a sufficient time for taking appropriate action at each step.
Exceptions and derogations, including disproportionate costs, have been better qualified.
Member States will have to establish marine-protected areas to meet their objectives under this directive in accordance with the international commitments of the Community and the Member States.
Action will be required in the context of each marine region, and, therefore, to develop marine strategies will involve strong cooperation with and within regional sea conventions.
The implementation of this directive will, in fact, require this enhanced coordination.
In this context, I would like to recall the importance given by Parliament during all the negotiations to important regional processes.
I would particularly like to mention the Baltic Sea Action Plan, which was adopted in the context of the Helsinki Convention.
As highlighted by Parliament, this integrated action plan is a useful first example and a resource that will facilitate progress in the implementation of the directive.
Such an integrated approach must be an important component in all the actions that have been undertaken by the different regional sea conventions to protect the European seas - the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic, the Black Sea and the Baltic.
To conclude, the Commission is very pleased with the outcome of negotiations.
The Commission can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (DE) Under the terms of effective environmental protection, the world's oceans, particularly the marine waters around Europe, must be given greater consideration in the policies of the EU.
The present Marine Strategy Framework Directive is a reaction to the challenges arising from climate change and provides for measures by both the EU and the Member States.
In order to take the appropriate steps at European level, it is vital in the first instance that the environmental status in the marine environment is charted by uniform criteria.
Furthermore, the Directive forces the Member States to achieve good environmental status in the marine environment by 2017 and to create the regulations necessary for this.
I would ask the Member States, in the context of the report, to take the necessary steps to verify and trace marine pollution so that the 'polluter pays' principle can be applied.
The steps already taken by the EU with regard to the capture of CO2 in the seabed must be strengthened, since these are an innovative contribution to combating climate change.
Pilot projects already in existence, however, must be critically reviewed, mainly with regard to their efficiency and possible consequential damage.
In order to counter climate change effectively, we should not be shutting out innovations, but incorporating them into a broad EU environmental policy.
Air pollution: ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive) [09388/2/2007 - C6-0261/2007 - (Rapporteur: Marie-NoÃ«lle Lienemann).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise on the Air Quality Directive is primarily the result of successful team work.
I wish to emphasise this at the outset.
My thanks especially to all my fellow Members who have taken an active part in defining the text of this Directive, particularly to the rapporteurs, Mrs Weisgerber of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mrs Corbey of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as well as Mrs Hassi of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
I should also like to thank the Commission for its valuable assistance and the Portuguese Council Presidency, which has made a vital contribution to this good result as an open and constructive negotiating partner.
The compromise puts the EU's future air quality policy on a sound footing.
The new Directive maintains the balance between ambitious targets and limits and the necessary flexibility for implementation in the Member States.
In addition, the focus is directed more towards exposure and increased awareness of the need for measures at the sources of pollution.
Let me first outline the key elements of the compromise.
There has been decisive progress, which is the intention with the amendment of air quality legislation, in the regulation of the finest PM2.5 particulates.
In the opinion of all the experts, the finest particulates originating exclusively from human sources pose the greatest risks to human health.
Fine PM2.5 dust particulates less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter and therefore not visible to the naked eye can penetrate the lungs and lead to serious, long-term respiratory diseases.
Focussing on the smallest particles in European policy on air quality is therefore long overdue.
In the United States, there has been a strict PM2.5 limit since 1997.
The United States is a good 10 years ahead of the EU with regard to legislation in this sector.
However, with all due respect for US air quality policy, I should like to state that we cannot simply copy what the United States has been doing for years.
We have completely different conditions in Europe, particularly with regard to population and traffic density.
The demand by environmental groups for the immediate introduction of a strict PM2.5 limit is unrealistic.
Data in Europe is not strong and measurement experience is inadequate - not good conditions for a hasty introduction of a limit.
The Council and Parliament have been in agreement since the outset on regulating PM2.5 in two phases.
Firstly, there should be a target from 2010 onwards and then a limit from 2015 onwards of 25 micrograms per cubic meter.
Parliament has constantly been lobbying the Commission as well as campaigning against the Council's opposition for a stricter value for PM2.5.
It is therefore to Parliament's credit that today we want to reduce the limit for PM2.5 to 20 micrograms per cubic meter in a second stage in 2020.
In addition to a target and limit for PM2.5, an exposure concentration obligation of 20 micrograms will be introduced for the Member States in 2015.
This has the aim of reducing background concentration and will have a positive effect on the protection of human health particularly in urban conurbations.
The model proposed by the European Parliament for reducing concentrations of PM2.5 by 2020 has likewise been implemented.
There is a differentiation according to the Member States and greater account will be taken of inputs.
As regards PM10, a majority in Parliament lobbied at first reading for an ambitious annual limit, which is also better correlated to the daily limit in force.
The position of the Council and the Commission not to touch the current limits at all has won recognition in the negotiations.
With a three-year extension to the deadline for PM10, the deadline extension is guaranteed until 2012 after the new Directive comes into force for local authorities, which have not been able to keep to the limits owing to their geographical position or meteorological conditions, despite all demonstrable efforts.
Even though improving the quality of the ambient air will also be a major challenge for the EU in the future, I should like to raise three points that in my view should be noted when implementing this Directive and when revising the legislation in 2013.
Firstly, the pollution of ambient air has fallen drastically in recent decades.
As a new study by the European Environment Agency shows, around 50% of fine dust emissions were reduced in the period between 1990 and 2004 - therefore even before the introduction of the PM10 limits.
This has been achieved less through legislation than through technical progress.
Secondly, conditions in the European Union and between the Member States vary enormously.
I have already mentioned meteorological and geographical conditions.
However, it is principally the widely differing population, traffic and industry densities that have the greatest influence.
More consideration must be given to this when implementing future legislation.
Thirdly, in order to reduce air pollution even further, neither short-term actions such as road blocks and traffic bans, nor stricter, paper-based limits will lead to success.
Parliament greatly welcomes the Commission's statement, to be published together with the new Directive in the Official Journal in 2008, on the adoption of measures at source.
Air pollution can be reduced only in the long term and at EU level specifically by strengthening cross-border measures.
The policy on sources, which has been given little consideration to date, should be the main focus in future, particularly private combustion plants, the shipping industry and also agriculture.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, and the shadow rapporteurs for their effective cooperation.
Agreement with the Council at second reading is a success for the European Parliament.
This agreement is a major step towards better air quality in Europe.
However, we do need the assistance of all those involved.
The cities and towns have to draw up clean air plans and create environmental zones, for example, if they do not keep to the limits.
The Member States have to create the conditions for this - such as the enactment of the regulation on motor vehicle stickers in Germany, for example.
However, this is also called for in Europe.
Only about 20-30% of air-borne soot particles come from inner-city traffic.
It is only here, however, that the local authorities are able ultimately to have any influence.
Local authorities have no chance of keeping to the limits if measures are not taken at European level to reduce emissions from sources other than transport.
The measurement of emissions alone does not improve air quality.
We need measures that combat the discharge of fine dust directly at source.
This will provide genuine health protection.
The Commission has now also committed itself politically to taking these steps.
It wants to make legislative proposals, such as the Euro 6 standard for lorries (which ultimately also leads to the compulsory introduction of soot particle filters), emission standards for smaller industrial installations and new regulations for ship's engines.
The local authorities' measures must be flanked by these regulations in order to achieve a genuine improvement in air quality.
Firstly, there will be limits for the smallest dust particles.
These particles are more harmful to human health because they can be breathed in.
We therefore have to assess this.
Through ambitious, yet realistic values we are sending out another signal for health protection.
The legislator has demonstrated a sense of proportion here and at the same time ensured a high degree of health protection.
Since we as Parliament have been able to achieve a good result on the smallest dust particles, we have accepted the Council's position not to change anything in the existing PM10 limits, including in daily limits.
This also means, however, that there is no tightening of the annual PM10 limits.
The text of the Directive makes it explicitly clear that the local authorities are not obliged to take ineffective short-term measures such as road blocks, for example.
The focus should be on long-term, sustainable measures such as environmental zones.
Local authorities are already doing a great deal here and they should continue to do so.
Cities and towns, however, can in future apply for an extension to the deadline for meeting the existing PM10 limits under strict conditions.
This means, however - and I deliberately wish to emphasise this - no free ticket for local authorities.
They cannot exceed the limits indefinitely and they can obtain a deadline extension only under two strict conditions: that they are suffering from unfavourable climatic conditions or unfavourable field conditions such as hot spots, for example, and they have taken all appropriate and reasonable measures at local level.
This flexibility for local authorities contributes to the Directive's practicability, without disregarding the level of health protection.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have put forward a responsible package.
We have achieved progress on the health protection front.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, clean air is a basic necessity of life.
Air has become cleaner over the last 30 years, but is still far too polluted.
Compliance with the directives currently in force is inadequate.
The Directive on ambient air quality needs to be revised if we are to tackle pollution more effectively.
Last week, Parliament and the Council reached agreement on the new Directive.
I welcome the outcome and wish to thank Mr Krahmer, Mrs Weisgerber and the other shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation over the last two years.
I should like to highlight three points.
First of all, the stricter standards.
My group has been consistently committed to more ambitious standards for particulates and other pollutants harmful to humans and the environment, and so I am pleased that, thanks to us, there is to be a new standard for microparticulates.
Microparticulate pollution can neither be seen nor smelt, but is responsible for the most health damage, leading to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths among Europeans.
Large numbers of people suffer from asthma and other complaints.
The new standard will enable us to take a much more targeted approach to tackling this health damage.
This agreement is therefore good news for public health.
Parliament did not resign itself to the lukewarm ambition of the Commission and the Council; we called for greater commitment, and obtained it.
The PM2.5 standard was to be reduced from 25 to 20 micrograms.
According to scientists, this will increase average life expectancy by a further four to five months.
However, even the new standards are not enough.
Further improvements are still required, including more attention being given to children.
Ultimately, we must arrive at a standard of no more than 10 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metre of air.
This is the ceiling recommended by the World Health Organization, and guarantees genuinely clean air.
The present Directive is a step in the right direction.
The second point is that Europe must not only set sound standards, but also develop instruments to meet these objectives.
After all, Europe is often good at setting general policy objectives, but much less effective when it comes to creating the right instruments for actually meeting those objectives.
Without cleaner cars, ships, agriculture and industry the air-quality standards will remain a paper tiger.
We recently voted on Euro V and Euro VI: cleaner passenger cars from 2009 and even cleaner cars from 2014.
This kind of legislation must be introduced quickly for heavy goods vehicles and buses.
Parliament has urged the Council and the Commission to hasten to make complementary policy to tackle the sources of pollution.
This has resulted in a Commission statement listing all the measures to be taken in coming years.
The statement will be annexed to the Directive, and will make reference to the Directive.
This is a clear political signal to the public that Europe is taking action and launching cleanup operations in all manner of sectors.
A third point of discussion has been the flexibility of the standards.
Twenty-four Member States cannot meet the standards laid down by the existing Directive.
That does not strike me as a good example of effective legislation.
My position has always been that it is quite acceptable for Member States who are taking a number of measures but are unable to meet the standards to be given extra time to tackle hotspots; provided, however, that much stricter standards are introduced in the medium term.
It is very important that the legislation we produce here is workable and practicable.
Today we are showing that the European Parliament takes complaints from Member States about impracticable legislation seriously.
Experience has taught us that the air does not become any cleaner if we neglect the implementation of the Directive.
The new Directive on ambient air quality is an improvement on the old.
Better, stricter standards are good news for public health, local authorities and construction firms alike.
We can breathe again!
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, firstly I wish to congratulate Mr Krahmer for his excellent report on this difficult and most important subject.
At the same time I wish to congratulate the shadows and all those colleagues who have contributed suggestions, advice and amendments, which, at the end of the day, have formulated a piece of compromise legislation agreed to in negotiation, and which will attempt, if implemented, to have a better air quality directive and provide, to some degree, for cleaner and healthier air for Europe.
At a time when respiratory tract infections such as asthma, emphysema and lung cancer are on the increase in many areas of Europe, with those affected being mainly the most vulnerable, i.e. children and the elderly, we as legislators have a duty to ensure that we do our utmost to secure more healthy breathing for our citizens.
To this end, we were united in our determination not to give in to the unreasonable demands of the Council, which did not accept any changes to the provisions regarding the existing daily and yearly limit values of PM10 and rejected outright Parliament's proposal to link any derogation with the adoption of additional EU measures on sources of pollution.
Although an agreement has been reached, the Council must nevertheless understand that this House gives greater priority to the health of its millions of citizens than to the wealth of a few European industrial giants.
Everybody must fully comprehend that Parliament is much more concerned with preventing people's lungs from being destroyed by disease than helping the purses of greedy industrial barons become fatter.
I am confident that this House will have a future opportunity to have all its provisions successfully adopted in a less compromised piece of legislation that will truly and comprehensively protect citizens from major respiratory damage.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to express our recognition of the quality of Mr Krahmer's report.
We are continuing our work on the directive, which is of considerable importance for the entire ecosystem, including improvements to the state of health of residents of Europe and - taking a broader view - the world.
The economic aspect of these provisions should not be concealed either.
Our aim should therefore be to find a compromise that will genuinely enable Member States to implement the adopted parameters specifying the admissible emissions ceiling for particulates and gases that contaminate the atmosphere.
I am referring here to the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 particulates, and of the gases carbon monoxide and dioxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and ozone, benzene, volatile organic compounds and also lead.
This consequently means reliable and regular monitoring.
Major expenditure will be required for the radical upgrading of many enterprises, including those supplying energy, and especially heat.
Fundamental changes will be needed in the methods and organisation of overland, air and water transport.
These and other costs will have to be borne, it is true.
It is also true, though, that not all countries are in a position to take rigorous action in this matter in the relatively short time that has been suggested without suffering clear economic losses.
This particularly concerns the new Member States, including Poland, which is doing a great deal in this area.
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important for actions undertaken by the EU to find followers elsewhere, especially in the United States, China, Russia, Japan and Brazil.
Air is, after all, common to all the world.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we remember the WHO appeal launched on 5 October 2006, challenging the international community to improve air quality.
Very strict standards needed to be adopted for atmospheric pollution, and the target was to cut the number of deaths in polluted cities by 15%.
The European Union, often at the forefront of environmental regulations, was a great disappointment at the first reading, to the point that our Environment Commissioner Mr Dimas was personally outraged at the position of the European Parliament, which was weakening legislation in force that already had few teeth.
At the second reading on 9 October 2007, the Verts had alerted the Committee on the Environment to the counterproductive effects of administrative simplification and more specifically to the increase in the permitted number of days on which the maximum values could be exceeded and the extension of the exemptions of certain pollutants.
The recently negotiated compromise at the European Parliament's second reading is a damage limitation exercise on the first reading.
Regarding PM2,5 in urban areas, a new limit value is proposed of 20 micrograms per cubic metre, which is to be reviewed by the European Commission in 2015.
Of course, additional measures can be implemented to take account of the circumstances of sensitive populations such as children and the elderly.
Although it is an improvement on the initial situation, this compromise does not constitute a major step forward for the European Parliament.
It will not force Member States to take the restrictive measures necessary to improve the health of the European people.
The impact of atmospheric pollution is still being estimated at a nine-month reduction in life expectancy for our fellow citizens.
We therefore need to go further, integrating the restriction of particles in suspension earlier on using preventive instruments aimed at limiting emissions from various sectors, particularly transport, and those from industry.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, every year 370 000 people in Europe die prematurely from illnesses associated with air pollution.
According to the Commission's official figures, life expectancy in some European countries has shown a decline of between eight months and two years as a result of exposure to dangerous airborne pollutants.
The great majority of deaths are due to fine airborne particulates.
My political group supports the final conciliation agreement and the hesitant, but at any rate positive steps which it takes in response to this situation.
However, I would like to focus on some serious weaknesses: the limits set by this conciliation for fine airborne particulates are more than double the relevant WHO recommendations.
The US Environmental Protection Agency sets stricter limits than the European Union.
No agreement has been reached on safer limits for fine airborne particulates (PM10).
Monitoring requirements have been reduced, although constant monitoring of critical pollutant loads is very important for improving the situation.
The compliance deadlines for benzene have been put back, leaving the big culprit, fuel quality, untouched.
Although everyone says we need improved fuels and cleaner cars, air quality and its monitoring in the workplace have been exempted.
Furthermore, the Member States are given considerable leeway not to enforce the existing legislation and not to monitor its correct enforcement.
We are making a positive step, then, but it is not enough, and for exactly this reason my political group is supporting the European Parliament's conciliation agreement but at the same time asking the Council and Commission to take bolder steps.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland, who is currently attending the Climate Change Conference in Bali.
Following lengthy negotiations, an agreement on ambient air quality has been achieved at long last.
This is no mean feat, and is also very important, because ambient air quality has a direct impact on environmental and human health.
Therefore, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, most warmly for all the work he has done to achieve this.
This Directive makes a realistic contribution to improving health and the environment.
Ambient air quality has already significantly improved in recent years, and this Directive will bring further improvement in the future.
Nevertheless, a number of countries are still finding it difficult to comply with strict standards so soon.
For this reason, I am pleased that this agreement permits a postponement to enable Member States to bring their ambient air quality in line with these standards, provided they make sufficient efforts.
Another important aspect is that measurement is not required at locations to which the public does not have access and which are not permanently inhabited.
This flexibility is particularly important in port areas.
I also particularly welcome the fact that specific reference has been made to measures at the source.
In my view, such measures, for example the new Euro VI standard for heavy goods vehicles, are vital in order to achieve good ambient air quality.
In conclusion I can therefore say that I welcome the present agreement, and shall be voting in favour of it.
(DE) Mr President, the increase in respiratory diseases currently being recorded - particularly among children, the elderly and the sick - as well as the rise in allergy-based breathing difficulties is directly related to a traffic avalanche rolling through our conurbations and along the major transport routes on a daily basis.
The failed EU policy on subsidies has been reflected in recent decades principally in intercity transport.
For particularly sensitive regions - such as the Alps - we have not as is generally known been able to bring ourselves hitherto to turn the fine words of the past into deeds by implementing the Alpine Convention, for instance.
The selling off of our public enterprises, however, which has led to a disastrously deficient public rapid transit network, is also now avenging itself.
To what extent actions such as traffic restrictions and the establishment of environmental zones or city tolls are still able to take hold here at all is highly debatable in my view.
First and foremost, the main culprits of pollutant emissions, such as commercial vehicles with ageing diesel engines, must therefore be replaced very quickly.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
More than 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, 30 million of them in Europe and 200 000 of them in Hungary.
Eighteen per cent of asthmatics in Western Europe are classified in the severe group.
The number of asthma patients in my home country of Hungary has increased by 250% over the last ten years.
The number of new patients diagnosed each year has doubled over the same period.
First among the causes that trigger asthma and asthma attacks is air pollution.
I think that the data in the report before us speaks for itself and its fate, which we will decide tomorrow, is only partly about environmental protection and much more about quality of life and health protection.
One of the greatest problems in Union legislation today is its lack of implementation.
Unfortunately this is also true of legislation on air quality.
Therefore, our primary task now is not to vote for more rules that are even more stringent but to promote compliance with the existing rules.
The place where I live, Budapest, is a city of two million people, and with regard to air particles, for example, it exceeds the permitted limits even in the first four months of the year, and indeed excesses of 4-5 times are not uncommon.
Our task is therefore to develop the current legislation further in a sensible way and to prepare guidelines that do not stipulate additional tasks but refine the existing ones to really contribute to cleaner air for the population of the EU.
I think the Krahmer report fulfils this requirement.
Its virtue is that it wants to measure and capture air pollution primarily at the place of pollution, which is technically the right approach.
The compromise is therefore not ambitious but progressive.
I trust that the cities and Member States concerned will now be able to implement it more consistently and that we will perhaps be able to pass on a more habitable Europe to our children.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(LT) My congratulations to the rapporteur.
I would like to begin by saying that it is always pleasant to have nice weather.
We are in no position to influence the weather, but we can and need to do something about its quality.
The levels of air pollution in the densely populated and industrial urban areas of the European Union are still unacceptable.
If you find yourself in the biggest cities of Europe, you can feel the threat of air pollution only too clearly.
It causes the premature death of tens of thousands of Europeans every year.
Pollution has an adverse effect not only on the length of human life, but also on its quality.
Recent years have seen a significant a reduction in harmful gas emissions in the EU countries.
However, this is only the beginning.
We have to tame the monsters who are spitting the gas into the air, the worst air polluters on the roads.
We need to take decisive measures to develop public transport, to encourage people to use private means of transport less often.
This is a key issue in the new Member States, where 20 or even 30-year-old cars in an appalling condition are continuing to pollute the environment.
The position of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and that of Parliament in general is very important to the countries that joined the EU in the 21st century, particularly as regards more stringent terms and objectives for reducing air pollution, the flexibility of implementation of these objectives and the coordination of long-term and short-term goals.
We must do everything in our power to achieve the smallest possible concentration of different sized airborne particulates in most parts of Europe by 2015.
Countries that are taking active measures to reduce pollution but have not yet achieved the set objectives should be given a chance to do so.
It is important to cut down the derogation period from 'four plus two' to 'three plus two' years.
(PL) Mr President, today the European Parliament is taking a second look at the draft directive on ambient air quality.
One of the aims of this directive is to restrict the quantity of suspended dust particles in the atmosphere in the next few years, particles that we inhale, ranging from 2.5 to 10 microns in size.
Scientists warn that the finest particles constitute a serious threat to human life, and it is these that the directive under discussion has in mind.
The compromise between Parliament and the Council has introduced concessions to the Council, which is in favour of less restrictive regulations.
I hope that the actions envisaged in this directive will not prove inadequate and that when this problem is reconsidered by the European Commission in 2013 more ambitious aims will be adopted, since we are talking here about the health of current and future generations.
Finally, may I thank the rapporteur for his good work and remind you that avoidance is better than dealing with the consequences.
(DE) Mr President, the compromise found is better than expected, but celebrating it as a great success would be a sham because it was watered down.
Wherever it is measured against the revised provisions, it has been watered down because heavily polluted locations can now be factored out.
The negotiated compromise, however, is also damage limitation, because the planned period of grace should now be understood as nothing more than an invitation to do nothing.
In order that the exception does not become the rule, the Commission must monitor the action plans under consideration and compliance with the limits and sanction the failure to transpose them.
It should not therefore be celebrated as a great success because we indeed know that this Directive should in reality have been in force long ago.
Nor should it, however - and this is a positive aspect of the compromise - give German local authorities carte blanche to twiddle their thumbs.
The fresh invitation to do nothing has thereby prevented the local authorities and the federal states from having to produce action plans.
We must also stress, however, that the judgment of the Federal Administrative Court in Germany means and has emphasised for Germany that the local authorities are duty bound to act in any case.
We know that there are already good initiatives in the European Union such as, for example, environmental zones and vehicle fleet conversion.
It must also be quite clear now, though, that this is the last reprieve.
Actions really do have to follow words now to ensure that an ambitious clean air policy does not become absurd.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the monitoring of air pollution and efforts aimed at improving air quality are laudable activities.
The fact that certain parts of the proposal under discussion set quite high requirements whereas others somewhat simplify the reality is not a concern.
What is more serious is that whilst the focus of the debate on the monitoring and removing of fine particles has rightly moved from coarse to finer particles - PM10 to PM2.5 - it should also apply to particles even smaller than PM2.5.
These penetrate as far as the alveoli and because they have a broad surface area they can potentially absorb large amounts of harmful substances.
Because these particles are not deposited in the upper airways they are potentially very dangerous.
Notwithstanding these reservations, I support the proposal for a directive, as does the GUE/NGL Group, of which I am a member, and I trust that we will return to this topic in a more comprehensive manner in the near future.
(FR) Mr President, we all recognise, and we have all said so, that our built-up areas, our cities are becoming increasingly polluted and that, unfortunately, deaths due to this pollution are becoming more and more common.
As chairwoman of an air quality monitoring network in my department that I set up more than sixteen years ago, I would like to remind you that reducing air pollution is seen by citizens as a priority action for the public authorities as regards environmental protection, and that it is even the biggest cause for concern of 54% of French citizens.
This text therefore comes in response to the renewed outbreak of respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema, which affects young children most of all - all we talk about during the winter is bronchiolitis in young children - and lung cancer in older people.
That is why the introduction of new standards for the finest and most harmful particles, which have not been regulated until now, is a satisfactory measure.
However, we have a multitude of solutions at our fingertips for better air quality, such as action on fuels, on modes of transport and on vehicles.
We still need to apply the raft of EU legislation that we already have, which most Member States unfortunately do not comply with.
Under the terms of the texts we will be voting on tomorrow, Member States will have to set up sampling points in urban areas.
In fact, everyone will have to have 'particle plans'.
We also have to provide the public with daily information, especially for those with particular sensitivities, on particulate matter in the air.
Finally, we should not forget air quality in enclosed spaces, where we can spend more than 80% of our time.
Little interest is taken in studies of the environmental quality of homes, though its health impact is bound to be at least as great as that of the outdoor environment.
(RO) Mr. President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr. Kramer.
The proposal for a directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe approaches the relation between air quality and human health and proposes Community actions to improve air quality in Europe.
Urban traffic generates 40% of the carbon dioxide emissions and 70% of the emissions of other pollutants generated by vehicles, and congestion, especially in metropolitan areas, costs the European Union approximately 1% of the GDP.
In many European capitals, traffic is congested and pollution seriously affects their inhabitants.
Over 66% of European citizens consider urban congestion and related pollution to be problems that seriously affect the quality of their lives and request the Union to act in a coherent and, especially, firm manner.
At the European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007, the European Union firmly undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020 as compared to 1990.
The European Union and the Member States must focus their actions on crowded metropolitan and urban areas and approach the issue of air quality in urban agglomerations by complying with the principle of subsidiarity in a more ambitious manner, by implementing a strategy of cooperation and coordination at European level.
The Green Paper on urban mobility promotes the development of public passenger transport, but also approaches measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to road traffic.
Regarding amendment 31, I would like to specify that some actions in the field of mandatory technical standards for reducing pollution generated by land vehicles, as well as by inland water ships, have already been taken in other pieces of legislation.
I believe it is extremely important for the Parliament to be informed every 5 years about the progress achieved by the Member States in improving air quality, but I consider it especially important for such actions to be financed from the Structural Funds as well.
(PL) Mr President, the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air is of major significance for the health of European citizens, particularly since the substances emitted by industry, transport and power plants may be transported over great distances, such as particles and oxides of sulphur, nitrogen and lead.
The directive lays down limits for their emission and emphasises the importance of reducing contaminant emissions and their sources.
The conditions for meeting these requirements vary, however.
In zones and conurbations where many contaminant-emitting entities function, for example coal-fired furnaces and plants using old technologies, adaptation to meet the directive's requirements will require time and considerable financial outlay.
In justified cases, therefore, pursuant to Amendment 2, the date of introduction of the directive's requirements should be postponed.
The directive is right to stress the need to monitor contaminant emissions, which is of great significance in restricting contaminants, including those of cross-border origin.
I congratulate Mr Krahmer, the rapporteur.
(DE) Mr President, I am delighted that we have found agreement so quickly here in all the groups on this important dossier.
Air quality is central to our citizens' health and wellbeing.
I am also delighted that we have set strict limits, particularly new limits in the PM2.5 sector, as these are particularly harmful to health.
Unfortunately, there has been no tightening up in many other sectors, which would have been desirable.
This concerns PM10 as well as the NOx sector, of course.
What alarms me more than the limits we have set, however, is the current air situation in the Member States.
As you all know, almost all the Member States are exceeding current limits.
The ball really is in our court now to implement this ambitious legislative package, as it is in that of the Commission to monitor it.
The Commission has so far not introduced any infringement procedures, although limits are continually being exceeded.
On the one hand implementation must therefore be clean, but on the other hand the Commission must also take practical action if Member States are still not able or willing to adhere to the limits.
It is also important that we have found consistent criteria for measurements.
Practice differs widely here in individual Member States.
With regard to transport - one of the primary causes of air pollution even in my homeland - it has to be said that the Commission is to some extent not prepared either to support initiatives here that countries are taking in order to adhere to air limits.
The Commission should really be asking for Member States to be supported and not obstructed here in their aims to keep the air clean.
We have seen some very significant increases in traffic passing through the Alps and here, too, something must be done with regard to the air.
(NL) Mr President, today, the European Parliament is providing clarity in the long-running debate on the specification of the standards required for reasons of public health with regard to particulates: PM25 and PM10.
Today, we are bringing about a substantial improvement for people sensitive to these: children and the elderly.
I support this policy wholeheartedly.
It is also clear that more customised measures are possible.
Zoning of our rather urbanised regions is to be possible, thus improving practicability without compromising our ultimate objectives.
It is also clear that the source policy is now being tackled seriously and that there is cross-border cooperation in Europe.
Mr President, what is not clear - at least not to me - is whether the blockade in Dutch legislation in respect of a number of projects on account of integrated authorisation for environment and physical planning has really been removed.
It is for the Netherlands, including the lower house of the Dutch Parliament and the legislation, to see whether this can be clarified in the Air Quality Cooperation Programme.
Today, Europe is providing a very clear framework for what is practicable, including in the Netherlands.
It is now for the Netherlands to manage the link between physical planning and environmental policy sensibly to avoid further unnecessary blockades.
That is the spirit in which I am happy to pledge support today to the agreement reached.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a number of key elements have been included in the overall compromise package that is now proposed.
Most importantly, it contains the following elements:
the time extension option for PM10 is kept at the level of the common position; there can be no delay in taking the measures and a single step approach will reduce the administrative burden;
standards for particulate matter PM10 are unchanged in accordance with the original Commission proposal;
a realistic and timely annual PM2.5 target and a limit value set at 25 Âµg per cubic metre to be achieved at 2010 and 2015 respectively;
an indicative limit value for 2020 that adds to the ambitious PM2.5 agenda for the mandatory review in 2013;
a legally binding exposure concentration obligation in 2015 that complements the exposure reduction target in triggering prompt measures that are expected to provide the maximum public health benefit; and
a Commission declaration on the progress in developing the Community measures at source.
The new recital 15 also strengthens the determination of the two co-legislators to consider as a matter of priority the legislative proposals put forward by the Commission to address emission at source at Community level.
I know that these elements were all-important to Parliament at first reading and in the committee this time round.
I believe that the proposed current compromise will satisfy Parliament as important ground was won on the key principle of the ambitious yet realistic ambient air quality standard setting, with a clear roadmap including the adoption of the necessary Community measures and a well-defined review in 2013.
I am also particularly pleased to note the importance given by both Parliament and the Council to finding a compromise in this directive.
The resulting compromise, as well as the demonstrated resolve, enables the European Union to take the effective next steps in ensuring healthier air for its citizens.
To conclude, the Commission is very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations.
It can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full.
I wish to thank and to congratulate, once more, the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for all his efforts to reach an agreement at second reading.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 11 December 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) The importance of having good air around us needs neither explanation nor emphasis.
The current European policy priority which concentrates on the rapid and far-reaching introduction of cohesive and uniform legislation aimed at guaranteeing air quality is the right approach.
The proposal in the directive currently under debate combines and streamlines existing European law by creating a single, cohesive proposal.
Following analysis of the proposal that it currently contains, it may be stated with assurance that the compromise package approved by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, The Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe fully reflects the interests of all parties concerned that will be directly affected by the directive.
This is a balanced proposal for the Member States that will feel the weight of its provisions, with a simultaneous improvement in air quality in Europe and, in the longer term, a significant reduction in PM.
Besides the very detailed treatment of individual target values for PM10 and PM2,5, I believe it is very important to concentrate on the provisions relating to flexibility in the attainment of admissible values for Member States.
It is worth pointing out that the Member States already have very considerable difficulties in complying with pre-existing provisions on air quality improvement.
It is also important to emphasise long-term air quality measures.
We know from experience that short-term measures are often not as effective as long-term ones.
Member States should be encouraged to apply long-term political strategies on air pollution on a voluntary basis.
in writing. - (HU) The right to clean air may also be interpreted as a human right, since the task of the Member States and the European Union is to ensure basic human living conditions (clean water and air).
Fifty to a hundred years ago, the symbol of industrial society was a smoking factory chimney.
Our values have changed in the meantime and we value a clean and natural way of life, at least in words.
Unfortunately, the air in our cities only partly testifies to this.
With the collapse of heavy industry, or its relocation to the Third World, industrial pollution has fallen, but motorisation has multiplied.
Twenty-five years ago there were one million cars in Hungary, which has ten million people, and now there are three times as many, nearly a million of which pollute the air of Budapest, together with all the catastrophic health consequences that this entails.
Lung cancer has multiplied and the number of asthma cases has grown ninefold.
Young children who live beside main roads are essentially exposed to a continuous risk.
It has also emerged that pollution by microparticles originating from diesel vehicles is particularly harmful to human health.
Europe should be ashamed that in this respect the standards in the EU are lower than in the United States.
We should not just talk, but act.
We need to use defined instruments to restrict road traffic in populated settlements, and to create much more stringent emission rules than up to now for the vehicles that remain in use.
We must change from being a society of polluters to being the society of a healthy life!
in writing. - (RO) The European Directive on air quality will improve the health of European citizens and will contribute to increasing the standard of living in the urban environment.
Due to the binding nature of this piece of legislation, this will be achieved on the entire territory of the European Union.
A weak point of the Directive is the financing of measures to adjust to the objectives undertaken by the Member States until 2010, or 2015 respectively.
As a first step, a considerable financial effort will have to be submitted in order to establish centres for sampling and measuring air pollution.
The structural funds already allocated to the Member States eligible for the environmental policy will also be accessible for achieving the objectives described by the directive, but this will reduce the initially estimated amounts.
I believe an additional budget line should be established when the directive becomes effective.
At the same time, I support the insertion of a flexibility clause that would allow transitional periods of up to two years to the Member States, provided that they can prove that they have made a considerable effort to achieve the targets of reducing air pollution.
in writing. - (FI) Today we are discussing at second reading two important directives on improving the quality of the environment.
One relates to the sea, the other to the air.
Protection of the air is one of the key and most traditional areas of environmental protection, because ambient air quality and human health are directly linked.
As the Commission has said, life expectancy has shortened in the EU by 8.5 months owing to air pollution.
The quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people is declining daily, and the natural environment is under threat, despite significant reductions in emissions in recent years.
The importance of the air quality directive probably cannot be stressed too much: it brings together a set of norms which were previously dispersed, and this is a better approach to the problem all round.
I wish first of all to thank the Council for meeting Parliament to discuss some important issues.
Almost half the amendments adopted at first reading were accepted overall.
The Council eventually showed its support for certain very crucial amendments by Parliament.
These related to replacing certain target values for particle concentrations with binding limit values, the deadlines for doing this and how they would be applied.
The limit value norm for PM2.5 particles, which are the most harmful to human health, is critically important.
We therefore need an extremely strict directive.
Mere limit values, however, are not enough in themselves.
Attention also needs to be paid to techniques which improve ambient air quality.
Population and housing censuses (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs JukneviÄienÄ, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on population and housing censuses - C6-0078/2007 - .
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, population and housing censuses are the central building block for all statistical reporting on the people that live in the European Union.
In almost every policy area in which the EU is active, be it economic, social or environmental, high-quality population data are required to help formulate operational objectives and to evaluate progress.
International, European and national institutions need census data to make valid comparisons between EU Member States.
Accurate data on the population are required to comply with important legislation.
Examples are the qualified majority voting within the Council, or the distribution of Structural Funds (on the basis of 'GDP per head' figures.)
The purpose of the present regulation is to provide a clear European framework to achieve comparability of the results of the censuses conducted in the EU Member States.
It clarifies the responsibilities and roles of the statistical bodies on the national and the European levels and sets common requirements concerning the quality and transparency of results, methods and the technology used.
This will be a major step forward to the harmonisation of demographic and social statistics.
Population censuses have a long tradition in the countries of today's European Union, in some countries reaching back over centuries.
For the first time there will be a European legislative framework for the censuses.
The word 'historic' might well be appropriate to describe this development.
The regulation will also be an important milestone for international cooperation in the area of population and housing censuses in which the European Commission, via Eurostat, has been active over many years.
There is a broad agreement across all the institutions involved - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - about the importance of the legislation.
It is only natural and appreciated that the legislation about censuses raises debate.
After all, you will decide upon the collection of data about all European citizens as well as upon the most cost- and burden-intensive statistical exercise.
The issue is politically sensitive and requires a considerable investment of taxpayers' money and citizens' goodwill in the Member States.
However, we should not forget that the absence of subjective and comparable census data would lead to negative consequences.
The data are used for policy formulation and evaluation, administrative purposes and social research that increases the welfare of the people living in the European Union.
The benefits of harmonised census data by far outweigh the efforts to collect it.
The Member States have been carrying out their national censuses for many decades.
What we can achieve with this European legislation is to make their efforts pay off even better by ensuring census data that are of the highest possible quality and comparable between the regions of the European Union.
This is why the European Commission supports the debate that is still ongoing and sincerely hopes that a solution will be found that is acceptable to a broad majority within this House, as well as to the Member States represented in the Council.
We appeal to all to support the rapporteur, Ms JukneviÄienÄ, in her quest to find such a compromise.
The Commissioner has just said that this regulation is a historical event.
I would like to begin by saying that yes, it is a historical event, but at the same time it happens to be one of the most scandalous in Europe.
Today, could we admit to ourselves, even though it seems obvious, that up to now we have had no reliable statistics and no idea about how many people live in the European Union and in what kind of accommodation.
First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, representatives of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and members of regional committees, for their close cooperation in preparing this document.
Many thanks to the representatives of the Commission and the Council who took an active part in the discussions and participated in our joint efforts to achieve the compromise that only necessary information should be included in this regulation.
Any unnecessary data that in some cases might be in breach of a person's right to privacy should not be collected.
The EU statistics and, accordingly, the regulation have a juridical basis, provided for in Article 285 of the EU Treaty.
There is no doubt that the foundations for this document are in place.
This article specifies the need to conform to very important criteria - impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.
The main objective of the regulation is to provide a detailed account of population structure and characteristics with a view to analysing the data and using the results to develop a strategy in many EU policy areas.
The data from the annual population census is used, as the Commissioner said, to ascertain such important criteria as voting and establishing the majority of votes in the Council.
High-quality regional data is necessary for the purpose of identifying regions that qualify for EU assistance, as well as for assessing progress in regional cohesion policy.
Therefore, could any other document be of greater importance in terms of being able to compare and trust the data contained in it?
The regulation provides an opportunity to collect high-quality data on housing.
This data is necessary to establish the number of consumers of water, energy and other commodities and to determine housing demand and supply and the necessary funding.
The last census, taken in 2001, was based on a gentleman's agreement and did not achieve any positive results.
I believe the data are insufficiently thorough, unreliable, difficult to compare and relate to different time periods.
That is why there is some doubt regarding whether EU funds have been distributed and used gratuitously.
Of course, this makes it difficult to develop plans for the future too.
The proposed regulation would guarantee reliable, transparent and comparable results.
It would also require only the essential information on certain issues.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I am asking you to support the amendments I have proposed, which aim to relieve the Member States of the burden of collecting and storing unnecessary information.
The vote on this regulation has been adjourned until the next plenary session.
It is very important to find a compromise.
We need to get this regulation up and running in order to achieve our objectives.
We also need the support of EU citizens.
It is important that they realise the importance of the census and support it.
People need to be sure that the common statistics system is reliable and essential for their wellbeing.
Most importantly, the information must be stored safely and used only for the correct purpose.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have been following the preparation of this report as well as the negotiations with the Commission.
It is in fact a very important report with a view to the planning and assessment of regional and social policies in the various Member States and, in that respect, the socio-economic profile of the population of Europe and housing conditions are among the most decisive aspects for measuring the improvement in living conditions.
In our view the Commission seems to be taking the correct line, which we support, on the indicators that make this type of analysis possible.
We therefore need to continue to improve the coverage, quality and reliability of this type of statistical data.
We think, however, that care should always be taken to strike a good cost/benefit balance as regards the degree of detail in the information to be provided, while also bearing in mind personal privacy.
This report will be useful only if it helps to increase the frequency, comparability and accuracy of these data at EU level.
For that it is essential to take very special care as regards the data supplied by the Member States, which needs to be consistent, complete and reliable.
That is the only way to make comparative studies and analyses of the socio-economic situation at regional, national and Community levels.
The way in which those data are processed is even more significant, since the classification of the regions for the purpose of applying the Structural Funds is based largely on such indicators, which means that in the normal course of events, this process leads to decisions that may have major consequences for the various European regions and for the Member States themselves.
I hope that, as a result of the negotiations with the Council, we shall achieve greater coherence, clarity and accuracy throughout.
I should just like to place on record that the PPE-DE Group has maintained its original position on this report, even after hearing the explanations given by the Commission, in line with the rapporteur's position; I hope we shall maintain that position to the end.
We are in favour in particular of deleting sections 1.3 and 2.3 of the Annex, as well as certain subsequent amendments that in our view are not consistent with the aims of improving the quality and reliability of the information.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Madeira, who was to have spoken on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, is unable to be with us because of transport problems.
I shall therefore be presenting her views on the importance of this report and her concerns, which I share, and which I expressed previously in this plenary session regarding development policies.
The approval of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is to be signed this week by the Heads of State or Government, makes it absolutely vital to have reliable European Union population data.
The new voting method included in that Treaty, which will henceforth take account not only of the Member States' vote, but also of the population figures, means that we must be aware that population censuses are crucial for the effective operation of the European Union.
However, this regulation is important for other reasons apart from the voting method - it is important also for all indicators concerning employment, regional, structural or social matters that take account of the data provided by each of the Member States and that, often, in view of the discrepancies in the data collection methods used or in the reference periods, produce inadequate analyses and results of questionable validity.
The last time this exercise was carried out, in 2000, the data were available only in 2005 and thus were of questionable validity.
The regulation under consideration today, purged of certain incongruities that shocked even the most inattentive reader, takes account of a series of factors that are essential in order to obtain good results from population and housing censuses and will enable us to have pre-defined reference years common to the Member States and listed questions that will allow reliable comparisons.
Finally, I repeat that I am in favour of including the non-obligatory topics in the regulation.
Using questions not covered in the obligatory topics will not only give Member States a consistent and coherent list to serve as a basis for collecting further data rather than leaving it to them which might produce interesting but totally redundant results.
The argument that censuses should be removed from the text because they cost money does not make sense.
It is precisely because high costs are involved that we should clearly place topics to be analysed within a legal framework so that the results do not prove to be worthless for future use for various purposes.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the draft regulation on population and housing censuses is a document of considerable importance.
Data gleaned from population and housing censuses provide an opportunity for rational drafting of development strategies and for intervention action to be taken.
This is why it is so important for the data to be transparent and comparable.
In that case, Community solutions will apply to real and well-studied phenomena.
Comparability is not just a matter of well-defined data; it also means that such data have been collected over identical periods of time.
Clear specification of collection periods and updating, correction and publication dates is of great significance and this has been clearly stated in the document and amendments.
One important question is the way in which data on local communities are gathered.
I support the amendment introducing a separate definition for this.
I also support the amendment introducing environmental policies alongside regional ones.
Regular statistical studies looking at family, social, economic and residential characteristics are undoubtedly needed in view of the demographic and social problems Europe faces.
This is why I think that the amendment deleting recommended topics for geographical levels, and in particular not derived topics such as location of schools and higher education institutions, means of getting to work or school, distance from work or school, number of children born alive, type of economic activity, duration of unemployment, main source of livelihood, income, housing conditions or disability, which describe families' actual living conditions, is wrong.
The emphasis on respect for national personal data protection rights in the text is important, and the principle of subsidiarity has rightly been retained in this area.
I congratulate Mrs JukneviÄienon a thorough piece of work on the draft report.
May I point out that we have been joined in our discussion by a Member who just yesterday became a full Member of the Chamber, Mr Krzysztof HoÅowczyc, a very well-known figure in Poland.
Welcome, Mr HoÅowczyc!
Please familiarise yourself with proceedings.
Mr HoÅowczyc is a rally driver, very well-known in Poland, and on Saturday he won a legendary stage of the BarbÃ³rka Rally.
My sincere congratulations!
Here we practise a different kind of sport, though, so please change seats quickly if you would, Mr HoÅowczyc.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that the capture and harmonisation of statistics on the most important economic and social characteristics of the regions is essential for the European Union.
The allocation of structural funds, one third of the budget, actually relies on this base data.
What the Commission is proposing here in its regulation on population censuses, however, in reality has nothing to do with these necessities.
The data that it wants to capture and harmonise in this statutory text, which directly applies to all EU Member States, is personal data on our fellow human beings, which is not really of any concern to the EU.
Included in this are personal data on family and sex life, housing situation and religious affiliation.
Furthermore, it also has the audacity to want to include this data by law in uniform standards without including any reference in the law to data protection.
It is therefore our duty as representatives of our citizens to stop any such intrusion into individual rights, particularly as there is no reason to harmonise data on family life, personal circumstances or the housing situation when this does not in any way fall within the competence of the European Union and is not provided for in the Reform Treaty.
The EU cannot be allowed, through the back door, to claim competences here that should remain solely with the Member States, and the supervision of data collection would presume this.
For us it is not a question of time or speed, but a question of the prime necessity that the protection of personal data has absolute priority.
This Commission text does not guarantee this.
I am happy that the rapporteur wants to delete the non-mandatory text here.
We already backed this, even at committee level.
Unfortunately, she had not obtained a majority for it at that time.
The citizens expect us to ensure that what the judgment now stipulates, namely adjournment, will actually compel the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to make sure that data protection is checked here once again and that only then will the decision on Parliament's position and first reading be made.
I would ask all groups to be true to their word here.
for the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on population and housing censuses presented by the Commission is a step in the right direction, like the previous proposals on statistics on health and safety at work and on job vacancies.
I also agree with the Commission's statement during the last population and housing censuses for 2001 that the collection of data from individual Member States based solely on 'gentlemen's agreements' is inadequate for achieving sufficiently comparable results.
It is therefore necessary to adopt legislation at European level.
Only in this way can we guarantee the reliability, transparency and comparability of the results.
On the other hand, I was alarmed when I saw the list of data requested by Eurostat in section 1.3 of the annex to the proposed regulation.
Even allowing for the fact that these are only recommended indicators, I believe that the Commission went too far in this respect.
There are no grounds for asking people intimate questions about their private life.
I was even more taken aback by the fact that this data was only to be collected from women.
I therefore wholeheartedly welcomed the decision of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to remove these intrusive and inappropriate requirements from the Commission's proposal.
Such information is perhaps more appropriate in a medical centre.
As far as the anonymity of this data goes, in my view it should be comparable to banking data.
I think that in compiling any statistical information we must above all respect the protection of personal data and the privacy of individuals, and we must prevent a disproportional increase in the number of tasks required of the data providers.
I will recommend that the GUE/NGL Group vote in this sense.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, on 20 November, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I was pleased to support the rapporteur, Ms JukneviÄienÄ, in her Amendment 32 to delete paragraph 1.3.2 so as to exclude the intrusive and offensive question about women's first sexual act, dressed up as 'consensual union'.
The Commission representative at that time present in committee promised me that this 'insensitive question' would be removed and not come back.
I took that as a victory for me, for my party UKIP, but, mostly, as a victory for common sense, and I was ready to congratulate the Commission on it.
By the way, that retraction proves that I was right to describe it as being about the sex act because, if it was just cohabitation following, which it was claimed to be, why did the Commission representative promise to withdraw what was an innocent question?
I am proved right.
Now, when I saw today that the vote on this proposal would not be held tomorrow as originally scheduled but postponed indefinitely, although the debate is obviously still going on, I smelled a rat because votes usually follow debates very closely.
I was right.
The latest version that I printed off from the computer just an hour ago shows as indicated on page 1, Text by the Commission, that a new Amendment 39 is here.
It bears no relation to the original Amendment 39, which is an innocent thing about technicalities, but it is the old 1.3.2 - complete with the whole list of questions, including the intrusive question about women's consensual union.
At the time, in committee, I did not like the fact that, when votes came up the following day, the rapporteur had allowed her Amendment 32 to be somewhat watered down to Compromise A, which only deleted the list of questions in 1.3.2, and left the 1.3 and 1.3.1 preamble paragraphs, which was a peg, of course, to hang further questions on - and I was right to be suspicious of that.
This objectionable, intrusive and insulting question has been disgracefully reintroduced as Amendment 39 by the Commission - against the Commission promise to me in committee - and I am more angry, Mr President, than I have been at any time recently.
I was promised that this would disappear and it has been brought back by the Commission - a disgraceful question which no woman should be asked to put up with.
It is a disgrace to women; it is a disgrace to the committee which has to debate the thing.
I therefore ask all colleagues to vote against Amendment 39 and - to make sure - vote against the whole of this rotten, distorted proposal.
(DE) Mr President, in view of the ethnically based conflicts which are constantly flaring up, manifesting themselves to excess in the most recent Paris riots, for example, it is pleasing to note that we in the EU seem to be finally awakening from our multicultural dreams and are wanting to ask questions on ethnic origin and religion in an EU-wide population census in 2011.
This data should definitely be collected so that we are better able to evaluate the risk potential in this regard.
Cultural differences can - as we have seen increasingly in recent times - escalate all too easily.
In this respect we in Europe - where some countries have boastfully declared themselves immigration countries - are sitting right over a powder keg that should not be underestimated, even in the metropolitan conurbations.
The most recent conflicts between the Kurds and the Turks have thus required massive police presence in our towns and cities, as is generally known.
Statistics on the ethnic and cultural composition of the resident population could therefore be of paramount necessity and benefit for the prevention of violence.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal on population and housing censuses is a completely new piece of EU legislation in an area that has not been previously regulated.
The question arises as to whether there is any need for such legislation.
The Commission's arguments concerning the need to guarantee comparability and quality of statistical data are relatively convincing, particularly on a general level.
However, we must take a critical eye to the proposed areas of information to be collected and evaluated.
The Commission's proposal contains a large group of data whose sustainability is highly questionable.
I regard as controversial the collection of housing data based on the conclusions of the Laeken European Council.
These can be only considered an expression of political will, not a valid legal document.
Besides, the EU does not have any competence in the area of housing, and so the statistics obtained on housing, contrary to other data, cannot serve to support the implementation of existing policies, unless the results are intended to serve as a possible catalyst for introducing a new common housing policy.
This would be, however, an abuse of power and a breach of the Treaty.
The proposal to collect a large amount of data on citizens' private lives is entirely without justification.
From the point of view of implementation of common policies, there is no reason why the EU institutions should have access to data on the number of marriages and partners of each female citizen or the length of these relationships.
This is more like playing 'Big Brother', interfering in peoples' private lives and improperly infringing their personal freedom.
If some of the EU institutions are tempted to do so, it is right to intervene and lay down clear limits, which cannot be transgressed.
In my view, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs did so by limiting substantially the areas of data to be collected and is to be commended for that.
The most transparent solution is that proposed by my Group, the PPE-DE, which omits all references in the annex to concrete types of statistical data.
I recommend that you give this proposal for your attention and your support.
(RO) Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to appreciate the importance of this proposal of regulation regarding statistics collected by Member States on housing.
Member States have to use a common system for the standard data to be regularly collected and reported.
Accurate and precise statistics regarding housing allow the Union and the Member States to implement adequate policies in this field.
Nevertheless, any data collection must observe the private life of individuals.
The Union is not only based upon economic criteria, but we also have to build a social Europe.
Decent living obviously involves decent housing.
Unfortunately, today, there are over 60 million citizens living below the poverty line in the European Union, and children are most exposed to the risk of poverty.
Obviously, these people also have difficulties in getting decent housing.
The main social and demographic tendencies affecting subsidized housing policies are generated by population aging, migration of population inside the Union, migration of population from rural areas to urban areas and predominant development of urban areas.
Yet, there is no unique model applicable to all Member States: in some Member States, there is a big number of houses in which many generations of the same family live together.
Austria, Finland, the Czech Republic and Poland have programmes for providing subsidized housing to young people.
In France, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Great Britain, the number of houses with only one tenant has increased.
In Romania, 95% of the houses are private property and only 5% of the houses are rented or are subsidized houses.
In Denmark, 47% of the houses are inhabited by tenants or are subsidized houses, in Austria 42%, in Finland 37%, in France 44% and in Germany 57%.
Statistics represent only a starting point in developing adequate housing policies for each Member State.
These policies depend on the allocation of public funds at national, regional or local level, as well as on the real estate market evolution.
I believe Member States should also use the Structural Funds for building houses, especially those for regional development.
Yet, the issue of housing requires an approach based upon statistical data, as well as a global, multidimensional approach, based upon national and Community law.
Nevertheless, a pragmatic approach, based upon the needs of the citizens, is also required.
Unfortunately, there are European citizens who live in inadequate, unsafe houses, but there are also European citizens who have no house or even a roof over their heads.
What is Europe's answer and support for the needs of these citizens?
Mr President, one of the more important services Europe can provide is to support the collection of reliable, comparable information.
For this reason, I can give qualified support to the idea of a European census.
However, a few points need to be considered.
First of all, there needs to be some recognition of national censuses in the report.
Member States already hold censuses, and they will now be in a position of having to organise national and European censuses.
Taking a census is very expensive - it is a labour-intensive activity - and it is reasonable to expect that Member States are going to increasingly combine the national with the European census.
