Partnership means something completely different.
Partnership means respect for the country which needs to carry out economic and social development.
A partnership agreement must foster respect for the fact that the provision of development aid must not be linked to the conclusion of an EPA.
Economic partnership agreements have to take account of the development of the weak, and weakest, countries.
No country, if it does not sign, should be in a worse situation than it is already.
That is fair partnership and that is an approach based on solidarity.
The Commission was miles away from that.
I think it is a good thing that, under pressure from many sides, it is now starting to pursue a different strategy, although I am very sceptical about this when I see how it is acting with Mercosur, ASEAN and the Andean countries, where it is still pursuing the same old way of thinking.
We Europeans seem to be saying, 'this is what is going to happen, take it or leave it'.
I repeat, that has nothing to do with partnership.
I was rather annoyed - in fact I was appalled - by what happened here today, that we could not use the Kigali decision as a basis, even though it was endorsed by all the Members who were in Kigali.
Parliament should have given this delegation its support by endorsing the decision.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) Mr President, EPAs are a controversial theme in Africa and are increasingly developing into one in Europe.
This issue involves fundamental differences of insight concerning the possibility of fighting poverty by means of sustainable economic growth in ACP countries.
It is clear that purely financial aid has not made a real contribution to the reduction of poverty.
We believe that these trade agreements can offer a window through which we can get away from a long history of barely effective aid.
The global trade with ACP countries has decreased.
It is now less than 1% and the Millennium Development Goals have not been achieved in Africa.
The situation must change.
Europe has a moral duty to help the ACP countries grow economically and to increase trade with them.
The EPAs must make a contribution to this.
Mr President, the benefits of trade and economic integration are evident, particularly in an increasingly globalised world.
Competition, a good climate for investment, market access, and working factories are essential for economic growth in ACP countries.
We must be flexible and pragmatic, but within the framework of the World Trade Organization.
The signing of the completed trade agreements is no longer expected by the deadline of 1 January 2008.
Some countries in East and South Africa have, however, reached interim agreements.
These are goods-only agreements.
They cannot be called a step towards regional development.
We must quickly start supplying technical support to strengthen these countries and then eventually reach a complete agreement, including, for example, services.
Mr President, my Group recommends, as others have said, that, in the interests of credibility and authenticity, Parliament establish a position which reflects what was unanimously agreed at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly and was reflected by the Kigali Declaration.
I believe that it is both a moderate and balanced document, which represents lengthy and successful negotiations between all our political groups - including, of course, Mr Sturdy's political group, as he made reference to it - and with the ACP.
I have never encountered the kind of pressure that the ACP has faced during these negotiations, especially as they are threatened with being severely disadvantaged by Europe's GSP tariff regime.
It is that threat that has caused the emergence of new regional groupings, and we will possibly see bilateral agreements, for example with CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
These subgroupings which the Commissioner has talked about are not something that we should see as a great achievement, but rather as something that threatens regional integration and is causing massive regional tensions amongst the ACP.
Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar and Comoros have agreed a subregional EPA; West and Central Africa have put forward no market access offers and so face GSP.
South Africa and Namibia, in the SADC, seem to have reached a red line they cannot cross and are being asked to include most-favoured-nation clauses which would oblige them to give the EU any market access they may concede in the future to other countries.
The Pacific, of course, is also not experiencing the best of negotiations and it is unlikely that any countries other than Fiji and Papua New Guinea will sign or initial.
Intransigence and a lack of flexibility have clearly alienated the ACP, especially when they realise that the Commission is pushing for agreements from the ACP that it has not sought from others, and colleagues from the Committee on International Trade will confirm this.
Both technically and politically, the 'goods-only' agreement has proved impossible, even for the Caribbean.
The capacity of the Caribbean is greater than of any other region.
Only last week, they said that what was on offer was simply not tenable for them.
Surely, the Commission must now step back, take the pressure off and reassess how it can ensure that we do not do the unthinkable and throw the non-LDCs to the wolves.
The willingness of both sides to continue negotiation in good faith should be communicated to the WTO in order to avoid the trade disruption which failure to sign an EPA by the deadline would cause.
The EU must make the required internal legislative changes to permit the continuation of the current trading arrangements.
Subsequently, the EU and the ACP could work together to ensure that there is no opposition or challenge in the WTO.
We, as Members of the European Parliament, simply cannot return to our constituencies, wherever they are in Europe, and say that vulnerable ACP states are going to be treated in this way when they are already agreeing amongst themselves that they are being asked to agree economic partnerships that they see as being harmful to their economic interests.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to inform you of the serious concerns expressed in recent months by overseas communities in relation to EPAs.
The EPAs cannot amount to mere free trade agreements under the auspices of the WTO, nor can they jeopardise the already fragile economies of our overseas communities. They ought to represent a genuine partnership to create a new economic and trade framework favourable to development in all such territories.
The geographic location of overseas communities in close proximity to many ACP countries places them at the centre of the preferential reciprocal agreements with these countries.
I am well aware that the outermost regions and overseas countries and territories (OCTs) making up Europe's overseas territory concern only six EU Member States and that obviously issues in these territories are largely unknown.
Nevertheless, the particular situation of the outermost regions is known and must be taken into account much more specifically within these negotiations on the basis of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty.
Additionally, OCTs next to ACP countries must also be given a special focus in terms of respect for the association agreements which already link them to the EU by virtue of this Article.
I thank you for supporting the amendment I intend to table in a bid to secure an intelligent balance between regional integration of overseas territories and their European links.
Although negotiations may be difficult, particularly concerning protection of local markets and the list of sensitive products, I trust the Commission will find a respectful compromise between the specific interests of outermost regions and OCTs and of ACP countries.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that what will be important is to use the next few weeks to shape the agreement so that everyone can be happy with it.
It is an agreement of great importance and it has immense symbolic resonance.
It is not just about negotiating a free trade agreement for the regions and countries of Africa and bringing them closer to Europe.
It is also about producing an agreement for a real development round, which fights poverty and genuinely shows that the European Union is in a position to negotiate an agreement in a way which puts the African countries at their ease and helps them feel a bond with the European Union.
There are several points which are important, as you yourself said, and you mentioned a number of them.
We must ensure that the regional agreements genuinely benefit the countries concerned.
We must ensure that the non-LCD countries also get an agreement and are not left out, and we must ensure that all the countries can develop in the right direction.
The agreement which you proposed, in the form of a two-step approach, must also guarantee that no one is left out, so that ultimately, we are genuinely moving in the right direction, which is still not guaranteed today.
Mr Markov, we should utilise the opportunity available to us now as a result of not adopting the resolution tomorrow, in order to reach a consensus in Parliament, and I think we have enough points of convergence for that to happen.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank all who contributed to this interesting debate.
I am sure that we see it as an ongoing process.
I am not part of it directly or personally but, for an agreement, you need goodwill on both sides and for many partners to agree.
As I said in my introductory statement, we are working in a pragmatic and flexible way.
Those who are ready or willing to follow the same approach follow not to the detriment of the others, but for the gradual achievement which is important for all regions and for international trade as a whole.
There were some questions or criticisms about the tone of the negotiations.
I want to assure you that it is in a spirit of partnership.
We take into account, in this spirit of partnership, the development objectives and the constraints on our partners.
Some questions were about goods-only deals.
The stepping-stone agreements lead towards comprehensive EPAs and these are supportive of ACP development and regional integration.
So we are not losing sight of the overall picture and overall needs of our partner countries and regions.
I do not want to repeat many of the points I made at the beginning, but the process continues.
Sometimes a deadline brings pressure to find a solution during the last few days or weeks, and we are making real progress.
I quoted many names and countries where we have recently initialled stepping-stone agreements, and we will continue doing so, but our interest is really in finding solutions.
Processes will continue, because there is more than one stage in this situation.
As I said, after 1 January, we will continue working on issues like services, investment and other trade-related areas.
I believe that the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week will support the proposal for a regulation of the Community to implement the market access which has been offered to the ACP.
As I said, it is the best ever offer in a bilateral agreement.
We are being not only open but also very constructive.
The strategy the Commission proposed, and I tried to describe, was fully confirmed by the Council - all 27 countries - and, in this spirit of partnership and this constructive manner, we will continue.
The objective is really a fully-fledged economic partnership agreement.
This will be a catalyst for regional integration.
Once the first-step agreements are concluded, we will continue towards this objective.
Nobody is left out or forgotten in this process.
We not only have in mind, but support very actively, the least developed countries.
I think that is all I can say for now, either in response to questions or by way of confirmation, but I am sure that this House will come back to this point in the coming weeks and months, because this is also about the timing of our agreements.
I have received four motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 12 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - We have reached a critical period for the economic partnership agreements (EPAs).
A WTO-compliant agreement is crucial for the non-least developed ACP countries.
It is unfortunate that a relationship of trust between the two sides has not always been evident.
No country should feel pressurised into entering an agreement.
The Commission should have done more to make the negotiations more inclusive.
The EU is the most important trading partner for most ACP countries.
The EU imported goods worth a total of EUR 28 billion from the ACP countries in 2004.
This amounts to double the amount of development assistance that was made available through the ninth EDF to the ACP region, from 2000 to 2007.
Trade, and not aid, is the key for sustainable economic growth and development.
While no one can deny that many ACP countries face considerable challenges, if the EPAs are framed correctly they should be seen as an opportunity for the ACP.
The European Union should be fully supportive of the development agenda that shall accompany any EPA agreement.
Interim deals should be put in place to ensure that there will be no disruption to trade and that the livelihood of millions will not be put at risk.
Amendment of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways - Interoperability of the Community rail system (recast) - Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2004/49/EC on the safety on the Community's railways - 6-0493/2006 -;
by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the Community rail system (recast) - C6-0474/2006 -;
by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 establishing a European Railway Agency - C6-0473/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the adoption of the first two railway packages in 2001 and 2004 and before the adoption of the third railway package on 13 December 2006, the Commission proposed a new set of legislative measures on cross-acceptance of rolling stock, particularly locomotives.
The aim of the measures is to revamp the rail sector by removing hindrances to the operation of trains on the European rail network.
The Commission launched this initiative for two main reasons: to facilitate free movement of trains within the EU by making the procedure for placing locomotives in service more transparent and efficient, and also to simplify regulations by consolidating and merging the three rail interoperability directives into a single directive.
The full package contains a communication, three legislative proposals and their impact assessment: a communication setting out the current difficulties and proposing a number of solutions to simplify certification of railway vehicles; a proposal to recast the existing rail interoperability directives; a proposal to amend the Regulation establishing a European Railway Agency, and a report on the impact assessment.
What is the central focus of these texts?
One crucial aspect is facilitating free movement of trains, and this concerns the procedure for approval of locomotives.
According to railway companies and manufacturers, the approval procedure is extremely long and costly, and there would appear to be very little justification for a number of the authorities' demands from the purely technical standpoint.
The Commission shares this view and intends to solve the problem by amending the legislation and also by asking railway authorities in the Member States to modify their attitude, and hence the importance of the communication issued along with the legislative proposals, suggesting solutions that may be applied immediately with no need to wait for any amendments to laws.
This communication has not been issued in vain.
One cooperation agreement has already emerged, signed in May for the Rotterdam-Genoa corridor.
This agreement follows the concepts proposed in our communication to the letter.
We could also mention the proposed recast of the directives on interoperability and safety.
The Commission had two objectives in mind when it drew up these proposals.
The first was to simplify the approval procedure for railway vehicles.
To this end we have introduced the principle of mutual recognition of authorisations for placing in service already issued by a Member State.
This principle is that rolling stock which has already been granted authorisation for placing in service in one Member State will not require any further certification in another Member State beyond that required by additional national regulations arising out of the characteristics of the local network, for instance.
Secondly, in a bid for clarity, we have used a single text to combine the 1996 Directive on interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and the 2001 Directive on interoperability of the conventional rail system.
In that regard, the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny has been introduced for certain powers delegated to the Commission by the Council and the European Parliament.
Amending the interoperability and safety directives prompted us to carry out two further operations.
We have made a number of amendments to technical issues in the new interoperability directive in light of experience gained during ten years of work not only by the Commission but also by the Member States in relation to comitology, by industry and the sector and, as of 2005, by the European Railway Agency.
We also wanted to respond to other operators by clarifying, in the safety directive, relations between the railway company and the entity carrying out maintenance.
The aim is, through this directive, to set out the new regulatory framework emerging from the Community directives on the opening up of the market and from the new contract on the use of wagons implemented on an international scale by the COTIF Convention.
Now I come to my final point on the proposal to amend the Regulation establishing a European Railway Agency.
This concerns extending the powers of the European Railway Agency to allow it to compile the various national procedures and existing technical rules for authorisation of locomotives, and to draw up and subsequently extend the list of requirements to be verified once only, either because these are internationally recognised rules or because they may be considered as equivalent between the Member States.
This task will be carried out in cooperation with national safety authorities under the guidance of the Agency.
The Agency must issue technical opinions at the request of national safety authorities or the Commission.
While making these amendments, we also clarified a number of other points in the Regulation on the basis of past experience, particularly in relation to the introduction of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) and registers of rolling stock.
Mr President, I apologise for this rather technical commentary, and wish to say that the first and second rail packages, and soon the third package also, form the legal and economic framework for sound operation of rail services within the single market. The operation will be completed by the opening up of national markets from the technical point of view.
This is the objective of these proposals so eagerly awaited by the railway industry.
I wish to thank Parliament for its splendid and rapid work on these texts.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though we are compelled to hold a 'technical' debate, as the Commission Vice-President has said, we are taking a major political step forward today.
Ever since the first Treaty was drawn up in the late 1950s, European transport policy has had three goals: to create a single market, to connect networks which were separate from one another - so as to create a single market for and between modes of transport, of course - and to make networks interoperable at the construction stage.
Interoperability is not a technical matter, therefore; it really is a precondition for establishing Europe-wide markets which are absolutely necessary and the stated aim of the Treaty.
Major progress has been achieved in almost all respects, yet the railway sector lags behind somewhat.
We find ourselves today with the same goals as those in the 1960s.
The reasons are different, and this is not the time to explore them, but this point needs to be made in order to strengthen our conviction that we are taking a major step and that it is crucial for us to succeed.
Interoperability is therefore a key condition for building, and being able to move around on, networks free from technical barriers which prevent full freedom of movement for engines and carriages.
As such, it is a fundamental step that had to be taken and must be taken as rapidly as possible.
The Commission was right to stop distinguishing between interoperability on high-speed networks and traditional networks, and hence to push as far as possible in this direction.
It was also right to put the problem of safety on the table at the same time, since safety is sometimes presented - and I need to tread very carefully here - as a reason for attaching conditions to interoperability.
How can an engine-driver be made to cross a border when he may not understand the language of the country to which he travels?
How can a locomotive be made to cross a border when it might not be perfectly suited to the network on the other side?
I could go on.
The Commission therefore did well to bring the two elements together.
We absolutely must guarantee safety, but within the bounds of a system that is interoperable, because if safety is put first as a condition for preventing interoperability, there is something amiss in this business.
The very fact that it was decided to create a European Agency dealing with these matters and others, as we shall see, is undoubtedly a sign that we are taking things seriously.
What has Parliament done?
Parliament has broadly approved the Commission's proposals, with a few recommendations intended to make the system more interoperable.
In the report on interoperability, Parliament envisages setting deadlines by which authorisations should be granted, in relation to existing rolling stock, of course.
It also advocates that the burden of proof of the fact that something is not interoperable - even on safety grounds - should be shifted onto Member States: in other words the initial assumption is that, once certified, everything can go everywhere, unless someone can give me a serious reason why that should not be the case.
Thirdly, Parliament envisages that the retrofitting of all existing rolling stock should be eligible for state aid.
Those, I believe, are the contributions made by this House.
The same applies to safety.
Here too, we have attempted to say that certification should be mandatory by a certain date: 2010 is our proposal.
This should allay everyone's fears, without exception, given that everyone is treated in similar fashion, rather than continuing to regard the monopolies still running railway services as automatically being particularly competent and therefore exempt from these obligations.
The third point concerns getting the Agency up and running.
On this point I have one key question on my mind, and I would address it to everyone, in particular the Commission.
We quite rightly saw fit to separate out safety from everything else by creating 25 European agencies.
That was a major decision taken some time ago.
I now wonder, given that these agencies are not yet operational, whether it might not be worth considering whether to have one single European Agency working through 25 offshoots in the different countries.
This is a fundamental issue and would help us find a positive solution to the allied problems of interoperability and safety at European level.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, as a result of globalisation, our economy, the progress of the Community and the welfare of our citizens depend more than ever on an effective, efficient, economic and, above all, sustainable system of transport.
All modes of transport are needed.
The railways enjoyed glory days in the beginning, but were then pushed aside by vehicles travelling on roads and motorways, due to their greater versatility, individuality and accessibility.
Now, with our roads at risk of collapse and our environment in a critical state due to pollution, we are once again looking at the railways as a hope for the future to meet our needs for domestic mobility.
Aware of this, the Commission has proposed a new legislative package to improve the technical part of the regulatory framework for rail transport.
This involves revising the directives on interoperability and safety and the Regulation on the European Railway Agency.
In general terms, it was years ago that the European institutions first considered the need to consolidate the railways at Community level.
Just on the issue of interoperability, everyone knows that, in July 1996, in other words 11 years ago, we adopted Council Directive 96/48/EC on the high-speed rail system followed, in March 2001, by the Directive on the trans-European conventional rail system.
However, for more than a decade, the levels of interoperability of the European networks have not gone beyond 7% and it is the requirement for national approval of locomotives and traction units in each of the Member States where these are to be used that is currently one of the main barriers to the creation of new railway companies dedicated to the transport of passengers and freight, and also a major obstacle to the interoperability of the European railway system.
As Member States cannot decide on their own that their authorisations for placing in service will be valid on the territory of other Member States, a Community initiative to simplify and harmonise national procedures and to encourage more systematic use of the principle of mutual recognition is necessary.
The current directives regulate only new rolling stock placed in service.
The new directive is intended to consolidate, recast and merge the current directives.
For our part, based on brief technical reports that we requested in accordance with Parliament's Rules of Procedure, we have proposed transferring to our Interoperability Directive the contents of the former Article 14 of the Safety Directive.
This is specifically intended to give the rail sector greater legal certainty and enable the simplification of the authorisation for placing in service.
We agree with the condition of there being at least one authorisation issued by one Member State for each vehicle.
This authorisation will stem from compliance with the 'EC' declaration and with the applicable technical specifications on interoperability.
Member States will consider as meeting the essential technical requirements those structural subsystems authorised to be placed into service in any other Member State and will not require any further authorisation, except where compatibility with infrastructure characteristics or limitations may be affected.
In our report, we wanted to structure the various aspects and sections of the directive in a way more easily understandable to those concerned, by devoting a specific chapter to the requirements for placing vehicles into service, depending on whether this involves first or second authorisations or vehicles meeting all the TSIs (Technical Specifications of Interoperability) or only some of these.
On all the aspects mentioned and throughout the whole procedure, we have remained in periodic contact with the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups, the Commission and also the Council Presidency.
We have finally been able to reach agreement, having resolved an important issue which was the maximum time limits for deciding on an authorisation, thus eradicating the well-known and paralysing administrative silence due to a lack of decision.
Following a great deal of effort, we have agreed that authorisation will be automatic in the absence of a decision and we have also agreed on the rest of the articles.
On behalf of this Parliament, we have therefore tabled a joint amendment, signed by all the parliamentary groups, which contains the same text that will be presented to the Council of Transport Ministers.
I hope that the fact of having reached agreement at first reading will be beneficial to the whole sector.
I want to end by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for their help and cooperation in achieving this objective.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Group, I would like to thank both rapporteurs very warmly for their good and constructive cooperation.
I think we always succeeded in finding common ground on matters of substance, we were able to reach agreement very quickly and I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs for the way in which they managed to reach a deal so swiftly with the Council.
After all, what benefit would a protracted dispute with the Council have brought?
We could have lost a whole year!
No, in my view, in spite of everything, we have managed to make progress on this matter at first reading and that is a great triumph for the House, the Commission and the Council.
I would just like to focus on two or three points, and I am sure, Commissioner, you will pass this on to the European Railway Agency.
We are giving the Agency greater responsibility for the setting of safety standards and interoperability criteria.
I hope that the Agency will utilise these opportunities in the interests of our industry, that it will set new standards quickly, and that it will operate in an efficient and practical manner.
As a passing comment, I also hope - and here I turn to Mr Costa if only he could hear me, he is on the phone, and phone calls are always more important - I hope that as more tasks are taken on by the European Railway Agency, the less the national agencies will have to get involved, and the less the national agencies have to do, the less bureaucracy there will be.
If the bureaucracy works properly at European level, we will not need 25 national authorities.
We want to save the European rail industry unnecessary overlap and duplication of work.
I have a final comment for the Commissioner and the two rapporteurs: it is very important that we have reached an agreement.
If the Member States miss their deadlines to decide on mutual recognition, then they are assumed to have given their authorisation.
It is only through this authorisation function that we can exert the kind of pressure on national authorities that is needed to prevent them from constantly dragging their feet.
Together, then, let us ensure that we save costs through cross-acceptance of locomotives and rolling stock, thereby increasing availability and giving further impetus to European rail freight in particular.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, I must admit that I am torn today because my Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero, having appeared before this House, is now attending a reception at the Council.
However, I have decided to remain here to listen to you and hopefully therefore to reinforce to some degree the Europeanisation of rail transport.
I am delighted at the truth and the opportunity that have been presented to the European people by the Commission through an exercise which is really better law-making, involving the recasting of a series of old directives in order to produce a single text and make substantial progress in favour of the railways.
In this respect, I congratulate Mr Ortuondo once again on his dedication and his almost punctilious tenacity in developing such a good legislative text.
I must admit that I am also delighted at the excellent cooperation that there has been between all the groups in order to make progress on such an important issue as interoperability.
I must also say that the best possible balance between safety and the need to advance courageously towards interoperability has been achieved.
Safety is also absolutely guaranteed by the two reports produced by Mr Costa, also with great dedication.
The Agency is improved and strengthened and its tasks and needs are also better defined.
We also hope to be able to develop these more harmoniously in the future.
European citizens must not therefore be afraid as rail safety has been Europeanised and therefore strengthened.
The work on interoperability urgently needed to be completed as we must first Europeanise rail transport and then improve convenience and logistics, bearing in mind that we also now have a new text on dedicated routes that will make interoperability even more essential.
As Mr Costa has said, progress needed to be made in terms of realising the ambitions of the legislator, in other words Parliament and the Council, with regard to allowing trains to circulate freely.
I believe we have managed to create the conditions to minimise the ever-present legal uncertainty which was why all the issues of mutual recognition of authorisations for rolling stock and locomotives constantly kept running into barriers and obstacles.
I believe that we have even made clear who, how and when these must be recognised.
We have even given a bit of a push, through the progress made on administrative silence ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate may certainly seem quite technical to our fellow citizens.
It certainly is technical, although the harmonisation of rail safety and interoperability rules constitutes one of their major concerns as they go about their daily lives.
I recall, for instance, the terrible accident a few months ago in Zoufftgen, between Luxembourg and France, which shocked us all.
If we wish to find a solution to the challenges ahead, particularly climate change, if we wish to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and bring about the modal shift, in other words reduce road freight services in favour of other means of transport causing less pollution, we must remove some of the present technical barriers.
To create a genuine European rail space, we must either harmonise Technical Specifications of Interoperability or introduce mutual recognition of standards.
The current procedures for national approvals of rolling stock are too long and costly.
We must facilitate administrative procedures, reduce time-limits and do all we can to harmonise national safety regulations, which sometimes lead to major traffic restrictions for no good reason.
I wish, of course, to offer my warmest thanks to our rapporteurs, Paolo Costa and Josu Ortuondo Larrea, for their splendid work, especially since this seems to satisfy all our political groups and it would seem, I hope, that we are heading for an agreement with the Council at first reading.
I wish to make three quick observations.
First of all, as all my colleagues have said, I am pleased we have achieved greater readability.
The provisions in relation to authorisation will be grouped within a single legislative document, the Interoperability Directive, for both the trans-European high-speed rail system and the conventional system.
Second observation: I am also extremely glad that a number of principles, rather technical a priori but nevertheless very important in this case, have been adopted in relation to approval; particularly cross-acceptance of rolling stock except in the event of specific characteristics of the local network, the obligation for the national authorities to demonstrate the actual safety risks, and the role of the Agency in the compilation and classification of national rules for clarification purposes.
Here I also feel it is important that the Agency avail itself of expert advice from network managers.
I am also pleased with the principle of implicit authorisation in the absence of a decision by national authorities within three months but, on the time-limits laid down for holding the keeper responsible, I wish to state a clear reservation because I fear this could remove responsibility from the rail company.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in amending the Directive on safety of the Community's railways, it is important to support efforts aimed at creating a common market for rail transport services.
That is why a common framework for regulating railway safety must be established.
The Commission should be authorised to adjust and adopt common safety measures and common safety targets.
It should also be authorised to introduce a single certification system.
To that end, existing requirements should first be checked, together with current safety conditions in Member States so as to establish whether the current safety level of the railway system has not been eroded in any Member State.
Priority areas where safety needs to be improved further should be identified too.
A safety certificate should constitute an assurance that the railway undertaking has put in place a safety management system covering the provision of transport services on the European network.
Items of rolling stock authorised to be placed into service in a given Member State must be covered by this authorisation in other Member States, if indeed the latter require such authorisation.
The directive in question states that whenever rolling stock is authorised to enter into service a legal entity responsible for its maintenance must be appointed.
That is very important.
The entity in question could be a railway undertaking, a sub-contractor or the owner of the rolling stock.
This measure responds to the expectations of the market in services.
The initiative before us will ensure that rail transport becomes more competitive and will allow jobs in the sector to be saved.
Amendments to this directive have been eagerly awaited, especially in the new Member States.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, with these three reports, the convergence of the European rail network will take a massive step forward.
Safety standards will be harmonised and monitored in future by the European Railway Agency.
Mutual recognition of railway vehicles within the EU Member States, which is long overdue, will be ensured.
That being the case, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, for without this good cooperation, we would not have achieved this result.
The difficult times are finally over.
In order to be able to operate a locomotive which was licensed in another Member State, it often took three years and could cost up to EUR 10 million.
This was provocative and to the detriment of environmentally friendly rail transport long before the EU had 27 Members.
In future, the authorisation of a railway vehicle will apply in all 27 Member States of the EU unless, within three months, a Member State raises an objection and justifies why the operation of the vehicle is not possible on safety grounds.
Its operation cannot be prevented for trivial reasons such as the colour of a fire extinguisher or the size of the wing mirror.
The burden of proof will thus be reversed.
In the past, manufacturers had to carry out a great deal of painstaking work to demonstrate that there were no grounds for concern, but in future, a good case must be presented for any safety concerns, and it is the European Railway Agency - whose powers will be enlarged - which will decide whether these concerns are justified.
If the three-month deadline passes without any objections, the authorisation applies to the EU's entire rail network.
This means that railway vehicles can be manufactured in greater numbers and at lower cost.
Germany's Federal Railway Administration, in particular, resisted the curtailment of its powers to the very end.
It is thanks to the persistence of all the groups in this House that a viable compromise has been reached and that Josu Ortuondo Larrea's report can now be adopted by consensus at first reading by the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, following the rejoicing over the unanimous support for these three reports by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to wind up the discussion with two critical observations: the European Railway Agency can fulfil the useful task of further developing and applying the new European Rail Traffic Management System and reducing its dependence on manufacturers.
But the Agency is especially needed in other areas due to the increasingly large scale of operations, liberalisation and competition on the tracks.
These developments necessitate more and more bureaucracy to make it possible to coordinate everything properly.
Long before the creation of the European Union, that coordination happened differently.
There were good agreements between national railway companies, which organised train connections together over long distances, together with the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits.
I doubt whether the new model is an improvement.
From now on, any railway vehicle which is approved in principle in one Member State will automatically be accepted in other Member States.
Such a situation does not even exist yet on a small scale between town tram companies; this is because the sharpness of the bends, the location of stops and sometimes the distance between two tracks mean that some trams cannot travel every route.
I expect too that the railway companies will frequently appeal for possible exceptions on the basis of security.
In practice, therefore, very little will change.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the Commission's Interoperability Directive admits that it is about enabling 'citizens of the Union ... to benefit to the full from the advantages deriving from the establishing of an area without ... frontiers.'
This vision is a burden to the UK because many of the EU population buy only one-way tickets.
I am pleased that isolated, narrow-gauged and preserved railways will be exempt.
But what about secondary rail routes?
Presumably, all this extra paperwork allows Luxembourgers, Latvians and Lithuanians to line up and run services from Long Eaton to Letchworth.
I know it is mainly about freight trains, 'non-stop from Lisbon to Liverpool without changing locomotives or train crews', says the briefing.
Some hope!
What will the crew say about the Working Time Directive?
Also, it will be stopped and checked for illegal immigrants west of Folkestone.
Current Portuguese locos would come off the track before the Channel Tunnel, as the rails in France are too narrow.
This train will stop.
The triumph of blind ideology over commonsense makes this place into the paper mill that the UK has come to despise.
Have a nice day, Mr President, but first cure the tunnel vision.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, with a view to achieving interoperable railway networks and ensuring a high level of sustainable mobility for our citizens, as well as efficient connections between EU regions, we should undoubtedly welcome the simplification of the current regulatory framework sought by the Costa and Ortuondo Larrea reports.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank both colleagues for their excellent work, especially given the strategic importance of interoperability, the indispensable need for safety and the need to establish the European Railway Agency with an extended mandate.
It is undoubtedly a good idea too, for the reasons given, to improve the technical part of the regulatory framework and promote the cross-acceptance of rolling stock.
The new procedure will thus be based on the principle of mutual cross-acceptance of authorisations already granted by a Member State, for which the necessary additional certification will be little more than a pro forma.
This is all very well, then, but all rolling stock absolutely has to be in decent condition: not only rolling stock which moves from one country to another, but also that which travels on local networks.
Railway users in Italy suffer obvious discrimination, since the most obsolete and often defective rolling stock is used on Italy's local network, at least by comparison with standards in many other EU countries.
If the Commission could investigate further, it would ascertain huge differences in the service provided.
As I have pointed out on previous occasions, the Italian railways provide an altogether unsatisfactory service, especially as regards local transport.
For this reason among others, I believe that the responsibilities of railway companies and owners should be more clearly defined with respect to safety, and also as concerns compliance with social standards and standards of service to users.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I firstly want to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work on the various reports which represent another step towards the integration of the European railways.
We are faced with the challenge of developing a competitive, profitable, sustainable and safe European railway system, in other words a true alternative to other modes of transport, thus enabling a modal shift.
However, the European railway system currently still suffers from many problems which have not yet been solved.
We can travel by train from Madrid to Berlin but, unfortunately, this journey, in a Europe in which we do have a single currency and an internal market, would be a real epic as we lack an integrated rail system.
The differences in track width between certain countries, the lack of standardisation and technological harmonisation of rolling stock and signalling systems, the disparities in training and certification of locomotive drivers and the insuperable difference in voltages supplying the tracks all make rail transport less competitive and work against the very reason why trans-European transport networks were planned, in other words to achieve a truly internal market in transport thus enabling more European construction.
Please allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to raise with you and the Commissioner, albeit briefly, the well-known and serious problem that is threatening the connection between the Iberian Peninsula and the European rail network, particularly in the Mediterranean area.
This is not just a Spanish or French issue, it is a European issue.
Commissioner, if the work on this line is not speeded up, we will not, in the medium term, be able to overcome the almost insuperable orographical obstacle of the Pyrenees.
In this respect, I want to call on the European Commission and the Commissioner to urge the Spanish and French Governments to solve this problem with a view to achieving a truly European rail system.
I know that things are difficult at the moment in Spain because a minister is being questioned and the government is a lame duck, but there will soon be another government and, with this, a new hope.
I truly hope that this problem, which is neither Spanish nor French but European, can be successfully overcome.
(PL) Mr President, the conditions under which the economy operates are constantly changing.
As a result, ongoing changes in many sectors are required, and we are today concerned with changes in the operation of railways, and in particular with the safety of their operation.
Accordingly, the relevant provisions need to be systematically brought into line with the current situation.
Many changes have taken place recently.
These include the enlargement of the Schengen Area to admit a number of countries whose railway systems vary considerably where technical conditions are concerned.
In addition, railway monopolies have been done away with in many countries and undertakings owning the network have arisen, along with regional and international transport undertakings.
This all calls for tightening up of the definitions and principles of procedure related to ensuring security on the territory of the Union.
The situation will largely be resolved by amending national provisions to take account of developments.
The proposals contained in the report by Mr Costa represent added value in this regard.
Mr Costa has proposed changes aimed at simplification, such as transferring Article 14 of Annex VII to the directive on interoperability.
This will significantly improve the readability of the directive.
Establishing clearer responsibility for safety is fundamental.
I should like to thank Mr Costa for all the work he has done preparing the report.
(FR) Mr President, in relation to this apparently technical issue of interoperability of the European railway system and the role of the European Railway Agency in terms of safety, we find ourselves at the heart of a genuine choice between civilisations.
Either the EU implements a European railway market based on competition of 'everyone against everyone else' and the dismembering of national railway companies in the vague hope of retaining the proper safety levels - this is what the Commission's proposals mean - or we make arrangements for cooperation between all the Member State rail companies to implement a network throughout the EU to transport passengers and freight at high speed in all safety.
The latter could be achieved by developing the Railteam alliance, bringing together the main European high-speed operators.
We should note that European railway history has already made a decision between the two systems.
Great Britain implemented the choices that the Commission is now proposing on its own rail network ten years ago.
The result: a general deterioration in the service, and a deterioration in safety leading to fatal accidents.
On the other hand, ten years ago Thalys was set up on the basis of cooperation between the SNCF and the SNCB, despite opposition by the Commission.
The result: an efficient, safe, quality service in response to passengers' needs.
On the strength of this historical experience, I wish to ask the Commission to abandon its choice of railway competition in favour of cooperation.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has much to offer to help all of us make our lives and our economies better.
Unfortunately, almost all these good intentions have names which are difficult to pronounce.
This applies especially to one of the priorities in today's railway package.
Interoperability is the magic word which describes what we want and what we must achieve if we are genuinely to have a functioning railway system in Europe.
Locomotives and other rolling stock must be aligned with each other, but for that, we need authorisation procedures which are interlinked.
The Commission has presented a relevant proposal which we have developed further in Parliament in a consensus between all the political families.
We hope that, along with the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and other things, this will help us achieve a better-coordinated rail system for a single Europe.
Our system is based on the concept and principle of mutual recognition and technical harmonisation, sets clear deadlines and criteria for authorisations, and requires - and this is very important - that, in the event of an application for authorisation being rejected, the national safety authority must prove that there is a risk to safety, not the other way around.
What we want, and what we hope to achieve, is that many of the tasks which have been transferred to the European Railway Agency in this context will be carried out by that Agency as quickly and purposefully as possible.
My hope is that, as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski has said, during and at the end of the process, there will be less bureaucracy here in our single Europe than is currently the case.
We are confident that our proposals can secure broad consensus in the House at the vote, so that the tangible outcome will indeed be more interoperability.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Ortuondo Larrea and Mr Costa, for their splendid work within a very short space of time on a rather technical issue.
Concerning the proposal to recast the rail interoperability directives, I see that an agreement at first reading is within reach.
This has been achieved as a result of several working sessions and I wish to congratulate Mr Ortuondo Larrea in particular for his personal undertaking to see this proposal through.
It was important to establish a precise detailed procedure for certifying locomotives and other railway vehicles in relation to possible action by national safety authorities, and to simultaneously impose a ceiling on the maximum time-limit for the certification procedure, as Mr Jarzembowski said.
The result of the negotiations to which the Commission has made a technical contribution is an amendment which completely remodels the text of the directive, and with which the Commission agrees entirely.
Thus, Mr President, if this agreement is confirmed, we will be sending out a firm political signal to industry and the national safety authorities.
It is now up to the national safety authorities to make the approval procedures for railway vehicles less expensive and more rapid.
We will also be adopting this legislation in record time, showing that European laws can move at the same speed as the TGV.
I wish to reply to Chairman Costa in relation to the national safety authorities.
These were created in response to the 2004 Railway Safety Directive.
For most of the Member States, this meant creating a new authority from scratch, with all the budget and recruitment difficulties this entailed.
It would be a rather difficult task, Mr Chairman, to take away a function from these authorities which has only just been allocated to them, and this would also cast doubts on the credibility of our railway policy.
I agree with you, however.
In the long term, we can imagine that one day there will be more extensive Europeanisation of this device.
I wished to give you a reply on that point.
I now come to the issue of safety, where you acted as rapporteur.
As you wished, a portion of these directives has been transferred to the new interoperability directive.
With the exception of compliance with the new comitology decision through the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the only remaining major component of this proposal is the issue of railway vehicle maintenance and the role of vehicle keepers.
More than half the amendments tabled are acceptable to the Commission as they are in principle or in part.
However, I must mention the situation of Amendment 21.
On this rather technical issue, any amendments envisaged must comply with the legislation already in force, particularly the Safety Directive, but also the Technical Specification of Interoperability for wagons that entered into force on 31 January 2007 and the decision on the national vehicle register that entered into force on 9 November 2007.
These amendments must also be line, as far as possible, with the various situations that may be encountered in practice.
They must bear a close relationship to the practices in force in other modes of transport.
They must not enshrine in legislation a contractual commercial model that may evolve along with the reform of the railway system.
That is why Amendment 21 does not meet with the approval of the Commission.
The same is true, Mr President, with Amendments 3 to 7, 10, 14, 17 and 22, essentially for purely technical or judicial reasons.
I want to finish with some remarks on the proposed amendment to the Regulation establishing the European Railway Agency.
Since the new functions assigned to the European Railway Agency basically depend on the interoperability and safety directives and the driver certification directive, the text should not pose any major problems.
In relation to Amendment 4, where you want the Agency to act as the national authorities' certifier, I am pleased that a reasonable compromise has been found in relation to Mr Ortuondo Larrea's report.
In the long term, the Agency could take on that responsibility, but at the present time experts agree that this kind of reorganisation would be premature.
The potential models for cooperation between the European Railway Agency and national safety authorities must be examined.
The Commission has undertaken to assess the impact of all these options to allow the best decision to be taken by 2015.
The other amendments are acceptable as they are, either in part or in principle, with the exception of three.
Firstly, Amendment 5 grants the Agency a mediation role in problems with the issue of safety certificates. We do not agree with this amendment for the reasons already stated.
Secondly, we do not accept Amendment 6 for reasons of coherence with the corresponding article in the Railway Safety Directive.
Finally, we do not accept Amendment 8, since this would bring the Agency in as an adviser on commercial projects, whereas this task corresponds to a Community body.
I have listened carefully to all the speeches today.
I feel that in the main the European Parliament has properly gauged the value of these provisions which are set to truly Europeanise our railways.
I do not intend to answer all the questions posed.
I simply wish to state that we have allocated 85% of funds for railway projects to the trans-European networks.
I wish to tell Mr de Grandes Pascual that we have not neglected mountain routes, particularly the Pyrenees.
I also wish to say that, whatever approach is taken to the railway system, we must nevertheless admit that, if we want trains to make a comeback in Europe, we must make a genuine effort to Europeanise the system through technical interoperability and harmonised safety regulations.
Mr President, the year 2007 will be a key year for rail transport.
As of 1 January national and international freight transport has been open to competition.
We are seeing that the revitalisation process in this sector is beginning to bear fruit.
The railways' market share, following a decline since 1970 in most of the Member States, has now stabilised and is in fact growing.
The legislative proposals you are discussing here today will help railway companies compete with road traffic.
I am therefore extremely pleased with the agreement on the interoperability directive, and the Commission will do all it can to bring about a rapid agreement on the other two aspects of these measures.
Mr President, please allow me to express my most sincere gratitude to all the Members who made a sustained effort on such a technical item. I feel this has helped us to make much more rapid progress since, had we been compelled to contemplate a second reading, we would have lost one precious year.
Thus I feel that 2007 will be a good year for rail transport, and this also makes it a good year for the fight against global warming, in which we know rail transport may be particularly useful.
The debate is closed.
Since two trains cannot pull onto the same station platform simultaneously, we shall vote on the Costa report tomorrow and the Ortuondo Larrea report on Tuesday 11 December in Strasbourg.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The Commission's proposal to improve legislation in the field of interoperability is welcomed, taking into consideration the need to improve the rail transport system in the European Union.
National procedures for the certification of locomotives and rolling stock, as well as those for certification of locomotive engineers, are very different, actually preventing the free movement of trains on the Union's territory.
It is extremely important for the regulations on interoperability to be extended to the entire Community railway network.
TENs are already designed on the principle of interoperability and, therefore, investments should focus on the normal railways and on all categories of rolling stock, in order to make them reach the European common standards in the future.
Interoperability is a requirement, but there are also regions of the European area where no railways compatible with high-speed trains can be built: mountain regions, isolated regions in general, railways going through tunnels and viaducts.
I believe the lawmaker should issue specific provisions because, on the one hand, we cannot deprive these regions of the benefits of rail transport and, on the other hand, we cannot ignore the conditions for the safety of passengers, trains and infrastructures themselves.
in writing. - (RO) The national railway safety rules imposed by the Member States are essential for the railway systems to meet safety requirements and for their interoperability.
Upon putting into operation any rolling stock, a legal entity in charge with its maintenance shall be appointed.
I believe technical specifications should indicate the basic parameters and the technical characteristics required for the maintenance of components, subassemblies or assemblies incorporated or designed to be incorporated in a railway subsystem.
Speed restrictions are imposed on 66% of the Romanian railways due to the condition of the railway infrastructure, and 77% of the rolling stock is worn out.
Romania has to invest in the development of railway transport.
I consider it extremely important for Romania and Bulgaria to be rapidly connected to the system of high-speed rail transport.
Rail transport safety is essential.
The first set of projects regarding the common safety objectives for railways, which aims at improving performances in the field of railway system safety in the Member States, will be adopted by the Commission by 30 April 2009 and the second set of projects, by 30 April 2011.
I ask the European Commission to support the new Member States in accessing the available Community instruments to develop transport infrastructure.
Coordination of certain of the Member States' provisions on television broadcasting (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (10076/6/2007 - C6-0352/2007 - (Rapporteur: Mrs Hieronymi).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing a pre-negotiated common position of Parliament and the Council on the revision of the Directive concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities.
We can view this as a great success for Parliament, the Council and the Commission, so I would like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to my parliamentary colleagues from all political groups and from all the committees involved, especially the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Culture and Education, Henri Weber, Ignasi Guardans CambÃ³ and Helga TrÃŒpel.
They have done much to make it possible for us to present a success, a joint result, today.
My thanks also go to Commissioner Reding - Commissioner of the Year 2007, congratulations! - who tabled the proposal for the revision of the Directive with great resolution and willingness to cooperate, in equal measure, and worked on it with us.
I would also like to thank the Council, specifically the German Presidency, under whose leadership it proved possible to achieve the common position, and the current Portuguese Presidency, which stalwartly defended the common position achieved, thereby enabling us to debate it today and vote on it tomorrow.
'Television without frontiers' is crucial for freedom of information and pluralism of the media in Europe.
We therefore greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to update this Directive just in time.
On the basis of the country of origin principle, we have achieved joint objectives for traditional and new forms of television, regardless of platform.
For traditional TV, this mainly encompasses the right to short-term reporting Europe-wide, safeguards on better access for the disabled, better controls on advertising aimed at children, and independent national media supervision.
However, we have also improved the financial bases for commercial broadcasting, not by increasing advertising - that still stands at a maximum of 12 minutes per hour - but by introducing more flexible rules.
We have taken the difficult step of allowing product placement so that private TV broadcasters, in competition with Google and other rivals, will be able to offer free-to-air TV services in future.
It was the European Parliament which worked to achieve adequate transparency directives here.
For modern TV on the Internet, the principle which will apply after tomorrow's decision and its ensuing implementation at national level is that TV will remain an economic and cultural product regardless of the technology used.
That is the European model which we have safeguarded with this Directive for audiovisual media services, as it will be known in future.
TV on the internet and mobile TV should also have a future in Europe, not only as an economic product but also as a core guarantee of freedom of information and media pluralism.
That is why it is so important to have initiated this modernised Directive just in time.
'Just in time' means that the forthcoming negotiations on the telecoms package, which have now begun, as well as the deliberations on online content can take place against the backdrop of this clarified legal framework for traditional and new audiovisual media services.
That is why I would ask you for your support in tomorrow's vote so that we secure a broad majority in favour of progress in our European media policy.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, it is always a great satisfaction for a mother to see the child she brought into the world grow up into an intelligent lively teenager.
This is how I feel this evening about our audiovisual media services 'without frontiers' directive, a feeling of satisfaction and pride I wish to share with the child's godmother, our excellent rapporteur Ruth Hieronymi.
There are many ways of testing a child's intelligence.
Mrs Hieronymi has listed them: a scope adapted to future audiovisual means, since it has been broadened to audiovisual media on demand such as VOD (video on demand); reaffirmation of the principle of the country of establishment, and thus consolidation of freedom of movement of programmes, adding in an intelligent cooperation and dialogue procedure to prevent or settle any potential conflict; a balance between respect for consumers and additional freedom for our businesses; enhancement of the right to information with the new rules on access to short extracts of key events.
All these new features, and more, I feel go to prove an intelligent balance between renewal and respect for values.
As testimony to the child's vitality, I wish to point to promotion of cultural diversity in the digital field, acknowledgement of new advertising techniques, a legal framework finally provided for product placement, attention finally paid to access to audiovisual media for our fellow citizens with visual or hearing disabilities, and the trust placed in the industry by arrangements to apply the directive using self-regulation or co-regulation.
Parliament played a major role in bringing the child to adolescence, and I wish to express my gratitude.
This is another example of splendid cooperation between the three institutions which have successfully completed legislation that will form an essential basis for the industry and the culture of tomorrow.
It is now time for the child to leave the nest and spread its wings as an adult.
In the case of a Community directive, this means transposition by the Member States.
In keeping with EU policy, I do hope this stage does not make the child obese. It would be all the more paradoxical as, in the new directive, we call on industry to draw up codes of good conduct on advertising aimed at children that leads to obesity.
Therefore I hope that, as far as possible, the Member States will refrain from adding national obligations to the detriment of their audiovisual industry.
I am absolutely sure that the text to be submitted for your approval tomorrow will provide genuine legal security in the industry, and will also promote our values of society and culture.
With this legal framework, the EU is moving ahead of legislation on other continents.
I think we can be proud of it.
We are also helping our industries in terms of creation.
We are making a contribution to the best possible financing scheme for our films and to access for Europeans to premium content schedules on free television networks: so it is this evening that, with you and thanks to you, I have the feeling that our mission has been accomplished.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SV) Mr President, first of all let me congratulate and thank our rapporteur for her work on this matter, as also the Commissioner.
This is a question on which there are many different and very strong views, yet we have produced a proposal which we are discussing here this evening and which points the way forward for European television.
There are a few things that I think are important to emphasise.
Among other things, we establish the principle of country of origin legislation, which means a better and stronger basis for diversity but also for common European television and - an important point - better conditions for a European film industry, since that is a closely related issue.
It also means better scope for free media to exist across Europe's borders.
Of course certain things could have been even better.
I myself thought it would have been good if we had had greater openness on the matter of advertising time, but more flexibility is created here.
I think that the proposal which has now come back on the matter of product placement also amounts to an improvement.
We therefore have reason to be satisfied with the progress which has been made.
Let me just say one thing regarding the future, since this legislation is based extensively on the existence of a difference between what are called linear and non-linear media services.
I think that the difference will play less and less of a role in future.
It is already apparent now that this difference is not so great or so relevant.
I think that it will be important to follow developments in this field, so that we do not end up with a situation in which traditional TV media in Europe are in a less favourable position than those which broadcast in non-linear ways, via the Internet or by other means, because in the long term that can damage our chances in the global context.
Once again I would like to thank the rapporteur and to note that we have taken a step forward.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by quoting my colleague Henri Weber.
This text is an acceptable compromise for the Socialist Group and, during the negotiations, we succeeded in adding some valuable provisions to preserve the European audiovisual model.
I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, for her determination, patience and also a particularly open and positive spirit of compromise.
Certain issues in relation to the digital revolution within the context of the knowledge economy made this review necessary.
The rules have been extended, in an appropriate manner, to the new audiovisual services.
Protection of minors is guaranteed, as is the protection of EU citizens from incitement to all discrimination.
These new services shall contribute to the financing of films and the European audiovisual component.
A percentage of their turnover will be paid into support accounts, and there will be guaranteed exposure of European productions in on-line catalogues.
Pluralism in the media has now become an official requirement.
The role of the regulatory authorities has been enhanced, and the adoption of provisions in relation to accessibility for all is recommended most strongly to the Member States.
In terms of advertising, the Socialist Group wanted to retain the rules of the current Directive.
With advertising limited to 20% per hour, the duration between two advertising screens is now 30 minutes, whereas we wanted to retain 45 minutes for European screens.
We are nonetheless satisfied that product advertising is banned during documentaries, information broadcasts and children's programmes.
The Member States may, however, choose to allow this kind of advertising for films, television fiction and sports broadcasts.
In this case there are strict regulations for product placement in order to prevent abuse and certain perverse effects.
A balance has therefore been found between freedom of expression, circulation of information, public access to new services such as VOD (video on demand), and content with a cultural and economic value.
The emphasis on quality will allow European production to strengthen its position.
This is one of the major effects of the directive.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I feel we have reached the end of a very long journey. It has taken us a long time and has involved the efforts of many people, many Members and many experts, even people who followed this debate very closely outside the House because it was so important to them.
We should all feel very pleased with ourselves because tomorrow, barring any surprises, the text arising from all these negotiations and debates will be unanimously adopted, perhaps even without a vote, the real test that such a text may be adopted almost by acclaim.
The time has therefore come to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi and the other shadow rapporteurs, but especially Mrs Hieronymi and, I must say, the Commissioner as well.
She says she feels the mission has been accomplished.
She is right.
She really can feel that way today.
This means we will be adopting a very clear legal framework with clear rules that will make investment in audiovisual means more secure and certain. The rules will be extendable to new digital media and to new means linked to new media, with all the essential features required for consumer protection and protection of minors, without simultaneously overlapping or simply amplifying the existing provisions, for the means are new and the legal responses must also be new.
The new rules certainly make advertising more flexible.
We are aware of this.
We debated them and we gave them our support.
By and large it was my Group that worked hardest to ensure this text finally came through, because we have not denaturalised the European audiovisual model.
We never actually went that far, but we know - and we ought to say this out loud because we also supported product placement, and we did it in all conscience - that if we want free television for viewers, although this is never free, but it is for the viewers, and if we do not want this kind of free television to be paid for only through taxation and public finance, there must be means of finance within a framework of competition.
This, then, is the context in which we have authorised product placement. We have made it transparent and we have made it very clear how and when it ought to be implemented.
It is now time to make arrangements for implementation.
Here I would ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities again.
It is true that the child has flown the nest, but not completely.
Implementation must be monitored very closely, and in particular, Commissioner, something must be done in relation to one aspect where I have serious concerns.
I think there is a general feeling in certain Member States that there are now no regulations for European television between now and the time of implementation.
There are no laws any more, we might say.
This, however, is not true.
The Television Without Frontiers Directive, which is still valid, laid down advertising rules, and the rules set out what could be done and what could not be done.
There is a general feeling that, until the new regulation, until the new directive is applied in the Member States, the rules already in force are not applicable.
Here it is your responsibility and that of the Commission to make it clear that this perception is incorrect, and this is not the way in which the situation ought to be viewed.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the amendments to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities aim to ensure that recipients of audiovisual media services in Member States can take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market by implementing the principles of regulation according to country of origin.
Amendment of the Directive will bring the European Union's provisions into line with the most recent technological advances.
The European Commission's proposal distinguishes between linear services, namely transmission through traditional television, internet or mobile television that delivers material to the viewer constantly pursuant to an ongoing programme, and non-linear services similar to television downloaded from the network on demand.
Retaining the so-called Television Without Frontiers Directive in its current form would aggravate the unjustified differences in the regulatory treatment of different methods of distributing similar or identical media content.
The current provisions regarding television should remain in force for linear services.
For non-linear services, however, minimal essential provisions should be established. These could, for instance, concern the protection of minors, a ban on incitement to racial hatred, and a ban on surreptitious advertising.
This is all provided for in the proposed changes.
The Union of the Europe of the Nations Group will therefore vote in favour of the proposal.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in our renewed deliberations on the new version of the Directive concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, henceforth to be known as the 'Audiovisual Media Services Directive', we have constantly conducted a cultural policy debate as well, concerning cultural diversity and maintaining quality in TV broadcasting.
With Parliament's final decision, the legislative process is really just starting, so we are already looking ahead.
I urge the Member States to make use of the subsidiarity principle enshrined in the Directive and fully exploit the scope for more cultural and media diversity.
This applies especially to more rights for independent producers, the contribution of non-linear services such as video-on-demand providers in support of European productions, and limiting the scope for product placement.
Public broadcasting in Europe, in particular, should do without product placement.
Throughout the work on the new version of the Directive, we had a dispute over matters of fundamental principle.
This focused on how much market liberalisation we want and where, precisely, we intend to regulate.
From the Greens' perspective, this dispute has been resolved in favour of more market-oriented liberalisation, especially advertising.
Our Group will therefore not support the new version of the Directive in tomorrow's vote.
The numerous new opportunities for even more advertising - whether in sports programmes, series or feature films - will result in a loss of quality in Europe's media.
Public broadcasting will therefore play an even more important role in future, and national legislators must enable it to fulfil its mandate to inform and educate as comprehensively as possible, also via new media such as mobile or Internet TV.
That is why, also when dealing with the new version of the Telecommunications Directive, we need to establish an appropriate framework at European level, if broadcasting is in future to be received to a greater extent via mobile phones or the Internet.
(DE) Mr President, the compromise which Ruth Hieronymi - of course with help from her colleagues - has devised here is one which I can wholeheartedly support.
I really would like to thank her very warmly; this was a very difficult piece of work and she has done a marvellous job.
In my view, the compromise covers most of what we wanted to achieve at first reading.
As we know, the rapid pace of technological development had rendered the old Directive obsolete.
I myself worked on this first Directive.
We now have something new: new transmission opportunities, new services 'on demand' alongside traditional TV, so we need this new directive.
For me, it was important in this context to uphold the country of origin principle and maintain short-term reporting.
More flexible regulations on advertising have been introduced, but I believe that maintaining a maximum of 12 minutes per hour is the right thing to do.
As before, cinematographic works and news programmes will not be interrupted.
One sticking point, as you know, Commissioner, was product placement.
Many of us voted for the present compromise with a heavy heart.
What is positive, however, is that the ban comes first, followed by the exemptions which have already been mentioned here.
I think that if these are correctly applied, we will not have any American-style conditions.
The restriction on advertising in children's programmes is also something which I welcome.
This compromise enables the audiovisual sector to face up to the major changes taking place and adapt to technological and market conditions.
The compromise helps the audiovisual sector to become more competitive in future.
This compromise is, at the moment, the best balance between media pluralism and cultural diversity, and offers the opportunity to develop a more competitive European audiovisual industry.
Once again, may I express my warm thanks to the Commissioner but especially our colleague Ruth Hieronymi.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I can only agree with what has just been said: in fact, thanks to the assistance of the institutions and the commitment of our rapporteur and her colleagues, we have produced a directive which is set to take our audiovisual industry into the future with due respect for our values and our cultures.
It is a considerable step forward for the European audiovisual industry, and I can only rejoice in this along with all the speakers who have said so.
A question was asked: what will happen between now and actual implementation of the new directive?
I am able to reassure the Member on this point.
We will continue to apply the rules of the Television Without Frontiers Directive.
In fact, I have just initiated infringement proceedings against Spain for exceeding advertising time.
The same will apply to all Member States who do not play by the rules: until we have new rules, the old rules are still the rule.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) I wish to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi and Mr Guardans for their splendid dialogue with the Members and for the quality of the reports that they drew up with the Council which have led to the presentation of this extremely consensual report at second reading.
The Council has accepted a large number of Parliament's requests and all the requests of my political group.
I am pleased that two items particularly dear to my heart were included in the text: the country of origin principle and the protection of children in relation to advertising messages.
Parliament has shown that it was able to conduct negotiations with the Council, with these having produced a much more elaborate text than before.
It was not an easy task, but we have achieved our aim.
I now hope that transposition into national law will be facilitated by goodwill among our governments.
in writing. - (HU) The new regulation for borderless television has had uneven success.
It is pleasing that we are creating legal bases for digital and non-linear television.
It is already the eleventh hour, due to the rapid development of technology.
I feel it is very important that the public service television stations that broadcast the values of the Community should make use of the opportunities provided by the new technologies.
If public service broadcasters cannot keep pace with commercial channels with regard to technological quality, then it is to be feared that they will lose the viewers they have had up to now, and their cultural, public-life and other quality programmes will not reach younger generations.
The final version thoroughly softens the rules on advertising.
It is particularly annoying that we have not managed to ban the crafty increase of volume in advertising either, even though our electorate throughout Europe deplores this practice.
It is also saddening that even children's programmes can be interrupted by adverts.
The product placement regulation is a sober compromise.
The legislation does not bring about many of the objectives of the European Parliament, but if it were not created the lack of regulation would presumably be even more problematic.
in writing. - (RO) I welcome the Council's common position, which brings some significant changes regarding the protection of children and minors, the access of disabled persons to audiovisual services and the placing of advertising products.
Spot announcements for alcohol and tobacco are perceived by young people as a way of being socially accepted among adults and these vices are correlated with physical attraction, fun, adventure and recreation.
Moreover, intensive advertising, especially addressed to children, for food products and beverages with a content high in fats and sugar undermines the positive initiatives for public health protection, such as nutrition education and correct labeling of products.
The European Union is dealing with an obesity crisis and television aggravates this problem.
In Spain, 48% of the advertising during children programmes is for sweets, fast-food products and crisps, and in Great Britain, food products high in fats and sugar represent 80 and 90% of the TV advertising.
The Council's text lays an emphasis on the development of codes of conduct related to "junk foodâ advertising to children, as well as on introducing filter systems and PIN codes that will increase the protection of minors from the negative influence of audiovisual services and will play an important role in the fight against obesity.
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Mr President, the European Parliament recently adopted a wise resolution on relations with one of its neighbouring states.
I would like to quote you some actual lines.
Please listen carefully and free from any fear: 'whereas the' Russian 'public is not sufficiently informed about the extent of the crimes committed in the' Second World War, 'most notably in' Finland, the Baltic States, KatyÅ and the KÃ¶nigsberg region; Parliament 'believes that the citizens of' Russia 'are entitled to be told the truth about the ... policies of war and genocide committed in their name and to have knowledge of the perpetrators of war crimes'; Parliament 'believes that' Russia 'must honestly confront its' Soviet 'past in order to progress and that coming to terms with the past is an integral part of the road to reconciliation with' Russia's 'neighbours'.
It was, indeed, addressed by our Parliament - to Serbia, which appreciated our suggestions, but, as this House does not exercise double standards, the same forms of encouragement are to be used in our documents regarding Russia.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the situation of European Roma, in connection with our opinion, which was adopted at the last plenary session.
I feel it is essential that the European Commission and the Parliament should work side by side and take responsibility for this minority, assuming a much more emphatic role than they have done up to now, and preparing, implementing and monitoring programmes aimed at the inclusion of social groups that have been excluded and marginalised.
As part of this, it would be very important for the Members of the European Parliament work side by side with the Commissioners who are directly or indirectly responsible for minorities, their integration and their inclusion and, as a specialist group, jointly to prepare a comprehensive, cross-border Roma strategy with effective monitoring, which would provide an opportunity for those who live in the most deprived areas and for the groups in the most disadvantaged situations to have access to the Union's development programmes.
In order to do this, a joint European crisis map must be drawn up, through which it would be easier to assess the areas afflicted by abject poverty.
Two years ago, the European People's Party were the first in this Parliament to adopt a Roma strategy.
I would like the other parties to join this.
I feel it would be very important for us to appear together, side by side, at the Roma hearing on 14 February and to act for this minority.
It is very important that something should happen.
Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, eyewitnesses are reporting a speeding incident which almost defies belief, involving Harald RÃžmer, the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, at around 3 p.m. on 14 November this year, apparently in a Luxembourg-registered CD vehicle which was travelling from the European Parliament into the centre of Strasbourg.
Sparrows were crushed beneath his wheels as he roared along the AllÃ©e de la Robertsau, blasting past slow-moving vehicles in traffic queues at speeds of more than 100 km/hour and forcing startled pedestrians to leap to safety off the zebra crossing.
I therefore have a few questions to ask Mr RÃžmer: were you indeed travelling in this vehicle at the time?
Who was at the wheel?
What instructions had you - or had you not - given to the driver?
Why was the vehicle in question being driven in such a reckless manner, and why was the speed limit exceeded so dramatically?
Do you think that traffic regulations do not apply to you?
Would you not say that as the European Parliament's most senior official, you should be showing special consideration to others and keeping within the limits of traffic law?
Is this how you intend to behave in future, and should all road-users run in fear from you?
(RO) Last Sunday, Romanians elected their representatives in the European Parliament for the first time.
Romania joins the European tradition of direct elections to the Parliament, which started in 1979.
The election in Romania has showed us that we have a big responsibility to the Romanian citizens, to whom we have to speak more about the European Union and explain the benefits and rigors of the family we belong to.
Although Romania is the second country in favour of the European Union, the turn-out to this election was relatively low - 29.4%.
Nevertheless, the election was a resounding success for the European people's trend.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in Romania are now almost three times more numerous in this forum, and, following our victory, the PPE-DE weight in the European Parliament has increased by almost 4%.
I thank Romanians for their trust and I thank you for the positive messages you sent to the Romanian voters.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sand in the Kosovo hourglass is trickling down relentlessly, and 10 December is almost upon us.
Unfortunately the dialogue of the deaf continues between an extremely autonomous Kosovo inside Serbia's borders and supervised independence.
The legislative elections of 18 November only increased political aspirations, with the victory of the independence supporters in a ballot marked by a record abstention.
The EU must therefore come up with a strategy other than independence, thereby affirming a European foreign policy.
The very word independence is a trap, a synonym of chaos for our Europe.
By accepting this process we are opening up a Pandora's box with all the nationalisms, regionalisms and localisms this implies on our own territory.
In a globalised world, independence is an illusion.
A call must be made to all parties to build a regional community with peaceful exchanges which duly respect democratic principles.
Supporting partition and independence will simply reinforce nationalisms.
Let us remember the words of President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand to Parliament: nationalism is war, and war is not only the past, but can also be our future.
Mr President, it is highly likely that Ireland will be the only European country to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
I myself am pro-EU and have voted 'yes' in all Treaty referendums.
However, I have a problem, and I am asking the Council to solve it.
We need a consolidated version of the Treaty before we ask our citizens to make an informed choice.
To illustrate my point, just look at page 51 of the Treaty, a section entitled 'Non-discrimination and citizenship', one which any citizen might want to read and assess.
Point 32 states, 'Article 17 shall be replaced by the text of Article 12.'
Point 33 states, 'An Article 17a shall be inserted, with the wording of Article 13; in paragraph 2, the words "when the Council adoptsâ shall be replaced by "the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may adopt the basic principlesâ and the words at the end of the paragraph "it shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251â shall be deleted.'
Mr President, I do not need to read any more: I think the point is well made.
(RO) Mr. President, I am glad to see you today, three days after an extremely important moment for Romania.
In compliance with the Treaty of Accession to the European Union, this Sunday, six months after the initially established term, Romania organized elections to the European Parliament.
Thus, the citizens of Romania, European citizens, were able to directly elect those who represent them in the most democratic institution of the European Union.
Even if the turn-out to the election was within the European average, that is not very high, I have the conviction that, due to the involvement of our new colleagues in Romania, Romanian citizens will become ever more aware of the impact the European Parliament's activity has on their day-to-day life.
The fact that extremist parties did not obtain the required number of votes to enter the European Parliament shows that Romanian citizens have already proved European maturity and responsibility.
On this occasion, I would like to congratulate all those who were appointed by the citizens of Romania to represent them in the European Parliament and I hope to cooperate for the well-being of Romanians, irrespective of their membership in different political families.
(PL) Mr President, Polish fishermen demonstrated in front of the European Commission's headquarters in Brussels yesterday.
They were protesting against the unfair and discriminatory action taken by the Commission against the Polish fishing industry.
The problem relates to the ban on fishing for cod in the Baltic Sea.
Cod is the main source of income for Polish fishermen.
The fishing ban was imposed by the Commission as a punishment for exceeding the annual quota for cod catches.
In addition, the Commission has threatened that Poland may not be allocated a fishing quota at all for 2008, or that its quota will be reduced.
That would certainly bankrupt the Polish fishing industry.
The quotas allocated are very restrictive and are based on incomplete and distorted data concerning stocks of cod in the Baltic.
Against this background, the question arises as to why Poland was the only country subjected to control, when my country called for detailed control of fishing in all countries.
German, Swedish and Danish fishermen are also exceeding the quotas.
Are Polish fishermen to become Commissioner Borg's sacrificial lamb?
Alternatively, is this perhaps an effort to eliminate competition by recourse to the European Commission?
The Union has evidently failed to take the notion of equality on board, and I therefore support the protest.
(PL) Mr President, I call for us to take up the cause of an Egyptian woman, Shadia Nagui Ibrahim.
This woman was sentenced to three years' imprisonment because, when she married, she allegedly stated untruthfully that she was a Christian.
In fact, she stated the truth, because she is a Christian.
She belongs to the Coptic Church and was unaware of the fact that her father, also a Coptic Christian, had converted to Islam for a time, and then returned to the Coptic faith.
Under Egyptian law, Shadia Nagui Ibrahim is a Muslim, because her father was once a Muslim.
A person's faith cannot be determined by the position of national or legal authorities.
It is a matter of personal conviction.
If Egypt wishes to be deemed a civilised country, it must amend its intolerant anti-Christian legislation.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to address myself to the Commissioner regarding the misguided use of the Structural Funds, which regrettably is a growing phenomenon in the European Union.
What has happened in Hungary concerning the LEADER programme is quite shocking.
The LEADER Local Action Groups (LAGs) which are supposed to bring together local authorities and municipalities in order to use and develop the LEADER programme on Hungarian soil have been made up solely of authorities belonging to one political party, namely the national government party, to the exclusion of local authorities run by non-governmental parties.
This is an absolute scandal, and I think the European Commission must take action against the Hungarian Government, perhaps by opening infringement proceedings, because the Structural Funds are not being used properly. Local people are losing out purely because their authority does not see eye to eye with the government.
(EL) Mr President, the Annapolis Conference on the Middle East ended with mixed results for the European Union.
In recent months, both Commissioner Waldner and the High Representative Mr Solana have reassured us in plenary that the European Union is playing an active role in forging Middle East policy.
On reading President Bush's speech today, however, I see no sign of this.
On the contrary, I read that the parties agree to create a mechanism to implement the roadmap plan, which is to be controlled by the USA.
The forthcoming peace treaty will also be implemented on the basis of the roadmap, with the USA as the final arbiter.
Where, then, is the European Union?
What message of hope can we give for the future, when we are mere spectators of events?
(LT) Mr President, last Saturday in Russia - in Moscow and St Petersburg - peaceful and entirely lawful attempts by Russian citizens to demonstrate their disapproval of the policy pursued by today's Russian Government were brutally suppressed.
The leader of the opposition group The Other Russia, Gary Kasparov, the leaders of the Union of Right Forces, Nikita Belych and Boris Nemtsov, and other followers have experienced violence and were detained by the Militsya.
Gary Kasparov was even sentenced to five days in prison.
This incident is further proof of the fact that in Russia people have no freedom of expression and are living in constant danger, with members of the opposition constantly fearing for their families' safety.
Mr President, I am absolutely certain that we, the European Parliament, are in no position to remain silent in view of these events.
We cannot apply different standards of morality, democracy and human rights to Burma and Pakistan while applying other, lower standards, to Russia.
Mr President, I urge you to take action with a view to defending the rights of freedom of speech and assembly in Russia.
It does not matter in which country people are fighting for freedom - they are fighting for our freedom too.
Therefore, wherever a free person is being kept in chains...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you very much, Mrs AndrikienÄ.
Unfortunately, we cannot devote any more time to this item on the agenda.
Mr President, on a point of order, some of us have been waiting here since 7 p.m. - the time now is 9.40 p.m. - just to get a chance to speak in the one-minute speeches.
Now you cut it down to less than 15 minutes.
It is not fair for the MEPs who have been waiting here all evening.
We should, perhaps, have been warned earlier on so that we would not have had to wait so many hours.
I can understand your annoyance.
I only took the Chair two minutes ago.
I have been informed, however, that unfortunately we have very little time left.
We have to close our debates at midnight, and still have many items on our agenda to deal with.
I am very sorry about this.
Control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Kallenbach, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons - C6-0081/2006 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firearms are not an ordinary type of product like any other.
A series of tragic events - in Erfurt, Antwerp, Helsinki and elsewhere - have vividly demonstrated the potential danger that firearms pose to the safety of our citizens, especially children.
We therefore need very strict rules governing the manufacture, sale and possession of firearms.
Although our European legislation expressly permits Member States to go beyond the common level of protection afforded by EU law, I am most grateful that Parliament has sought to substantially improve the levels of safety applicable in Europe in respect of firearms.
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs Kallenbach, and the Chairman of that Committee, Mrs McCarthy.
My express thanks are due to both of them for their excellent cooperation.
May I remind you of the background to today's decision.
The starting point was the need to make various amendments to our legislation to enable us to ratify the UN Firearms Protocol.
A comprehensive revision of Europe's firearms legislation was not planned until after that.
Thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, we have done all of this in one major step, at the first attempt, in fact, as the Council has also given its blessing to the unified proposal before us today.
Solutions had to be found to a number of difficult issues and today's outcome stands up to scrutiny.
We are not encroaching on the different traditions and cultural specificities in our Member States, where there are long and highly disparate traditions relating to hunting, sports marksmanship and weapons collecting.
These have been respected.
A European Firearms Pass will make cross-border travel easier and provide a sound basis for transnational meetings of hunters and sports marksmen in future.
We have also opted for appropriate marking and registration of firearms to allow cross-border transfer and transport of firearms in the internal market, but making this more transparent and therefore safer.
An important innovation is the registration of all weapons in personal ownership.
We need to know who has what.
Registration will enable us to curb the illegal ownership or transfer of firearms to an even greater extent.
Data will be kept for 20 years, so that traceability is guaranteed for a long enough period.
That is certainly to be welcomed.
In this context, however, the Commission is considering clarifying, in a declaration, our understanding of the new Recital 9e of the Data Protection Directive.
We have also decided to ban the acquisition of firearms by minors under the age of 18 in future.
Europe is thus sending out a clear message that firearms are not something that young people should have access to.
Of course, we will still allow junior sports marksmen and hunters under the age of 18 to pursue their hobby but only under adult supervision; that means parents or coaches, for example.
There have been far too many tragedies involving firearms that have fallen into the hands of young people.
I hope that the new rules will help to avoid further tragedies of this kind and raise awareness, especially among junior sports marksmen and hunters, of the need for particular care when handling weapons.
We have been confronted with one new problem arising as a result of technological developments and criminal activities in Europe: I am referring to the conversion of copy weapons, which in themselves are not dangerous, into fully operational guns.
This is a problem which was first drawn to our attention by Mrs McCarthy. This has allowed de facto circumvention of the law.
That will now be stopped.
Let me say in passing that we will have to look more closely at the problem of conversion of copy weapons over the next two years in order to close any safety loopholes.
The same applies to the question of how we ensure that firearms are deactivated effectively.
As you know, the Commission was in favour of building sanctions into European legislation, as the European Court of Justice's rulings are clear on this point.
The Commission recognises, however, that Recital 8 includes a reference to these sanctions under criminal law and the UN Protocol.
That is important, as compliance with Article 5 of the UN Protocol requires sanctions to be applied by Member States.
I am confident that this is something that the Member States are envisaging in their national law.
A Commission declaration on this issue will also be submitted to the European Parliament's Secretariat.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Alvaro for his support here.
Europe will thus have modern firearms legislation that prioritises the safety of citizens and takes account of the need to protect our children and young people.
We are thus increasing the level of protection afforded by Community law.
It is now up to the Member States to recognise the sign of the times and, taking account of national conditions, to develop these provisions further on an individual basis.
This means that any Member State which considers that more stringent provisions are necessary and appropriate will have my personal support, and I can only encourage these Member States to take such action.
I am relying on your colleagues in the national parliaments to make a clear decision when it comes to the issue of firearms.
The watchword must always be 'safety first'.
Today's decision will clear the way for that, and I would like to thank you for your support in this endeavour.
Commission declarations appended to debate
1) Declaration on Sanctions
'The Commission welcomes the rapid adoption of the Council Directive amending Directive 91/477 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons, but regrets that the Council opposed its initial proposal regarding Article 16 on criminal sanctions.
The Commission notes that the Community has competence to establish criminal sanctions in conformity with Article 5 of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.
Accordingly, the Commission considers that any decision to ratify the Protocol would have to be accompanied by a declaration of competence that correctly reflects the scope of the Community competence.
The Commission reserves its institutional rights in this regard.'
2) Draft declaration on data protection
'The Commission notes that the processing of personal data under this Directive is subject to compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and cannot prejudice the level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under the provisions of Community and national law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set forth in Directive 95/46/EC.
In this respect, the necessity to prolong the minimum period during which the registers containing information on the owners of weapons are kept from ten to twenty years should be justified.
The Commission is convinced that such processing of personal data is justified in view both of the dangerous nature and longevity of such weapons and of their possible misuse for criminal purposes, which therefore requires the proper tracing of both firearms and their owners.
The Commission further notes that, in view of the purposes of this Directive, and in accordance with the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC, access to the centralised data filing system, or the system guaranteeing access to non-centralised filing systems, should only be available to police and judicial authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences.'
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a very protracted process is nearing what I hope will be a successful conclusion.
Let me start, then, by expressing my warm thanks to everyone who has made a valuable contribution to this process: the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr PodestÃ , Mr Lehtinen and Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, the Committee Chairman Arlene McCarthy, and the secretariat responsible, the staff of the rapporteurs for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Alvaro, and others who supported the process, the Council Presidency, represented by AntÃ³nio Delicado and his colleagues and last but not least, the Commission, represented by Mr Michel Ayral and his colleagues, who were motivated by their Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, to find a common solution.
I have learned a great deal throughout this process.
I have learned about the true role that lobbyists can play: some of them contributed constructively to achieving common solutions, whereas others deliberately set out to obstruct the process with half-truths and misinformation.
From the outset, it was obvious to me that it is no simple matter to strike the right balance between the requirements of a well-functioning internal market, the justified safety concerns of citizens about the illegal use of firearms and the understandable desire of hunters and sports marksmen to pursue their hobbies largely unhindered.
As Mr Verheugen has said, we wanted to utilise the experience gained with the application of Directive 91/477/EEC, remove some of the shortcomings identified, and transpose the UN Firearms Protocol, which was signed by the Commission back in 2002, into Community law.
We were therefore obliged to include specific articles to cover the illegal use, trade and acquisition of firearms.
This compromise takes account of these requirements.
I admit that I would have preferred even more clear-cut provisions here and there, for example in order to achieve better legislation or to simplify matters, and indeed to reduce the number of firearms categories to two on a Europe-wide basis, as is already the case in two-thirds of the Member States.
However, I was unable to secure majorities here.
Overall, however, I am very satisfied with the compromise achieved.
Let us consider for a moment: we will thus be implementing a partially harmonised firearms law in 27 Member States.
We still have very disparate firearms laws in place at national level, and this partial harmonisation will facilitate legal trade and make a contribution to greater safety.
A 100% guarantee that there will be no abuse is impossible, but as we have already heard, we should recognise that we have an obligation to try, as far as possible, to prevent tragedies such as those which occurred in Germany, Finland or Belgium.
I do not intend to focus on the details of the new legislation now; you are familiar with them already and Mr Verheugen has already mentioned a number of them.
I welcome the fact that, by 2014, we will have a computer-based firearms register in the Member States; this will improve information exchange and do much to facilitate traceability in the event of abuse, and may even make traceability possible in the first place.
We take the Internet age into account as well, as the provisions will apply to online purchases just as they do to face-to-face trade.
May I conclude by making a number of points which should make your decision easier and counter the arguments of those who oppose better European firearms legislation.
The directive will not apply to weapons and ammunition collectors, to public services or to cultural and historical institutions.
The provisions will not apply retroactively.
We are proposing national firearms registers, not a European register.
Although we do have a register of that kind for cows, it seems to be more difficult to achieve in relation to firearms.
Nor are we opposed on principle to manufacturers, dealers, sports marksmen or hunters who deal responsibly with firearms with full awareness of their special nature.
I have been told that, when the original Directive was debated in the 1990s, very serious concerns were expressed, and the discussions became very emotional.
Later, though, this Directive came to be regarded as very helpful, practical and effective.
In that sense, I am confident that the compromise before you will also be a success, and I count on your support.
Mr President, I do not think there is much to be added to what Mrs Kallenbach has just said, other than that it has been a pleasure for me to work alongside the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Arlene McCarthy, and my colleague on that Committee, Gisela Kallenbach, with whom I worked very closely with great confidence during this phase of the process.
Not least, I would also like to thank the Commission, represented in this case by Commissioner Verheugen.
Such close cooperation is a rare commodity.
What can you say in a minute when you have taken 30 seconds to thank people?
In essence, what we have achieved is this: the European Union has sent out a clear message that, when it regulates the legal firearms trade, it is equally concerned about tackling the illegal transfer and abuse of firearms.
We have made it clear that the European Union will not tolerate any form of crime involving firearms on its territory, that we will not tolerate people using weapons which they have not acquired through a legal process, and we will not tolerate a situation in which people abuse the rights they have acquired through the EU.
I say this to everyone who has today received countless e-mails, as I have, from hunters and sports marksmen accusing us in the European Union of restricting their freedoms: read the directive, contact the Commission and you will see that the European Union has taken action to protect its citizens, not the reverse!
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, and to the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for having made themselves constantly available for consultations, enabling us to achieve an innovative but, I must say, well-balanced compromise.
The purpose of the proposed amendment to the Directive is to adapt it to the UN Protocol on combating organised crime, as concerns the legal purchase and trade in firearms intended purely for civilian use.
The Directive covers issues to which everyone is sensitive, such as the safety of our citizens, but also sporting traditions and the customary lifestyles of millions of Europeans who go hunting.
Close consultations with the Council have enabled us to produce a text that strikes a fair balance between the desire to draw up harmonised rules and respect for individual countries' specific cultural practices, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity.
On the first point, I would emphasise the marking system for firearms and their essential parts, not least for purposes of ensuring their traceability, the obligation to retain data for no less than 20 years, more rigorous monitoring of online selling, given the risks this is known to entail, restrictions on the use of firearms by minors and by people thought likely to endanger public safety, and the introduction of general principles on the deactivation of firearms.
On the second point, I would recall that the present four-category classification has been preserved, out of respect for the already-mentioned cultural and traditional practices, with a reassessment of the advantages and drawbacks of perhaps cutting back to just two categories to be carried out by 2012.
However, the Council's lack of availability has meant that the European Firearms Pass will not be the only document required for the carriage of firearms, and in my opinion this is a missed opportunity.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur Mrs Kallenbach, to the other shadow rapporteurs, and to Mrs McCarthy, Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for seeing through this complicated legal package.
When almost two years ago we started this work, we were assured that this would above all be a technical measure, the sole purpose of which was to use the UN Firearms Protocol to enable it to become EU legislation.
The process, however, was anything but a technical one.
Some wanted to ban weapons completely and restrict people's legal enjoyment of them, whilst certain people did not want to see any kinds of controls on the purchase and use of weapons.
Under the leadership of our rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, however, we found a balanced compromise among the main groups, one which takes account of the safety of individuals and society as well as the needs of those who enjoy using weapons as a pastime and hunters too, for example.
It is a good thing that all weapons in the EU should be registered in order to make it easier to trace them and that Member States in future will have to keep the details of a weapon and its owner for a period of 20 years.
It is also important that imitation and converted weapons should be covered under the directive.
The lives of hunters and marksmen will be made a lot easier when the European Firearms Pass is the only document they need when travelling from one country to another, and there should be no fee charged for one.
The age limit of 18 years old which is stipulated in the directive and its exceptions is sensible, in my view.
It means, for example, that in my country, Finland, the thousands of registered underage hunters may continue to pursue their hobby with the permission of their parents, just as they have up until now.
It is directives such as these which prove their worth in the eyes of the public.
The EU's Four Freedoms will likewise gain strength when the EU is developed as a safe area of internal rights.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I too first of all would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kallenbach, for a very well drafted report.
It is important for everyone's future to prevent the illegal manufacture of, and the trade in, firearms.
The report will help achieve this objective.
We Finns have been concerned about whether or not young people should be allowed to continue to hunt for pleasure.
The sport is subject to licence in Finland and closely supervised, and there is guidance available from experienced hunters in the safe and responsible use of weapons.
I think it is important that this best practice and long tradition in Finland will also be able to continue after the new directive has been adopted.
It is important that tomorrow we agree a carefully prepared compromise, in which the different practices in the Member States are made compatible and the Member States can allow, subject to certain conditions, the purchase and possession of firearms for the purposes of hunting for under 18-year-olds too.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, it is very important to control possession of firearms if we wish to ensure the safety of people living in Europe.
Clearly, any relevant provisions must not unduly restrict the right of citizens to ensure their own security on their own property, nor must they restrict their right to ensure their personal safety when undertaking important public duties or after having done so.
In addition, citizens are entitled to possess weapons that are family heirlooms or are used in hunting or for sporting purposes.
This is all part of Europe's tradition.
All restrictions should relate to the psychological state of the individual and should also apply to people suspected of offences classed as crimes.
Furthermore, I believe such restrictions should apply to people who publicly advocate Fascism and radical Communism and to extremist Islamic activists.
Technology is currently available in Europe allowing anyone good with their hands to create an amateur firearm relatively quickly.
The implementation of undue restrictions will not therefore prevent the criminal fraternity from possessing firearms and will unduly restrict the rights of citizens, including their right to self-defence.
Our border controls must be strengthened still further, because illegal immigrants are still managing to enter Europe and weapons can be smuggled in even more easily.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, the proposed changes to the EU's weapons directive are aimed at improving the control of weapons.
There will be better labelling and more stringent requirements on trade in and the manufacture of weapons.
That is good, and it is especially good that the committee wants to tighten up these requirements even further.
This issue takes on particular importance, seen in the context of the tragic fatal shootings at Jokela School in Finland a few weeks ago.
The combination of drifting youngsters, the spread of a culture of violence on the Internet and access to weapons is unfortunately a lethal one.
That is why the tighter measures we now have to adopt are immensely important.
It is also good that this is a minimum requirements directive.
In other words Member States can go further and have more progressive legislation.
I would like all EU legislation to be on this basis.
That would solve many problems.
It looks as though we can reach agreement on first reading.
That is good because it enables us to save time and resources which can be devoted to something else, for example work to bring about a more peaceful and more child-friendly society.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, hunting is an old-established custom.
Every Member State has its unique hunting tradition to protect.
Today's debate therefore represents the conclusion to a long process.
Strong wills have opposed one another, many discussions have taken place and the shadow rapporteur has been barred from taking part in the tripartite meetings.
Many of the original proposals could have threatened the hunting cultures of Member States.
Regrettably, the European Firearms Pass did not suffice as the only document needed for the occasional use of hunting and marksmen's weapons in another Member State.
Freedom of movement is prevented by the fact that certain Member States are permitted to require additional documents.
Huntsmen and marksmen from the Community will be subject to greater bureaucracy than persons from third countries.
Fortunately fees for such permits have been prohibited.
In the course of the process, as shadow rapporteur, I tried to influence the final report on those occasions when I was permitted to participate in the meetings.
My work focused mainly on two questions.
I was concerned to prevent a ban on ordering weapons on the Internet and to forestall changes in the availability of exemptions for schools offering training in nature management and marksmanship.
In remote regions a ban on the purchase of weapons on the internet would prevent access to weapons for hunting purposes.
In Sweden today we have good regulations on internet purchases, which are accepted by both the hunting community and the authorities.
The second question was about the minimum age criteria, which would affect various types of upper secondary school programme.
In Sweden training in hunting performs an important function in teaching future generations about hunting and game conservation.
Now our hunting traditions can live on.
What had been an unwieldy bureaucratic proposal has now become an acceptable, though not ideal, compromise.
(DE) Mr President, Schengen and ever more brutal criminal gangs undoubtedly make it essential to adopt a tougher approach to the illegal possession of firearms and to organised crime.
However, the whole thing becomes a farce when innocent citizens, hunters and sports marksmen are, in effect, treated the same as criminals.
Instead, the overriding priority must be to increase numbers in our police forces, which have been cut back in recent years.
In the United Kingdom, crime statistics have soared since the total ban on handguns was introduced, and in my view, this should make us pause for thought.
In our increasingly unruly times, when the state is making savings in the security sphere, it must be permissible for innocent citizens who have all their mental faculties to ward off a threatened attack on life and limb if necessary.
The fact is that most crimes are not committed using legally acquired weapons.
The EU should perhaps focus to a greater extent on better protection of its borders, for example by increasing the resources available to FRONTEX, and on improving cooperation in the security sphere.
The EU countries have perfectly serviceable firearms legislation and if more stringent provisions are required or necessary, the relevant decisions should be taken in the countries concerned.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the starting point of this dossier and look at how far we have come, I think it is fair to say that we have managed to put this very controversial issue back on an objective footing.
In cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have found a solution which allows better controls on firearms throughout the European Union, without neglecting the justified interests of sports marksmen and hunters who are concerned about excessive bureaucracy and excessive registration requirements.
I am most grateful to Commissioner Verheugen but also to the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Arlene McCarthy, and of course our shadow rapporteur, who worked very hard on this dossier for many months with the rapporteur and the other colleagues concerned.
This was not a simple matter for the various groups involved, but I think we have achieved a compromise solution which - given the background in the Council - was the only possible route.
As far as the trade-related part is concerned, which is covered by the UN Protocol and which still lies ahead, the question is to what extent the Commission is capable of presenting a proposal which will meet with the general approval of Council and make Parliament's work rather more straightforward.
I am not being ironical, Commissioner: in all seriousness, I wish you every success in skilfully convincing your colleagues in the Council that the obligations they have undertaken under the UN Protocol must naturally apply in the EU as well.
I would therefore like to thank everyone who played a part in keeping the ball in play on this very controversial issue.
I think that a sound solution has been reached for all concerned on the basis of a compromise, and I hope that tomorrow we will be able to endorse this compromise with a broad majority.
Mr President, I am speaking as a concerned MEP, and not as committee chairwoman.
I believe that, with this new law on weapons, we can demonstrate to our citizens that Europe can act to tackle the problem of illegal guns.
We have tough laws in Britain, but without this EU law guns will continue to find their way onto the streets of cities like Manchester and Liverpool.
Colleagues, this is a 9 mm Smith & Wesson copy - a convertible weapon designed to fire blanks or CS gas pellets - which, when converted, fires live ammunition.
Do not panic - it is not loaded, it is convertible, not converted.
A gun like this tragically killed a 12-year-old Manchester girl, Kamilah Peniston.
Mothers Against Violence, mothers who have lost children to gun crime, ask me where these guns are coming from and what we are doing here to stop the illegal smuggling of these deadly weapons.
Greater Manchester Police tell me that 46% of all guns seized last year were converted weapons.
Converted weapons are now a cheap, popular choice for criminals, and they are a growing problem in Europe - not just in the UK.
Therefore, I thank Commissioner Verheugen, Ms Kallenbach our rapporteur, Mr Alvaro and 25 of the Member States for supporting my amendments to crack down and tighten controls on these convertible weapons.
Putting them under the same control system as real hand guns will make it much more difficult for criminal gangs to get their hands on them, and it will cut the smuggling of these weapons, which are banned in Britain.
The Association of Chief Police Officers in the UK fully supports this law and its requirements for convertible and deactivated weapons, for marking, for traceability and for controls on weapons' sales by distance communication, including the internet.
Following the recent tragic shooting in Finland and the attempted shooting at a school in Germany, it is clear that we need stricter EU-wide standards of gun control.
This is Europe being pragmatic and taking practical action to protect our citizens.
The tragic and senseless gun deaths of young people in my region - 15-year-old Jessie James, 11-year-old Rhys Jones and 12-year-old Kamilah Peniston - are a deeply sensitive issue.
Their lives were taken from them.
We, here in Europe, owe it to them and their families to ensure that we take these guns off the streets.
(ET) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
In today's society with all its dangers, all attempts to increase people's security are whole-heartedly welcomed.
Security is a prerequisite for all freedoms. Security is a basic quality of a democratic society.
Fresh in all our minds is the Jokela School massacre, which was not the first example of such an occurrence.
We must, however, ensure that it is the last.
According to World Health Organisation data, interpersonal violence and suicide rank respectively third and fourth worldwide among people aged 15-44 years as the leading causes of ill-health and premature mortality.
A large proportion of these occur through the use of firearms.
The easy availability of firearms has been associated with higher firearm mortality rates.
It is most welcome that the European Union understands the need to shift the focus to the specific threat.
I would like to go into one more aspect.
Specifically, since the transposition of the Directive in 1993, the internet has developed considerably and become an electronic market place.
The Directive's aim of stopping trade in firearms can only be achieved, therefore, if internet trading is included in its scope.
I am therefore of the view that the Member States of the European Union must react in an appropriate and consistent manner to the situation regarding the firearms in question.
To do so we need harmonised preventive and punitive measures and we need to integrate them into a single policy.
Finally, my thanks to the rapporteur and the people who worked with her.
(DE) Mr President, I would simply like to point out to Mrs McCarthy that firearms are banned from the House.
Mr President, with time to make only one point, I want to draw attention to the unequal way in which the European firearms pass operates in practice, particularly as it affects the hunting fraternity.
If the owner of a registered weapon wishes to go hunting in most other EU countries, he simply produces his Europass at his point of entry, but if he wants to enter the United Kingdom he must supply his original Europass in advance, and then wait six to eight weeks for it to be processed by the local police.
Thus he is without the pass for that time and cannot hunt in other third countries in the mean time.
There is no need for such bureaucracy, which is severely damaging the promotion of hunting holidays in the United Kingdom, including in my constituency of Northern Ireland.
Surely, even an advance photocopy of the Europass would serve the same purpose.
I trust, therefore, that, in due course, that anomaly will be addressed.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basis for the amendment of this Directive was the UN Protocol and the question of how we can tackle terrorism effectively.
That was also the basis for the Commission's proposal.
The rapporteur's proposal adopted a fairly revolutionary approach to the existing Directive.
If we look at what we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow, we see that it is a compromise which, as so often, does not completely satisfy all sides.
The compromise is this: on the one hand, we are trying to tackle everything that is illegal - and here, we are never rigorous enough - and on the other hand, we do not wish to overly complicate the use of legal firearms.
There are certainly some aspects, such as categories or registration, where tougher rules on the basis of subsidiarity would have been appropriate, but this was not a 100% success.
However, a start has been made and we will see how the exercise works out in practice, and how Member States tackle this issue.
I think that this is a viable compromise, and I know that everyone involved has worked very hard to achieve it, so I too would like to express my thanks.
In this context, however, I think we must constantly be mindful of the difference between legal and illegal firearms.
We have to tackle the issue of illegality in a rigorous and consistent manner, but we must apply a judicious approach and a lack of bureaucratic complexity as the appropriate benchmarks in the legal sphere.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the text we will be voting on tomorrow is a compromise which finally satisfies almost all legal gun users.
The Commission's original text was perfectly acceptable to us, as were the positions of the Council.
The rapporteur, unfortunately, adopted rather weird positions, and we had to put up quite a fight against her initial ideas.
I also wish to thank Mr Podesta for his truly carthorse work, his patience and his diplomacy within the PPE Group and at many working meetings.
The compromises we have produced satisfy all legal gun users.
I should say that French hunters are quite satisfied that the four categories have been maintained: this is an important issue in France, and I am very pleased this evening that we managed to retain them.
I am also pleased to say that I am satisfied with the central registration system, for it is also logical that we should be able to trace guns.
I feel this is a most important point for the safety of citizens.
Arms dealers are also satisfied with the CIP marking.
We are also satisfied with remote sales.
We are relatively satisfied with the text as a whole.
Having said that, I feel that the past year's work ought to make us reflect on the matter of the initial positions of the rapporteurs, and I must say we should be wary of adopting excessively inflexible positions on certain initial aspects.
In fact, if the Commission, the Council and the PPE Group had not firmly defended their positions, I believe we would have been steered towards a text that would have been impossible to apply, and towards green positions and an ideology to the great detriment of hunters and legal gun users.
(DE) Mr President, I just wanted to ask Mrs McCarthy whether the weapon she has with her is marked and registered and whether she has permission to bring it into the House.
Mr President, I have to answer that question because it just shows that Mr RÃŒbig does not understand the legislation in front of him.
Because it is not defined as a firearm, you do not need a permit: anybody off the street can buy it - a criminal can buy it.
So Mr RÃŒbig should get his facts right before he intervenes.
I rise, though, on a point of order, concerning an accusation made by Ms Goudin and I wish to correct the record of the Minutes.
No shadow has been excluded from this trialogue.
The IND/DEM Group was invited, it appointed a rapporteur 18 months ago, it did not turn up to any meetings in committee or to any hearings, and it did not turn up to any trialogues.
Ms Goudin knows very well that she was only appointed two weeks ago to take over from the shadow rapporteur, who did not turn up.
I will defend the work of our rapporteur, shadows and the committee because we take our issues seriously, we do a serious job and the IND/DEM Group should take its work seriously as well.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
A renewed EU tourism policy: towards a stronger partnership for European tourism (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on a renewed EU tourism policy: towards a stronger partnership for European tourism.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting, and that I had the pleasure of putting together with the cooperation of a number of colleagues, in fact follows on from a report already adopted by this House - the one by Mr QueirÃ³ - through which Parliament sought to make a contribution to European tourism policy.
The inspiration behind this report is the need to devise a different, and I hope more practical, approach to European Union policy on tourism, which is currently restricted by the provisions of the Treaty.
The Member States have not conferred much responsibility for tourism on the European institutions under the existing Treaty, and I must say that not even the treaty we are about to approve - and which I hope the Union will adopt next month in Lisbon - will increase the EU's formal powers over tourism to any great extent.
At the same time, however, the existing Treaties do enable the Union to implement a large number of policies which have a considerable impact on tourism and on the possibility of increasing it or maintaining Europe's competitiveness as a world leader.
The purpose of this report, therefore, is to set out various possibilities.
The list drawn up by us in this House, with everyone's assistance, is merely an indicative list, which I hope can be further expanded.
It is a list of opportunities for using the EU's full range of existing powers to benefit tourism.
Let me give just two examples: the tourist is a traveller, so by definition many of our transport policies can be seen, or re-read, in terms of and in favour of tourism; the tourist is a consumer, so many of the EU's consumer protection measures can be re-read in terms of tourist requirements.
More broadly, however, tourists - especially those arriving in Europe from third countries - are people who cross borders, just as other people cross borders for various reasons.
The European Union's visa policy, its immigration policy, should be carefully revised in order to be able to attract the maximum possible number of tourists.
Many of the contracts signed by tourists nowadays are concluded directly, using web-based technology, and do not afford them full protection.
The EU can thus do a lot for tourists by protecting such contracts or introducing types of contracts which do afford protection. I will spare you the details.
In sum, we all acknowledge that tourism is one of Europe's most promising industries, and I think we can say that - above all for reasons of cohesion - it is worth standing by our main aim of developing the tourist economy; this means making the most of resources such as cultural and environmental resources, which can be done by utilising the Union's formal powers to the full.
The intention behind this report is therefore to encourage the Commission and the Council to envisage a set of initiatives belonging formally to other fields of competence - I repeat, consumer protection, transport safety, guarantees for certain tourism-related contracts, immigration policy, coordinated promotion campaigns beyond Europe's borders, and so on - to put together a set of initiatives, a package of tourism initiatives.
I firmly believe that these could constitute a real contribution by the European institutions to preserving and developing a sector that, as we all know, plays a major part and will play an ever greater part in the future of the European Union.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Committee Chairman, Mr Costa, on his report.
The report makes clear the great extent to which tourism is influenced by different Community policies, but above all, it shows how important this sector is for Europe as a whole.
Tourism is an expression of Europe's lifestyle and prosperity but it is also a key economic sector with substantial potential for growth and employment.
In fact, tourism already accounts directly and indirectly for more than 10% of gross domestic product in the European Union and provides around 12% of jobs.
However, it is not just Europe that is seeking to benefit from the extraordinary economic prospects afforded by the development of tourism.
We have to equip ourselves with the capacities that will enable us to flourish in competition with other traditional and new tourism markets.
Here, Europe can build on the competitive advantages which already make it a highly attractive destination.
We have an unparalleled heritage, a unique geographical concentration of attractive and culturally diverse sites, and we rightly have a reputation for a high level of service.
These are trump cards that we must play as we seek to develop Europe as a tourism product in future.
Quite simply, our destinations must be the best and the most attractive, forming an offer that makes Europeans and non-Europeans want to spend their holidays here, again and again.
This means that the criteria which have to be met in other sectors of our economy have to be met in tourism as well: we need European tourism to be a product that is innovative and provides an optimum choice for consumers, that meets the highest quality standards and that is as environmentally friendly as possible.
In short, it must be a product which is an expression of our European values and strengths.
Let me give you some examples of how we are promoting cooperation and keeping this competitive edge in the tourism sector.
Last month, we had the European Tourism Forum in Portugal, an annual event bringing together all actors in this sector, and it is an excellent opportunity for cooperation and for showcasing Europe.
On that occasion, I had the honour of presenting the 'European Destination of Excellence' award to 10 European destinations nominated as the Best Emerging European Rural Destinations of Excellence.
This pilot project is helping to raise the profile of all Europe's destinations outside Europe and draw attention to the diversity and quality of tourism in Europe.
I would like to remind everyone that this type of project was explicitly called for in Parliament's previous report initiated by Mr QueirÃ³.
I would like to thank the European Parliament and Mr Costa in particular for the generous support given to this successful initiative.
I am pleased to say that far more countries are now participating in the second round of the competition.
We can also tell you at this stage that the web portal for 'destination Europe' has been a success and provides a sound basis with potential for expansion.
We are currently exploring other ways of improving Europe's image as a tourist destination and are hoping for your support here.
In conclusion, let me emphasise that increasing sustainability in tourism is a key aspect of our policy.
I am convinced that if we integrate sustainability aspects into all areas of our tourism industry, this will enable us to protect those competitive advantages which already make Europe the world's most attractive tourist destination.
The Commission unveiled its new 'Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism' last month.
The components of that 'Agenda' constitute a response to the calls set out in this and the previous report from Parliament.
I think that here too, we can look forward to continued good cooperation in future.
It is my hope that the 'Agenda' will be adopted by all tourism industry stakeholders and, indeed, by tourists themselves, and given that all of us in this Chamber are frequent travellers, that includes us as well.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the tourism sector is particularly significant.
Directly and indirectly, it generates more than 10% of the GDP of the European Union and employs roughly 12% of the workforce.
Although this does not fall within the competence of the European Union, there are a number of measures and actions which may contribute to an upward trend in the sector and its sustainable development.
Many of these are already mentioned in the report, and at this point I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
The challenges facing tourism call for a coherent policy response at EU level: a comprehensive and competitive framework for action, with specific quantitative and qualitative targets.
In the new planning period, and given the targets which have been set under the revised Lisbon strategy, cooperation and synergy are necessary at all levels - European, national, regional and local - to enable the tourism sector to contribute to achieving these targets.
It is also necessary to coordinate the policies and actions which have direct or indirect impact on the tourism sector.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that on the question of what kind of tourism sector we want in the European Union, we have already given our answer.
We want a viable sector which will develop according to the principles of sustainability, will offer high-quality tourist products and services, and will not exclude anyone.
If we all act together, at all levels, we can now achieve this aim.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism is extremely important to the EU.
It certainly has major effects on economic growth and job creation in Europe.
Beyond these aspects, it also encourages integration, dialogue between different peoples and knowledge of each other's cultures, and thus helps in the development of a sense of European citizenship.
Consequently, in the absence of a common tourism policy, issues in this industry, which covers several areas and involves a wide range of services and professions, must be taken into account at European level.
The report submitted to us today brings this need to light.
I must therefore congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, and more specifically for supporting some of the priorities stated by the Committee on Culture and Education.
Europe's diversity and richness mean that it is still the world's most popular tourist destination.
We must rethink our policies and update them to take more account of culture in order to retain this position.
Likewise, we must highlight the need to preserve Europe's natural and cultural heritage and promote traditional culture, in particular popular and artistic crafts, trades and skills which are in the process of disappearing, and encourage initiatives to enhance and promote this heritage.
In this context, among other measures we must support the creation of a European Cultural Heritage label, which I feel sure will increase our fellow citizens' sense of belonging to a common cultural space and identity.
It is also essential to encourage development of new technology which plays such a major role in selling tourist products, promoting cultural commodities and events, and managing and conserving sites, and will continue to do so.
Finally, in association with all tourism players at all levels, we must promote sustainable and high-quality tourism which is competitive, environmentally-friendly, responsible, and above all accessible to everyone.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, it is rightly stated in the report under discussion - and I must here congratulate the rapporteur - that the tourism sector is at the crosswords of numerous European Union policies and has a substantial impact on growth and employment and also on social and territorial cohesion.
It is therefore essential to realise certain aspects of tourism policy, following the definition of the guiding principles in Parliament's resolution of 8 September 2005 for which I was the rapporteur.
The first aspect concerns simplifying and harmonising the tourist visa application procedures for entry into the Member States, with a view to reducing their costs and facilitating access to the European Union for tourists from third countries.
