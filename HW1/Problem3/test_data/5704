My view is: something happened, which is now being investigated, but I would urge you to keep a sense of perspective.
, Mr President, thank you for reminding us that in fact the title of the item on the agenda that we are examining is hooliganism.
Two months ago, I addressed Parliament regarding the need to take action against the crimes that hooligans would undoubtedly commit during Euro 2000.
The measures taken by the Belgian authorities served to limit the clearly racist, xenophobic and homophobic violence of the hooligans.
It is therefore becoming imperative to consider measures to deal with the instigators of such violent crimes, who are often manipulated by extremist right-wing movements.
It is still too easy for hooligans to move around with complete impunity within the countries of the European Union.
Instant sanctions must be taken in the countries where they commit crimes.
Those who are identified and on file as having committed assault must be banned from entering stadiums during major sporting events.
Supporters' clubs and football clubs must be made to take greater responsibility, as it must be said that they sometimes fan the flames.
The campaign by the French Minister for Youth Affairs and Sport, Mrs Marie-Georges Buffet made them take greater responsibility and this action has borne fruit.
I therefore believe that Parliament can provide a real impetus for the Member States and the UEFA to implement such measures immediately, as the red card, Mr President, must admittedly be applied on the pitch, but must also be applied with regard to hooligans, both in and outside the stadium.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, needless to say, all forms of violence should be denounced, including the outrageous expressions of hooliganism during Euro 2000.
Despite this, I am still convinced that the reprehensible incidents were blown out of all proportion, partly by the press and partly by politicians.
Because of this, we have been unable to emphasise sufficiently how extraordinarily well-organised Euro 2000 was, indeed the standard of organisation will turn Euro 2000 into an unforgettable experience for millions of people.
As representative of one of the host nations, I would like to congratulate everyone who was involved on the organisational side and in the enforcement of law and order.
The success of Euro 2000 has shown that small nations are capable of great things and this should not be overshadowed by the wanton behaviour of a minority.
All Member States should, in consultation with each other, take appropriate measures.
Not only was Euro 2000 a superb festival of football, it was also a festival of solidarity among the citizens of the European Union, whom it brought closer together.
Mr President, on Monday, the Liberal Group voted against including this item on the agenda and if I now consider the resolution, I believe we were right to do so.
Extending congratulations in a resolution is very civilised, of course, but hardly the task of this Parliament.
The issue of hooligans cannot be termed urgent because this phenomenon has been around for years. I believe that, nevertheless, Parliament should look into this, but not as a matter of urgency.
I would now like to say a few words on the events which unfolded in Rotterdam.
Naturally, an investigation is necessary because the accusations are very serious.
If a television team was locked up all night, then this needs to be investigated thoroughly and there had better be a very good reason as to why this was done.
This inquiry is under way.
The Dutch Public Prosecutor is involved in this matter and so it is completely premature on the part of this Parliament to pass a verdict on the incident at this stage.
In my opinion, this is a long way off, and it is inappropriate to pass political judgement at a time when a Public Prosecutor is looking into a matter.
Consequently, I believe that the amendments pertaining to this matter should be rejected.
We could, of course, come back to them once it has become clear that human rights were violated, but I do think that passing such a verdict would be overstepping the mark at this stage.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to turn to Mr Heaton-Harris who, about a month ago now, thought that the sporting event at Charleroi would have to be cancelled: there would, he claimed, be terrible trouble.
I would say to him, very sportingly, as he was once a referee, that I was right to blow the whistle on him then.
Secondly, I believe that we should look at this matter in depth and that if, as the resolution indicates, we could achieve greater cooperation between the various Member States during an event such as Euro 2000, progress would be made.
If, in future, we could manage to prevent repeat offenders from attending other events, and if, finally, as Mr FodÃ© Sylla indicated earlier, we were able to monitor a subject such as that in order to develop new teaching on behaviour in stadiums, then sport, and not political concern, would win through.
I will end, Mr President, by hoping that the content and pace of my speech have been as you requested, that is, on a human scale.
Iraq
Mr President, the United Nations has been emasculated by two members of the Security Council on the issue of sanctions on Iraq.
Kofi Annan is a good and honourable man.
However, he should resign in the knowledge that the world is utterly opposed to the disproportionate severity of these sanctions.
The EU must speak out against sanctions which amount to virtual genocide.
The alleged purpose of the sanctions is to get rid of Saddam Hussein.
He is still there ten years later.
In fact, the real purpose of the sanctions is to control oil and provide a training ground for US and British pilots so they can ensure the survival of the military-industrial complexes in both the US and Britain.
On my recent visit to Iraq I saw children die of respiratory infections, diarrhoea, leukaemia, gastro-enteritis and malnutrition.
We must remember that this is a country that has the second largest oil reserve in the world.
Operating theatres have raw sewage dripping in, and out-of-date equipment.
We are witnessing the slow strangulation of a wonderful nation and a wonderful people.
I am a friend of Islam and I think we should stop, in this European Union and the European Parliament, demonising the Arabs and demonising Islam.
Mr President, we had originally submitted a text on the same subject and with the same purport, but this text gives a far more balanced view than the text of the so-called joint resolution.
I would have far preferred discussing a text which strikes more of a balance.
Why is it then that this text has not been published? We have withdrawn our signatures after all.
In our opinion, the text we submitted originally would have formed a much better base for a discussion.
Mrs Maes, perhaps we do not understand each other very well, but if you have withdrawn your signature from the joint resolution, or have not signed it, the text remains alive and will be put to the vote in accordance with the rules in force.
Is this also being distributed?
Is it available, because I have noticed that many MEPs have not seen this text?
Yes, of course.
We were not aware that there was the least problem with distribution, but if you say so, we will check and we will have the text distributed.
Mr President, Iraq was at war with Iran from 1980 to 1989.
During this time the USA and EU supported Iraq since we perceived Iran as the real threat to the Middle East.
Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990.
This was wrong and unacceptable.
The UN responded by passing Resolution 661 to impose sanctions on Iraq.
The UN action was justified.
The USA and Britain imposed a no-fly zone in April 1991.
In 1994, Iraq recognised the territorial integrity of Kuwait.
From 1991 to 1997, UN inspectors - UNSCOM - systematically and comprehensively inspected, destroyed and verified Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction.
The UN representative reported to the UN in 1997 that UNSCOM's work had covered virtually everything about Iraq.
In 1998 the International Atomic Energy Agency declared that Iraq no longer had a nuclear capacity.
The oil for food programme started in 1996 has been excessively bureaucratic and incompetent, resulting in long delays in procuring essential medicines and food supplies.
Of the USD 28 billion worth of oil revenue over three years, only USD 7 billion has been utilised for imports and USD 12 billion remains frozen in a bank in New York.
If the sanctions were intended to destroy Iraq's military capacity, then they have done the job.
If the sanctions were intended to dislodge Saddam Hussein, this has not still been achieved after ten years.
However, ten years of sanctions have caused enormous suffering and hardship for the 22 million people of Iraq.
High infant mortality, decreasing life expectancy, increased incidence of cancer and treatable diseases, continue to devastate the social fabric of a country that once enjoyed a high standard of living.
The intellectual embargo has deprived doctors, teachers and other professionals of the advances in science and technology.
I believe the European Union must reassess its position in helping those suffering acute hardship.
There are six EU States - Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece - represented diplomatically in Iraq today.
These diplomats share the view of the UN Office in Iraq, WHO, Red Cross, and other NGOs that the EU can, through its diplomacy, achieve a breakthrough.
Our parliamentarians and Commission officials should go on fact-finding missions to Iraq to meet members of the Iraqi Parliament, EU diplomats, international agencies and NGOs.
Such dialogue will help to establish the facts as they are today and help identify how this deadlock can be broken so that sanctions can be lifted for non-military suppliers.
I hope that this House will vote in favour of this resolution.
Mr President, I am convinced that any type of embargo apart from an arms embargo is a violation of human rights and ineffective in combating authoritarian regimes.
My visit to Iraq made me even more intolerant of the fact that, in the name of the defence of democracy and the rights of the Iraqi people, oppressed by Saddam Hussein, we are killing a people and destroying a country.
This is intellectual genocide.
The head of the World Aid Program has said so.
We have seen the victims in the hospitals: children with their mothers who look at you with staring eyes and haunt your sleep; doctors who watch the agony, powerless to do anything.
The Oil for Food programme stipulates that any imported goods must be screened by the exemption committee; million dollar contracts are delayed for years for fear that the goods may have a dual use: medicines, spare parts, medical equipment and graphite-tipped pencils are all prevented from entering the country.
There are no airlines offering flights to Baghdad, although there are no UN resolutions banning such flights either, because the USA and the United Kingdom have declared a no-fly zone.
I call upon Europe to stop vacillating and suspend the embargo, with the exception of the arms embargo, unilaterally, reinstating civilian aircraft flights.
We must trust the Iraqi people to bring about democracy in Iraq!
One young girl from the Iraqi opposition, Rabye, said to me, while the bombs were falling on her village, 'You are even destroying our dream of building our own democracy ourselves'.
Mr President, if anyone needs any kind of proof that there is something seriously wrong with the continuing sanctions against Iraq, we just have to look at the number of resignations of high-profile people within the United Nations.
We can also note the words of Mary Robinson who has strongly condemned what is going on in relation to the sanctions.
What is happening is that victims, innocent people, women and children, people without any power, without any kind of control whatsoever, are being persecuted.
There is a war against the Iraqi people on which little concern has been focused, and I am glad that some people from Parliament have actually visited Iraq to see for themselves.
It is extremely important.
The illegal bombing by the US and Britain, which is not covered by any UN Security Council resolution, has no mandate whatsoever and is absolutely outrageous: it should not be allowed to continue.
How we can allow illegal bombing like this to continue is just beyond credibility.
The infrastructure in Iraq has been completely decimated.
Again, the victims here are innocent people who have no power whatsoever.
I also have to congratulate here some organisations in our communities who are doing something or are trying to raise awareness, and here I would mention those voices in the wilderness who are the sanction breakers - I think they are playing a major role and I would like to voice my support here for them.
We also have to look at the fact that in any kind of future measures against Iraq we should focus on the enhancement of human rights and democracy, and we should also look at the protection of the Kurds and in the north and the Shi'ites in the south in terms of guaranteeing them some sort of autonomy.
We cannot lose sight of them either.
Mr President, on 15 April this year, following a full debate with the Council and the Commission, we adopted a resolution that was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of this House.
In that resolution we called on the Council and the Commission to do their utmost to protect the life and health of the Iraqi people and to put an end to its suffering.
We called for the embargo on food and medicines to be lifted, because it hits the Iraqi people and not Saddam Hussein.
We called for an immediate stop to the bombing the USA and the United Kingdom is engaged on without a mandate from the UN Security Council, because again this hits and punishes not the culprits but the victims in Iraq.
At the beginning of that resolution we of course confirmed and underlined the Iraqi Government' s obligation to accept and encourage the United Nations' controls with a view to the destruction of ABC weapons and to trace the disappeared Kuwaiti citizens.
With today' s debate and this new resolution we are seeking to achieve three further objectives.
First, we want to address not just the Council and the Commission but also the United Nations Security Council.
Secondly, we propose that our Parliament should take the initiative in sending a fact-finding mission on the ground.
Thirdly, we reiterate the need for the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and the Red Cross to ensure that the most deprived and vulnerable people in Iraq can benefit from the oil for food programme.
Mr President, like Mr Andrews I speak this afternoon as one who regards himself as a friend of the Arab and Islamic world.
This resolution can only be supported if recital A and paragraph 1 are regarded as being at its absolute core.
We are saying that any relaxation of sanctions must depend upon Iraq respecting United Nations resolutions.
In particular we must ask Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross on tracing the 604 Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
If there is to be any EU visit to Iraq it must include a visit to those families in Kuwait who are still waiting to know ten years later what happened to their loved ones.
Any weaker position on the part of the EU will not help the people of Iraq, but will condemn them to perpetual tyranny.
Mr President, one minute is a very short time for such a serious topic.
I say serious, because we are talking about nothing less than the survival of a nation, and what must be called an international attack on immigrants, as it was once termed by Mr ChevÃšnement, a French Defence Minister, against a nation which was trying to escape the new world order.
This attack does not bode well for the future.
This new world order, an expression coined by Mr Bush to conceal the interests of the multinationals and in this case the large American oil companies, is becoming increasingly intolerable for us.
In this respect, the silence of humanitarian organisations in the face of the situation of the Iraqis who are suffering and over a million of whom have already died by our doing is astonishing.
What a contrast and what hypocrisy between so-called humanitarianism and this holocaust that we are collectively carrying out due to simple cowardice in the face of American power, that great empire that this House in particular and Europe in general are incapable of opposing on any subject, as yesterday' s vote on Echelon showed once again.
The most serious thing, and I will end here, as there is undoubtedly far too much to be said here, is that for once, a Southern country was managing to develop, and the Northern countries, lined up behind Washington, have been unremitting in destroying it.
This is immensely dangerous and worrying for the new century.
Mr President, who could not feel sorry for the sorely tried population of Iraq?
I would therefore like to think that it was this sympathy that was the driving force behind those submitting the joint resolution.
The political ramifications of their intention are, however, a missed opportunity.
What is more, they are a complete disaster for the liberated Kurdish part of ancient Mesopotamia.
Allow me to be more specific.
Contrary to what is assumed in recitals B and C, Saddam Hussein, a latter-day Nebuchadnesar, took it upon himself to raze this old civilisation he admired so much to the ground.
This is evident from the first and second Gulf War and another five years, the 1991-1996 period, during which Baghdad categorically refused to cooperate in the oil-for-food programme, which led to a completely unnecessary lengthening of human suffering.
At present, the Iraqi Government is even allowed to export unlimited quantities of oil in order to procure humanitarian aid.
In other words, what is stopping Saddam from alleviating the suffering of his people?
In fact, what will happen with the reserved 13% for the Kurds in the unlikely event that the sanctions are lifted?
In my view, the use of the strange term "intellectual embargo" in recital D is bizarre. After all, the Iraqi intelligentsia has for decades strained under the intellectual embargo of Saddam' s Baath party.
The tyrant of the Tigris is only interested in one type of scientist: the developer of weapons of mass destruction.
It is precisely this obsession of Saddam Hussein' s which reveals the very risky naivety of Paragraph 3 of the joint resolution, because the lifting of the no-fly zone in the North of Iraq - remember this is the international guarantee for the Kurds against their arch enemy Saddam - will probably drive millions of Kurds to take flight once again.
They know all too well what Saddam' s pledges are really worth.
Those tabling this resolution cannot possibly have it in mind to raise this awful spectre.
Hence my explicit vote against.
Mr President, let me say that I am shocked and horrified at the Commission reply on the issue of Iraq and the dismissive way in which they dealt with it.
Just let me quote to the Commissioner, and to the Commission, the saying of Oscar Wilde that in our dealings with life, destiny never closes her book.
Iraq deserves better than the Commission reply.
I am absolutely horrified.
I wish to express total dissatisfaction with the reply of the Commission.
That is all.
If you are going to be fair Mr President, let me say I express total satisfaction with the reply of the Commission.
Perfect, that is one in favour and one against.
We thank the Commissioner who does not want to speak.
Let us be brief and we will all move on.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Venezuela
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0615/2000 by Mr Di Pietro and Mr SÃ¡nchez GarcÃ­a, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Venezuela;
B5-0627/2000 by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the areas affected by the catastrophic floods of December 1999 in Venezuela;
B5-0634/2000 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Venezuela;
B5-0642/2000 by Mrs Frassoni and Mr KnÃ¶rr-BorrÃ s, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the floods in Venezuela in December 1999;
B5-0652/2000 by Mr Linkohr and Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the floods in Venezuela in December 1999.
Mr President, today we have the opportunity to show our solidarity with the Venezuelan people, who last December experienced the consequences of a natural disaster which affected the coasts of the States of Vargas and Miranda and caused the deaths of 50 000 people.
We therefore insist on the importance of approving this resolution which, in summary, is the logical consequence of the report of the special committee which travelled to Venezuela to get to know the reality on the ground of this natural disaster, and also reflects the coherence of the European Union' s political commitments.
I hope it will thereby be possible to finance, in a significant way, the programme for recovery of the areas affected and that it will be drawn up according to the models for this type of action.
Furthermore, we should take account, for the purposes of coordination, of the programmes of financial aid of the Member States and the Community regions.
Mr President, as Mr SÃ¡nchez GarcÃ­a has just reminded us, this resolution comes within the scope of the decision taken by the Conference of Presidents to send an ad hoc mission to Venezuela to assess the tragic consequences of December' s floods in that country.
This issue of Venezuela is serious and urgent.
It is serious because the losses have not yet been sufficiently quantified - but this tragedy has caused the deaths of more than 30 000 people.
It is urgent, Mr President, because the European Parliament' s mission took place last February and so far we have not been able to reach any final conclusions.
I believe this Parliament is stretching the bounds of its credibility.
I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission to ask the Commissioner how it has fulfilled the mandate which it received from this Parliament in the resolution adopted in January to assess the Community' s response to the tragedy in Venezuela.
I hope the Commission is capable of mobilising the necessary human resources to deal with the priorities indicated by this Parliament and I am sure that, if the Commission, as it has proposed in its preliminary draft budget for 2001, is going to be able to spend EUR 815 million in the Balkans, it will also be able to spend EUR 50 million in Venezuela.
Mr President, this issue raises a problem which goes much further than the resolution on Venezuela.
The problem involves the preservation of Parliament' s capacity to respond to this type of situation.
We have to make it very clear what we want. Do we want a real Parliament or do we want a cardboard cut-out Parliament?
Do we want a Parliament which fully assumes its duties or do we want a Parliament which simply endorses the priorities of other institutions?
Do we want a Parliament which does its duty or do we want a Parliament which simply signs cheques relating to the commitments of other institutions?
This is the debate surrounding the 2001 budget and it was the debate surrounding the 2000 budget.
Mr President, I simply mean that where there is a will there is always a way and that this resolution demonstrates a decisive commitment on the part of this House to show its will to help and cooperate. It aims to show that the European Union wishes to cooperate with the Venezuelan people and society.
Mr President. I am convinced that, on the basis of this will, we will find in this budget, which consists of EUR 100 000 million this year and will involve a similar amount in subsequent years, a way to provide for the needs of the victims of this tragedy.
Mr President, the three points which the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left wishes to make on the aid which the European Union can and must give to Venezuela as a result of the terrible flood disaster are: first, we should throw ourselves economically and technically into resolving the consequences suffered, and not reduce this aid, as the Commission intends, in order to fund another catastrophe, this time artificial, caused by us in the Balkans, in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia.
Secondly, we must ratify and apply the Kyoto commitments in order to reduce the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere, which lead to the greenhouse effect and, therefore, climate change and its adverse consequences.
Thirdly, the European Union must show solidarity with Venezuela, and with Latin America in general, so that we can counteract the negative effects of the great influence of the north of the continent on the rest of it.
Mr President, with regard to this resolution which speaks of solidarity with the Venezuelan people, I wish to express my total agreement with certain ideas.
Firstly, I would ask that aid should reach the people and groups who are most in need of it.
As a group we are clearly not opposed to this talk of SMBs and industries in general, but this eagerness to talk of these sectors seems excessive while we do not talk of other more needy groups.
In particular - as Mr Salafranca has pointed out - the effectiveness of the aid measures must not suffer as a result of a lack of human resources.
Secondly, we denounce the fact that something so essential to our group as incorporating the people affected into the drawing up and application of aid measures has not been accepted. This is necessary so that we do not find that things have been done which are not needed or not wanted.
Finally, last but not least, we should reflect on our methods of production and our consumption of natural resources, because this lies behind these catastrophes, and we should not be regularly lamenting them.
Mr President, I do not mean to give the impression that just because there is a particular sensitivity towards Latin America in this House, this should prevent us from also supporting the Commission' s efforts regarding Central and Eastern Europe and the reconstruction of the Balkans.
What does concern us at the moment is the abandonment of that area, which we have begun to notice over the last year, with the new Commission.
It seems as if Latin America has suddenly disappeared from the map of the Commission' s concerns.
Of course, we have had good experiences with the European Union' s contribution to Central America after the Mitch disaster, and we also saw a good initial reaction on the part of the Commission, which quickly allocated EUR 400 000 for emergency humanitarian aid to Venezuela when the disaster mentioned by previous speakers happened.
At the moment we know that the Commission has the possibility, the means and the resources, to provide more aid.
This type of disaster is unfortunately happening frequently and I have the impression that Latin America makes good use of Community aid.
We have the instruments, the means, the good representation and also a European presence in those areas.
We must remember for example that the European Union is the main foreign investor in Venezuela and that we have many cultural and social ties with those countries.
Therefore, I hope that the Commission views this Parliament' s requests with the best possible will so that, with the resources available, and with those which can be mobilised quickly, these requests can be granted and that a plan may be drawn up which is not limited to essential humanitarian aid, but which will help this country, which is making a great effort to rebuild itself for its own benefit, and probably also for our benefit, because the development of Latin America probably benefits the continent of Europe more than any other.
Mr President, more than six months have now passed since the tragic floods in Venezuela.
As a member of the European Parliament' s ad hoc delegation, I was able to witness the terrible effects of what is considered to be the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in Latin America.
It was something that you had to see with your own eyes to believe.
As striking as the photographs and television pictures in the media were, they merely hinted at the true scale of the disaster.
We were also able to see the fantastic cooperation work that the NGOs are carrying out with people affected by the floods.
This emergency humanitarian aid provided by the NGOs could not have occurred without the Commission' s financial support and I therefore wish to praise all those who made it possible.
However, the priority now must be to reconstruct the whole area affected and to stimulate economic recovery.
A new plan for the region must include the rebuilding of homes and every kind of infrastructure and the provision of incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises, which were completely destroyed and many of which will have to start again from scratch.
I am aware that the task of reconstruction is colossal and that is perhaps why it has been so slow.
Only a few roads have been cleared.
Water and electricity supplies have been restored to some extent, but little more has been done, and the people who have been affected are despairing of the delay.
Thousands of them are still dependent on food aid to survive.
It is vital to replace the thousands of jobs destroyed by the floods.
The Venezuelan Government will need a great deal of support if it is to succeed in this Herculean task.
With regard to the task of reconstruction, which cannot be delayed, the Commission must offer the same level of support it provided in terms of emergency humanitarian aid for countries affected by Hurricane Mitch, or something similar.
We therefore urge the Commission to provide a significant financial contribution over the next five years.
Apart from a basic obligation to show solidarity, the historical ties that bind us to Venezuela and the stability of democracy in that country demand this.
First, let me stress that quite contrary to what has been suggested here, the Commission is very much aware of the political importance of Latin America and that in fact it has recently taken a number of initiatives that underline its great political importance for Europe.
Secondly, let me point out that in the case of the disaster in Venezuela, it is still worth considering cause and effect as well as responsibility.
And the Union did in fact provide extensive aid from the start and will continue to do so in future.
This aid is directed at two things.
First, it is aimed at supporting reconstruction in the federal state of Vargas.
It is already becoming a little easier to identify the needs here, which was not the case in the beginning.
I can understand people being impatient because progress is so slow in some areas.
But the Venezuelan Government has not proposed any projects to us.
That is not meant as some kind of covert criticism.
It is probably difficult for the Venezuelan Government to decide very quickly what the priorities should be.
So we first had to send a committee of experts to Venezuela to establish the priorities for ourselves.
The results are now before us.
In a few days' time we will forward a communication to the Council on the measures to be supported and the funding to be provided.
The second aspect - which in my view is even more important than reconstruction aid - is aid for the prevention of disasters.
That means we want to play our part in defining and initiating management programmes in relation to the natural risks in the federal states of Falcon Miranda and Jarakui.
The disaster-prevention measures are very much in need of improvement, as we have indeed learned from this disaster in Venezuela.
I believe the best way we can help the people in the long term is for us to concentrate on that.
As for funding these two measures, that is a very difficult question, because it really is a problem for the Commission to be constantly confronted by the Council and Parliament with their wishes as to what it should do and where it should help; but unfortunately no-one tells the Commission where it is to get the money from.
After all, we cannot print it ourselves, as you know.
We will find a way to finance these measures too and will make realistic proposals, incidentally also proposals that will take account of what the country itself can contribute in view of the sharp rise in its revenue from oil exports.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5Â­0628/2000 by Mr Van Velzen, on behalf of the PPE/DE Group, on the controversy involving the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;
B5Â­0635/2000 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian representative on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;
B5Â­0651/2000 by Mr Ford and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the resignation of Mr Pelinka, the Austrian representative on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia;
Mr President, I agree with Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, who said in an interview that the urgency tabled by Mr Swoboda was the wrong course to choose and that he expected a rather more mature approach.
I agree with him because in an explanatory statement, which he presented to the House, Mr Swoboda refers to conflicts between the government in Austria and the head of the Monitoring Centre on racism that date back quite some time.
It was the time when Viktor Klima, an SPÃ member, was head of the Austrian Government and the government was SPÃ-dominated.
It is a delicate matter when a Socialist from Austria does this, but by no means urgent.
I endorse what Mr Watson said because here Mr Swoboda is also confirming to the present government that better relations are now being established with this Monitoring Centre.
He should be pleased about that, as I and many others are.
That again is no reason for urgency; and there is even less reason for urgency when I quote you what the head of this Monitoring Centre says in an interview she authorised.
She specifically praises Austria' s new policy towards foreigners and concedes to the government that there has, of course, not been a single xenophobic initiative, whereas there is much progress.
She says, much progress, which was not possible under the red-green government; and of course she also says that she is not being hindered in any way in her work.
So what is the point of all this, Mr Swoboda?
As an Austrian Socialist you are obviously just trying to create a platform for polemics against Austrian.
That is shameful for an Austrian and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms!
Mr President, I apologise to the translators if I spoke too quickly earlier on.
I would like to talk to you about the resignation of Mr Pelinka from the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre, Vienna.
I believe that what happened to Mr Pelinka, a renowned academic respected by the scientific community, is indicative of the true nature of the coalition in power in Austria.
The far right, particularly when it is in power, is highly skilled in the art of pushing its opponents to the limit.
What happened in the case of Mr Pelinka did not come about by chance or coincidence.
It began with slander, he was persecuted by means of an unfair judgement, given by a court answering to the FPÃ, as the current Justice Minister of the FPÃ was JÃ¶rg Haider' s lawyer when he sued Mr Pelinka for libel.
The work of the Monitoring Centre was then made unbearable by a public pressure campaign against its members.
I believe that Haider is, and we must recognise this, expressing his contempt for the sanctions that the European Union is currently imposing on him as it was when the Portuguese Presidency took the initiative of proposing the nomination of three wise men that he decided to retaliate by demanding a referendum on lifting sanctions, a completely demagogic, populist and anti-European referendum.
We are also talking about a challenge issued by Haider to the Community as a whole.
He reminds us that the Monitoring Centre is a creation of the European Union and that our President attended its inauguration three months ago.
This is proof, for those who might still have doubts, that we must not negotiate with the far right, as every small victory it achieves strengthens it and makes it more commonplace.
If the European Union were to relax its position on Austria, this would not miraculously lead Haider and his friends to defend human rights and relinquish their ideology.
In response, we must give Mr Pelinka our total support.
We must also help the Monitoring Centre on a human, political and financial level and finally, the Member States must continue to isolate the Austrian Government and, while supporting the Austrian people, isolate the coalition, which is unacceptable and unfair.
Mr President, I had the honour of representing the European Parliament on the management committee of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and one of my colleagues there was Professor Doctor Anton Pelinka, representing the Austrian government.
He played an important role in our deliberations, counselling moderation when others wanted to move too far and too fast, resisting cheap easy stereotyping of those we were investigating and imposing fact in preference to fantasy.
All in all, he was a frustrating friend for those of us who wanted to move further and faster.
I was therefore shocked to discover that state victimisation has been taking place against Professor Pelinka, first when Haider's lawyer, acting as prosecutor and judge in the case of libel against Mr Haider, whom Professor Pelinka described as responsible for having made National Socialist positions and statements politically acceptable.
Second, when he was constructively dismissed from his position as vice-president of the management committee of the Monitoring Centre through administrative harassment by sections of the current Austrian government.
This resolution charges our Committee on Civil Liberties, as Mr Watson requested on Monday, to follow these developments closely.
Perhaps we should not be surprised at what has happened.
Mr Haider said in 1992 of Professor Pelinka, after the latter had pointed out the Nazi past of Hans Steinecker, a precursor of the Freedom Party: "The time is up for falsifiers of history and those who insult Austria.
Pelinka has a disturbed relationship with Carinthia and his manner of permanently propagating falsehoods is unacceptable."
In March this year the Freedom Party said: "The newspapers were right once again.
Now he (HÃ€ider) is threatening us."
But he is not threatening anybody.
It is quite normal.
When I feed a dog and it bites me then I will not feed it any more because otherwise it may bite me again.
The wise men have a hard task in front of them over the coming six months.
Mr President, I am deliberately refraining from entering into these cheap polemics, especially on the part of Mr Pirker, but want to keep the discussion at a certain level and stick to the facts.
It is a fact that the Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia did indeed face difficulties in the first weeks, which were politically motivated, and that Mr Pirker in particular grossly insulted the head of the Centre, whom he has cited today as a witness to show how well things are going.
It is a fact - and I noted that in my first statement today; the ladies and gentlemen who talk so big were not even there on Monday - that things have, thank God, improved because Dr Winkler, the head of the Centre, has endeavoured, as has the new Austrian Government representative, to straighten it all out.
But it is also a fact that the situation remains precarious; and here I, like Dr Winkler, must also state that unfortunately not just the Austrian Government but also some other governments do not give the Monitoring Centre sufficient support.
There certainly is an urgent need to call on all the governments - as I propose - to support the Monitoring Centre.
But it is also a fact that, sad to say, the referendum announced for Austria, which representatives of the European and in particular the Austrian People' s Party who are sitting here in this Chamber opposed only a few days ago, could dangerously aggravate the situation and mood in Austria again; for it is reviving anti-European feelings that will certainly not do the work of this Monitoring Centre any good.
And that is why I want to state my view here and call on the government, on those responsible in that government, not to hold that referendum, so as not to stir up new hatred, not to reawaken an anti-European mood again - something a party like the Austrian People' s Party, which was always pro-European, is in fact unlikely to want.
I am firmly against that kind of anti-European mood and I place my hopes in this House.
Mr President, I will tell you immediately that the ELDR group refused to sign the joint resolution for a very simple reason: we find it a little over-emotional, while not forceful enough, and does not offer the possibility of a more political and more balanced choice in the name of Parliament.
It is because this resolution is too weak that we will not vote for it.
We consider that the problem associated with the resignation of Mr Pelinka is important enough not to be tackled by a resolution that is emotional but does not actually say anything and is extremely watered-down.
Allow me to address a comment to the GUE Group and the PSE Group.
I do not understand their agreement on the text in its current form, in relation to the initial text that they themselves introduced.
Consequently, we within the liberal group would like, and this is the wish of Mr Watson, his committee to be able to effectively take control of the matter and we would like to have very clear information on whether the Austrian Government has infringed Article 10 of the Treaty, that is, whether or not it has fulfilled its obligations with regard to the Monitoring Centre.
If it has not fulfilled its obligations, it is up to Parliament to take the appropriate action with regard to the Commission and the Council.
The main thing is to make it clear and today we are not clear.
Mr President, my group also supports the proposal by the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to treat this whole affair carefully in that committee.
Nonetheless, we will vote for this resolution because, unlike the earlier ones, it is an extremely moderate and responsible reaction to the statements by the head of the Monitoring Centre to the Committee on Home Affairs
The EPP Group also took part in the discussions and decisions on the present resolution.
So I am extremely surprised that the members of the Austrian People' s Party are unable to endorse this resolution, which merely expresses an initial concern and is an initial call on the Austrian Government, and have chosen instead to give us a taste of the way the Austrian Government treats its government critics.
Mr Pirker reads out some statements by the head of the Monitoring Centre but keeps silent about the terrible statements she made in committee, where Mr Pirker himself launched violent attacks on her, about the defamation of the Centre in the Austrian Parliament, about the systematic harassment, the lack of security provisions, the lack of support.
I am sad to see the ÃVP members also giving us a sample here of the way they deal with government critics in their own country; in fact attempting to present them as traitors to their country.
If you listened to Mr Pirker' s allegations that any criticism is criticism directed against Austria, you will see that this really is an appalling attempt to invent a conflict between the defence of human rights and patriotism.
That is a disgraceful attitude!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating a motion for a resolution that is lacking in substance.
It is difficult to identify exactly what the complaints are, which means we do not know precisely what we are discussing.
Who has actually seen Mr Pelinka' s letter of resignation?
Who knows the real circumstances of his resignation?
What is known in Austria about Mr Pelinka' s resignation is the fact that various versions are being circulated by various people.
What I know is the fact that legal proceedings are pending between Mr Pelinka and Mr Haider.
Under no circumstances is it the business of politics or of any parliament to go so far as to criticise proceedings before an independent court that have not yet concluded.
Every state governed by the rule of law provides for constitutional legal measures.
A policy that does not respect the independence of the judiciary does not, in the final analysis, respect the principle of the separation of powers and thus violates a basic principle of democracy.
Racism and xenophobia are a serious problem throughout the Union and one that must be taken seriously.
It must be combated by every means available wherever it arises.
What I expect of the Monitoring Centre is to take stock of the situation objectively and to look at it in comparative terms, so as to allow the policy-makers to react to it.
What I do not expect of the Monitoring Centre is interference in day-to-day political matters and to exercise its mandate with an ideological bias.
Because underlying the concept of racism and xenophobia there are people and their destinies, and they should not be used to put on some kind of political show.
What I oppose is that this simplistic motion for a resolution is also tabled by those Austrian Members who pretend to support my home country.
Mr President, the Commission is grateful for the valuable contribution Professor Pelinka has made as a member of the Management Board towards setting up the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
Yet it is the Commission' s common practice not to express an opinion on legal proceedings concerning individuals in the Member States.
That applies particularly to this case, which falls outside the scope of EU legislation.
Moreover, the Commission cannot express any views on the reasons that led Professor Pelinka to resign from the Monitoring Centre' s Management Board.
The Commission services have already requested the Austrian authorities to appoint a new member of the Management Board.
The Commission emphasises the importance of the independence of members of the Management Board, as provided for in the regulation on setting up the Centre.
I do not believe I need give you an assurance here, since everyone knows that so far, the Commission has done all in its power to support the Monitoring Centre in Vienna and will continue to do so in future.
We are firmly convinced that the Monitoring Centre plays an important role in combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
Let me specifically underline once again that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to ensuring that the Monitoring Centre will under all circumstances remain an independent body, enjoying the utmost autonomy in the performance of its tasks.
That concludes the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Before the vote on child soldiers in Uganda:
Mr President, we agreed a joint motion for a resolution, on which five groups collaborated.
Once the document was finished, a sixth group joined in.
I think it is contrary to our Rules of Procedure for a group to join in signing this motion without asking the others.
My group regards that as a breach of our Rules of Procedure and I would ask you, Mr President, to examine this matter.
Given that we collaborated on it, we will in fact vote for this resolution, yet I would ask you to ensure that the sixth group' s signature is deleted from this motion for a resolution.
We have had a look at this and as far as we are aware there is no rule which stops anybody signing another resolution.
Therefore the signature can stand.
But I would suggest that this be looked into for the future.
Before the vote on Venezuela:
Mr President, the same applies here as to the one I just spoke about.
I insist that you have this checked because it was just during this part-session that a member of our group wanted to add his signature to a motion for a resolution by other groups but first had to obtain written authorisation from the other groups.
We cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week.
So I would ask you to investigate this matter and inform us of the results.
For the rest, we support this resolution because we helped draft it.
I fully understand what you are saying.
We will look into the matter, but there does not appear to be a rule at the present time.
Mr President, as you say, Mr Sakellariou, at the beginning of the part-session, presented us with four requests for amendments to the agenda which were all rejected, and now he wants to end his part-session with another request which, as you have already said, is completely inadmissible.
We could carry on this way, but we would be wasting time.
The President has already replied.
It seems to me that he is absolutely right.
I do not want any further debate.
We will look into this matter.
Vote
Mr President, I simply wish to express our enormous sadness at the news we have just received concerning a horrendous accident on the Spanish roads, in which a lorry has collided with a school bus transporting Catalan school children, with an initial toll of 20 dead and 30 injured, some of whom are very seriously injured.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Following the debates with the Council last night I was wondering whether this report is actually close enough to the original proposal for first reading procedure to be possible.
There are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification.
If we vote for them would this actually take the report further away from what this House is allowed to vote on?
This concerns Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 18, 21, 33, 36, 40, 42 and 46, some of which directly imply policy down to individual schools in Member States.
I would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now.
All the amendments have been checked and approved by the services so we will vote on them now.

President.
That concludes the vote.
Mr President, I simply wish to update the information I communicated to the House a few moments ago.
The accident which has taken place in Spain is really very serious.
The number of children who have died has risen to 27, and their families, to whom we wish to send our condolences, are from Cerdanyola del VallÃ©s and from Viladecans, in Barcelona.
I will make sure that the President is fully apprised of that and that is so done.
Mr President, I do not know the extent of this tragedy, but if children are dead, I would perhaps suggest to the House that we observe a minute' s silence.
We need to have more information about the full extent of the tragedy.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Redondo JimÃ©nez report (A5-0152/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Redondo report which regulates European Union interventions in the event of fires and atmospheric pollution.
This is certainly a positive measure.
I voted for the motion but I would prefer it if, in future, in implementing the proposal, we took into consideration the fact that many pensioners and elderly people live near forests and they are often the only people left in remote and countryside areas.
Fires are frequent in these areas and it would therefore be a good idea, or rather appropriate to use these people to help prevent fires.
. (PT) This report contains amendments to the current regulations on the protection of Community forests against atmospheric pollution and forest fires.
The amendments to the regulation on protecting forests against fires are particularly important for Portugal.
In fact, we must pay considerably greater attention to the Mediterranean woodlands that have been affected by forest fires, and this requires considerable financial resources for reforestation and for the necessary fire prevention measures.
For Portugal, where fires have destroyed large areas of forest, it is vital to increase appropriations in order to supplement national investment in building infrastructure, for example, and to help local authorities, private landowners' associations or wasteland management bodies to buy fire prevention equipment.
This is why the increase to EUR 77 million in Community appropriations proposed by the rapporteur as opposed to the EUR 50 million proposed by the Commission is so important.
It is also important to create a Community information system on forest fires so that the situation at any given time is more widely known. This will enable us to fight more effectively against forest fires and their causes.
I shall give my own personal view of the report on forests.
I know the Committee on Agriculture tells us that we are having the wrong debate in defending an increase in the budget in the context of these reports.
Personally, I consider that we have a political responsibility to send strong political signals to the Commission, the Council and the citizens.
In December 1999, part of the European Union was hit by terrible storms which devastated a large proportion of the forests in southern and eastern France and created despair among the victims, in particular small-holders.
I also know that we cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.
By voting for the rapporteur' s proposals, I wanted to contribute to the implementation of a true forestry policy in the European Union, as despite the vast CAP budget, forests, which are an integral part of agriculture, remain the poor relation.
- (EL) Forests play a huge role in maintaining fundamental ecological balances in the ecosystem of life itself.
Unfortunately, the protection and attention which they are afforded is not commensurate with their importance.
The major catastrophes which forests have suffered over recent years and the failure to react adequately in dealing with them are seriously jeopardising the ecological balance, as well as health, safety and numerous cultural and social values inextricably bound up with our forest heritage.
Mountain and forest areas, especially in the Mediterranean, have been seriously damaged by deforestation, fire, erosion desertification, abandonment, abuse and inadequate reforestation, with the result that tens of thousands of acres of forest land have been lost.
Allow me to bring to your attention the dramatic problem in Greece, which is at the top of the European league in terms of the numbers of acres burnt for every fire.
Only 10% of the surface area destroyed in Greece is reforested.
The remaining 90% is either abandoned or, more usually, is swallowed up and developed by economic interests (such as the tourist businesses generally encouraged by the government of the day), which take advantage of the fires - and/or are perhaps guilty of arson in starting them - the unresolved problem of land ownership and the fact that there are no forest land register or records of government-owned forests in order to improve their profits.
We have a wide variety of forests within the Community (northern, temperate, Mediterranean and tropical) and an equally wide variety of general and specific problems.
Not only has the EU's forest policy to date failed as a result of fragmented, one-off, inconsistent and incoherent action and the wholly inadequate funds provided; the Commission has now proposed further cuts in the already minimal funds available to protect forests from fire and atmospheric pollution.
The reason given for the proposed cuts is the reduced take-up of funds during the last period!
But the problems have not been solved.
On the contrary, they have multiplied.
Such a policy is not merely hypocritical.
It is aiding and abetting fire.
We shall not give up.
We call on the European Parliament to stand by its repeated votes and positions on the need to strengthen measures to prevent and fight fires and protect and enhance the value of our forest heritage in all areas of the Union.
We believe that the Community funds allocated to forests were and still are totally inadequate and we call for them to be increased in line with real needs and the importance of forests.
We really must take suitable initiatives in collaboration with national and local authorities and the agencies responsible and set out an efficient forest policy and develop direct and coordinated action so that the forests destroyed can be revived and reforested on the basis of the latest scientific data and methods, taking account of the biological, climatic and ecological conditions in each region and, we repeat, the EU and the national governments must provide the funds needed in order to create the necessary infrastructure and recruit sufficient personnel which, if Greece is anything to go by, are woefully lacking.
In doing so we shall be helping to ensure that the forests in these countries are protected, developed, restored ecologically and used productively.
Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Arvidsson report on restrictions on the use of phthalates.
I abstained to toe the line of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, but also because I was uncertain for another reason: just before I came into the Chamber to vote I started to wonder what would happen to the firms which produce phthalates if we ban the use of phthalates, not everywhere on Community territory and in all cases, but only when they are used in toys.
Surely they will not use these phthalates for other purposes?
For objects that might be used by pensioners or the elderly?
Or for some other purpose?
I would be extremely concerned if this were the case.
I will not continue Mr President, because this is a public debate and I prefer to stop here.
g.
(SV) If Amendment 6 to Article 2 of the directive is adopted, the following explanation of vote from Parliament's Group of the Europe People's Party and European Democrats will apply.
The members of the Group of the Europe People's Party and European Democrats choose to abstain from voting on the legislative resolution because Amendment 6 to Article 2 has been adopted.
Reason: Marking toys designed for children between 3 and 6 years of age and childcare articles manufactured completely or partially from soft PVC plastic containing phthalates, and their packaging, with a warning label is very difficult and in reality is likely to be tantamount to an indirect, extended ban.
The content of the decision on labelling, therefore, goes beyond the scientific grounds for the directive.
.
(FR) I have a special interest in the matter of toy safety.
I was a rapporteur on this subject in 1992 and I am particularly interested in following legislative developments on the subject.
As for phthalates, the chemical substances used to plasticise PVC, I have always campaigned for proactive measures with a view to protecting, as indeed we ought, this particularly vulnerable group of consumers, i.e. children.
Experiments on animals have shown the toxic and carcinogenic nature of some phthalates, which can cause liver, kidney and testicular ailments in children that suck or chew on dummies, rattles or teething rings.
This identification of the risks gave parents legitimate cause for concern, and should have led to firm measures being adopted, meeting the requirements of the precautionary principle.
The least that can be said, however, is that the Commission' s reaction, albeit relatively prompt (referral to the scientific committee for an opinion, studies into toxicity, ecotoxicity and impact on the environment, the emergency ban decision and proposal to amend the directives concerned), was rather lukewarm in view of the issues at stake and in view of the objective of guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection and protection of human health.
What has the European Commission proposed?
It has proposed banning toys containing one of the six offending phthalates that are intended to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three, and to put a warning on toys containing one of the 6 offending phthalates and likely to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three, and to revise the directive in four years' time.
This is, of course, completely inadequate.
It is ridiculous to provide for a ban only on toys and childcare articles intended to be placed in the mouth.
As every parent knows, young children put absolutely everything in their mouths.
We must therefore ban toys and objects containing phthalates which are likely to be put either totally or partially into children' s mouths.
The lack of reliable scientific information on the movement of these chemical substances within the body should lead us to implement the precautionary principle.
I should also like to point out that we should be particularly vigilant with regard to the substances used as substitutes for phthalates.
It is essential, furthermore, to bring the labelling of toys and childcare articles containing phthalates which are likely to be put in children' s mouths into general use.
To avoid encouraging children to suck or chew on their toys, we should add a clause to prevent flavouring substances being added.
We should envisage revising the directive in order to bring it up to date in the light of developments in scientific knowledge.
I am convinced that, given the information currently available, we should adopt an approach of the utmost caution.
I supported the amendments tabled by the Socialist members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I shall conclude by pointing out that, as far as the case of toy safety is concerned, the regulations regarding EC markings are too ambiguous and should be clarified as soon as possible.
The threat that phthalates may pose to human health has not been proven scientifically.
For example, according to research undertaken in the United States by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, only rarely, if at all, among children is there a risk of exposure to harmful chemicals, as the quantities of phthalates in toys do not exceed that level which could be considered harmful.
As the quantity of phthalates that might possibly get into a child' s system from toys is so small, the study group is not recommending that phthalates be banned.
I myself do not support the principle of 'excessive force' and an extensive ban that is not justifiable in the light of scientific facts.
The toxic effects of phthalates are insignificant, and they do not irritate the mucous membrane or the skin.
Although it was found in the 1980s that very large quantities of phthalates caused liver tumours in rats and mice, official agencies in Europe and the United States have not confirmed that phthalates present a risk of cancer in humans.
In addition, I am sceptical about substituting phthalates with substances whose effects there is no research data on.
However, I support the idea of further research into those phthalates whose effects we cannot be absolutely sure about.
In practice the problem is a minor one, however, as the European toy industry has, in the main, stopped using phthalates.
Hieronymi Report (A5-0186/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the MEDIA report but I feel that, since pensioners and the elderly watch television more than anyone else and are therefore extremely interested in this European Union aid, it would be beneficial if they were able to watch a European television channel broadcasting European programmes.
This would make us more successful in preserving the culture of our nations, which is well-known in Europe, rather than only ever importing films from other States, especially the United States of America.
I therefore hope that my proposal will be taken into account when the document is implemented.
- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have fundamental objections, based on the principle of subsidiarity as laid down in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, to EU funds being used in any way to develop, produce or market what are known as European films and film training.
These funds would be much better spent on the reconstruction of Kosovo, a European contribution of aid that has still not received its budgetary settlement after a year of internal budgetary opposition within the EU.
The idea of offsetting American dominance in film and the arts is understandable and lawful.
However, this is a job for the private film industry and the Member States themselves.
The European Union must instead resolutely dispense with tasks that do not relate to its key concerns.
Mr President, I should like to ask if the members could explain their vote in writing if reports are being discussed or, at least, to wait until the end if they are explaining them orally, as they are entitled to do.
Written explanations of votes at this time are not an expression of respect for the House for any of us.
We take note of your observation, Mr Mastorakis.
Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0185/2000)
.
(FR) We abstained from the vote on this proposal even though we are firmly convinced that a policy of exchange and cooperation between different countries in the field of education would contribute to improving the quality of education by promoting the intermixing of cultures and exchanges between the peoples living in Europe.
Such a policy would only be a factor in progress, however, if it were based on an education policy within the various states which aims to earmark greater resources for public education accessible to all.
At no point in the texts, though, is this priority stated, but more especially, in none of the countries of the European Union is it applied.
We are concerned that a number of phrases are indicative of a restrictive and utilitarian concept of a form of cooperation whose objectives would be dictated by the constraints of the market and initiatives by firms or private bodies looking for a workforce they could train and qualify according to their requirements.
Introducing the laws of the market into education, however, means keeping the best quality for a minority and allowing the quality for the majority to deteriorate.
We therefore voted in favour of the amendments warning against allowing the market to play too great a part in education.
. (PT) It is a well-known fact that defining the quality of education is a very complex political issue that depends specifically on the objectives set, the means to achieve them and the conditions that determine whether they can be achieved.
Cooperation at European level on quality assessment and on quality indicators should not therefore generate assessment models, since it is essential for us to maintain a variety of methods and approaches, bearing in mind the different national contexts and varying historical, social, cultural and political situations in each country.
Potential cooperation based on exchanges of experience in assessing the quality of primary and secondary education must therefore take account of the fact that this is a particularly sensitive area. It must fully respect the responsibility of Member States for the content of their education and for organising their education and training systems, as well as their cultural and linguistic diversity.
Mombaur Report (A5-0180/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the motion partly because one of the recitals states that competition does not prevent the States from imposing public service obligations in the general interest on the parties involved.
I would like to hope that, when this recital is implemented with regard to the provision of gas for domestic use, there will be a requirement to take into account the many people who have a very low income - including pensioners who do not have enough to live on - and that provision will be made for the free supply of a certain quantity of gas or another type of energy.
.
(FR) Overall, and in each of its comments, this report does nothing but extol the virtues of competition and the market economy.
Its author' s sole concern, under the guise of unifying energy markets in Europe, is to deliver this entire sector into the hands of private profit.
Or, more exactly, by separating electricity production and management of the distribution network, the author is prepared to allow states to manage all the areas that require a great deal of investment and offer very little profit, on condition that they hand the profitable areas over to the private sector.
Unification of energy production and distribution throughout the European Union, and the planning and rationalisation of these activities, may represent progress, but only on condition that the whole sector continues to be a public service exclusively concerned with satisfying needs rather than maximising private profit.
The rapporteur' s attitude is the exact opposite of this.
Were the 'liberalisation process' he advocates to come into force, this would be tantamount to a step backwards.
We have therefore voted against this report.
.
(FR) As a new Member of the European Parliament, let me say how shocked I am.
I did not take part in the previous legislature, which experienced the sell-off with regard to the notion of 'French style' public service, and I really do mean a wholesale sell-off similar to what happened to the transport, postal or even the telecommunications sectors.
In proposing to outline the situation as regards the transposition of the Directive of December 1996, on electricity, and of June 1998, on gas, the Mombaur report is patently expressing the ultraliberal philosophy of the Commission which, under cover of bringing about an internal energy market that is of the greatest advantage to the consumer, is demanding that these markets be opened one hundred percent to competition.
The process is always the same.
The Commission puts forward a minimalist directive on the basis of the argument that liberalisation can only be profitable in a context of deregulation. Next the supporters of 'ever more Europe' transpose the directive and go even further (at the start of the year, 65% of the European market had been liberalised although the directive required only 30%!) and, finally, the Commission comes back a second time to 'regularise' the de facto situation in a much more restrictive fashion!
It is all the more unacceptable, given that there are still problems!
What is the point of bringing about a single energy market when electricity and gas are not compatible (in terms of production and distribution, development of the market, or notions of public service)?
How can one reasonably ask a service provider to ensure continuity of a public service, which is available on a fair basis, if this is not economically profitable?
By the same token, how can we ask the former monopolies to now become totally competitive, when they still have major investments to pay off, the product of yesterday' s political choices?
How can one reasonably demand ever lower prices in the sacred name of competition without challenging current requirements regarding nuclear safety?
How can the national concept of public service be replaced by the Community concept of a general interest activity, which is far more restrictive?
I could carry on like this at great length.
Let me point out that it took decades of republican tradition to enable the gradual build-up of our public services. Is it only going to take a transition period of four years to demolish them?
We were consequently unable to vote in favour of this report which expresses the will of the all-powerful Commission to go ever further and ever faster along the road of liberalisation.
Liberalism may well be worthwhile, but only gradually, in small doses, without definitively ruling out state interventionism, lest we tomorrow suffer the financial consequences of giving it up!
.
(PT) In the follow-up to the Lisbon European Summit of 23 and 24 March, which decided to speed up liberalisation in areas such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport, the European Commissioner responsible for Energy presented a set of measures seeking to speed up liberalisation in the electricity sector. These included the implementation of mechanisms for cooperation in overcoming problems that might potentially stall liberalisation, and negotiating access to the Community market with third countries.
As you will be aware, at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council, the Commission was asked to present a report by March 2001 on developments in the energy markets under the Lisbon strategy, so that we could assess progress in the liberalisation of the electricity market at the Stockholm Summit in March 2001. With the support of various governments, mechanisms were strengthened during the Portuguese Presidency with the aim of speeding up the process that was already underway with the December 1996 electricity directive.
This directive stipulated the gradual opening up of this market by 2003, whereas the 1998 natural gas directive stipulates that the final phase of the opening up of this sector should be completed in 2008. This has serious consequences for Portugal, and specifically for the State Electricity Corporation, its employees and for Portuguese consumers.
This action sidelines both the issue of employees' jobs in this sector and the interests of individual Member States, including the protection of a high-quality public service that serves the interests of consumers. We should therefore totally oppose this report.
.
(EL) The purpose of this report is to justify liberalising the energy markets - mainly the electricity but also the natural gas market.
Basically, this means taking this strategically important industry away from the public sector and giving it to private-sector companies to run so that they can increase their profits.
The state then merely regulates the private monopolies and ensures that guidelines issued by the European Union are complied with and it is the country's economy and its people that pay the price.
The whole thrust of the report is geared away from serving the interests of the people - the interests of the man in the street - and growth in the national economy and towards serving the interests of large monopolies.
The report contains quite a few inaccuracies in its bid to present the liberalisation of the energy market in an attractive light.
For example, it is not true that competition has reduced prices and created jobs in Great Britain.
In the 4-5 years since electricity was privatised, prices have increased substantially, jobs have been lost and there is no longer a national, long-term electricity development programme.
Elsewhere, the same report admits that jobs have been lost as a result of liberalisation, but considers that new jobs will be created in non-productive sectors, on the stock exchange, in advertising, in financial services and so forth
According to a study by the Public Power Corporation in Greece, the present staff of 32,000 will be cut to 20,000 and numerous services which are crucial to both the PPC and the economy of Greece, such as the production of new technologies, power station studies etc. will be abolished as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market. Privatisation and liberalisation will push up prices, especially to consumers on the small Aegean islands, who pay a price per kilowatt/hour several times below cost.
It is also unacceptable that a public-sector corporation should be forced to allow private-sector companies to use its highly valuable transmission and distribution grid in the name of so-called competition.
If the EU really wanted healthy competition, as it itself understands the term, it would force the private sector to create its own grid and generating stations and compete with public corporations, rather than force the public corporations to "offer" their grid to their competitors.
This is simply a way of making it easier to shift assets to large companies.
It is for precisely this reason that an attempt is being made to separate sectors, thereby preventing public-sector corporations from operating with a view to optimising vertically integrated activities and become competitive.
Generating electricity is not the same as producing a simple commodity.
The energy sector is crucial to the economic development of a country and vital to its defence.
Consequently, liberalising the energy markets jeopardises both the security of a country and its economic growth.
This risk can clearly be discerned; as the report stresses, "In a frontier-free Europe, public utilities must operate in the single market.
These firms are no longer strictly national; nor are their shareholders".
The GUE/NGL MEPs have therefore voted against Mr Mombaur's report.
It is gratifying that the efforts to create a liberalised energy sector now look seriously as if they are to bear fruit.
Most countries are by now well under way with implementing extensive changes to the structures of their markets.
Some countries have already implemented full liberalisation, and I am especially pleased that Denmark is in the vanguard.
Denmark ought to make use of this favourable position and complete the liberalisation, as has already happened in Sweden, for example.
It is therefore unfortunate that the Danish Government does not apparently have any plans for the time being to take the final step towards full liberalisation.
Mr Mombauer' s excellent report hits home regarding several points.
In particular, it should be emphasised how important it is to take account right now of the candidate States' situation.
Liberalisation of the energy markets in the countries of Eastern Europe will require special arrangements, and particular account must be taken of the environment.
It is also important to draw attention to the fact that all electricity production should be transparent, and that special support for this must in no circumstances constitute a distortion of competition.
Radwan Report (A5-0169/2000)
Mr President, the 1999 annual report of the European Central Bank is not terribly forthcoming on the subject of the main question that all observers are asking: why has the euro, which was presented as a strong currency, turned out in the end to be a weak currency?
Out of nigh on two hundred pages, the bank devotes just a single page to this subject, plus a tiny graph showing only the observed decline in the strength of the euro.
The only explanation given is the difference in economic health and structures between Europe and the United States.
Although that is true, it is not a sufficient reason.
It should be mentioned, first of all, that Europe is not a single country, with one people, one state, and one economic government and that, consequently, the euro is generally considered to be more vulnerable than a national currency.
Furthermore, it was launched at too high a level at the outset, precisely because it was evaluated in relation to the existing rates for genuine national currencies, even though it has none of their intrinsic qualities.
How do European leaders intend to combat this depreciation?
Firstly, indirectly, by means of policies to promote growth, an approach we can only endorse.
At the same time, however, we see the European Central Bank raising interest rates, officially in order to combat a non-existent risk of inflation, but in reality in order to support the parity of the euro.
It is a double-edged sword, because, if it is used at the wrong moment in the cycle, it may cancel out the growth that they are trying to stimulate by other means.
The other dubious solution is the headlong rush to strengthen the eleven members of the euro zone, which is supposed to lead gradually to a single European economic government.
This will not change a great deal in the short term.
In order to deal with the root of the matter, we should have to deny the nations of Europe any autonomy whatsoever, but this is patently impossible.
In any event, a deadlock is being imposed on the system at the same time.
As I explained at a recent symposium of the French National Assembly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is intended to serve, among other things, to put an even greater stranglehold on the peoples of Europe in relation to Community law and hence also in relation to the single currency.
This venture is helping to take us to a point where we lose our freedoms.
Mr President, surely you agree that these are not explanations of vote, but simply a continuation of the debate.
I still do not know how Mr Berthu voted, not that I am interested, but this is not an explanation of vote, this is just a continuation of the debate.
I voted for the Radwan report despite the fact that point 9 on page 8 calls upon Member States to speed up the structural reforms of the social insurance systems in wording which does not convince me.
Is it the usual request which, with these words, so often disguises the request to cut down on citizens' pensions in order to reduce the budgetary expenditure of national governments?
If this is the aim of the report, I would stress that it should rather be interpreted as rationalisation to avoid wastage in social security benefits, for if they were administered more efficiently it would not be necessary to continually cut benefits and the pensions of the elderly throughout Europe.
The report we are now considering attempts to defend the monetarist policies of the European Central Bank, particularly on price stability, whilst forgetting that we do not currently have a continually falling interest rate. On the contrary, we are in a phase of constant increases, which have very serious repercussions on the incomes of less well-off families who use bank loans to buy their own homes, which is what happens in Portugal.
The rapporteur, who is delighted with the conduct of the ECB, considers that what is crucial is strict observation of the nominal convergence criteria in the Stability Pact, for applicant countries too, together with the policies linked with these criteria. These policies include wage moderation, the flexibility of the labour market and of social security systems and speeding up the liberalisation of the services and capital sectors.
The rapporteur even goes so far as to criticise euro area countries that have reduced working hours since, as he sees it, this attitude contributes to "rendering labour markets more rigid instead of more flexible" .
The rapporteur therefore puts himself in the position of defending the most refined form of capitalist neo-liberalism, at which we must protest most vehemently by voting against the report.
Karas Report (A5-0170/2000)
Mr President, we are discussing the European Parliament report on the information strategy to be adopted in the final phase of application of monetary union. I would like to make it clear to Mrs Peijs that I voted against this report.
This report reflects the concern felt by many leaders in the face of the public' s virtually total lack of interest in the implementation of the euro.
We are, however, eighteen months away from a crucial deadline: the withdrawal of national currencies and the start of the physical circulation of euro notes and coins.
So far, admittedly, progress has been relatively smooth for the euro, as the initial phase has principally involved technical experts, bankers, investment experts and stock market traders, who have all had adequate warning and who, moreover, are favourable to the idea on the whole.
In such circumstances, it is not surprising that the euro has been easy to establish in this phase.
From now on, however, progress promises to be a lot less smooth, since the euro is about to come up against the citizens who, more often than not, have not yet fully understood what is going to be expected of them and who are going to find themselves cornered by decisions which have already been taken.
In order to make up for this omission, the European Parliament is demanding that the information policy be stepped up, increasing appropriations by approximately 30%, to EUR 38 million per annum.
In order to deal with the complexes of decision-makers who might be experiencing doubts, it adds, somewhat ingenuously, that, to quote the resolution voted on, "according to Article 37(b) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, information policy is an autonomous action which needs no legal basis" .
In such circumstances, indeed, why should we hold back?
Let me mention, incidentally, that we have always challenged the Commission' s option to make expenditure commitments without a legal basis, and we also challenged this interinstitutional agreement which the Council was weak enough to accept in contravention of the customary principles of proper management of public monies.
Mr President, I will endeavour to comply with Mrs Peijs' wishes and keep my speech short. I will simply say that I voted for this report in the hope that, on 31 December 2001, all the pensioners will be presented with a calculator which will convert their own currency into euro.
Mr President, I am one of those MEPs who has tabled Amendment 7 with the request that the Commission's euro information campaign be restricted to those countries that are part of the area in which the currency is at present being used.
This means that Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom should remain outside the campaign while the krona and the pound are still the currencies of those countries.
It is a reasonable request that the EU not carry out tax-funded campaigns in Member States on sensitive internal political issues.
In the end, it is a question of tolerance for one another and of respect for each nation's democratic process.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mr Karas' s communication strategy for implementing EMU.
Introduction of the new common notes and coins will have considerable practical significance for individuals and companies, not only because the coins and notes are new but also because the 'new prices' have to be got used to once the present ones have been converted into the common currency.
Money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence.
It is therefore important that the necessary information should be made available, and more information should of course be made available than we receive whenever countries at present introduce new designs on notes and coins.
In our vote, we attached importance to information being provided in the individual countries by the Member States and to special agreements being entered into with the Member States concerning this issue.
We agree that it is right for the Danish Government not to have entered into such an agreement. We look forward to a situation in which Denmark too can enter into such an agreement once the Danish people have hopefully said yes to the common currency in the referendum on 28 September 2000.
- (NL) My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, has never been in favour of rushing through a common currency within the EU.
The euro is preventing us from regulating the economy by adjusting interest rates and exchange rates.
Furthermore, the so-called stability of the euro is financed by large cuts in unemployment benefits and in provisions for education, health care, housing and public transport.
I am therefore of the opinion that the euro is only convenient for businesspeople, lavish holidaymakers and MEPs, but not for the majority of people.
Insofar as there was ever faith in the euro, this faith has been eroded extensively since the euro has dropped in value compared to the Danish Kroner, the Swedish Kronor, the British Pound and the currency of many countries outside the European Union.
I can therefore imagine that those pro-euro now feel the need for a propaganda campaign.
The Karas report mainly intends to instil more confidence in the euro among the public at large by, inter alia, involving sports associations and education.
In addition, it intends to denounce the practices of swindlers and those increasing prices who are cashing in on the introduction of the euro.
I wholeheartedly endorse this part of the report, but I was unable to assent to the proposal as a whole.
I reject the Karas report in its entirety.
While the aim of familiarising Europeans with their future currency is a perfectly legitimate one, given that the decision to give up national currencies has already been taken (in conditions which I deplore), I am adamant in rejecting the propaganda this text puts forward in support of what Mr Karas terms "an essential, identity-building factor in the process of European integration" .
This text at least has the merit of exposing the outrageous untruth to which the supporters of a federal Europe resorted when they asked the French to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. At that time, the single currency was presented as a purely technical instrument to improve the operation of the economy in relation to the dollar and the yen, and as an operation that was perfectly neutral in terms of national sovereignty.
How far we were then from seeing it as the key element in the process of integration!
This text will be an essential weapon, let us have no doubt, for all the people in Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark fighting to safeguard their national democracies. The euro, even though its supporters in these countries deny it today, is in fact the instrument of warfare of a federal Europe rejected by the overwhelming majority of its peoples.
So when the honourable Members reject the amendment tabled by William Abitbol, simply asking that this integrationist objective be clearly stated in the Commission' s communication programmes, they are contributing to a propaganda operation which their voters will most certainly punish them for.
The resolution of the Karas report claims that women for some reason do not share the general enthusiasm which should have greeted the implementation of the euro.
This smacks of the unpleasant tones of revolutionary propagandists of every age, seeing reactionary plots between the cloth and the women in every household rejecting the bright revolutionary future.
It seems not to have occurred to anyone that it is perhaps because of their day-to-day experience of economics that women are more than reluctant about the transition to the euro.
This is a despicable attitude, which reveals the dictatorship of the orthodox thinking which involves branding the men or women that oppose the euro, or who merely show some reluctance, as ignorant, illiterate or uneducated.
This is where blind federalism takes us!
Lambert Report (A5-0162/2000)
.
(FR) The annual reports from the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions belong to the traditions of this House.
Parliament in turn responds to the reports from both these bodies with two reports of its own that do not vary greatly from year to year.
There is a new feature, however, this year. The Thors report, supported in particular by the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr SÃ¶derman' s request, is attempting to give the Ombudsman a general right of access to all the documents that need to be consulted when investigating the case for a complaint.
We are opposed to this proposal, not because we reject supervision of the administration, but because such powers exceed the jurisdiction of an Ombudsman and approximate to those of a judge.
It is obvious, and we will certainly not deny it, that the frenzied Community administration and the ravages it causes cannot but add to the dissatisfaction of our fellow citizens and, hence, give rise to ever more appeals.
The proliferation of competencies, the diversification of spheres of intervention and the legislative bulimia of the Commission and the European Parliament will no doubt do nothing to make this phenomenon any better.
The Ombudsman and his colleagues are not, however, the right people to meet these challenges.
It is our political responsibility to cut such disputes off at source by giving our work precedence over issuing activist texts to justify our existence, with proper respect for the principle of subsidiarity which will prevent the European Union ruling on subjects that are none of its concern, and by ourselves, if necessary, making use of the authority we have in terms of supervising Community bodies.
Too often we have seen this House hiding behind expert committees because it refused to accept its own political responsibilities.
If we have to allow the Ombudsman to monitor administrative problems, we must, for our part, learn how, before and after the fact, to control the insane Community machinery which is running amok.
The excesses we must fight are often the product of the very nature of the current construction of Europe, something we must tackle at the very root.
Atkins Report (A5-0162/2000)
Mr President, do not tell Mrs Peijs that I am not doing my best to comply with her wishes.
I voted for the Atkins report because it is extremely important for pensioners, who do not have much time left, to arrive at their destination on time when they travel by air as they are always short of time.
This part-session has produced a rich crop of reports on transport.
I must, unfortunately, observe, however, that this sector is examined only from the Liberal point of view.
Mr Atkins' s report on the European Commission proposal on the single European sky goes along with this rationale of liberalisation at any price.
This was the cause of the French air traffic controllers' strike last week.
This was how they expressed their concerns about a purely commercial view of their profession.
I understand their action, and I can certainly not say as much for Mr Atkins, whose report urges the Commission to encourage Member State governments that currently tolerate a situation where national labour disputes disrupt air traffic to tackle the problem as a matter of urgency" .
It is pathetic!
No one can deny that the air traffic situation has deteriorated.
Air traffic corridors and airports are at saturation point, delays are common, with one in three aircraft behind schedule, and the whole business is accompanied by a trail of environmental and noise pollution.
I wish therefore to pay tribute to the determination of Mrs de Palacio, the Commissioner responsible for transport, in tackling the problem head-on in order to achieve the creation of a single European sky as soon as possible.
I disagree entirely, however, with the means she puts forward and with the report' s proposals.
The report proposes to introduce competition among air traffic control centres, taking away the link between regulatory authorities and operators.
The supervisory function would be carried out within separate companies whose capital would be open to air companies or private partners.
Such liberalisation would serve to jeopardise air transport safety, and this, of course, is unacceptable and contradictory to the EC Treaty, according to which improvement of transport safety is one of the chief objectives of common transport policy.
France would certainly seem to be the odd man out in Europe, where, in most countries, air traffic control is administered by agencies, under state supervision but open to private capital.
France wishes to keep these activities in the public sector.
The principle of subsidiarity must be applied here, and each Member State must retain control of the organisation of air traffic control.
This is essential, especially as the problem with delays is not caused by air traffic control, which is responsible for less than 25% of all delays!
In conclusion, I support the proposals to strengthen the role of Eurocontrol, the pan-European agency responsible for the management of the airspace of European states, be they members of the European Union or not, in its capacity as regulatory authority.
The report is wrong to underestimate this agency' s potential, but I have voted against a report which is completely unacceptable.
.
(FR) I voted against Mr Atkins' report because it is totally at odds with the real world and is in keeping with an a priori ideological vision rather than with any concern to meet the real needs of our fellow-citizens and air transport users.
We cannot, of course, deny that there is a need to improve the situation of regulation and air traffic control in Europe in the spirit of the single European sky.
It is perfectly obvious that the aircraft in our airspace should not be on the receiving end of inconsistent, uncoordinated and complicated handling of their flight plans.
And it is true that, although some progress has been made with Eurocontrol, the time has already come to move on to the next phase and to improve the system, bearing in mind one absolute imperative: safety. Regulation and air traffic control must not be subject to the law of competition, but rather to the concept of a general interest service.
Moreover, the United States have never liberalised their own air traffic control, as this is managed by a single state agency.
That just goes to show!
The Atkins report, however, is entirely concerned with the goal of opening the service up to competition, even though it is hard to see exactly how it could be a source of private profit or how the profits made could possibly reflect its performance!
The pretext for driving forward this liberalisation, furthermore, is delays in flights.
This is certainly a situation that must be remedied, but, in order to be effective, we should really analyse the actual reasons for delays and the real solutions.
We should first of all note that there have been positive developments this year as delays have substantially reduced in France.
This indicates in the first place that we should make a distinction between temporary disruption (use of airspace by the military for Kosovo, the change in the control system, etc.) and structural problems.
We must also measure the problems due to the air companies or the limited European civil airspace with regard to the number of overflights.
Air traffic control does not play a very significant part in causing delays, in the final analysis, and, in any case, improvement of the system involves improving the organisation of the coordination of the various Member State control systems, supporting Eurocontrol in this role.
This should be the priority and the guidelines on the single European sky.
Unfortunately, the Commission does not appear to be on this track, and the Atkins report is even further off the mark.
- (NL) The aviation sector has traditionally been organised in a particularly liberal manner.
The reason for this is that governments compete with each other by building ever more and ever larger airports, and that apart from these airports, there is no need for creating infrastructure comparable to railways or motorways.
As such, since time immemorial it has been common practice in this sector for different companies to compete with each other for the same route.
Airfares bear out this freedom too.
There is no link whatsoever between the distance to be covered and the fare. Where passengers are wanted, prices are low; where it is believed that there are more than enough passengers, prices are high.
There is little left to be liberalised in this sector.
Despite this, there are people who expect further liberalisation to be a panacea.
It is supposed to lead to cheaper flights, a wider range of flights and no more delays.
According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, this consideration is very one-sided and only serves two interests: that of airline companies and that of the consumer, whose only focus is more and ever cheaper flights.
In our opinion, a number of other aspects take priority over this, such as passenger safety, livelihoods and the working environment of the employees, environmental protection and the protection of the railway industry from price dumping and other forms of unfair competition.
There is little point in blaming the workers for everything that could cause irritation among passengers. These workers are sometimes obliged to strike out of self-preservation.
Neither is this the fault of Eurocontrol, which has taken over a number of cross-border state responsibilities.
Safety should not come second to the pursuit of profit by companies which aim to take over Eurocontrol' s market.
The problem has far more to do with the excessive growth in aviation and price competition at the expense of long-distance rail transport.
The current proposals do not address this problem.
From this critical stance, we tabled 11 amendments.
Since it has transpired that a majority within Parliament does not support our stance on this, we were unable to assent to the final version of the Atkins report.
. (PT) Although this report deals with certain real situations, such as the increase in air traffic or the delays experienced on various routes, and although it is based on certain correct premises, specifically the need to guarantee and strengthen air transport safety, it nevertheless glosses over the underlying causes of these situations, which are inextricably linked with successive actions to liberalise air transport and with the unbridled competition that has resulted from this.
In particular, it draws hasty and mistaken conclusions, which lean markedly towards the liberalisation of airspace and towards the future control of this airspace by the main air transport companies.
Since it is true that effective cooperation is required and since technical and disciplinary measures are essential in this area, we do not support these guidelines, which are even more radically in favour of liberalisation than those suggested by the Commission.
If these guidelines were followed, they would exacerbate safety problems and would lead to greater social problems, in addition to raising questions about the sovereignty of each state over its air space. These questions are all the more relevant because this air space is shared by their respective military air forces.
.
(FR) On 26 June 2000, French air traffic controllers went on strike to protest against the plans of the European Union to liberalise air traffic control. I should like to show my solidarity with this strike and with the demands of the air traffic controllers' unions.
The responses to the saturation of European airspace are pushing us into a headlong rush, with airports and airstrips proliferating, the working conditions of employees in the sector deteriorating and pollution on the increase.
We, on the other hand, are in favour of the harmonised development of transport on a European level, prioritising the fulfilment of real social needs, and opting for railways as the best solution for most needs, particularly for distances of less than 500 kilometres.
Liberalising air traffic control will not solve the problem of delays, since only 20 to 30% of delays can be attributable to air traffic control.
It is known that today the military have seized, in France for example, 80% of the available airspace.
Why has this never been challenged?
The Commission is using the delays as an excuse to move towards a split between a European regulatory office and the establishment of a privatised internal market for the provision of air traffic services.
Such measures, undertaken under pressure from lobbying by air companies, can be implemented only to the detriment of safety, especially given that the companies themselves will be able to put themselves forward to provide such services.
It is for all these reasons that I voted against this report.
DamiÃ£o Report (A5-0141/2000)
I voted for the DamiÃ£o report, Mr President, partly because I voted for the amendment which stipulated that women on maternity leave should receive a full allowance.
Maternity is not an illness.
This morning, the Italian newspapers contained the news that medical treatment for dogs and cats will be tax deductible.
If there is enough money to spend on dogs and cats, there ought to be enough for women on maternity leave, who are not ill but people who have the right to a full allowance.
Mr President, this report on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding is very valid and is a step in the right direction.
Point 11 in particular contains many positive proposals.
At the same time, I would like to warn against a development whereby we in the European Parliament end up devoting ourselves to social policies and social legislation, something which I think is, on all accounts, the duty of the Member States.
It is a very important part of the cultural and social identity which every nation and every country creates.
This is one of the most important questions of all in every election campaign in Sweden and in other countries.
Let this remain a national issue!
Mr President, the pregnant mother and her unborn child, mothers who have recently given birth and breastfeeding mothers need as much support as possible during this very important period, which is important not only to the individual mother and child but also to society, remembering the low birth rate and ageing population in Europe today.
Certainly companies have social responsibilities. But surely governments should set an example, especially in those countries like my own where the role of mother and the family is protected in the constitution.
Unfortunately this does not appear to be the case in Ireland regarding paid maternity leave, facilities for breastfeeding and exemption from night shifts.
I give these examples to highlight the fact that just because a directive has been agreed it does not mean it has been implemented.
It is high time we stopped paying lip service to working mothers, their children and their families in our European Community.
.
(FR) In this report, we voted in favour of the paragraphs which contributed towards protecting the working women, both in terms of their health and wages and in terms of children' s health.
It is, however, to be deplored that the report does not even propose to bring the advantages and rights into line with the countries where these are most favourable to pregnant women in work.
Moreover, we should not like our vote in favour of the specific protection of women night-workers during pregnancy to be interpreted as legitimising women' s working night shifts.
Quite the contrary, we wish to restate our opposition to night work, if it is not socially useful, not just for women, but also for men.
The prohibition of night work for women is a right acquired by the working movement in France.
To revoke this would be a retrograde step in social terms.
To speak of equality between men and women is hypocrisy.
This hypocrisy is intended to conceal the fact that the legislator is more concerned to reassure employers that their factories may be operated profitably than to guarantee the health and safety of employees.
. I abstained on Amendment No 2 submitted in the name of Mr Bushill-Matthews which called for the special needs of SMEs to be recognised when implementing Health and Safety legislation.
I have every sympathy with this desire but the amendment is superfluous as Article 137(2) of the Treaty clearly states that "directives in the social field including Health and Safety shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of SMEs."
I believe therefore that the sentiments expressed in the amendment are already covered and it is unnecessary to repeat this in the report.
.
(EL) Here we stand once again under a shower of good intentions which, even if translated into a set of positive proposals, are doomed to remain dead letter because they get nowhere near the nub of the problem and do not touch on the main trend causing the problem.
The European Parliament's proposal contains numerous positive proposals which are negated by its very inability to set out the problem of negative developments in labour and labour relations as a whole.
Because no attention is given to the main trend towards restructuring labour relations and reducing and abolishing the fundamental rights acquired by workers or framework labour conditions such as minimal working times and conditions, temporary and part-time employment and cuts in social security and protection, the resultant framework is completely negative and non-conducive to the application of any policy to protect working women during and after pregnancy.
We wish to point out and highlight the risks inherent in a strict prohibition on dismissal, especially under the present, extended regime of generalised atypical employment contracts and the indirect exclusion of pregnant women from jobs, a regime in which we need not just to maintain and consolidate but to increase maternity leave, define the maternity allowance more clearly and apply strict and more substantive controls on night work by pregnant and breastfeeding working women.
Not only must we strengthen the legal framework protecting the health and safety of pregnant women and rectify omissions and clarify ambiguities - the "Trojan horses" used to bypass and infringe legislation -, we also need to deal with the lack of political will on the part of national governments to apply the directive properly, a lack which is sorely in evidence from the sluggish state of control mechanisms in the Member States during the previous period.
A typical example is Greece, where there are no controls on employers' obligation to carry out an integrated written assessment of occupational hazards in the workplace, including a specific assessment of the hazards to pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Experience has demonstrated that reducing employability and "adaptability" to guideline Community priorities on employment issues renders any protection basically non-existent and cancels any individual arrangements in practice.
The problem is: what guidelines are being issued, what sort of employment policy is being applied?
And unfortunately, we have confirmation that the EU wants to make more drastic cuts to allowances and social insurance, to amend and downgrade provisions on dismissal and to reduce and abolish provisions to protect working conditions.
We must not delude ourselves as to the nature of employment policy and the social policy of the EU in general or the interests which it represents, which is why, despite sharing the EU's positive position on the protection of working women, we believe this is nothing more than yet another report of ideas and good intentions.
We therefore call on working women and men to continue their social fight for an overall change of policy and for a policy which centres on man and respect for his needs and dignity.
A fight geared primarily to the implementation of the principle of full and stable employment, with full, consolidated social rights for everyone.
Only such a framework will safeguard the rights of the particularly sensitive category of pregnant women and the rights and respect for life as something other than the raw material of profit, subject to the laws of costs, competition and inexorable market forces.
.
(FR) We are in favour of all the amendments to the directive seeking to improve the protection of pregnant employees before, during and after their maternity leave.
The resolution proposes to remedy some of the omissions in the present directive and to harmonise European legislative systems to align them with those that guarantee the most rights.
We endorse such proposals in the name of guaranteeing employees' rights to health, especially as the proposed amendment of the ILO Maternity Protection Convention (Convention 103) reveals many retrograde steps, such as the exclusion of certain categories of women from entitlement to maternity leave, the minimum duration of maternity leave and the possibility of making a woman redundant during this leave.
A strict European framework must be established to protect pregnant women against any form of discrimination during recruitment, regarding issues of their working conditions, access to maternity leave or its duration: 20 weeks including 8 mandatory weeks after the birth.
Women must be protected against any wrongful dismissal and their former wage must be guaranteed.
Finally, night work must be prohibited for both men and women in sectors where it is not absolutely essential, rather than seeking to modify the conditions for pregnant women.
Short sea shipping
The next item is the report (A5-0139/2000) by Mr Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the development of short sea shipping in Europe: a dynamic alternative in a sustainable transport chain - Second Two-yearly Progress Report.
The rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, has the floor.
Mr President, in 1995, the Commission submitted the communication on the development of short sea shipping on the basis of the strategy which was formulated in the White Paper on the common transport policy.
The second annual progress report on this draft is now before us.
However, after five years, it has become clear that short shipping is still merely an empty promise which has not been kept, despite the verbal support by the Transport Council of 8 December 1999, which considered short sea shipping as a priority.
We are not trying to boost the popularity of short sea shipping out of idealistic motives.
It is a fact that transport shipping will increase by 70% in the next decade.
It is impossible to meet this growing demand by road transport alone.
Short sea shipping is therefore not a competitor of road transport, the train or transport using inland waterways, it is one of the modes in the transport chain.
It is in everyone' s interest to keep the irritation communities are caused by the constant drone of through freight transport to a minimum.
Transport should also be as clean as possible and in that respect too, short sea shipping meets high requirements.
Speed might not be the main feature of short sea shipping, safety is.
Weekend traffic bans and traffic jams are a curse to road transport.
In many cases, short sea shipping can provide a solution to these problems if it is used in combination with other modes of transport.
At the same time, I do not want to claim here that it is a panacea.
We will take the pressure off quite substantially if we try to make the best use of all modes of transport and combine them in the best way we can.
But in order to do this, a number of conditions do need to be met.
In its communication, the Commission makes a distinct reference to industry itself.
This is fine, but as rapporteur, I would like to add another dimension.
There are some very specific aspects where mainly governments at national, local or regional level can add weight and can give short sea shipping a boost.
In its communication, the European Commission provided a sound overview of the issue as a whole.
Parliament and your rapporteur have looked at the Commission plans with a critical eye and tried, in consultation with all parties involved, as befits a Parliament, to compile this report.
Industry was asked to raise practical issues which could, in their view, obstruct the development of short sea shipping.
We are still awaiting this report.
I would like to underline a few aspects.
Once again, short sea shipping can only take off in Europe if it is considered an integral part of the transport chain.
Connections with the hinterland in the form of rail, internal waterways and road are essential in this respect.
As such, it is important that short shipping is integrated with other modes of transport and this means that infrastructure will need to meet certain requirements.
Short sea shipping is also eminently suited to specialist transport. Cars are a good example of this.
Innovation in the construction of specialist ships will prove decisive here and this could give our shipbuilding industry a shot in the arm.
The sector' s image is also important and must clearly be cleaned up.
The sector is suffering from excessive red tape.
Procedures last forever.
But increasingly, we can also point to many positive developments within the sector.
Industry should take its responsibility there, for example, in the setting up of regional promotion and marketing agencies, but the market cannot do this on its own.
Member States must lift obstructions.
For example, the road transport monopoly springs to mind, with the impact this has on the levels at which short sea shipping should pitch its prices to tie in with Bilbao' s short sea port.
At every level, excessive bureaucratic procedures and endless red tape accompany the cargo.
This puts short sea shipping at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transport.
Accordingly Parliament calls for this sector to be treated with the necessary flexibility, thus enabling this sector to acquire a better position in terms of affordability.
For example, we have in mind the introduction of exemptions from pilot service in ports where captains can demonstrate they have a high level of experience.
By the way, an irritating error has crept in to the erratum, where the experience of the pilot is referred to.
This should, of course, be the captain, otherwise this is complete nonsense.
The market is still fragmented at present.
This is why in its report, Parliament points to the need for a one-stop-shop approach to offering logistical transport services to end users. These services should embrace all multi-modal transport services and should, in this way, counteract the fragmentation of the present services.
In my report, I also call for incentives from the Commission, which are needed to promote short shipping.
In view of the European connections, I would also ask for investment projects in mainly the Mediterranean Sea area and the ports along the Adriatic Sea.
Short sea shipping requires destinations.
You may have wonderful short sea terminals in Rotterdam, but you need to have a destination.
The setting up of these new lines requires critical mass and it could be one or two years before these resources are available.
The European Union will need to help out by providing cheap loans from the European Investment Bank in order to overcome this difficulty.
Furthermore, we are lacking information and statistical data on which industry can base its investments.
No one knows what we transport in what way, where to and in what quantities.
I believe that statistical data on what we transport where is one of the things we need as a matter of urgency in order to pursue a policy for transport, which will grow at an amazing rate in the next couple of years.
Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues Ripoll and PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, who have worked on this report - but who are not able to be here - I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, on her marvellous report, in particular because it deals with a problem which is important for very real and practical reasons.
Furthermore, I wish to say that there are two things which I am regretting right now: firstly, that I am not able to hear the opinion of our friend Mr Fatuzzo on how short sea shipping affects the interests of European pensioners, and secondly, that so few Members are present because, considering the egotistical interests of this House, it is probable that one day they will regret not having found out about the issue of short sea shipping, because they will perhaps have to use it one day to travel to and from Strasbourg.
Turning to the background to the issue, I must tell Mrs Peijs that we have followed with great interest the developments and actions which in recent years, especially on the basis of the creation of the forum for the maritime industries, have been taking place in the European Union with a view to promoting short sea shipping as an alternative to land transport.
Both the Commission' s report and the rapporteur' s report illustrate the different comparative advantages of each type of transport, of which, in the case of sea transport, I would like to highlight the fact that the infrastructures are less saturated, the fact that they are less expensive, they consume less energy and therefore emit fewer pollutants into the atmosphere and they improve communications with the outermost regions of the European Union.
We consider - and I think we all agree on this - that the transfer of charges from land to sea transport should be taken as a priority objective of the European Union' s transport policy.
I would like to highlight the fact that in the last two years there have been a series of actions which have had positive effects on short sea shipping.
This has made it possible, as the Commission' s report points out, for intra-Community sea transport activity to increase by 23% between 1990 and 1997.
Nevertheless, this is a relatively modest increase - of only 3% cumulatively per year - and this is less comparatively than the increase over the same period in land transport, which has been 26%.
Consequently, rather than bringing the relative positions of sea transport and road transport closer together, the difference between them has continued to increase.
All of this indicates therefore that we not only need more vigorous quantitative measures but that we probably need a different qualitative focus.
Mrs Peijs' s report seems to us to be very balanced, but we would like to draw your attention to one of the key objectives for the promotion of short sea shipping: the simultaneous reduction of the time and direct cost involved in port operations for ships which provide this type of service.
In many cases, the port services - both with regard to the ship and the goods - are faced with no effective competition or with very limited competition and this means that there is often abuse of dominant positions, such as the imposition of obligatory services which are not necessary or are not even used, for example, piloting, towing, mooring and port handling, as well as the payment of very high tariffs.
What is certainly the case is that, apart from very few exceptions, transoceanic services do not have to face competition from roads and, in most cases, air transport does not offer any practical competition to them.
For all these reasons, we believe that, if the intention is to promote short sea shipping in a realistic and effective way, it is essential to reorganise the current provision of port services, by improving their efficiency and reducing their costs.
We should also bear in mind what this means for the economies of the areas in which there is a ship-building industry.
This means a revitalisation of the whole area, as is well known by the people who live in those cities, in those regions, in which the ship-building industry is a very active element in the local economy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked: why are we so keen on short sea shipping at European level?
The answer is: we have a vision.
We see large quantities of goods transported round our continent on safe, environmentally-friendly ships.
The goods are unloaded at the point where they can reach their destination via the shortest possible overland route.
That takes the burden off overland transport by adding another link to the chain of intermodal transport.
Of course we are still many sea miles away from making this vision come true, although some progress has been made over the past two years, as the report shows.
Mrs Peijs' good report describes the existing obstacles and the strategies for realising our visions.
There was broad agreement in committee.
What can we do internally for short sea shipping? I just want to mention a few things.
In the technical field we can introduce more environmentally-friendly technology for ships' engines and specific terminals for express transhipment.
In the organisational field, and especially for cross-frontier transport, we can introduce uniform shipping documentation, simplified administrative procedures and fewer pilot services in cases where they are not absolutely necessary.
What can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain?
First, we can improve the interfaces with other modes of transport by introducing modern systems of transhipment - especially to inland shipping - standardising containers, promoting transport logistics services for the entire transport chain and by many other means mentioned in the report.
I think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre-accession strategies.
Meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables.
The report says that an exchange of best practice would be useful.
That is true, for why have we been calling for some time now for a reference centre for intermodal transport.
It would be sensible to engage in more research and above all to set up demonstration projects in the field of intermodal transport.
All in all the report offers a whole package of sensible proposals.
I hope that the next progress report in two years' time will tell us that we have moved a little closer to our vision, our vision of a successful intermodal transport system in Europe.
Mr President, there are three aspects of Mrs Peijs' excellent report that I would like to highlight and illustrate by way of example.
Although these come from my own constituency, I know they are representative of many similar regions.
First, intermodality and the need to optimise infrastructure links to the hinterland.
This week we have voted for environmentally-friendly measures designed to encourage more freight on to rail.
Good rail access into ports is vital in this context.
We have to accept, however, that there are times when it is roads that provide the necessary access into the hinterland.
I cite the placing on the TENs map of the A75 from Gretna to Stranraer, given its importance for sea transport to and from Northern Ireland.
Second, the extent to which outlying regions and islands depend on the sea for contacts with their neighbours.
We often look on the sea as something that separates communities. We are better viewing it as a highway that connects them.
My group endorses Amendments Nos 1 and 4 accordingly.
I would add, though, that for environmental sustainability we should look upon connections between peninsulas in the same way.
In the west of Scotland the route from Gourock to Dunoon is twenty times as far by road as it is by sea and that from Tarbert to Portavadie is twenty five times as far.
Third, it is essential that we continue to recognise the lifeline nature of many short sea shipping routes.
I am not thinking just in terms of the need to sustain public service obligations in this context.
We also need to find other permissible ways of reducing the costs associated with transport to island and outlying communities.
Their economies are invariably fragile ones and it is just not good enough that the farmers on the Isle of Lewis have to pay twice as much for their hay as farmers living near Inverness.
I hope the Commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area.
Mr President, in this group we welcome the Peijs report and we welcome the Commission's stance to which it is responding.
It is indeed true that short sea shipping is environmentally friendly and cost-effective, and it is indeed true that it supports the economic development of maritime regions; but we in Scotland call upon the Commission, therefore, to get its act together in respect of the forthcoming liberalisation of sea transport in the west of Scotland.
As Mrs Attwooll has just pointed out, we not only have island transport there but also important short sea links across what we call sea lochs and the geologists call fjords, where instead of going 150 kilometres up a narrow road over a mountain pass, you can take a boat across a narrow water.
If we were to interpret the regulation on maritime cabotage sensibly, we would say: Of course these peninsulas are functionally equivalent to islands, and public service obligations apply in these cases as well.
In that case it would be quite lawful for the state to support the services there.
In the same way, one could then take a holistic look at the package of routes across the west of Scotland, instead of breaking it up, inviting cherry-picking by private entrepreneurs who come in to take the few paying routes and make it harder to sustain the routes which are not profitable all the year round.
We want a holistic look at that kind of thing throughout Europe, we want an imaginative approach by the Commission.
It is six weeks since I put a question to the Commission asking if it would treat the peninsulas as equivalent to islands.
Earlier it had claimed intimate knowledge of the west of Scotland.
It still have not replied to that.
I ask it to reply as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s communication on the development of short sea shipping in Europe and the very good report on it by Mrs Peijs give a realistic picture of the development of this environmentally-friendly mode of transport in Europe over the past two years.
The development and promotion of short sea shipping are a particularly important step on the way to developing a system of multimodal transport for the European Union and bordering regions.
Efficiency, cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility and sustainability distinguish this form of transport from road transport and can offer a serious alternative in coastal regions.
However, it is also most important to improve the cooordination between the various modes of transport so as to bring out the specific strengths of each of them most effectively.
That is why the public and private sector must adopt a range of European, national and regional aid measures to adapt and develop the ports, which are the nerve centre of the transport chain, and target these measures at the specific requirements.
Furthermore; it is important to adapt the related technical and organisational aspects, such as administrative formalities and documents, customs and embarkation procedures, to ensure the rapid and smooth change from one mode of transport to another and from one country to another.
Other support measures should include special incentives for the development of innovative technologies, special pre-embarkation terminals for short sea shipping and integrating the ports in the development strategy for the coastal regions.
This is an important means of strengthening economic and social cohesion and the links between the centres and the peripheral areas in the European Union.
The integration of short sea shipping in the logistics chain of door-to-door delivery can be an effective means of sustaining the growing economic cooperation between the EU and its neighbouring states and satisfying the growing need for transport that accompanies it.
Mr President, I would like to say the following on behalf of Mr van Dam.
Transport policy requires choices.
Sustainable transport policy requires even more, or at least other, choices.
The task which we in this House have is to facilitate the transport of goods and passengers in such a way as to keep adverse side-effects to a minimum.
The mode of transport we are discussing here, short sea shipping, has the reputation of being a mode of transport which can counter the negative effects of the transport sector, especially in terms of the space occupied and environmental pollution, in more than one way.
However, as Mrs Peijs rightly points out, the sector is not taking full advantage of the opportunities at the moment.
I would like to highlight a number of aspects.
We often hear that short sea shipping, and transport by sea in general, is an environmentally friendly mode of transport in terms of emissions per transported unit.
This is certainly true, relatively speaking.
However, progress made in this sphere in other sectors, especially road transport, is undermining this position.
If ports refuse to turn a ship, swift action is most definitely required.
Given the developments in the road transport sector as a result of new European emission standards for fuels, I am of the opinion that in order to boost the environmental performance of short sea shipping, we need to lay down a European directive concerning maximum permitted emission levels generated by ships' engines.
Furthermore, unlike certain fellow delegates, I am of the opinion that short sea shipping should not only supplement existing modes of transport, it should also operate as an alternative to intra-Community transport.
Given the problems surrounding distribution or with regard to reducing ECO points in Austria, we very much welcome an alternative route from North to South and vice versa.
Short sea shipping can take care of at least part of this.
A third aspect concerns the situation at ports.
If we want short sea shipping to become more competitive in terms of speed, we will need measures to simplify customs and (dis)embarkation procedures. The rapporteur is right to point this out.
If the sector then operates more efficiently and according to more up-to-date standards, it is vital to broadcast its potential.
In a number of countries, including the Netherlands, promotion offices have been set up successfully with this goal in mind.
It is therefore advisable for national or regional authorities to do their bit in order to develop this sector.
In short, Mrs Peijs' report is comprehensive and I would like to congratulate her on this.
If those involved take up their responsibilities, we are bound to conclude in a number of years what the Netherlands already knows: "Transport by sea, the best route" !
Mr President, to visitors from afar, the sea crossing to the Scottish islands is the stuff of romance, and indeed the beauty never fails to move both native and visitor.
But for those who live and make their living there, the island shipping services are both an essential lifeline and a costly hurdle to be overcome for their economic and social well-being.
The costs that impede are not only the fares, difficult as those often are, but also the inconvenience of pre-booking, of waiting in queues, of fitting in with timetables which provide low and variable frequencies; and then there are the risks of delays and cancellation due to weather or mechanical breakdown, or strikes which hold the islands to ransom from time to time.
There is considerable concern on the Scottish islands at the moment that the EU's competition policy, which requires putting these services out to competitive tender, will undermine these lifeline services even at their present level and add a further upward ratchet to the cost of living and of doing business.
We need to reassure those who live and work on these vulnerable islands and remote peninsulas that they have nothing to fear from bringing a measure of competition into the process for awarding these contracts.
Can I ask the Commission to do what it can to reassure the Scottish islands, the Scottish executive that is struggling with this situation at the moment and the Scottish Parliament, that it stands ready to make sure that this process works well, that it does not undermine but improves the shipping services in the Scottish islands.
Perhaps through Commission Verheugen I can pass an invitation to the Transport Commissioner, his colleague, Mrs de Palacio, to accompany me on a romantic trip to the Scottish islands.
Mr President, Commissioner, living as I do in a country with an extensive coastline and many islands - in fact I live on an island -, I have first-hand experience of the value of short sea shipping.
Of course, the basic sector is passenger transport, but the report under discussion focuses on freight transport in response to the Commission's communication.
It is worth noting that, although the volume of traffic carried by this form of transport has risen over recent years, road transport has fared better, meaning that special attention needs to be given to this more environmentally-friendly form of transport.
The current situation is still pretty off-putting for the public, which is given the impression that this is a fairly outdated, slow and complicated means of transport.
The development of maritime transport is further hampered by administrative procedures in need of improvement and delays, an incomplete infrastructure and the obscure fees levied by some ports, together with unnecessary mooring charges.
But we can still improve its image and turn it into a viable alternative solution for types of freight which can be transported by various methods.
I refer, of course, to places which are not restricted to maritime transport, such as islands, which must always warrant special attention.
The private sector has a basic role, but there are aspects of the market which call for intervention by public-sector agencies at regional, national and European level and even financial aid, so that islanders do not feel that they are second-class Europeans.
Developing cabotage has an immediate impact on social and economic development in our regions and hence on the cohesion of the European Union.
The rapporteur has obviously approached the subject matter in this spirit and has taken her work very seriously; as an islander I feel obliged to extend her my special thanks.
I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen who, I see, has put his headphones on. Thank you for your attention earlier on during the explanations of vote by the honourable members.
Mr President, Commissioner, at a time when we are trying to correct regional disparities, Mrs Peijs' s report is very opportune, since it deals with the matter of short sea shipping and asks Member States and the Commission to adopt measures to promote this type of transport.
As always, I would like to remind you that the regional and structural policy of the Union, as a whole, is a response to the specific disadvantages suffered by certain European regions, such as the so-called outermost regions.
Last March, the Commission presented a report which lays out a strategy aimed at the sustainable development of those regions and which includes various principal aspects, notably those regions' relations with the areas in their geographical vicinity, which, to a certain extent, largely condition their development.
Therefore, we believe that Mrs Peijs' s report is opportune, especially if it is reinforced by the amendment I have presented on the inclusion of sea transport between ports in the outermost regions and ports in the vicinity of those regions.
In this way, we could correct the error made by the Commission when it drew up the two-yearly report on the development of this type of transport, of employing an incomplete definition of short sea shipping.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, short sea shipping is the most economical, most efficient, and most suitable solution for remote regions.
I would like to thank Mrs Peijs for her interesting and excellent proposal.
In my own country, shipping is almost totally of this short sea shipping type: in other words, it is important to us in that respect.
We are unusual in that we only have a land connection with the rest of the EU in the north, so the importance of maritime traffic is enormous.
On top of everything, our railways have a different gauge from those found elsewhere in the European Union.
What is most peculiar about our situation is, however, that our shipping always comes to a halt in the winter unless certain measures are taken, because the sea freezes.
This has led to a situation where we have had to establish a special fleet to break the ice.
They are powerful ships: one ship' s energy is equivalent to that used by a whole city.
This being the case - as we have this hindrance to movement - we hope that this ice-breaking operation may be supported, as the obstacle has been ordained by the Lord, and we cannot do a thing about it.
It is also to be regretted that the effects on employment and welfare of this sort of traffic have not been highlighted sufficiently.
A cheap workforce is a huge risk in these circumstances, especially in the north, and especially in ice.
How can someone wearing shorts, who has no professional skill to his name, cope in minus thirty degrees and three metres of ice?
That is the problem.
Aircrews are always well trained, but the same cannot be said of the cheap workforce that is employed on ships.
I expect the Commission to look into this matter.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Peijs on a successful report.
There are many problems and bottlenecks with regard to transport in Europe: roads and air space are congested and the competitiveness of the railways is poor.
This week here in Parliament there have been many important reports on the subject of transport, all aimed at relieving congestion and reducing bottlenecks.
Mrs Peijs' s splendid report aims at exploiting the opportunities offered by short sea shipping.
It is an important addition to the reports on railways and air traffic.
We indeed need viable and competitive logistical chains linking road traffic, rail transport, short sea shipping and, in addition, modern information technology.
For remote countries across the seas, and that includes Finland, short sea shipping is an absolutely vital necessity, just as Mr Paasilinna there just said.
I wish to mention the importance of the suitability and availability of ports and port services.
Ports must be included in the Trans-European Network as part of the transport infrastructure.
For the measures proposed in the report to be implemented, good levels of co-operation will be required between the Union, Member States, players at local level, and companies too, as will genuine investment of time and money in short sea shipping.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.
Quite clearly she has spent a lot of time on it and has brought a lot of problems to light.
We can see the different problems quite clearly from different areas of the European Union.
Each area has its own particular problem.
We have to recognise that it will take time to achieve our ultimate goal.
But there is no doubt that short sea shipping is something we must strive to achieve better than we have up to now.
It is certainly sensible to ship more goods by sea rather than by road.
It is more environmentally friendly, more acceptable in every way.
But we have to ensure that we get the balance right.
That is what the rapporteur has been striving for.
One of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor.
To be competitive ports have to be more efficient and for this they will certainly require more support.
I support Mrs Attwooll's appeal for the A75.
It recognises that we in Northern Ireland export goods across what is a very expensive stretch of water between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
It is our main outlet for all we produce.
From Scotland they trundle down to England.
There certainly could be a more efficient and environmentally satisfactory way of doing that but there is no cheaper way.
For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective.
We had a very good ferry service set up between Ballycastle and the south of Scotland which was forced to close recently because of lack of support and bureaucracy.
Mr President, Mrs Peijs, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her report.
All the previous speakers have said this, and, like you, regretted the fact that short sea shipping suffered from such a poor image in terms of its slowness and inefficiency, even though it provides one solution to traffic congestion, high infrastructure and environmental costs.
Moreover, in recent years, this form of transport has enjoyed an unquestionable success, even though it is not very well known, or not well enough.
It does however offer, as you said, advantages in terms of costs, energy, efficiency, regional cohesion, the environment and even intermodality, as it is an ideal means in the implementation of multimodal transportation.
Measures must therefore be taken at the earliest possible opportunity to step up the efficiency of dockside operations and reduce waiting times in port.
Speaking personally, I would insist on the public authorities playing a part, at regional as well as national and European levels.
There are, however, two points in your report that I have a problem with.
Firstly, the proposal to draw up a list of ports particularly suitable for short sea shipping.
I do not consider such a list to be necessary, as it entails a risk of penalising the ports which are not currently entirely suitable, but which are going to be modified in future.
Moreover, there is a suggestion that the logistical services offered to users should be combined in a single unit.
I am in favour of an information system but, personally, I reject the idea that a thriving major port should have central control of all the services.
Finally, I should have liked, as a member of the Industry Committee, to have heard someone say clearly that short sea shipping must not be considered as an alternative, but that indeed an intermodal strategy should be found, establishing complementarity between modes of transport.
In this context and in this spirit, the Member States should moreover harmonise their regulations so as to prevent distortions, which, particularly in the case of mainland transport, often cause hold-ups.
If we wish to achieve a multimodal system, it is important to have a set of means of transport and regulations that are, if not common to all, then at least perfectly harmonised.
Mr President, let me thank Mrs Peijs for her excellent report and for the work she put into it.
The report show that short sea shipping is an issue on which there is the widest agreement between you, the Member States, and the Commission and the agreement goes further.
I know of no one and no organisation which does not wish to see short sea shipping developed.
In the past we were guilty of talking short sea shipping down.
We mentioned its potential and by doing so implicitly said that it was not really doing very well.
But it is doing well.
It was not much publicised but short sea shipping was the only mode of transport which, during the 90s, could more or less keep pace with the development of road transport.
So we must give credit to the short sea shipping industry.
However there is always room for improvement. The shipping industry is the first to acknowledge this.
Let me mention a few key issues in Mrs Peijs report.
We need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine door-to-door concept.
It must be fully integrated in the transport chain and be offered through one-stop shops.
Several bottlenecks hamper the development of short sea shipping.
The Commission services are currently identifying these bottlenecks and potential solutions, together with the new Member States and industry.
One area which has already been identified is the diversity of documents required.
To create more uniformity, the Commission intends to present a proposal by the end of the year aiming to harmonise certain ships' arrival and departure documents.
The efficiency of ports is crucial for short sea shipping, and also by the end of the year the Commission will present a package of measures intended to enhance that efficiency through liberalisation.
Further, the old fashioned image of short sea shipping needs to be changed. That was already mentioned in the debate and I appreciate that very much.
