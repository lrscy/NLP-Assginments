A football game which is being played this very evening illustrates why these amendments are important.
My footballing nation, Scotland, is playing Italy, the world champions.
Our amendments simply make it clear that 'national' in football does not necessarily mean 'Member State', and nothing in this report or in the terminology of this report ought to in any way bring into doubt or undermine the status of the historic footballing nations of Scotland, Wales and England.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, football is far and away the most popular sport in Europe, and the environment and atmosphere surrounding football have a major influence on young people.
This influence is all the stronger as it is spontaneous and not imposed from above.
It is therefore important that football is not viewed solely as a environment awash with large amounts of money, an environment conducive to lawbreaking and acts of violence and an environment whose top levels are completely cut off from the amateur leagues that form the foundation of the game.
At the same time, the amateur leagues are, I would venture to say, more socially beneficial than the exclusive environment of professional sport, in which business has to a large extent detracted from the original pleasures of the game.
Along with rapporteur Mr Belet, I wish to call on the EU to ensure that the customs and habits of professional sport do not influence student and youth football, and that children are not traded on the basis of their talent and performance, as though they were young gladiators.
This practice affects the right of children to develop their personalities in an open atmosphere with a broad range of knowledge, and introduces the unforgiving adult world into their upbringing.
At the same time, football clubs become less interested in devoting the time and effort to developing their own young players.
This in turn has the effect of restricting the large-scale involvement of children in popular sports, and of strengthening selection, which turns a small minority of talent into merchandise while the majority are left on the margins.
Top-level football influences not only its own players and spectators; it also constitutes a world in which children and young people in particular find their role models.
We should therefore try to ensure that football stadiums stop being venues for aggressive behaviour, that xenophobia and racism disappear from football and that the business surrounding football is not - rightly or wrongly - linked to corruption.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the EU has no competence over sport and nor should it.
The Champions League and the G14 clubs across the UK, Spain and Italy, oppose the EU intervention in football broadcasting rights.
Bayern Munich is for it; English clubs are against it, yet a UK Sports Minister, Richard Caborn, is here to lobby for the Germans.
So much for British interests!
Amendment 25, until it was sensibly withdrawn, ordered the flying of the EU flag at Champions League and European Championship matches.
Had they thought about Switzerland, who will co-host the European finals in 2008?
The fact that the Champions League includes Russia, Turkey and Norway?
None are in the EU and there is no EU team.
The same amendment also demanded that the EU anthem be played at these matches.
But 'Ode to Joy' is a complete misnomer to 41% of the population, and 58% of the British population.
You know, Schiller wrote 'Ode to Joy' in 1785, and his words 'Oh friends, no more these sounds', may have been controversial then, given that Beethoven was unfortunately already disabled by deafness when he wrote the Ninth Symphony, but they are appropriate today.
And, as for 'Do you fall in worship, you millions?', well I can tell you, over 200 million people say 'no'.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for my political group in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Catania, with whom we have worked effectively and fruitfully throughout this procedure.
Sporting fixtures are there to attract a large, family-oriented public, which legitimately aspires to watch matches in complete peace and security.
The fact is, for years and even very recently, certain individuals have been using football grounds for the purposes of staging violent or racist demonstrations.
Such abuses are totally unacceptable.
Football is the most popular sport in the world.
In order to prevent these kinds of incidents, the Member States have had an organised and effective system in place since 2002 to exchange information on the risks represented by certain matches, and especially by certain dangerous supporters.
A single, direct point of contact has been designated in each of our Member States.
These national 'football' information points meticulously prepare for international matches by improving police cooperation among the services.
They therefore need to improve their information exchanges even more and use, for example, standardised forms.
These points of contact will thus be able to work in a more structured and more professional fashion.
I should also like to congratulate Mr Belet on having included in his comprehensive report several paragraphs on the fight against racism.
That seems particularly crucial to me, in view of the rise in all forms of intolerance within our society.
Football can in fact only continue to play a social and educational role if matches take place without violence.
Ladies and gentlemen, in a few hours' time, Mr Belet, Mr Bennahmias, Mrs Hazan, Mr Bono and myself will submit a written statement on the fight against all forms of trafficking in, and exploitation of, children in football.
I call on you to support us in this undertaking and to sign this text as soon as possible.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Catania for his report and Mr Belet for the work he has accomplished, which I find balanced even though I too share the view that more could have been done.
Football has now taken on a significant major role, and in view of the new challenges that are arising we can no longer imagine that it can be controlled solely through the football bodies.
Thus there is a need, which has been accepted by the European Parliament, to take action to ensure more balanced growth in the football sector, seeking to respond to the changes taking place with an up-to-date approach.
Moreover, as has been said, the ever-growing importance of European football involves, as we can see, consequences of considerable significance in all sectors.
We need only think of sponsorship and the value of television rights, marketing and the increasing number of international competitions, which in turn have effects on various sectors, and the new social and cultural problems generated by them.
Thus, I would say that this new, ever-growing social dimension of modern football encompasses public behaviour, morality, drug-taking, violence and racism, and even the exploitation of young players.
There has been talk of the big teams but very often we miss the real scale of the problem by dwelling too much on the large clubs and not going beyond them, when in fact it is above all in the lower divisions that we need to take greater care than we have done up until now.
It is therefore right to recommend that greater regulation be imposed on European football and that this should be connected with European law and the dynamics of the internal market.
It is right to implement a more modern form of governance and to try to elevate the social and cultural influence of football in a positive way.
The objective that we ought to set ourselves is not so much to invade UEFA's sphere of responsibility and to replace it but to implement policies that contribute to better management of this sphere of activity.
We need to be clear, though: the demands for independence emanating from the football bodies must not turn into the idea that each of them can do what it pleases, outside the scope of EU law.
If we want, as is our duty, to combat the mistakes and the decline within the world of football, it is important to accomplish this task through collaboration between the political and parliamentary bodies and sporting bodies.
Everyone needs to give of their best to achieve this objective.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too welcome the two reports.
It has been said that today football in Europe is all about big business, but it is also true that it ought to be something else too.
However, fees in the millions, a lack of transparency, violence arising as a result or a response and racism are a spectacle to which, to a certain degree, we are often becoming inured.
This jeopardises the educational role of sport - in this case, football.
What we really ought to be doing is reflecting deeply on this role, starting with amateur football and sport as played in schools, where the positive values of competition always go hand in hand with respect for the rules.
Although the EU does not have specific competence in this field, as has already been said, the relationship between football and violence, which is exploding in all its absurdity and often involves the players themselves, means that we all need to get involved.
It is our duty to lay down, as we have tried to do, common measures to prevent and repress hooliganism, in cooperation with the football associations, UEFA and police forces, for the safety of all citizens.
I would say, however, that we must also look at the deeper causes, or subsidiary causes, for which these bodies have up until now not been responsible and which need to be identified and addressed.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Belet for the way he has gone about writing this report. I do fundamentally disagree with him in some areas, and indeed the massive power-grab that this report is asking for in its recitals, but I welcome the professional way he has conducted himself in writing the report.
Yes, there are problems in football, but none that we European politicians cannot make a lot worse.
Yes, there are small elements of people who use football matches as an excuse to be violent, and they should be arrested and stopped from attending.
But, as many Rangers fans from Glasgow in Scotland will tell you, policing at international fixtures needs to be friendly and sensible, rather than hostile and over the top.
Giving EU competence in this matter to us will not stop this violence, and we do not need it to actually swap best practice.
This report is a good example of why we should stand back and be sensible.
Sport is best governed by those who participate in it.
Many of this report's recommendations are quite sensible, but we are politicians and we simply cannot resist tinkering where we have no right.
Just look at the now withdrawn amendment 25; listen to many of the contributions in this debate and you will see why.
My theory is that by demanding these new powers we will try and correct problems that do not really exist, and try and change and harmonise the very different sporting models in football that exist across the continent at the moment.
As someone who has refereed at the lowest level of the game for 25 years, and having heard much of the debate on this subject over my time in this Parliament, I think we are in great danger here of forgetting that professional football clubs - the ones we are speaking about tonight - are uniquely connected to the millions of amateurs who run out on pitches across Europe every weekend, and we could easily damage the solidarity people here wish to promote and protect by our quite ignorant plea for interference.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I should also like to thank Mr Belet for his initiative and cooperation.
I hope that we can keep the compromises that we have worked out and that we are not going to change a great deal at the last minute and then have to go to certain people on bended knee after all.
In this report we have considered and properly addressed the problems facing football today.
What we do not want is more regulation at EU level.
Instead we want legal clarification of the existing rules to prevent sensible football regulations being annulled.
The idea that henceforth it will only be possible to settle any problems before the European Court of Justice, for example, is absurd.
We did not want to do battle with the big clubs either, or attack the traditional clubs, but rather fight for a fair balance between small and big clubs.
The award of licences might be an example here.
In addition, considerably more attention needs to be paid to young players than has been the case thus far.
Mr President, Mr Belet's report is not about the EU taking over football, and the ALDE Group has been at the forefront of tabling amendments to make that clearer.
However, there is nothing wrong with it assisting in the sharing of best practice.
There are aspects, such as the business of football covered by European legislation, which are taken care of within the corresponding business or other legislation and do not need special rules.
Football also has a social or cultural dimension.
However, the closest links are those forged within the local communities.
That is where fans go week in, week out to see games and it is where many clubs, such as Reading Football Club in my own region, invest in football in community projects.
It is those local links which are why national associations, leagues and clubs are best placed to make the right decisions within a self-regulatory framework and I believe, with the appropriate amendments, that is what this report says.
(ES) Mr President, as is customary, though this time it is well-deserved, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Belet, for his ability to hold dialogue with all of the groups and all of the Members.
He himself reminded us at the beginning of this debate that we must not lose sight of the fact that this is a report on professional football, thereby adding a component that I believe to be crucial; I would also like to stress that we are dealing with an own-initiative report.
That is to say that this is the first time that the European Parliament has focussed on football, sending out the message that it takes an interest in the phenomenon of football.
That means that we must make our principal causes for concern very clear.
When it comes to professional football, we must essentially discuss professional football clubs and spectators.
Without those two elements, the problem that we wish to tackle would not exist.
I therefore entirely agree with Mr Heaton-Harris's final comment: there is no place for any speculation that does not take account of the crucial role of the actual football clubs.
If we send spectators the message, 'Look, the European Parliament wants to meddle in the world of football in order to make the spectacle of football less spectacular'; if we are going to say to the big clubs, the ones that have real customers, real social demand, 'Look, for the sake of the principle of solidarity, your income is going to be restricted, you are not going to be able to sign up the big players and you are not going to be able to have those structures.
We are going to make football less spectacular', I can assure you, ladies and gentleman, that football fans - and there are many of us sitting here - will be astounded.
They would say to us, 'so you are concerned about football and you are sending out the message that you are going to make the spectacle less attractive by working against the big football clubs'.
That is absurd.
I would therefore ask, ladies and gentlemen, that we take that very much into account when it comes to dealing properly with the audiovisual rights of football clubs.
(NL) Mr President, whilst Europe should not, where paid football is concerned, be the referee, it should be more than a mere spectator.
While we should not claim any competences where we do not have them, matters such as internal market rules, the fight against racism and cross-border fraud do indeed fall within the EU's remit.
I am therefore in favour of paragraph 8, but against an independent supervisory body.
Europe is no referee and should not stick its nose in matters which the football world is very capable of handling itself.
I am indebted to Mr Belet for the enormous support in his report for the fight against racism in football.
Last year, I took the initiative for a written declaration on this subject matter, something to which the report makes explicit reference.
With record support, this became an official resolution, the proposed measures of which were adopted as stricter sanctions by the UEFA and FIFA.
This excellent way of cooperating should be extended beyond the area of football.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Ivo Belet and Mr Giusto Catania on the important outcome of their report on the future of professional football in the European Union.
More importantly, however, I should like to congratulate Ivo Belet on the overall effort to focus the interest of five committees and a large number of agencies and public figures in sports and the economy.
It is illustrative of the importance and dynamism which football exerts, magnetising millions of sports-loving politicians - and not only politicians - throughout the world.
When the Bosman case hit the headlines in 1995, no one expected that the European Union would make the first major inroad into sports for the benefit of the workers and, above all, of footballers.
Now, 12 years later, we have an own initiative report which lays new foundations with prospects commensurate with the values of the European Union and of more popular sport, or rather football.
The amendments voted by all the committees and the proposals to the Committee on Culture, Education, Media, Sports and Multilingualism and the Council pave the way for a fast proposal to create a legal framework for sports, regardless of if or when the Constitutional Treaty is passed, which makes such provision.


These are the reasons why the European Parliament should support the report on football, because it is universally accepted that this would mean a change of positions and status quo predicated on protecting sport from hooliganism, racism and xenophobia, drug use and equal treatment for small and big clubs in the management of Community rights and in highlighting talent without engaging in the trade of importing minors from third countries.

Mr President, I first wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Belet for the wonderful job he has done.
Obviously, we all have our minor or major reservations on the text submitted, but he has made a good job of coordinating the work of all the committees.
I should also like to stress another point: in this area we are lucky to have a trusted partner in UEFA.
The way that organisation has worked in the past has shown that we can trust it to deliver on the goods it talks about regularly.
Therefore we have a partner we can rely on.
I will focus on only one sector, which is that of television rights.
The digital era should be about more choice for consumers.
Unfortunately, television viewers in many of our Member States are faced with less choice and have to pay for things they used to get for free before.
With our report we are sending a clear signal to the authorities that we need to strike a balance between pay TV and free-to-air TV.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate and thank Mr Catania and Mr Belet for the report which they have presented to this Parliament.
Sport, and football in particular, is an inalienable part of European cultural identity, plays an undoubted social function and can be a useful tool in combating discrimination, racism, intolerance and violence.
However, this positive function and role is today being increasingly compromised by those who want to make games in stadiums into yet another setting for violence and terror.
Safety in the stadiums should therefore be our priority and the key word should be prevention.
For this reason I fully agree with the call made in the Belet report for all the Member States to introduce cooperation mechanisms between clubs, supporters' clubs and police forces, to combat the violence, hooliganism and delinquency which we see more and more, including during the games.
I also agree on the need to step up sanctions against any display of racism or xenophobia in stadiums and for UEFA and other bodies to apply appropriate disciplinary measures to anyone responsible for any such behaviour.
A preventative measure that is equally fundamental, however, is to reinforce and professionalise cooperation and the exchange of information between national bodies when international matches take place.
It is also crucial to monitor the presence in the stadiums of fans who may represent a threat to public order and to obtain data on the nature of supporters' clubs, which is a crucial element for the host country to be able to successfully assess the risk connected with the sporting event and, in this way, prevent disturbances in the public eye.
It is certainly necessary to avoid abuse in monitoring all citizens and to respect the privacy and confidentiality of personal data, but we must not protect some people's privacy at the expense of the safety of everyone.
Nor must this become a pretext for allowing the uncontrolled entry of genuine delinquents, on the grounds of decriminalising real offences solely because they were committed in the context of a sporting event.
We must create a fair balance, weighing opposing requirements against each other.
This balance can only be found, however, while respecting individual freedom and protecting the rights of every person, and most of all the right to safety, including the right to go to a stadium and watch sport in peace.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs and especially Mr Belet, with whom I served on the Independent Review of European Football established by the Council last year.
Football has a number of problems.
One of these is the linkage of wealth and sporting success and the concentration of both in the hands of an increasingly small number of clubs in almost every league across the whole of Europe.
However, measures to counter this trend taken by the football authorities - such as the home-grown players scheme or the obligation to sell TV rights collectively with redistribution to all clubs - could risk being found to be incompatible with European law.
I was alarmed to hear Commissioner FigeÄŸ say that the Commission was still thinking about this and had not yet reached a decision.
That is why we need the White Paper to recognise if not derogations then at least sympathetic interpretations of EU law that recognise the specificity of sport.
That is why the contributions of Mr Titford and Mr Heaton-Harris are so misplaced: they are aimed at alarming the British tabloids.
It is nonsense to say that this is a power grab by the European Union: it is a loosening of existing EU legal requirements that were initially drawn up for other purposes.
That is what is needed. To portray it in the complete opposite way of what is intended is completely disingenuous.
. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating both rapporteurs, but Ivo Beleta in particular, on the results of the work they have undertaken.
The report that Mr Beleta prepared covers all the key elements of European soccer, ranging from its legal context, management, competition, the internal market and social issues, to combating criminal behaviour such as racism or doping, as well as combating corruption at football events.
On the face of it it appears to be an easy job, because football is a sport that arouses great passions.
The fact that this House is not immune to these strong emotions can be seen in the number of amendments the rapporteur had to take in his stride.
One of these proved particularly important, as it concerned the sale of the broadcasting rights to football matches.
In earlier discussions I supported a collective system, which would guarantee the equitable distribution of the proceeds of broadcasting, and provide a better competitive balance and the rivalry that sport needs.
Now, I declare my support for the oral amendment that has been proposed by the rapporteur.
As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would also like to express my gratitude for the fact that the report included employment issues concerning the contracts signed by professional players with clubs, the legal regulation of football agents and the transactions they make and education and training for young footballers with guarantees that the best will find places in club teams.
I am convinced that football can provide the basis for development and self-fulfilment, which is why I am pleased by the points included in this report which talk about the need to support clubs that provide young people with the right conditions both for training and for learning.
Finally, I would like to point out that the field of sport, including soccer, has become an area where the free movement of workers is truly taking place across the whole European Union and I hope that this will also soon be the case in other sections of the European Union's labour market.
(ES) I too would like to thank the rapporteur, above all, for the spirit of cooperation he has shown in the drawing up of this report, a report on the future of professional football, which is not just important for football, since it deals with problems that have recently been increasing throughout the world of sport: violence at sports grounds, racist acts, doping, lack of financial transparency, etc.
I would like to focus on two issues: firstly, the increasing economic importance of football, which has led to an increase in the value of television rights.
In my view, it is important that the report has taken up the concern about the system of income resulting from sales of those rights, which can cause a competitive imbalance amongst the different clubs, although I regret - and this is something that I believe is missing from the report - that account has not been taken of the fact that this income also depends on the club's impact on the worldwide audience, not just the national broadcasting market, nor that there is some redistribution of resources resulting from the sale of the broadcasting rights of national leagues amongst clubs.
Furthermore, I am pleased that the report takes account of the European Union's different national football associations, regardless of whether they are part of government sports structures or federations recognised by the Member States.
Finally, I hope that the Commission will take account of these suggestions from the European Parliament when drawing up its White Paper on sport.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, mirroring the right of every citizen to access to justice, pursuant to any of the constitutions of the Member States, Article 47 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrines that right for people whose rights and freedoms guaranteed under Union law have been violated.
The significance of these precepts is obvious: there is neither the jurisdiction nor any legal pact that can deprive anyone of their fundamental right to access to justice, although the exercise of those precepts can, in certain situations, be applied to what, in forensic terms, is known as a 'plea of lack of incompetence'.
Nevertheless, such exceptions must be recognised by an independent and impartial court, previously established by law, as stated in the aforementioned Article 47, this being a vital prerequisite to the exercise of its own competence.
For this reason, access to justice for a natural or legal person must never involve any form of disciplinary infringement.
The exercise of a right recognised by all constitutions and the European Charter must not result in an offence of any kind under the law.
That being the case, the Belet report enshrines the correct principle that access to justice, even when not justified in sporting terms, must not be penalised by disciplinary measures.
In this regard, I condemn FIFA's arbitrary decisions.
The vote on this principle will not only contribute towards making sport more transparent but will also strengthen the major principles on which the rule of law is based.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belet, for his contribution to the report on the future of professional football in Europe.
In my view, Europe is going through a period of particular uncertainty and is experiencing a stage of reflection.
This can also be seen in a human dimension that is very important for European citizens, which is sport in general and football in particular, because of their educational function and the role they play in social and cultural integration and also in combating discrimination.
This integration process was caused in part by the positive effects produced by the Bosman ruling, which in 1995 set out to create freedom of movement for football players.
In this context it should, however, be pointed out that professional football constitutes an economic activity recognised by Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
On the financial level the integration referred to has not been fully implemented, partly because of distortions in competition on the football market, caused by differing tax systems in the various countries of the Union.
Thus, in some countries taxation is advantageous, allowing their clubs to pay footballers quite a lot more than the payments that other clubs' budgets can withstand.
Finally, we should not neglect to highlight, again with regard to football, that the proposal for Community harmonisation in the allocation of television rights is not a real priority. This is because of the historical, cultural and above all market differences between the various European Union countries, as well as the conflict with the principle of subsidiarity as a basic principle that ought to be respected.
Mr President, five years ago in this Chamber I put forward the need for a European sports agency.
I believe that today it is more necessary than ever.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I thank both rapporteurs and all Members who took the floor, because many interesting points were raised.
Tomorrow you will have to decide on the precise content of the report, but much of what you said can be used as input not only for further discussions but also for work in favour of football and sport and Europe as a Community.
One of the important points is, as Mr Belet said, to ask the relevant authorities to sit around the table and seek solutions.
One of the messages is to work together.
We have had close and regular dialogue for many years with bodies like UEFA and FIFA.
The European Sport Review was discussed, as it continues to be now.
I mentioned at the end of my introductory remarks the very interesting event that took place recently in Manchester.
I have heard the divided opinions of British colleagues.
Football is synonymous with the UK.
We can convey many messages about the importance of cooperation for the sake and good health of football.
In football, Europe is a superpower.
I do not want to speak about geopolitics, but I have attended international debates where it has often been said, mainly by African countries, that this dominance damages international relations and the sport.
The Africans have been very critical of the Europeans.
We should respond with clarity and credibility.
There is a professional but also an amateur element.
This is a very important pyramid for football and sport, where both elements and the pyramid as a whole are important.
Money is not the most important thing, because, if it were, then the whole pyramid would be turned upside down and that would be detrimental.
For example, last year we agreed with FIFA to support African engagement, via children's football, to promote sport and integration.
This is part of the preparations for the Football World Cup in South Africa in 2010.
Two weeks ago, we met with sports ministers in Stuttgart.
There were two negative topics in the debate: violence and doping.
These issues were also mentioned in your report.
The ministers agreed to continue work on the establishment of a European network of anti-doping agencies, which is one of the contributions to ensuring the transparency and credibility of our actions.
Violence was also discussed.
We will organise a conference on sport and hooliganism in November with the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.
We also spoke about the economy and sport and social inclusion via sport.
For example, we agreed to produce more specific and more reliable data on the economics of sport to see how it contributes to the job market and growth in our countries.
This is very important.
The remaining points for the Commission and in the coming White Paper on sport are the following key words, which are a kind of mosaic for our relations in sport: specificity, subsidiarity, autonomy and, of course, diversity - which is so visible and important in not only culture but also sport, transparency, rules-based activities and relations.
However, all that must be implemented within the EU legal framework, not outside, which you firmly support.
In conclusion, we are now in the process of consultation on the White Paper.
As I have said, once these reports are adopted tomorrow, they will help in this preparatory work.
We have now received 670 contributions and more than 200 of these are collective, i.e. on behalf of associations and federations.
Therefore, we need work together to get it right for the sake and credibility of Europe, which also has broader international responsibility in sport.
Europe is a cradle of many disciplines, including football and the Olympic ideal and ideas, and we have to promote the values of these traditions and activities in a larger area of European cooperation and internationally.
I should like to thank all Members of the European Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (IT) Football is deeply rooted in European identity and culture.
Particularly, but not exclusively, for young people, it constitutes a vital instrument of social cohesion, informal education and economic and regional development.
Recently, however, legal scandals, rigged championships, violence, racism, multi-million transfer fees and the way financial interests have prevailed over sportsmanship have only served to divert football from its original spirit and to alienate people from football.
It is therefore important for the EU to act to clean up a sector in which we are world leaders.
As well as being a form of cultural expression, this sector can also continue to be a source of economic growth, jobs and social cohesion.
I therefore hope that football, and sport in general, will in future receive the assistance needed to regulate the many interests at play.
Above all, I hope that by supporting activities, meetings and events at local and European levels (and particularly by promoting access for young people, including disadvantaged youth), it will be possible to develop and protect the smaller sports and clubs that, throughout Europe, are an important tool for the civic education of our citizens.
in writing. - (IT) I would like to express my appreciation for and agreement with the work accomplished by the rapporteur.
The issue of football, and sport in general, is an expression of a team spirit and a playing culture typical of western civilisation.
I therefore believe that the right approach lies not in laying down new laws but in pushing the world of football towards forms of self-regulation that can encompass all those directly concerned - all participants, including football supporters.
Legal certainty should be sought by means of guidelines guaranteeing cooperation and solidarity among all stakeholders in sporting events.
I would particularly like to emphasise the need to encourage education of young people, the application of severe disciplinary measures to combat violence in stadiums and racism, the involvement of supporters in the management of football, the identification of a transparent system for the control of costs, fair competition between the clubs, and insurance protection for players.
For all these reasons, the adoption by the European Commission of the White Paper on the role of sport in Europe is eagerly awaited, and the drafting of an action plan for European sport in general and football in particular would be extremely welcome.
, in writing. - Due to the increased occurrence of relatively important incidents within the framework of football matches, one can only welcome the Austrian initiative to amend the regulation concerning security in connection with football matches.
The assessment of the international police cooperation following the European Championships in 2004 highlighted clearly that it is necessary to increase the international information sharing on risk supporters.
However, it is important that, as stressed by our rapporteur Giusto Catania, the exchange of personal data should made in accordance with the domestic and international laws applicable and should not be used for other purposes.
Due to the constantly growing number of supporters travelling to matches abroad, strengthened cooperation between the national football information points and a genuine international dimension is required.
By preventing and controlling violence and disturbances in connection with football matches, through international exchange of information allowing every Member State to make efficient risk assessments, the aim should be to help reaffirm the moral and educational values of football and even sport in general.
Ivo Belet's report on the future of professional football in Europe is a very important position statement.
It is clear to all of us that football plays a variety of roles in Europe, and that it has a considerable social and cultural function; this popular game makes it possible for people to meet and get to know each other's views, and it also promotes social participation.

Racism and xenophobia are social problems that are being expressed ever more strongly not only in our daily lives but in the world of football as well.
From week to week, we have been able to witness firsthand serious racist incidents at football matches, and, in Central and Eastern Europe, intensifying anti-Roma sentiments.
This sport, which enjoys exceptional popularity, is today closely associated with hooliganism and racist-motivated hate speech.
Racism and xenophobia are widely present in football stadiums.
In Central and Eastern Europe, the pitches resound with anti-Roma outbursts, regardless of whether a team with Roma supporters and patrons is playing
The popularity of the game must make for opportunities for the struggle against racism, for raising awareness and setting an example.
The European Commission and the governments of the Member States must take part, along with the football clubs, in the struggle against the racial hatred manifested on sports pitches.
More serious sanctions than what we have seen hitherto must be imposed for any racist-motivated incident in football; furthermore, it is indispensable that both UEFA and the national leagues apply the disciplinary rules in a strict and systematic manner.
Compliance with the obligations of Flag States - Civil liability and financial guarantees of shipowners (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Marta Vincenzi, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on compliance with flag State requirements C6-0062/2006 , and
the report by Gilles Savary, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the civil liability and financial guarantees of shipowners C6-0039/2006 .
Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, there now exists a sound body of Community legislation on maritime safety, but much still remains to be done.
The Commission wished to supplement the structure of this legislation with a new package of measures designed to further prevent accidents and to better take into account their consequences.
Furthermore, by submitting seven proposals, the Commission has taken the utmost account of the resolutions on the strengthening of maritime safety that were adopted by Parliament in the wake of the 'Prestige' accident.
We are addressing them.
Thus, the European maritime administrations will be able to set an example.
No ship will be able to escape an inspection in European ports.
The inspection of inspectors, or classification societies, will be much more rigorous.
A clear chain of decision-making will make it possible to provide refuge for ships in distress.
Operators will better fulfil their responsibilities to their passengers or third parties.
Finally, it will become possible to provide systematic feedback on accidents.
I am delighted that the European Parliament supports the ambitious approach proposed by the Commission.
Your rapporteurs have produced an outstanding piece of work.
The Commission remains committed to simultaneously examining the seven proposals and to preserving the 'package' approach, with the aim of ensuring that the proposed measures are effective and consistent.
For technical reasons, you wished to examine two of these seven proposals in advance.
By putting forward a proposal on the responsibility of flag States, the Commission intends to fill a void in the European safety system.
It is incumbent on the authorities of the Member States to ensure that ships sailing under their flags apply the safety rules.
Clearly, the situation in Europe must be improved.
It is not normal for member countries to appear on the grey - and even black - list, established by the Paris Memorandum.
It is not normal for there to be so many differences in the rate of detention of vessels flying the European flag, from 0.9% to 24.14% of extreme cases for the period 2003-2005, according to figures taken from the Paris Memorandum.
Let us be clear.
It is not a question of imposing a new layer of bureaucratic requirements for operators or national authorities or of adopting new safety rules, but of ensuring that the rules already in force are actually applied.
The Commission proposal is simply aimed at enshrining in Community law the rules of the International Maritime Organisation, which stipulate that flag States must implement international conventions, and at enforcing a measure that is purely voluntary - the IMO audit system.
Our aim is therefore to provide our maritime administrations with impeccable quality and, in this way, to work on the quality of our vessels.
In doing so, we will have helped to prevent unfair competition from possibly developing among European maritime transport companies.
I now come to the second proposal.
This proposal is about giving greater responsibility to shipowners by strengthening the liability scheme.
The Commission proposes to implement minimum rules that are applicable to all the Member States in this area - civil liability and financial guarantees - and to lay down rules that genuinely make it possible both to prevent accidents and to compensate for the damage caused.
Some will object that international conventions exist on this very subject.
To which I would reply that these conventions are imperfect, and reflect two points of view.
Firstly, not all of them have entered into force; they are even taking a long time to do so.
Secondly, even when these conventions become genuinely operational throughout Europe in the future, there will always be scenarios that they do not cover.
Then, above all in terms of substance, these conventions have a flaw.
They sanction a principle that urgently needs to be modernised: limitation of liability.
More precisely, these conventions define the threshold beyond which shipowners lose their right to limit their liability.
The problem stems from the fact that this threshold is fixed at a practically insurmountable level - inexcusable conduct.
An insurmountable threshold amounts to favourable treatment for shipowners, to the detriment of victims when the damage suffered is greater than the limit of indemnity provided for by these very conventions.
It is also favourable treatment for bad shipowners, to the detriment of the good ones.
Shipowners who have been grossly negligent - on the scale of faults, one degree below inexcusable conduct - and are responsible for major pollution, should no longer be able to benefit from this privilege of having their liability limited.
Our proposal falls within this context.
It is therefore both an immediate response designed to overcome the difficulties in implementing the international conventions and a first step towards modernising all of these texts.
Mr President, it is a bit late this evening for me to continue any longer.
I might perhaps be able to respond to Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary, whom I should like straight away to sincerely thank for their excellent work.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, full compliance with international rules by the Member States could resolve problems that as we know are of an economic and social nature and concern environmental protection.
Within the Commission and within the Committee on Transport and Tourism we have tried, in the directive under consideration, to emphasise three fundamental issues.
The first is the possibility of Member States fulfilling EU obligations with the contractual instruments already used to apply international rules.
The second is that it is not the Member States that need to demonstrate that they have applied the standards but the Commission that must demonstrate that provisions have been contravened and that some margin of administrative discretion, already present in the provisions of the IMO, is in fact necessary to adjust the application of the obligations of the flag State to national situations.
This work, which is the product of direct consultations with social and institutional representatives, has been evaluated and supported by the Transport Committee.
I would like to thank all participants, starting with the Members who tabled amendments: in the vote at the end of February, the amended proposal and the legislative resolution were adopted unanimously.
The amendments accepted, tabled and agreed clarified a position shared by all the political groups, namely that reinforcing maritime safety without burdening public administration is possible and should be achieved.
Moves in this direction are the changes to the system of inspections, which have become compulsory instead of optional, the system for communications to the Commission, whose contents have been slimmed down, and the guarantees of personnel training with mandatory practical experience at sea.
In order to promote maximum agreement, I did not wish to table my further amendments, since the objective is, here in the Chamber too, to obtain consensus and the balanced position already achieved in committee.
If, Mr Barrot, the European Parliament were to approve by a large majority of votes most of the contents of this proposal for a directive and that of my colleague, Mr Savary, as amended and discussed, with the political groups all lining up in favour of strengthening the Erika package, I think that we could rely on public opinion being fully with us.
Today the public is aware of the serious problems linked with maritime safety, and I think we can succeed in overcoming the hesitations of the Community institutions and any U-turns by the European Union.
We hope there will not be any today, especially just a few days after the extremely important Berlin Declaration.
Mr President, just the once will not hurt, and are we not much better off for it?
We are going to be able to legislate on a maritime safety package without any accidents having taken place.
On previous occasions, we had to mourn the sinking of the 'Erika', a catastrophic sinking with pollution at sea and the very difficult task of salvaging the wreckage, and the sinking of the 'Prestige', about which you know more than anyone, as a Spanish national, and which had a huge impact on our coastlines.
Therefore, I believe that the Commissioner should be congratulated for having proposed to us this package of seven texts, which must remain a broad-based proposal from the Commission and the European Parliament to the Council, even though two of them are slightly ahead of their time.
We have worked hard on this matter, and I should like, in this regard, to thank all of my colleagues, in particular the other political groups, for the excellent work that we have been able to produce and for the outstanding vote that we have obtained, which testifies to a very strong desire from Parliament to genuinely signal its consent, today, to this 'maritime safety' package.
It naturally falls to me to present you with a report - and probably a rather complicated one at that - on the civil liability of shipowners and of financial guarantees responsible for basically covering damages to third parties.
We are not talking here about damages between two vessels that might collide, or between parties involved in the transport chain, that is to say, between charterers and shipowners, but about damage caused to third parties, in particular environmental damage.
What the Commission is proposing - and I believe that this is really the minimum that should be asked of the Member States - is to ratify the major International Maritime Organisation conventions on liability and compensation of third parties.
From this perspective, there is a general convention that covers all kinds of damages, the LLMC, which has not been ratified by a number of Member States, particularly in its 1996 version.
The HNS Convention, which concerns chemical risks, has not been ratified.
We are completely exposed today to chemical risks, much more so than to oil risks, and we know that what is transported on Europe's seas is often very dangerous.
Then there are two other conventions: one on the protection of people abandoned at sea - you will have heard about these crazy situations in which sailors cannot leave their vessel after the shipowner has gone bankrupt and who remain berthed for months on end - and one on liability for damage produced by bunker oil, otherwise known as degassing.
What the Commission is therefore proposing is to have these conventions ratified.
Parliament voted for this proposal and wanted all these conventions - particularly the chemical convention - to be ratified.
This was not proposed directly by the Commission, but we would stress our desire to ratify.
Secondly, we believe that a regime for withdrawing the benefit of limitation of liability should be implemented for ships that belong to States that have refused to ratify the conventions, whether they be non-EU States or EU Member States that balk at doing so.
I believe that Mr Jarzembowski is very keen on this increased clampdown on ships belonging to States that have not ratified, the aim being to encourage them to do so.
In such cases, it is not inexcusable conduct that is reprehensible, but gross negligence, and gross negligence means that, in actual fact, the liability and compensation regime is infinitely more severe.
Finally, we have endorsed the Commission proposal to create a financial guarantee certificate and to monitor it by creating, within the Maritime Safety Agency or elsewhere, an office providing information on the validity of the certificates, particularly for ships that pass through territorial waters and that do not dock at ports, the aim being to guarantee a maximum level of safety.
I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a text that does credit to the European Parliament and that drives the Member States into a corner.
I am one of those who greatly suffered, when the 'Erika' went down, on hearing a number of Heads of State or Government, including my own, undermine Europe by saying: ' 'Erika' is Europe's fault; there is no legislation'.
Well, today, there is legislation.
It is extremely strict, and we dare the Council and the Member States to implement it.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) The truth is that I am speaking not just on my own behalf but also on behalf of Antonio LÃ³pez-IstÃºriz, who was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the Savary report.
As the honourable Members know, the two reports that we are debating today, drawn up by Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary, form part of what has come to be known as the third maritime safety package.
The fundamental objective of the seven proposals making up the package is to increase the safety of our seas.
Since we are debating two reports jointly, it would be impolite of me not to mention the report by Mrs Vincenzi, a report which we wholeheartedly support.
If you will allow me, however, I would like to talk more specifically about the Savary report.
The report is courageous and decisive and deserves my praise and my support.
It is not an easy task - none of the seven proposals in the package are - and it is not easy for everybody to accept, since we are talking about financial guarantees and responsibilities of shipowners and it is quite legitimate for that sector to try to water down that responsibility or postpone decisions with which compliance is obligatory.
Do not imagine that I am being critical of the shipowners in any way.
They are within their rights and their positions are legitimate.
I too originally intended not to go against the grain and I argued that competence should fall to the IMO in such a globalised field as the sea.
My view clashed with the general view of Parliament and in the end I was persuaded.
That is better, and it happened in the case of the double hull requirement provided for by our dear departed Loyola de Palacio.
The European Union took the decision first, and then the IMO.
If it had been the other way round, the accident that recently took place in Gibraltar would surely have caused a further disaster on a huge scale.
I shall begin by thanking you for accepting the amendments in which we call for the obligatory ratification of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage for ship fuels.
Secondly, I shall focus on an issue that I believe to be important and which I would ask you to support: I am referring to the creation of a solidarity fund to cover damages caused by a ship that has no financial guarantee.
We need to fill a vacuum in order to make this possible in the event of an accident caused by one of the ships that, in spite of the obligations laid down in this Directive, sail our Community seas without financial guarantee certificates.
In no event should the compensation for damages caused by a ship without financial guarantees be paid by the Member State, which, at the end of the day, is the victim of the accident, but rather, in our view, it must be met by a consortium which, like others that exist in comparative law, takes responsibility in such situations.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats essentially supports the excellent reports submitted by Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary on flag State requirements and the liability of shipowners respectively.
At the same time we would like to thank the rapporteurs for drafting these reports so skilfully.
Contrary to the fears of some sections of the shipping industry, neither of the two directives really impose any new substantial requirements on shipping or the Member States, and they therefore do not adversely affect the competitiveness of the European fleet compared with its competitors from third countries either.
Rather the two proposals actually only serve to make some long-standing international conventions in maritime law finally binding on all Member States.
If we look at the individual proposals for the flag States, then it is high time that all 27 Member States in the European Union complied with their obligations under the international convention in terms of inspecting their own vessels.
To do so it is not enough simply to sign and ratify conventions.
It also requires the Member States finally to make available the necessary equipment and personnel so as to carry out effective inspections of their own vessels.
When it comes to liability for accidents at sea, all that is actually happening here is that all Member States are being obliged by Community law finally to apply the 1996 LLMC Convention.
We are also calling for the 1996 HNS Convention and the 2001 Bunker Oil Convention to be applied at long last, which is surely not really an unreasonable demand of either the shipping industry or the Member States.
We can therefore justify our position perfectly.
In the interests of the environment and the public, we are demanding something that goes completely without saying, and I hope that the Council will finally understand this and be prepared to deal with these two dossiers accordingly.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, if I told my mother that we debated maritime safety at 11 p.m. after football, she would probably say: you Brussels people are crazy.
At this stage I would not disagree with her.
Nevertheless, it is good that the Commission has tabled this proposal because it is necessary.
In the Committee on Improving Safety at Sea (MARE), we have called for the European Union to become active in the fields of flag State requirements and liability and compensation.
At this point I should like to express particular thanks to the two rapporteurs, my colleagues, Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary, because both reports are tricky in terms of content and politically very controversial.
In addition, so far we have not heard any cheering, euphoria or shouts of 'bravo' from the Council.
That is why at this stage we should say once more to the Council - because there have clearly been misunderstandings - that the fact that we are debating these two reports today does not mean that we are giving up on the Erika III package with its seven dossiers, but rather that we are underlining the particular political importance of these two reports.
The Council, which is trying at Mr Savary's request to interpret the concept of 'gross negligence', would therefore be very grossly negligent itself if it were labouring under this misconception.
I agree with Mr Jarzembowski: the Council's attitude towards the Vincenzi report is very difficult to understand.
What is actually the problem with incorporating valid IMO rules into European law?
Similarly, in the Savary report what is the problem with including chemical pollution in a civil liability regime alongside oil pollution?
That cannot actually be the problem.
In any case common sense would support these proposals.
The message of these two reports is: the Member States should bear more responsibility for ships flying their flag and both the Member States and shipowners should bear more responsibility if something happens.
These matters are overdue: think of the Erika and the Prestige.
Thank you, Commission, for the proposals.
Thank you to the rapporteurs.
Now the Council is asked to conduct itself properly and not be grossly negligent.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I am here only to confirm what has already been said by my fellow Members.
Maritime safety is an issue that is too serious to be the object of tactical manoeuvres: too serious for the experiences we have already had, for the accidents that we have already suffered, and too serious for us not to predict that increasing maritime traffic will lead to greater risks in the future.
The Commission has therefore acted wisely in exploring every possible avenue to guard against any difficulties and to prepare for any eventualities.
That is the reason, which is certainly neither tactical nor trivial, why we believe that all seven of the proposals - designed to harmonise the forms of classification, to compel the States to monitor the vessels that fly their flags, to ensure that inspections of vessels are carried out in the ports, to ensure that movements of vessels are monitored, to lay down procedures for action in the event of an accident, to verify or manage liability, both with regard to third parties and with regard to passengers - must go forward together.
The fact that the two reports under consideration were both adopted by considerable majorities, and one literally unanimously, highlights the way in which the feelings of European citizens, whom we are called upon to represent, have been acknowledged. It also confirms that this is the right path to take.
The adoption of these first two reports this evening is a message addressed to all the European institutions: to the Commission, which has put them before us on the table, urging it to maintain its position, and to the Council, urging it to show itself ready to make true progress on the maritime safety chapter, so that we do not find ourselves some time from now - God forbid - lamenting not having taken action in time when we could have done to avoid potential disasters.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Vincenzi and Mr Savary for their valuable work.
There is no doubt that the maritime sector is just one of the areas crying out for tighter regulation.
The flagging of ships is a crucial issue, an issue prioritised by the International Transport Workers' Federation in its flags of convenience campaign.
I think it is essential, especially in relation to the Vincenzi report, that the report be adopted in order to ensure that Member States meet their international commitments in this respect.
We have seen disputes such as the Irish Ferries dispute and others in the sector, where reflagging has been used as a mechanism to sack workers so as to pay low wages for uncertain working hours and working conditions and to avoid labour regulation in the country of ownership.
Workers within the shipping industry need action now across the range of international instruments which will improve regulation within their sector and their quality of working life.
I am sure that Parliament will adopt these reports.
It is incumbent on the Council and indeed on individual Member States to respond accordingly and to meet their responsibilities.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to Mrs Marta Vincenzi and Mr Gilles Savary for their reports.
These are two regulations from the package proposed by the Commission, which I would like to thank for their comprehensive response to this House's expectations.
I would like to concentrate on the issue of civil liability.
Firstly, I will gladly approve the introduction of ceilings on civil liability, which I believe keeps it at levels high enough to ensure that in most cases the injured party will be adequately compensated.
I do not agree with the criticism that these ceilings are too high, because the ideal situation is one where we would not have to pay compensation at all.
I also welcome the compulsory civil liability guarantee whereby shipowners will have to apply to the authorities of the Member States for certificates confirming the existence of guarantees in relation to all damages caused to third parties.
It is fortunate that such a certificate will be issued by the Member States, as this will make it simpler to check the reliability and standing of companies.
It is also with satisfaction that I endorse the obligation to notify the presence of such a certificate.
In my view, it is good that we have a broader concept of wilful misconduct which will make it possible to hold someone liable for breaches that have been committed.
It is therefore suggested that the interpretation of wilful misconduct be broadened to take into account the concept of professional conduct.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we are living in the era of globalisation, which undoubtedly has its good points and its bad points, but which is fortunately enabling us to become aware of the great effects of human activity and development on the planet.
Amongst other things, the marine environment, which provides us with so much in terms of food, leisure and transport, is constantly being polluted, by dumping from both land and sea.
Of this pollution, some of it - the smallest proportion of it - results from unavoidable accidents, while the majority of it is caused by shipowners and operators who are still acting irresponsibly, ignoring international rules and safety practices.
The specific cases of the Prestige and the Erika stood out, but we must not forget the pollution that is caused on a daily basis by the uncontrolled dumping of bilge and cleaning out of tanks.
We are therefore obliged to employ all of the controls and resources available to us in order to put a stop to this criminal behaviour, and we must demand that all flag States fulfil their responsibilities, that they have properly qualified and experienced inspectors, and that their port authorities inspect the condition of ships' hulls and ensure compliance with the rules on the dumping of waste.
Finally, with regard to that last aspect, I would like to insist that the Commission propose legislation to oblige all ships to carry automatic devices for recording levels of liquid in bilge and tanks every hour, in the manner of black boxes like those carried by aircraft, to make it possible to detect crimes against the marine environment.
This is the only way to achieve our objective.
I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteurs on their wonderful work.
Mr President, honourable Members, allow me first of all to thank you and to congratulate you.
I believe that, although this text comes at a very late hour - which I regret somewhat - it illustrates the extent to which Parliament is now largely the guarantor of the European general interest.
I should like to thank all of the MEPs who have worked so very hard on these texts.
I believe, in actual fact, that we have here a package that should not be broken up.
These seven proposals form a whole.
They enable us to make the entire maritime transport chain safer, and for that reason, I believe that the packages should be preserved.
I should like first to address Mrs Vincenzi's report.
I should like to begin by pointing out that this specifically European approach does not seem incompatible with the overall approach within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
However, it is true that, thanks to the Community, we can promote within the IMO an approach aimed at having the international standards applied more effectively by all of the flag States.
This approach is not incompatible with that which consists, at Community level, in already ensuring that each Member State has a flag of quality.
In the future, it is the very quality of the flags that will make them more attractive and that will also enable us to better defend their high-level Community use within the maritime sector.
Shipping companies will also benefit from such an improvement, since these flags of quality will lead to a reduction in checks at ports.
Therefore, I am grateful once again to Mrs Vincenzi.
Furthermore, I would add, Mr President, echoing, for the most part, the committee's work, that I do not share the Council's reluctance and I am therefore going to go back over some amendments.
With Amendments 25 and 26, you amend the presentation of the criteria determining the additional surveys to be carried out by the flag administration.
I can accept this, but with one reservation: ships that have not been inspected in the last 12 months under the controls of the port State must not be exempted from these investigations. Thus, Amendments 25 and 26 could be reworked, and even improved.
As regards Amendments 43, 44 and 52, I would say that they weaken the proposal, by reducing the demands in relation to the level of recruitment of flag State surveyors.
Do you not think that a high-level qualification should be maintained?
Thus, Amendments 43, 44 and 52 really pose problems for me, and I cannot accept them.
Although many other amendments clarify the position, some amendments - Amendment 2, Amendment 6, Amendment 13 and Amendment 17 - are in danger of causing some confusion, because they refer to International Labour Organisation instruments and go beyond the scope covered by the proposal.
I am therefore unable to accept them.
Lastly, I should like to mention Amendments 4 and 12, which provide the Member States' authorities and private operators with the opportunity to refer directly to the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.
However, these amendments disregard the right of initiative belonging exclusively to the Commission when exercising implementing powers conferred on it.
They are therefore unacceptable to the Commission.
There you have my few remarks, which in no way detract from my support for Mrs Vincenzi's work, which is quite remarkable.
Once again, I am entirely convinced that the Member States should agree to progress along these lines.
This is absolutely vital, and, in the long-term, there will be a competitive advantage to having flags of high quality.
Turning now, Mr President, to Mr Savary's proposal.
I am very grateful to him.
He has stressed that this evening's two proposals are somewhat ahead of their time.
Yes, precisely, if we want to make progress, we must make a number of attempts to commit the Member States to a policy, to a strategy that is far more courageous and far more determined, in order to prevent any further oil slicks.
Will the directive enable us to increase the protection for victims?
Certainly!
As Mr Savary did a very good job of pointing out, the introduction of a compulsory financial guarantee system imposed on all vessels that enter European waters is an innovation in the maritime world.
The financial guarantees should be reliable and accessible, which is why we are proposing that public authorities check, a priori, that the insurance cover is sound and why we are stipulating that victims should be able directly to address insurers, in order to invoke their rights.
There will also be protection for victims, since a minimum level of compensation is guaranteed.
This minimum corresponds to the standards of the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (in its 1996 version), standards that are, I might add, sufficient in most cases.
However, it is true that the directive makes provision, in certain cases, for the benefit of the limitation of civil liability to be withdrawn from shipowners, so that victims can obtain compensation that is commensurate with the damage caused.
Therefore, Mr President, honourable Members, one can say that this proposal for a directive definitely moves our maritime law forward.
I should like to say once again how grateful I am for the courage that it has taken to face up to a certain form of opposition, and to move towards modernising private shipping law.
There is, in fact, no longer any justification for some principles of the maritime law in force.
They result in responsibility being taken away from operators.
Our aim is to have quality shipping, our own fleet and third-country ships in transit.
I now come to Mr Savary's proposal.
The aim is indeed to have quality shipping, our own fleet and third-country ships in transit, and for victims to receive compensation that is commensurate with the damage caused, which does not allow for the existing principles of law.
The key Amendments 10 and 20, on gross negligence and inexcusable conduct, are along these lines.
We endorse them.
You have also demonstrated clear thinking, because you have improved and clarified a number of elements in the proposal: Amendments 9, 11, 14 and 19.
You have introduced new provisions that we feel are precious, more specifically Amendments 16 and 17 on the obligation for Member States immediately to ratify the conventions that are pending.
There remain, however, a few amendments that we can accept in principle, but that we cannot adopt in full.
They are Amendments 23, 26 and 27, which refer to the creation of a new Community office for managing guarantee certificates.
The idea is certainly very appealing, but does a new structure need to be created when we have the European Maritime Safety Agency?
What tasks will it fulfil?
You will understand that we want the consequences of these amendments to be looked into further, in detail.
Turning now to Amendment 25, which provides for the creation of a solidarity fund.
We are not convinced of the need for this new structure.
Will it really be useful, once the directive is implemented, given the too few residual cases?
Then, aside from the practical difficulties associated with the setting-up of such a fund, how can we prevent the 'good' shipowners from paying for the 'bad' ones?
There you have the bulk of my comments.
A complete list of the amendments and of the Commission position regarding each of them will be passed on to the secretariat of Parliament for the two proposals in question.
However, irrespective of the few reservations that I have expressed on certain amendments, Mr President, please allow me to pay tribute to a very remarkable piece of parliamentary work.
I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs, to thank Mr Costa and all of the members of his committee, and to thank Parliament in general for this excellent piece of work which, I hope, will enable us to move in the direction of such maritime safety, which we need now more than ever, in view of the development of maritime transport.
In view, too, of the fact that, from now on, the reunified Europe will concern not only the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, but also the Black Sea and the Baltic.
We therefore have a pressing duty to make progress.
I am grateful to Parliament for having understood this and for having supported us as it has done.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.

Verification of the credentials of the new Members of the European Parliament
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say straight away that at the meetings of 26 and 27 February and 19 and 20 March, the Committee on Legal Affairs carried out the verification of the credentials of 56 Members, whose names appear in the annex to the Minutes.
Given the number of verifications to be made and the constraints on parliamentary time, we considered it appropriate for the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs to present an oral report.
The procedure for verification of credentials applies to the 18 Members designated by Bulgaria and the 35 Members designated by Romania.
In addition to these new Members there are three others, designated by the competent national authorities, to replace others who have left office.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has therefore approved a total of 56 mandates.
It is of course a particular pleasure for me to be able to report on the validation of the mandates of all the Members in question, and I believe that not only the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs but the whole of Parliament may welcome the entry of the MEPs for the new Member States.
(Parliament validated the mandate of the Members)
1.
Mediation in civil and commercial matters (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, just a little bit of respect for a rapporteur from my colleagues would be appreciated!
I shall be very brief.
It was not possible to schedule a debate on this report; there are no amendments; we are voting because we want to now open discussions with the Council and the Commission.
I also wanted to say that this is not the last word, and we reserve the right to reopen some of these compromises if necessary with the Council and the Commission to ensure that mediation truly works for our citizens and that we achieve our objectives.
We can now move to the vote.
2.
Community participation in the capital increase of the European Investment Fund (vote)
3.
Request for defence of the immunity of Giuseppe Gargani (vote)
4.
Review of the medical device directives (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have worked together so outstandingly well - the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee staff and the House administration, the Commission and the presidencies, both Finnish and German.
We have succeeded in getting the crucial improvements on which we had decided accepted, those being the clarification of reprocessing, where the Commission has promised us a directive specifically relating to the subject; clarification of the position of software, of databases and the phasing out and labelling of carcinogenic and mutagenic substances.
I now have two comments of a technical nature.
First, there is an amendment to paragraph (4), in which, contrary to what had been agreed, part of a sentence had not been deleted.
In English, this reads as follows:
'and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive'
(DE) and the figure '12' which has to be replaced by '15'.
Secondly, there is Amendment 87, where I ask you to vote against the first half, since an error has found its way into it.
Doing so will not affect its substance.
5.
Structural business statistics (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PT) It would perhaps not be popular for me to speak, but I should like to take this opportunity to make two points.
Firstly, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Members of the Commission for their cooperation and the three presidencies involved in this codecision procedure, namely the Austrian, Finnish and German, for their close collaboration.
I should also give a special mention to the German Presidency for helping to resolve a final comitology problem.
Secondly, I wish to say that the 170 amendments reflect well on Parliament's role as they reduce the administrative burden on companies in various ways: by eliminating less relevant variables, by exempting some small and medium-sized companies from having to respond to surveys and by encouraging the use of administrative sources.
This is just one of the points that, to my mind, could and should lead Parliament to adopt this proposal at first reading.
- Following the vote on Amendment 142:
(DE) Mr President, you were right to point out that we have a very large number of votes to get through, and it is evident that we now have votes that will, on a permanent basis, yield virtually unanimous approval.
Who was it who insisted on us having separate votes today, or to put it another way, could we not vote en bloc?
If the Socialist Group in the European Parliament agrees, we could vote on the amendments jointly, but we need that group's agreement.
(DE) Mr President, we can agree to that, but I would suggest that, if it is the case that these are amendments on which we have reached agreement with the Council, the committee should call a short meeting to adopt them accordingly, which will take only a minute to sort the matter out.
We cannot do the committee's work for it.
Are you requesting an interruption of one minute?
(DE) Mr President, although we can agree to voting en bloc, the next time, the committee needs to discuss and decide the matter before the plenary, so that we can then do the business in a matter of a minute.
I ask that this be communicated to the chairmen of committees.
(Parliament agreed to Mr Rack's request)
(Applause)

Organic production and labelling of organic products (vote)
- Following the vote on Amendment 111:
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 155, since Amendment 167 tabled by my group is reproduced in full in Amendment 171 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and since I believe it is important to bring together the largest possible number of votes in order to eliminate accidental contamination of organic produce by GMOs, on behalf of my group I would like to withdraw our amendment if we can co-sign Amendment 171 by the Socialist Group.
(The Socialist Group in the European Parliament agreed to the inclusion of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group's Amendment 167 in its Amendment 171)
- Before the final vote:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, on the basis of Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask that the report be referred back to the committee.
Indeed, Amendment 1, which requests a double legal basis - that is to say, Articles 37 and 95 - had extremely broad support in this House, being adopted by 585 votes.
Now, the Commissioner replied yesterday that she did not accept this amendment.
I therefore think that we must go further in negotiations with the Commission, while retaining the report - which, I am very pleased to say, is constructive - in its present form. We must go further, however, and I therefore ask that the report be referred back to the committee.
(Applause)
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to the competent committee)

Statements by the President
Last week, in the Turkish town of Malatya, three people working for Zirve, a Christian publishing house, were murdered in a particularly cruel manner.
This was a dreadful deed, one that I condemn in the strongest terms, and I would encourage the Turkish authorities to continue in their efforts to shed light on every aspect of this crime.
The Turkish Government has strongly denounced these attacks, and I would urge them most emphatically to bring those responsible to account for their actions.
The protection of religious minorities and of their rights is an important function of the rule of law in any democratic state, and this House condemns all crimes committed by political or religious fanatics against those whose opinions and convictions differ from their own.
I have to inform the House that the news has just reached us of the death of Boris Yeltsin, the former - and first - President of Russia.
We wish to express our sympathies to the Russian people.

Order of business
The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 19 April 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated.
It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:
Monday:
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has asked that the vote on Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo's report on the Green Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules be deferred to Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
rapporteur. - (ES) This report is the result of the enhanced cooperation between the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is going to be debated late tonight and there are certain amendments that we would like to consider in order to try to achieve the maximum consensus for the report.
This is why I would ask for the vote to be postponed until Wednesday, Mr President.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
Wednesday:
(DE) The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has moved that the vote on Mrs Bowles' report on basic information on Purchasing Power Parities be deferred until Thursday at noon.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I can be very brief.
This is just because we received a legal opinion from Parliament's Legal Service very late on Friday and we need to make a few comparisons with the text agreed with the Council.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(DE) The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has moved that it should be possible to submit motions for a resolution following the Commission statement on the strengthening of European legislation in the field of information and consultation of workers, with the intention that the texts be voted on at the next part-session.
Mr President, we are delighted that there will be a statement on Wednesday evening from Commissioner Å pidla on information and consultation.
We would certainly like an opportunity to table a motion for a resolution to recall the often-repeated position of this Parliament: we think that the European Works Council Directive needs to be reviewed.
We understand the position of our Liberal colleagues, however.
They would prefer to hear what the Commissioner has to say before pinning themselves down to a resolution.
We therefore request that the motion for a resolution be attached to the statement, but not voted on until the next mini-session in Brussels.
Mr President, we are against the motion for a resolution and whether we should link it to the Brussels part-session, because we take the view that important issues should be dealt with in committee.
We have committees in order to make the decisions of Parliament strong, important and reliable and therefore we stick to that.
An important issue should be dealt with in committee.
That is why we have committees in this Parliament.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The agenda was therefore adopted.)

Advanced therapy medicinal products (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on advanced therapy medicinal products and amending Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 C6-0401/2005.
Mr President, honourable Members, I am very glad that we are able today to talk about the regulation on medicinal products for advanced therapies, which has been long awaited, and is of enormous importance to innumerable sick people in Europe, to many of whom these new therapies offer hope of new and life-saving treatment.
I am not talking here about the common cold, but about such conditions as cancer, Parkinson's disease, AIDS, and other dreadful scourges.
So far, no single legal framework has been put in place, with the consequence that many patients are not in a position to benefit from the treatments that are available, or they end up being prescribed medications that are not safe.
By means of this regulation, we are preparing the way for easier and safer access to the ones that will save their lives.
The proposal is also of great importance for Europe as a centre for research.
With things as they stand at present, European researchers and manufacturers - who are often small and medium-sized enterprises - can neither grow nor hold their own in international competition.
Let me now say something about the legislative process.
While it is self-evidently a matter for your House as to how the procedure is handled, I would, however, ask you to bear with me as I appeal to you to come to a decision and to refrain from dragging the process out any longer, in view of the need to create unambiguous conditions for these innovative therapies, for which people have been waiting for so long, and it is for that reason that I am all the more pleased that three groups have put forward a comprehensive compromise package that will make a speedy agreement of that sort possible.
I am able to say, on behalf of the Commission, that we are able to endorse this package as a whole without any changes needing to be made, and I believe that the Council Presidency, too - although we have yet to hear it say so - is persuaded that the Council will be able to adopt the package as it stands.
I am perfectly well aware that we are dealing here with a particularly tricky topic, and we must be especially sensitive when considering ethical issues as important as this one, and so let me once again make it clear that our sole intention, with this regulation, is to ensure that patients get safe and effective medicines.
There is no other objective in mind.
The fact is that the regulation does not actually lay down whether or not medicines are ethically acceptable, and in this respect, we are abiding strictly by the subsidiarity principle, for ethical matters are reserved to the Member States, and we, in the European Union, cannot end up in a situation in which one of them can impose its ethical convictions on another; that is not on.
The only thing that is workable is that we leave the ethical issues to the Member States, for that is what we have always done.
There is nothing new about it; that is a policy that has been clearly established for many years, and there are many examples of it.
It follows, then, that the proposal neither compels the licensing of ethically problematic technologies at national level nor prohibits them from being used throughout Europe; the proposal goes no further than respecting decisions taken at national level.
The important principle that donations of organs and tissue must be voluntary and unpaid applies as a matter of course, and is already enshrined in other legal acts.
Reiterating it in this proposal would therefore be superfluous.
What we should do, whatever happens, is lay down common safety standards for such products.
I do not think there is any argument by which we might justify acceptance of a standard of protection that varied from one Member State to another, which - among other things - would result only in patients and their various diseases travelling the length and breadth of Europe.
Despite the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs, then, we should not remove ethically problematic products - those derived from embryonic stem cells, for example - from the scope of the regulation.
Let me say once more - and I do so in all seriousness - that today presents us with a unique political opportunity to adopt a regulation for which sick people in Europe, and the European medicines industry, have been waiting for a long time.
It is because this is an opportunity that we cannot allow ourselves to miss that I ask all the Members of the European Parliament to endorse the compromise package submitted by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Ries and Mr Adamo on behalf of their groups, and to reject other motions.
If this regulation is adopted, it will promote innovation, make our research and industry more competitive, and, above all, help to save lives and deliver people from grave suffering; all these things you can bring to pass by endorsing this package.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to address you today as the rapporteur on the proposal for a regulation on advanced therapy medicinal products.
Furthermore, as a medical doctor, I should like to address the progress in medicine of highly specific medicinal products emerging onto the European market to treat patients with the diseases enumerated by the Commissioner.
I should like to seize this opportunity to thank the Commission for its proposal.
The time has come to treat patients with products which are safe, efficient and based on non-controversial grounds.
Since the beginning of 2006, the European Parliament has been working hard on this proposal with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The final report was adopted by a large majority.
There is a broad consensus within Parliament that the report by the Committee on the Environment, as presented for the vote in this House, is excellent.
All stakeholders, representatives of both the bioindustry and of patient groups welcomed it after its adoption last January.
Last week three Members of Parliament, on behalf of their political groups - Socialists, Liberals and GUE - tabled a number of amendments presented as a so-called compromise with the Council and the Commission.
This individual action was undertaken without the knowledge of the rapporteur.
I would like to underline that no agreement was reached with the other two institutions at the end of the informal trialogue that took place last month.
Ninety per cent of these amendments are a copy-and-paste of the committee report with cosmetic changes.
The most relevant are the 10%.
These amendments concerning the more sensitive political issues are the result of an individual initiative of three of our colleagues.
As they mentioned in their letter last week, the interinstitutional agreement has not been finalised.
Furthermore, many of the amendments presented in the package do not have the support of the committee responsible, the other two committees nor of the rapporteur.
Therefore, I should like to urge all my colleagues to support the responsible report by the Committee on the Environment in the vote on Wednesday.
In order to speed up the legislative procedure, the informal trialogue with the Council and the Commission took place last month.
The three meetings showed discrepancies.
From a substantial point of view, several politically sensitive questions have not been solved.
From the point of view of procedure, the question was raised of the two amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs which were directly incorporated into the report under the enhanced cooperation procedure.
As the main rapporteur, I have tried to underline that the remit of that committee should be respected.
In spite of the clear provisions in the Rules of Procedure on enhanced cooperation between parliamentary committees, colleagues from the two other institutions and some shadow rapporteurs refused to consider these amendments in the light of the first reading agreement.
Apparently, enhanced cooperation is respected only when it suits certain colleagues.
It is welcomed in files such as REACH, but as far as advanced therapies are concerned.
Some go even further and misuse the voice of patients' groups, declaring that the enhanced cooperation procedure is undemocratic.
I would like to raise one aspect of the proposal which still worries me: the principle of subsidiarity.
In its fully harmonising proposal, the Commission introduces an op-out for Member States to apply their restrictive national legislation concerning certain contentious products.
In practice, this would mean that certain products would not have access to the market of all Member States.
Following the opinion of our Legal Service, this provision presents serious problems of incompatibility with the legal bases and could therefore be annulled by the European Court of Justice.
If this is the case, this regulation would become a fully-harmonising measure for all products including those prohibited in some Member States.
Here, the two amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs bring legal certainty by excluding from the scope products containing or derived from embryonic stem cells.
As rapporteur, I have to respect the diversity of 27 sets of legislation relating to embryonic stem cell research, from the complete freedom of research to the prohibition of killing embryos for research purposes.
If we do not support the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs, this regulation would de facto promote the development of products derived from embryonic stem cells, although this might be considered as ethically unacceptable by citizens and Member States.
As an elected representative of this House, I have the responsibility to listen to all opinions, to marry positions and to propose to our citizens a text which can be considered as modern, progressive and respecting universal principles and values such as human dignity.
I welcome the tone of the recent Berlin Declaration regarding European values, as well as the programme of the President of the European Parliament, who stated that the question of human dignity is at the core of his and of our approach when voting on European legislation.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to thank the Commissioner for his remarks about this proposal and report.
I warmly support them.
I should also like to state quite clearly that my committee, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, supports this proposal and hopes that it will go forward smoothly.
So we share that objective.
Next I would like to remind colleagues that the interest groups - the patient groups who are most likely to be affected by this measure and to benefit from it - strongly support the measure.
I regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field, but usually they are in the USA and not in Europe, which is to our loss.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work, but I have to respectfully disagree with him with regard to the two amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs which seemed to me, and to many on my committee, to be pushing in exactly the opposite, retrogressive direction to that of this proposal.
So I join in supporting the compromise package which has been put forward, particularly by my distinguished colleague Mrs Roth-Behrendt, not least because independent observers tell me that this package is in line with the ITRE Committee's position.
So naturally I support it.
(Interjection from Mrs Breyer: 'Are you speaking for the committee or on your own behalf?')
I am speaking for the committee, Madam; I am speaking in my turn, and you should wait for yours.
I would like to remind everybody that the world around us is changing technologically, socially (although manners may not be changing), scientifically, and, as we can see in this report, biomedically.
We must not deny the patients of the future the therapies of tomorrow.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. - (DE) Mr President, before I speak for the committee, I should like to point out an error to Commissioner Verheugen.
I think it is improper that he should give the impression that those who tabled the compromise had made sure it would make rapid progress; the very opposite was the case, for it was those individuals who put forward the compromise who voted 'no' in the first vote in the committee.
Now, though, for what I have to say on behalf of the committee. The Rules of Procedure give the committee a most prominent role in the treatment of ethical issues, and I trust that everyone here accepts that - not just the Council and the Commission, but also many Members of this House, none of whom, I hope, are seeking to deny the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs their authority in matters of law.
We have considered this report in very great depth and adopted a multitude of amendments, two of which in particular - I am referring to Amendments 3 and 17 - were referred directly to the plenary in accordance with the enhanced procedure and are extremely important.
The committee calls for the reference to embryonic stem cells to be deleted, but why?
As you know, the Court of Justice's interpretation of Article 95 is that a fully harmonised measure must not allow derogations for Member States, so, it being a matter of doubt as to whether the article would stand up to the Court's scrutiny, the committee has therefore proposed a precise wording supplementary to Article 28; that alone makes for legal certainty and clarity and is, most important of all, capable of standing up in the European Court of Justice.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, as the Commissioner has said, it is an exciting time in medical research.
We are on the verge of new breakthroughs, and the root for these is the development of advanced therapies, using gene and cell therapies and tissue engineering.
Gene therapy and somatic cell therapy products are already being clinically tested.
Some of the tissue engineering products are already with us.
This proposal is there to ensure that we deal with a complex issue in a sensible and universal way, through central authorisation so that we can pool scarce expertise at Community level, ensure the highest standards of patient safety across the EU and enable access to the European market and thus to all patients.
That is what it is all about and on that basis, I welcome my honourable friend's report and congratulate him on the work that he did, not only in bringing the report through our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but in the subsequent work he has done negotiating with the Presidency in the trialogue.
We needed to look at various issues: the hospital issue, the small and medium enterprise issue, the medical devices issue.
Of course, with this comes a number of ethical issues and those are important.
However, my belief is that the EU's job is to guarantee safety and efficacy, and Member States should take the ethical decisions.
I believe that is where we will conclude on this important measure.
We now have to look very carefully at the options before us in the votes on Wednesday to make sure that we take something through which has the wholehearted support of this House.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I shall say just two sentences about the substance of the matter in hand - with which all of us present here are familiar - and would then like to say something about the procedure.
Thousands of patients right across the European Union are waiting in desperation for new kinds of therapy that might alleviate their suffering or even save their lives.
To all those who think certain categories of therapy have to be excluded, in whatever country and with whatever laws being in force, I say, once more, here and now, what I said in the committee, and yes, I do mean it: you are cynical, you are irresponsible, and you should be ashamed of yourselves; now take your ideas and put them to the patients - face to face.
Mrs Breyer is not squeamish either, so you can say it to her as well.
I should now like to say something about the procedure.
I will do this in English so that Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik will understand me directly.
Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik spoke about tabling amendments without the knowledge of the rapporteur.
It is not necessarily usual that one clears it with the rapporteur, Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik.
I would have loved to do that with you, but you stopped cooperating at an early stage in the trialogues.
I want to read out what we - Mrs Ries, Mr Adamou and others here - did, so that everybody is clear.
We tabled a package of 75 amendments.
32 are exactly identical to the amendments from the committee; 18 amendments are slight linguistic changes; 10 amendments are working on a compromise which you and I already agreed on before you stopped cooperating, and 15 amendments are linguistic or legal concerns.
That is the situation we are in at the moment.
I now want to add something concerning what you said before on the interinstitutional agreement.
I think we should just have a result as soon as possible.
Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik, you also said that we should have a first-reading agreement.
I agree, because thousands of people are waiting for it.
I am very grateful to the Commission and to the Council, who really supported us in reaching a result.
From my point of view, they have come as close to Parliament's positions as they could - going further than I have seen before and further than I expected them to go.
Naturally, Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik, we compromised, you compromised and I compromised.
In fact I made a compromise as regards your group's position on hospital exemptions and other things, because I thought, as some of you think, we should have a strong, safe regulation which makes sure that patients get the best scientific support and the best therapies in safe surroundings.
As regards the so-called 'ethical' amendments, yes, Member States who want to ban the use of foetal stem cells should be allowed to do so, and, Mrs Breyer, everybody who says that the Court of Justice would deny that and would put it under Article 95 is either not knowledgeable - which you are not - and then giving the wrong impression, I am afraid.
If you read Article 30 of the Treaty, you are exactly sure that it says that public morality is always a reason to make sure that a Member State can ban something.
And that is what happened in the past.
That is what is happening at the moment in the European Union.
We have always said that those Member States who allow research on it could continue.
However, the patients also deserve the right to have the safest, best products available, and that is why I tabled an amendment on subsidiarity, to make sure of that again.
That amendment is in the package.
It says that every Member State which thinks a product should not even be produced there, nor marketed, should be allowed to ban it.
In other Member States, the patients should have the freedom to obtain it.
That is what we are here for.
Mr President, Commissioner, Secretary of State, given that the rapporteur has already done so at length, I do not wish to launch into a detailed description of advanced therapies.
I shall merely reiterate the point that this is an extremely promising area of research and medicine, offering real solutions for people with third-degree burns, patients suffering from venous ulcers, diabetes, hereditary diseases and cardiovascular diseases, offering hope, too, for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and offering a solution finally, one day perhaps, to the tragic shortage of organs, which results in the deaths each year in Europe of thousands of patients awaiting donations.
In other words, there are countless numbers of patients - millions of them - who are awaiting this regulation.
It is not just patients who are awaiting it, but businesses in this sector, too, for, quite apart from the quality, safety and effectiveness of the products, quite apart from the need to make them accessible to everyone, without discrimination, the idea here, with this text, as the Commissioner pointed out, is also that we stimulate research and innovation.
Well, on three occasions already, those seeking to impose on us their vision of ethics and morality - and the rapporteur is one of them - have delayed and are still delaying the adoption of this regulation: in committee, in the informal trialogue - as my fellow Member, Mrs Roth-Behrendt pointed out just now - and perhaps again on Wednesday, I fear, with a request for referral of the report.
At the heart of the controversy and the deadlock are medicines made from embryonic or foetal stem cells, which the rapporteur wants to exclude from the centralised procedure and thus leave outside the scope of this legislation.
Things must be made clear, as clear as our Amendment 62, which is in the package, and validated by the legal services of the three institutions, I should also like to point out: the Member States and they alone will decide which research and which products will be available on their territory.
Nothing will be imposed on them that contravenes their national legislation on ethical matters.
That is indeed, I believe, the definition of subsidiarity, and those who intend, in the name of subsidiarity - it is quite a feat, after all - to ban these products throughout Europe and prevent countries that want them from making progress, puzzle me.
For that reason, I formally reject Amendments 3 and 17 tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs, together with the package of amendments endorsed by Mr Gargani and others.
Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is simple, after all.
Our credibility is at stake here, as is, I would say in passing, the consistency of our work and of our decisions.
I would remind you that, last June, we were authorising the funding of research into embryonic stem cells in the seventh framework programme for research.
I urge you today to support this compromise package tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/European United Left.
Something that has not yet been said is that this package also has the support of a number of MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, contrary to what was explained by the rapporteur, it is accepted by the Commission and by the Council.
This package solves all of the technical issues; it is a compromise that makes it clear that it is not Europe's role to legislate on ethics, because, ladies and gentlemen, if the next few years are to be characterised by all manner of revolutions, it is up to us to give meaning to them, and to offer hope, not destroy it.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, despite the tremendous efforts made by Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik, the rapporteur, there may be significant weaknesses in our position on advanced therapies.
If the ethical amendments package is not supported, adequate guarantees will not be provided for countries that do not wish to destroy human life for therapeutic purposes.
Guarantees for human dignity may also be lacking.
Human dignity is currently under threat from the commercialisation of the human body, interference with the individual's genetic heritage and the possibility of creating animal-human hybrids.
Europe is right to set human rights standards for the world, even though this sometimes seems a hopeless task.
The question arises as to why we adopt such a passive stance with regard to biotechnology and advanced therapies?
We may be forced to give in twice.
Without a clear ban on the commercialisation of the human body we risk being forced to give in to the market, which will handle trade in cells.
Without a clear ban on interfering with an individual's genetic heritage we risk being forced to give in to a cruel, eugenic and inhuman philosophy.
Such a philosophy always gives precedence to the quality of life over its inalienable value and dignity.
We should be ashamed that Asia is now setting standards for the European Union in this area.
The legislation in question cannot be endorsed without the ethical amendments package.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the vote, the day after tomorrow, will put to the test how seriously we take the Berlin Declaration, which had a lot to say about values, and of whether we are willing to express those values in European law, or whether they are only empty words and a waste of paper.
There are three principles that we see as indispensable.
One is that the human body should not be exploited for commercial gain, and I have to tell Commissioner Verheugen that this is not laid down elsewhere; nowhere, in fact, is this principle laid down and made binding in law.
I am amazed at the aggressiveness with which some seek to prevent it from being so.
Secondly, we do not want any interference in human beings' genetic identity: we do not want tailor-made human beings.
Not only is that laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but it is also present in the bio-patent directive.
We do not want the choice of treatment to be determined by people's wallets any more than we want, in the future, modifications of genetic material that would no longer be reversible.
Nor do we want monsters and hybrids; what we want is for these things to be quite explicitly banned.
Were this House to unite against these three ethical principles, it would send a devastating message and would, indeed, in moral terms, represent a breach in the dam.
Since it is intolerable that naÃ¯ve hopes and false promise of cures for conditions with which embryo therapies have next to nothing to do should be used as a means of sending this House down slippery ethical slopes, we must instead send out a clear signal for European values and ensure that ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to take my turn in emphasising that the purpose of this proposal is not to harmonise questions of ethics or morals; it is for the national competence of the Member States to be respected as regards whether or not sensitive products are used.
Such decisions must be taken on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity and must remain within the national competence of each Member State.
The personal, moral and ethical views of each of us must not conflict with this approach, especially as each Member State will be responsible for deciding which type of products it will allow to be imported and which not.
The crucial question is whether or not we agree that Europe should decide which products we shall market and which we must ban.
My answer is no.
Let me now remind you of the package of amendments - Amendments 82 to 156 - which also reflects the six months of consultations and attempts to reach a compromise with the Council and the European Commission.
Our objective is to reach a compromise at first reading, which is what is wanted by most of the associations of patients whose lives, in many cases, depend on a leading edge medicinal product.
In short, the immediate application of the regulation would mean easier, faster and safer therapies for European patients.
Europe needs this regulation and it needs it now.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, imagine someone who is in financial difficulty and who is racking their brains to find a way of making ends meet.
They decide to sell tissue and cells of their body for payment in order to eke out a living.
This situation is conceivable if we exclude the ban on the commercialisation of the human body from the scope of this regulation.
I would argue in favour of backing the amendment in this respect, not least to remain in line with the Oviedo Treaty and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I am also extremely anxious about the technical scope in the area of medicinal products modifying the human germ line as well as those derived from human-animal hybrids, as these techniques greatly affect human dignity.
Moreover, there are major differences in opinion among the various Member States.
I therefore hope that we can keep these products outside the scope of this regulation out of continued respect for the dignity of the human body and for the choices of the individual Member States.
We would, in my view, also reinforce the principle of subsidiarity by keeping these products outside of the regulation's scope.
Since the regulation's legal basis is Article 95, which deals with the internal market, it appears possible, as the proposal is worded at the moment, for legal entities to bring charges before the Court against a national ban on medicinal products that are authorised at European level and to win their case.
This is something that must be avoided.
(FR) Mr President, this evening we are debating a particularly important advance, which should enable future generations to benefit from high-technology medical treatments.
European patients therefore need to be able to have access to these revolutionary products, on a non-discriminatory basis, because of the potential that they offer.
It is also important to guarantee that these products are safe and effective.
The fact is that, without Community legislation, the situation varies from one country to another and is unfair for patients: some have access to products, when others have to go without.
As you yourself said, Commissioner, in a situation such as this, there will be medical tourism.
Therefore, if we are to overcome these obstacles, we need a clear, strict, framework encouraging investment and the growth of the biotech industry in Europe.
The technical section is therefore totally pointless in this context since, on account of subsidiarity, each Member State has the freedom to decide whether or not to ban this type of cell technology on its national market.
I particularly support the technical package that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has tabled in the form of amendments and that takes up all of the points of agreement that were reached during the various informal trialogues with the Council and the Commission.
I truly hope that we vote in favour of this technical package because, by doing so, we will be able to reach an agreement at first reading and to fulfil patients' expectations quicker.
I absolutely regret Amendments 3 and 17 tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
They simply prohibit any form of centralised authorisation for advanced therapy medicinal products derived from embryonic stem cells.
I should like to point out that the aim of this text is to guarantee the safety of new therapies, while facilitating research and development and the authorisation of products derived from these advanced therapies.
Amendments 3 and 17 put patients' safety in real danger by excluding certain products from the very strict public heath requirements laid down by the regulation.
When patients' safety is at stake, any form of discrimination is unacceptable.
The implementation of a European technical framework, which patients and the industry have been awaiting for several years now, must not serve as a pretext for imposing any particular ideological point of view.
Mr President, I would like to thank those Members who participated in the detailed processing of this regulation.
It is extremely important that issues as sensitive and complex as this are dealt with under the codecision procedure.
It reassures our citizens, whose national parliaments cannot vary a regulation, to see their MEPs engaged in preparing balanced and effective legislation which seeks to enhance their lives.
The therapies which this regulation seeks to deal with have great potential for treating cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Regrettably, and not unexpectedly, some reactionary elements are falsely claiming that this proposal overrides Member States' rights on ethical issues.
They want to exclude products derived from embryonic stem cells from the scope of this regulation.
The effect of doing so would be to leave such products unregulated in many parts of Europe as regards their safety, quality and efficacy.
Contrary to these wild claims, the regulation does not circumscribe a Member State's right to refuse to countenance embryo, stem-cell-based therapies.
Indeed I would deplore such a ban by any Member State.
This regulation is about saving life and about enhancing the quality of life, not its destruction - as is being claimed by some in this House tonight.
We owe it to tens of thousands of patients and their families to do everything we can to encourage and make available the most advanced treatments for some of the most intractable illnesses facing our societies today.
We also need to guarantee insofar as we can that they are safe and of the highest quality and that they actually work.
This is what this regulation seeks to do.
I fully support the PSE Group's position and call on all Members - and indeed I would particularly call on all my Irish colleagues - to support this regulation.
Mr President, the regulation of tissue engineering products is both a necessity and an inevitability in the present era of rapid biotechnological advances.
Such advances offer a potential cure for hitherto incurable diseases.
But, as on many occasions in the past, one of the main obstacles to medical progress is not scientific limitations, but pseudo-ethical dogma born out of religious misunderstandings of God's real wishes for mankind.
Such misconceptions have sadly changed very little since the Dark Ages' comprehension of the physical world.
Accordingly, in these legislative discussions, we have again heard heated ethical disagreements and calls for the prohibition of anything to do with human embryonic stem cells, hybrid chimeras and payment for human tissue.
I ask you, colleagues, what is ethically wrong in using an animal ovary into which human genetic material is inserted in order to produce a certain human chemical and save someone's life?
What is ethically wrong with a unique human tissue being obtained from a donor in return for payment in order to use it in the treatment of a child's cancer?
After all, what is less ethical: to use embryonic stem cells or hybrid chimeras and to allow payment, or to let a child to die?
(PL) (text missing) and advances in biotechnology and biomedicine lead to the development of therapies described as advanced, including gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and genetic engineering, all of which should aim at preventing disease and improving the state of human health.
What has happened, however, is that experimental technology has been used to create animal-human hybrids and chimeras.
It has also been applied in cloning and in experiments to change the genetic heritage of individuals.
Techniques of this nature infringe ethical principles, and they are also problematic from a medical point of view.
They can cause side effects as they have a negative impact on health and they lead to the commercialisation of the human body.
The situation is aggravated by the intense competition between medical and pharmaceutical concerns.
It is not the first time this has led to the production of medicines or the use of D therapies with dramatic side effects.
Rejection of the amendments banning immoral practices reveals the irresponsibility of people who endanger the health and even the life of those they should be helping by condoning disregard for human dignity.
At the same time, solutions at European level can be a way of forcing acceptance by those who do not agree with infringing moral principles.
This amounts to a distortion of values and to putting the brakes on scientific research that complies with the principles of respect for human dignity.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we should be clear in our own minds about the fact that all those who have given their attention to this regulation want to help patients; Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik is a doctor, and so am I. Even though we may take a different line on some amendments, you should not take that as indicating any opposition to helping the sick.
Speaking personally, I do agree with Mr MikolÃ¡Å¡ik and with the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that have now been brought back in by Mr Gargani, Mr Morillon, Mrs Auken and others, which - and this is something you need to know, too - represent the position taken by the overwhelming majority of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as determined by a vote we took last Wednesday.
I would like to turn to a subject that has not featured in this debate so far, but is very important if we want to know how we can create the right conditions for the companies that want to help patients.
There is at present a whole array of small and medium-sized enterprises that are already carrying out treatments in hospitals, whether the people treated are in-patients or outpatients.
Quite some time ago, these firms came to me and told me that, if the regulation goes through unamended and without easier arrangements for small and medium-sized businesses under national licensing schemes, they would no longer be able to offer those services.
That, rather than this or that promise of miracle cures, is what we need to bear in mind - the real live businesses that are there today helping patients and who say that the proposal for a Commission regulation is not as good as it is made out to be.
Nor does the so-called compromise package offer the small and medium-sized businesses a proper solution for their problem.
Amendment 127 provides for SMEs working in tandem with a hospital to be exempted from the requirement for a European license.
SMEs working outside hospitals, though, and facing fewer risks, are obliged to go to London to get their licences, incurring many charges and having a complicated process to go through.
As one Member of this House always says, there are times when consensus becomes nonsensical, and this is one of them, thanks to those who cobbled together this so-called compromise.
Commissioner Verheugen said that we are not talking about ethics.
He went on to say that the principle that the human body must not become a commodity has been complied with.
What now, then?
Are we going to talk about it or are we not?
If the principle has been taken into account, then a European regulation on the subject exists, and, that being so, we have to examine whether or not it is any good.
Having been a rapporteur on this, I know that this House wanted more stringent regulation, but, back then, the Commission said no, citing the legal basis.
The legal basis has now changed, and so you ought at the least to think up a proper justification, rather than simply saying that the matter has been taken care of.
We need this regulation; I am all for us getting it, and have been so for the past five years.
For three of them, it was on ice in the Commission - not, admittedly, on Commissioner Verheugen's watch, but the Commission does nevertheless bear responsibility for this three-year delay.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Ries and others bear responsibility for another six months' delay, having rejected the report back in September.
Now you are giving us another month in which this House has to talk the matter through in proper parliamentary fashion.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation we are discussing today is indeed urgent and of particular importance, dealing as it does with advanced therapies, across-the-board quality standards, the more rapid availability of high-quality products, and, ultimately, the competitiveness of European businesses.
I therefore want to congratulate those Members who had a hand in putting together the compromises; that was the right thing to do, and it was done at the right time.
I, too, find this or that part of it indigestible, particularly those that have to do with small and medium-sized enterprises, which the compromise package rather tends to disregard, but this is one of those times when we all have to make a superhuman effort for the sake of coherence, in order that we might achieve uniformity of regulation, and, not least with the Seventh Research Framework Programme in mind.
To be sure, this does have to do with ethics, but it is also about the way in which different ethical standards collide and the challenge that that presents us with.
At the end of the day, though, it is about people, and they should come first.
What we are fighting about is the prevention of suffering, and that is why I should like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council, for I know, Mr Schroeder, that you too have done the seemingly impossible, and that is why I find so much of the hysteria, indulged in by the Greens in particular, quite incomprehensible.
Mr President, last month the Ukrainian Prime Minister came to the European Parliament.
In a discussion in committee, I asked him about the trade in human body parts, especially of infants before and after birth.
The Prime Minister acknowledged this gruesome trade and called it painful.
He reminded me that it also included embryos.
He said the problem was not only Ukrainian sellers but also the wealthy international buyers
He asked for our help to end this form of human trafficking.
Our help.
Tomorrow's vote will determine whether we have any help to give.
If we uphold the ban on commercialisation and if we exclude human embryos from the scope of this directive, then we will be able to do something about the wealthy buyers within the EU.
If, however, we give the green light to commercialisation and destruction of embryos, not only will we be unable to help Ukraine with the buyers who keep the trade alive, but we will also cause the same painful situation in the EU, whereby those who are desperate for money are exploited for their body parts to benefit those who are rich enough to pay for them.
(EL) Mr President, this regulation is needed and it is needed quickly, because medicine has advanced, progress is being made and there are also high hopes of innovative therapies.
I do not think that anything should be exempted.
Everything must be included in this regulation and the reason is very simple and very practical: does anyone believe that, if in the European Union we ban the licensing of certain innovative therapies which have been approved elsewhere, the citizens of Europe will not go and find these therapies?
I, of course, much prefer central licensing.
The only thing that I personally am calling for at the moment - and I think that the regulation covers this - is a strict scientific evaluation of these innovative therapies and full safety.
Apart from that, if we fragment and stop licensing by each Member State, just imagine what will happen in the European Union.
We shall have Member States which will have allowed it and Member States which will not have allowed it.
Moreover, as many speakers said, no one is prohibiting any Member State from allowing or banning something which has been licensed.
Consequently, I do not understand why there is all this debate, when the world is waiting for new therapies, when there are chronic illnesses and when patients' hopes are very high.
I do not think that we should be the obstacle to a future cure for Parkinson's disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer and so on.
I therefore think that we should go ahead and vote for the regulation, as tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, of course, I am against the two amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
(HU) Every time we begin talking about advanced therapy medicinal products, stem cell or embryonic cell therapies, or embryo research or organ transplantation, vehement debate inevitably ensues.
Our points of view differ widely, regardless of age, sex, nationality or political convictions, a sure sign of the complexity of the question.
It is no small undertaking to have decided to draw up a piece of legislation that seeks to provide a unified regulation of this border area between ethics and science.
For these therapies and medicines increasingly represent life and death.
By using, or by not using them, either way we are making decisions about human lives.
Advanced therapy means life for many thousands of European citizens.
It is the last ray of hope offering the prospect of a healthier, fuller life.
In the developing world, however, it can mean death, since the illegal trade in organs is already causing the maiming and death of thousands of people.
At the same time, our goal cannot be to stop the development of technology.
What can, however, be our goal is to find answers to the moral and ethical questions raised by technical advances.
We need the current legislation to point the way, to help ensure that technical development means an affirmation of life.
This is not a question of the struggle between good and evil, but of what is technically possible and yet ethically permissible.
I owe Mr MikolaÅ¡ik and my other colleagues gratitude for the fine compromise they have prepared, and trust that the legislation to be brought into effect by our votes will be on the side of life.
Mr President, there are many European families with members suffering from serious diseases.
There are also many medical researchers and therapists with the means to help those patients, and they are all waiting for this important piece of legislation.
It will provide the common legislative framework which will make these innovative therapies more readily, more widely and more safely available.
It is urgently required, it will be of great benefit and there is no reason for delaying its implementation by loading it with unnecessary ethical provisos and carve-outs that are impossible to agree with the Council.
It has been firmly established that ethical restrictions are properly within the power of individual Member States if they wish to limit or forbid.
Subsidiarity is the essential rule.
But there is every reason to have a European standard for regulating the safe use of such therapies where they are used.
So I ask my colleagues, and particularly my good friend the rapporteur, to let this vitally important piece of legislation proceed this week, so that agreement with the Council can be reached.
Many of our less fortunate fellow Europeans will thank us when this legislation comes into effect, but they will have great difficulty understanding if it is further delayed, emasculated or stopped altogether by this Parliament.
This is one of those occasions when it is really important for us to exercise our powers carefully and responsibly and let this matter be finalised.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can say that I agree with the rapporteur and therefore am also in favour of the two points included in Amendments 3 and 17, in line with the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as all the amendments proposed by that committee.
Someone said that they did not understand why this debate was so heated.
It is heated because it has to answer two important questions.
The first one is, 'Does the end justify the means?'
I recall that in Article 2 of the Oviedo Convention on bioethics we wrote that the interests and welfare of the human being shall prevail over the sole interest of society or science.
The first question is therefore as follows: 'In view of the fact that science is capable of crossing new boundaries, should we always do what science tells us?
Does the fact that something can be done make it right, or is there an ethical rule to say whether it is right?'
The second question is as follows: 'The human being takes precedence, but what is a human being?'
We can no longer ignore this question, which is of momentous, planetary importance, because the whole human rights doctrine, from which everyone claims to draw inspiration, turns on this one point: 'What is a human being?'
When we talk about embryos, we need to answer the question of whether an embryo is a human being or not.
This is not merely an ethical question, but rather a legal and political one, even more than it is an ethical one.
It is not a quibble, either, but a serious question, and it should at least make us hesitate for a moment when we come to vote.
Since we have already decided that the Member States can do as they see fit, I do not see why a different view of things should be imposed on them through a European regulation.
At any rate, I hope my speech will make my fellow Members think carefully about a complex issue that involves human beings - not just those human beings who are hoping for new kinds of treatment, but also those whose bodies and very lives might be sacrificed for the sake of others.
(PL) Mr President, essentially, the draft we are debating concerns the introduction of a centralised procedure whereby the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products could issue authorisation for the marketing of advanced therapy medicinal products.
The European Commission also wishes to ensure financial support for the firms manufacturing these products.
These proposals are worthy of support, or rather, they would be worthy of support if it were not for the fact that products that could be developed using controversial technologies have been included amongst advanced therapy products.
I refer to products created using human embryos, or developed from animal-human hybrids or chimeras, and also to pharmaceuticals that change the genetic heritage of human beings.
Several European Union Member States such as Germany do not allow products developed using unethical methods onto their markets.
The Commission's proposal contains an exclusion which would allow these states to opt out of the principle of a common market in the case of these controversial products.
It is now being stated that there is a legal error affecting both the draft currently under debate and the 2001 directive.
Supporters of that view argue that pursuant to Article 95 of the Treaty, which aims at full harmonisation of the market, citing it as a legal basis for a draft regulation on advanced therapy products implies creating an open European market for these products.
The European Parliament therefore found itself in a situation in which it had to choose between going along with the European Commission's draft or exercising caution and not condoning controversial experiments.
Members of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs were opposed to the idea of including unethical products in the regulation, arguing that regardless of Member States' rights and despite rapid progress in certain areas no compromises concerning human rights can be permitted.
They maintained that the principles banning the use of the human body for commercial purposes must be upheld, and that creating animal-human hybrids or chimeras amounts to an infringement of the principle of human integrity and an affront to human dignity.
Mr President, honourable Members, you will, on Wednesday, be voting on the regulation on medicinal products for advanced therapies, which has since early 2006 been promoted initially by the Austrian Presidency of the Council and then by its Finnish counterparts, and we have, since the beginning of this year, done everything in our power to bring about agreement without delay.
The regulation aims, in the highly-innovative and extremely important area of medicine production, to protect all the patients who need those medical products, and to do so by means of quality standards that are uniform across Europe.
The need for high-quality products for everyone in Europe means that it is true to say, as some of you have, that what is on the agenda today is in fact life itself, improved quality of life and the chance of new life.
What is also on the agenda, and not least in importance, is the competitiveness of the European biotechnology sector.
In negotiations on the regulation in the Council working party, aimed not least at achieving agreement with your House, it has proved possible, over recent weeks, to make decisive progress, and it is on these negotiations, which take into consideration a very large number of amendments drafted by experts and submitted by the lead committees, that the prospects for a good compromise, and also a rapid agreement between the Council and Parliament, depended, and still do depend; as the negotiations currently stand, agreement is possible on the basis of that which is to be the subject of Wednesday's vote.
The rapporteur has submitted a parcel of amendments, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and the Group of the European United Left have drafted their own sets of them.
Both packages draw to the fullest possible extent on the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and on the amendments drafted by it, and are therefore close to one another, although it is clear that it is the package produced by the shadow rapporteurs of the named groups on which agreement is possible at Council level.
However great our differences in debate, it strikes me as essential that it be stressed that what this is all, primarily, about is the quality and safety of these new and advanced therapeutic products.
Clear though it is that ethical considerations have a part to play in these deliberations, there has, ever since the cells and tissues directive was resolved upon, been agreement to the effect that we in Europe see ethics as subject to subsidiarity and hence as something for which the Member States bear responsibility, and it is for this reason that two ethically-motivated amendments proposed by your House's Committee on Legal Affairs could not be agreed to by the Council working party and would represent a definite obstacle to agreement between the Council and your House.
The German Presidency strongly asks you to bear this in mind when the time comes for you to vote.
Application of the subsidiarity principle ensures that national legislation - and I would draw Mrs Breyer's attention to the example of stem cells - is not touched by the regulation.
It is not we who have stated that, but rather the Committee on Legal Affairs of your own House that has made that clear, so that, for example, my own country's legislation on stem cells is not affected, while, on the other hand, the regulation gives all the others the highest possible degree of certainty.
Certain among you have - and quite rightly - had comments to make on the ethical framework, with warnings as to what might come to pass.
I certainly share your misgivings, and I am quite sure that the Member States are taking them into account already; moreover, I know of no doctors in this Europe of ours who would do the things that some of you have so graphically described today.
In view of the importance of the document you have to vote on, which touches upon the future of many patients in this Europe of ours, the German Presidency has a great interest in concluding this legislative process as successfully and speedily as possible.
We have a great opportunity to show the public how we are, in a very important field, capable of being very purposeful and consistent in working towards adding European value, and our sense of ethical responsibility leaves us no alternative to a rapid and necessary decision that will be a basis for quality products of high value.
We therefore strongly urge you, whatever misgivings some of you may have, to perhaps put these to the backs of your minds in view of the vital and higher objective of getting this regulation in place without delay.
For that, we - and in that I include the citizens of Europe and the patients - would owe you the utmost gratitude.
Mr President, honourable Members, if, if in a community of twenty-seven states, there is no consensus on an ethical issue - such as is the case in this instance - then the only way in which civilised people can deal with this state of affairs is with tolerance and respect, for we have to tolerate and respect the views of others.
I might add that it is also a fact of life for all of us that, while we do well to pay attention to what our consciences tell us, we cannot make that a yardstick for the conduct of others.
On this issue, for example, my conscience tells me that I could not take upon myself the responsibility not only for leaving this new medical sector in a legal no-man's land, but also for putting it in a situation in which - in certain parts of Europe at any rate - everything would be possible, with no legal bounds set and no stipulations as to quality.
That, then, is why my conscience tells me that we need this regulation.
My conscience also tells me that I could not take upon myself the responsibility for saying, to a sick person at death's door, 'here is a medicine that could help you, but there were some ideological objections to it, and so we are not allowed to use it.'
My conscience tells me that I do not have the right to do that, and that is why I say to you that the only way in which we can handle this issue is to do as is suggested here, that is to say, to allow those with ethical objections to act accordingly and to allow those without them to do whatever they want to do within the bounds of that which will be permitted by the regulation, which - heaven knows - will not allow everything.
Let me now say something about some of the arguments that have been adduced today.
As regards the principle that the human body should not be exploited for commercial gain, I would say, yes, that is indispensable, and you will find nobody who is more in agreement with that than I am.
This principle is already firmly enshrined in the directive on human tissues and cells.
The anonymity of donors and recipients, and the altruism of donors, are European principles that must be adhered to, and that is certainly true in this context and is something about which nobody can be in any doubt.
It has been said that the Commission proposal is ambiguous, that it is, so to speak, not watertight when it comes to the issue of national prohibitions and their remaining in place, but the representative of the Presidency has already given the answer that needed to be given to that, and all I can do is confirm it.
The changes needed in order to take account of the objections raised by your House's legal service are contained in the compromise package, which, as I have already said, the Commission supports, and I want to repeat what Mr Schroeder said, namely that your House's legal service has explicitly stated that these amendments resolve the problem, and that it welcomes that.
I would like to make it plain that it is a misreading of the Treaty to say that Article 95 - the internal market article, that is - would not guarantee that no products would be licensed that a Member State did not want to see licensed.
On this point, the internal market rules are as clear as daylight: every Member State has, at all times, the right to refuse to allow a specific product onto its market on ethical grounds or by reason of public morals; about that there is no doubt.
Since we can be certain about the case law, about its practical implications, and about the legal basis afforded by the Treaty on European Union, you really do not have anything to worry about on this score.
Finally, the technical package has been described as inadequate, and to that I have to say that the Council and the Commission really have been extremely willing to make compromises in order to get this dossier wrapped up early.
We did indeed accept the great majority of your House's amendments, particularly as regards small and medium-sized enterprises, in the form, for example, of reductions in charges and derogations from central licensing; all that is in there.
That which is in this proposal for legislation goes well beyond what we did earlier, for the Commission has already enacted its own regulation allowing small and medium-sized businesses going through the approval process a reduction in costs of up to 90%, and here too, or so I believe, everything that could be done has been.
So, then, let me ask you again to consider whether it is not indeed really high time that this debate were brought to a proper end, with a good outcome for those researching in this field, because they want to help people, and a good outcome for those who depend on these medicines for dear life.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Written statement (Article 142)
in writing. - (SK) We live today in a world of incredible technical progress.
But despite the advances that medicine has made, modern diseases still inspire fear.
The use of progressive treatments, including gene- and cell-based therapies as well as tissue engineering, are innovative developments that give great hope to patients.
There is no doubt about the huge potential of advanced medical therapies when it comes to providing revolutionary cures for serious conditions such as cancer, Parkinson's disease and skin burns, and therefore I welcome the regulation of the European Commission aimed at harmonising procedures in this field across the EU, and ensuring that sufferers have safe cures for these serious ailments.
The elimination of barriers on the European market will give patients greater access to existing cures through the Europe-wide licensing of these products.
However, in order to maintain the underlying principles of the internal market and in the interest of its proper functioning, as well as to secure the legal bases, this regulation should apply only to cell-based products that may in the near future be actually introduced on the market and which do not arouse controversy.
For this reason it is quite unacceptable to ignore the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is the main body responsible for ethical issues in new technologies in the European Parliament.
Finally I would like to congratulate rapporteur MikolÃ¡Å¡ik and thank him for his principled position on ethical matters and for his personal integrity based on the Oviedo Agreement and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Enforcement of intellectual property rights (criminal measures) (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Zingaretti, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights - C6-0233/2005 -
Mr President, honourable Members, infringements of intellectual property rights are on a continuing upward curve and now constitute a really serious threat to the European economy and to European society.
