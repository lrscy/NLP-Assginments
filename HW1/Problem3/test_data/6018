Everything seems to run more smoothly on paper but, in practice, we see, for example, that, in most countries, the Roma are still really being treated like second-class citizens and that we are still being confronted with third-world situations which are on a par with the worst slums in Africa and in third-world cities.
As for the treatment of other minorities, what is written so neatly on paper and in laws appears, once again, not to bear any resemblance to reality.
I would, for example, like to refer to the treatment of the Hungarian minority both in Slovakia and in Romania.
It is not looking so good in practice as it is on paper.
Communication with the population is a major problem because people have substituted a spontaneous enthusiasm for Europe with a more critical stance.
If no promises are made or promises remain unfulfilled, this critical attitude will naturally increase.
However, I do wonder whether the Commission is pursuing the right policy by not addressing the people in those countries in the language of those people.
Is it safe to leave communication entirely to the governments?
I have noticed that some governments do not even inform their own MPs, never mind whether the population knows what is being said at the wonderful Infopoint in Warsaw in all Member State languages apart from Polish.
I wonder whether we are communicating or simply hiding?
Mr President, I was very pleased about the speech given on behalf of the Presidency, and I was particularly glad that importance was attached to how people in the candidate countries experience the situation.
We must not ignore the fact that there are to be referendums in quite a lot of the candidate countries.
I hope that people in the candidate countries read, in particular, that part of Mr Brok' s report consisting of the statements from the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for these, in my opinion, give due weight to what is really important to the individual citizen.
I hope, however, that they do not read the part concerning the common foreign and security policy and, in particular, NATO membership.
We all know that a common European defence would cost a fair amount of money.
Calculations show that, for our part of Europe, it would mean a 50% increase in budgets.
I dare not even imagine what it would mean for the candidate countries.
I hope that people read the good part of the reports, and I hope that it is this, and not all the other parts, that will be pivotal to the enlargement process.
Mr President, I should like to thank and congratulate all the rapporteurs.
To pick up on something Mr Haarder has already mentioned, our duty and responsibility is to the countries of eastern Europe, not because of the gift that we give them but because of the new enthusiasm and spirit that they can bring into what is becoming a stagnating European Union.
In particular I want to focus on Hungary.
As one of the leaders and front runners for enlargement, it has proved itself capable of throwing off the yoke of totalitarian communism and building a new market-based economy, creating new opportunities in education, improving its infrastructure and industrial capacity and developing its tourism and agriculture.
It has already completed 22 of its 31 chapters of accession to the European Union.
I welcome the implementation of the SAPARD programme to help further rural development and community development within Hungary.
In particular, I call upon the Commission to help alleviate some of the difficulties the Hungarian negotiators are facing with internal bureaucracies within the Commission and speed up that whole process.
In conclusion, we must open our arms and welcome the rejuvenation that the arrival of the countries from central and eastern Europe will bring about.
Mr President on the basis of the Christian idea of charity, I wholeheartedly support enlargement of the European Union.
Much to my delight, the Communist system collapsed in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989.
That happiness was generally shared in Western Europe at the time.
It now requires a sequel, namely our aid to the candidate countries, to enable them to join the European Union and, in that way, actually return to Europe.
This line of thinking also shows realism, for the predominantly eastward enlargement of the Union benefits the Member States and candidate countries politically and economically speaking.
Just to give you an example: after 1988, reciprocal trade experienced turbulent growth.
The resolution following Mr Brok' s oral question is right, therefore, to underline the shared benefits of the enlargement process.
However, this view of enlargement is definitely not shared by everyone. This is borne out by recent opinion polls.
These studies show a contrast between general public opinion in the candidate countries and that within the 15 EU Member States.
In the candidate countries, enlargement is widely supported.
In the Member States, however, only 43% of the citizens can muster any real enthusiasm.
In fact, in a number of EU countries, those against outnumber those in favour by quite a margin.
As if the burden and insecurities of this major enlargement were to rest on EU shoulders only.
Moreover, Mr Brok' s motion for a resolution does not take account of this imbalanced public opinion.
It encourages both Member States and candidate countries to provide their populations with more and better information.
I fear that that will not entirely cause the noted lack of European commitment to disappear.
Whatever the case, the incentive in the resolution is mainly aimed at the Member States.
However, those in favour are not alone by any means.
The EU Member States are most definitely populated by scores of people who feel for Central and Eastern Europeans.
The extent of their initiatives, private or church-based, since time immemorial, and often long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, speak for themselves.
Members of the Council and the Commission: make sure you definitely involve these allies in your information campaigns on enlargement.
I would like to turn to another point of the motion for a resolution which caught my attention.
Paragraph 49 states that there is no need for candidate countries to meet stricter conditions than the Member States themselves.
That seems to me to be self-evident.
What is more, the European Union has explicitly restricted its admission requirements to compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
As long as the candidate countries cannot co-determine far-reaching cooperation in various areas of policy - such as the CFSP and the asylum, immigration and monetary policies - the European Union may not impose new criteria in these areas.
Mr President, there is a saying in Dutch which means that the last mile is the longest one.
This will once again be apparent when we complete the accession negotiations with candidate countries which have made most progress.
After all, there are a number of difficult issues left to deal with.
I hope that the European Union will know how to give a tangible sign of its willingness to enlarge.
Moreover, to quote the well-known biblical saying, it is better to give than to receive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following today' s debate on enlargement, we will have to reach a verdict on an overall motion for a resolution formulated by our fellow member, Mr Brok.
The merit of this text is that it takes the decision of the Irish people to reject the Nice Treaty seriously and does not disguise, and I quote, "the uncertainty" that this brings into "the timetable for enlargement".
We are therefore very pleased to see Mr Brok himself include, in point 2 of his motion for a resolution, the recommendation made by us the very day after the Irish vote, to include alternative solutions within the framework of the accession treaties.
On the other hand, it is completely unacceptable to exploit the result of the Irish referendum to justify the abandonment of the intergovernmental process.
If current Intergovernmental Conference practice is often opaque and unintelligible, this is not due to the method itself which associates governments that have been democratically elected by their citizens.
It would not be at all difficult to make the intergovernmental process more transparent and comprehensible.
We must take practical steps to achieve this, keeping away from the pursuit of ideologies which, when we do not approve of a decision, lead us to conclude that, in order to prevent such a thing being repeated, the legal framework within which it occurred needs to be abolished by majority vote.
This really would be a case of hallucinatory thinking, or, as our fellow member Mr Berthu stated last night, a regulatory illusion.
The lesson to be learnt from the Irish referendum is certainly not that we must make the process of European integration even more undemocratic.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and political benefits of enlargement will undoubtedly be far greater than its probable cost to the budget.
I would add that this is already the case today.
Nevertheless, it is our task precisely as one arm of the budgetary authority to discuss and engage in some serious and sober preliminary budgetary planning - at the same time allaying our emotions and fears - and to approach the figures in a rational way.
On the basis of our experience with the pre-accession programme and given the take-up capacities and administrative structures in the new Member States, we can also assume that in respect of both agricultural policy and the Structural Funds integration into the Community programmes will be gradual.
On this basis, even if ten new countries join before 2006 in a big bang, we will be able to meet the financial requirements of enlargement up until then within the financial perspective, as agreed in Agenda 2000: EUR 7 billion in the final stage for agricultural policy given gradual integration and from EUR 6.1 billion in 2004 to around EUR 10.9 billion for structural policy, and this compared with a current Commission preliminary draft budget of around EUR 100 billion for 2002 to put it in context.
There is no doubt, however, that for the period after 2006, even taking into account compliance with future world trade obligations, we will very probably have to discuss the issue of revenue and expenditure in the European budget because in the final stages in 2013 these comparative figures could amount to EUR 17 billion and EUR 26 billion respectively.
Let us not confine ourselves to looking at these two areas of budgetary policy.
I have grave concerns about whether the Commission's reflections on how Europe is to be governed or the practical plans in this House to overcome the languages problem really do take sufficient account of the requirements which will need to be met if we really are to safeguard European national identities and preserve the ability of the European institutions to act in the interests of the citizens of a larger European Union.
A further far more intensive debate needs to be initiated here to ensure that we are capable of acting in the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of Estonia and Latvia has been rapid and I congratulate those nations on such an achievement.
Freedom and independence incite nations into action.
This should also be the case with people, and the control of individuals over their own lives needs, of course, to improve.
This is not a project for some Ã©lite, and this point must now become clear in these applicant countries.
Europe's boom phase of economic growth has now ended.
In the opinion of many we are on the way to a downturn, even a recession.
This economic standstill will affect those applicant countries even more than our economies, since the former are considerably more frail.
The popularity of the Union has, however, declined in many applicant countries such as Estonia to less than half of what it was, even before this economic standstill which has now taken place in Europe.
The fact that a severe budgetary discipline has been followed is, in these Member States, seen as one reason for this.
A downturn would reduce further the popularity enjoyed by the Union.
For this reason then I ask, and urge as a priority, that we energetically seize the challenge of narrowing social differences and the social and economic gulf, since this is the base upon which we will be able to get the large majority of people in these countries to support membership.
This also means that unemployment within the Union itself must not grow, otherwise it will erode the very base and the broad support for enlargement which exist here within the Union.
In other words, the worsening economic situation may pose a threat to enlargement within the agreed or envisaged timetable.
Therefore, let us get to grips with social inequality before this entire matter is pushed too far into the future.
Mr President, it is fantastic to live through this exciting period in the history of Europe when we are finally unifying the continent.
I hope that, in just a few years' time, our new friends and colleagues will be able to sit down here with us in the Chamber instead of just listening from the gallery.
We shall then be able to unite in solving the problems that exist and in creating good conditions of life for the citizens of Europe, and not before time.
It will soon be twelve years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and many Europeans promised that those countries which had finally thrown off the yoke of communism would quickly be able to obtain membership of the EU.
There is still a great deal to do, and this is also described in the excellent reports we are discussing today.
Great progress is being made, and I am delighted that the Belgian presidency has such lofty ambitions.
It is important that no more demands should be made now.
There is more than a little to do in the EU, as well.
Many of us are disappointed at the poor result from Nice and hope that Laeken will prove to be very ambitious.
Integration is a mutual process that requires efforts on the part both of ourselves and of the future Member States.
However, we together have a huge task in convincing the population in all the countries of the practical benefits of a united Europe.
It is also a question of communicating pride in the Europe we have built so far and the Europe we shall build together.
Mrs President, Commissioner, in the current political situation there is no political alternative to enlargement supported by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, as our group chairman has already stated.
The future of the European Union is not and should not be enlargement, contrary to what the President-in-Office of the Council said in his introductory speech.
The future after 2004 of an enlarged Union is uncharted territory.
The Union could be a consolidated free trade area, or else a supranational Union where objectives of sustainable development and social cohesion are the fundamental objectives of a reformed policy.
If we fight for this second option, then the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2003-2004 will be the last chance for the Fifteen to correct the failures of Nice and assume their responsibilities so that a Union of 27 Member States can be governed democratically and effectively.
The question is not, however, of a purely institutional nature: it is also a budgetary issue.
If a policy of solidarity between the Member States is pursued, this means that, in the future, the Union' s financial resources will have to be increased for, in economic terms, the integration of the markets of the candidate countries with those of the Union has been taking place for 10 years at the cost of increasing territorial and social inequalities in the candidate countries.
Current European aid is essential and alleviates the cost of the transition, but if we really want to preserve a model of European society based upon solidarity and negotiation between all players in a 27-State European Union, there needs to be a clear commitment from both sides to this objective that exceeds the commitment to incorporating the Community acquis and will oblige each of the 15 current members to provide additional aid.
If we want enlargement to be a success whilst preserving our chances of an interdependent Europe, we must not, as Mr Verheugen rightly said, bury our heads in the sand.
From this point of view, I am very shocked by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy' s rejection of the majority of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Mr President, I think this is an excellent set of reports and that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has done a good job.
Having said which, I think that no-one can hide their concern about how the enlargement of the European Union is proceeding and about the serious repercussions, especially the social repercussions, in a number of countries moving towards accession.
As president of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should like to say that, yes, there has been important intervention on the part of the European Union and issues such as the nuclear sector, restructuring of the agricultural sector and investment programmes in Bulgaria have been given positive momentum; however, at the same time, I cannot, for example, ignore the recent EUROSTAT report published a week ago, which shows that social rights fought for in Bulgaria are literally being demolished.
I think we need to look into all this.
Mr President, I am pleased to participate in this important debate on the enlargement of the European Union and in particular to acknowledge progress on Malta's application for membership.
This House was pleased when in September 1998 the government of Malta informed the Presidency of its intention to reactivate Malta's application and since then, with the structures put in place by the government, Malta has demonstrated its sincerity and determination to become part of an integrated and enlarged Europe.
Coming as I do from a small island state similar to Malta, I can testify to the EU's commitment to the development of small and underdeveloped peripheral regions.
In my view, despite the many criticisms, the vision of Europe's founding fathers continues to be realised.
I look forward to the participation of Malta and other applicant countries in the Europe of the new millennium.
It is worth noting that by June 2001 Malta had closed negotiations on over 17 different chapters, including important issues ranging from education and training to telecommunications, fisheries and consumer protection.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make five points from the point of view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Firstly, where the reunification of Europe is concerned, all of us are aware of its historical dimension and our own political and moral responsibility.
It must succeed and it will succeed because it is right and proper.
Secondly, the economic data show positive developments.
Economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe continues to be above the EU average.
The macroeconomic situation has improved.
EU exports to the accession countries are on the up and the accession countries are already benefiting now from the accession negotiations because under this process they are also being given orientation aid for necessary reforms, which would have had to be implemented anyway after 50 years of Communist dictatorship, even if they did not have the prospect of joining the EU.
Thirdly, and the Commissioner touched on this, economic and monetary union - the euro - will not be achieved immediately upon accession.
It is important that we point out that once the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled, the Maastricht criteria will need to be met - without any opting-out clauses and that this will probably require at least another three, four, five or more years.
Fourthly, money and balance sheets are, after all, not the be-all and end-all.
The economic indicators are positive, but they are only a means to an end and not an end in themselves.
We said this today in the debate on the Middle East: a means to an end which is to create peace, provide security, guarantee social stability, build up a democratic polity and safeguard growth and employment.
Fifthly, there is much to be done: to meet the stability criteria, to regulate state aid, to remove regional disparities, to reform pensions, social security and health services, to make rapid progress on privatisation, and to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and the public authorities.
We have reached an important stage.
We look towards the goal with optimism.
Mr President, I wish to join with others in also expressing my delight at the support shown for enlargement today.
It is crucial that the EU send out a signal that we desire enlargement for our own sakes. It is also important, however, that there should be broad grassroots support for the project among the populations of the candidate countries.
It is, of course, the countries themselves that must hold the debates on membership, but it is also our task to ensure that the conditions are of such a kind that this development is perceived as progress by the populations of the candidate countries too and that they are not given the feeling that it is a case of the strong riding roughshod over the weak.
Enlargement must therefore be based upon mutuality, respect and equality. Above all, we must, for our part, understand that there will naturally be changes to the way in which the EU develops once new countries and people come on board.
Their starting points are not always the same as ours, and it is precisely that fact which can also be a source of enrichment for us.
Mr President, I welcome the debate this afternoon and welcome Mr Verheugen's comments this morning, which were extremely positive.
I should like to make one crucial point.
The key to the enlarged community has to be the integrity of the single market.
We must ensure that the complete integrity of that single market will emerge at the end of these negotiations.
If it is not the case, then there will be considerable resistance to enlargement from businesses in the Community and from the workers in the Community who feel themselves disadvantaged.
I take one particular example.
Recently in the Czech Republic there was restructuring in the banking sector.
One of the major banks in the Czech Republic - IPB - was forced into administration and this was done to the benefit of another bank - CSOB.
There appears to have been some use of state aids to support the position of the CSOB in order to support the position of a private sector rival to the IPB.
Clearly that whole saga is very unsatisfactory.
It is not transparent and it is not in accordance with the terms of the association agreement.
We must ensure that those sorts of events do not continue to happen.
As chairman of the joint parliamentary committee, I should also like to say a few words in relation to Lithuania.
I welcome Mrs Souladakis' report.
It is clear that the Lithuanian government has made enormous strides to catch up.
I am very hopeful that they will be alongside the original group within the next 12 months.
But again, they have to ensure implementation of the single market, particularly as regards counterfeiting in the audiovisual sector.
Ladies and gentlemen, it will not come as a surprise to anyone that I, as a member of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, will be broaching the subject of women, for a not inconsiderable majority of the population of the candidate countries consists of women.
Very vulnerable women, at that.
Let us not forget that most accession countries are also countries of origin and transit of trafficking in women.
Let us also, therefore, discuss women for a change, as opposed to farmers, employers, trade unions, and the like. Let us talk about this large majority whom we wish to make Europe-minded and not frightened of Europe.
If we do not devote any attention to that group, things are bound to go wrong.
We therefore need to set up a proper information campaign by means of which women' s organisations, but also all individual women in the country or in the cities, can be reached for the purpose of explaining, among other things, the acquis communautaire as it relates to women.
In that way, Europe stands a better chance of being accepted, and the situation for women will improve considerably.
Finally, I should like to point out that, in his speech this morning, Commissioner Verheugen failed altogether to mention the situation of women in the candidate countries, something which I deeply regret.
Mr President, I am positive from Greece's experience that, contrary to what Mr Brok' s motion for a resolution maintains, the already frightful situation in the nations preparing for accession to the European Union will deteriorate even further, given that the purpose of accession is to serve big business, not the workers; workers who, in the run up to accession, are already feeling the pernicious political, social and economic repercussions of privatisation and the surrender of their economies to foreign economic interests.
For reasons of solidarity, therefore, we must vote against the reports.
We do not want to be accomplices.
As far as Cyprus is concerned, we have taken note of the positive points in the Poos report, which is why we shall abstain rather than vote against it.
However, our general political position, as stated above, also applies here.
We also note that the pre-accession procedure, especially post-Helsinki, has not only failed to resolve the Cyprus question, it has encouraged Ankara and its vassal Denktash to take an even more intransigent stance.
We are particularly worried by the fact that accession negotiations are being used to pressurise the Cypriot leadership into accepting a federal solution, i.e. into legally recognising the invasion and occupation of Cypriot territory and totally abandoning the relevant UN resolutions.
I refer you to the statements on the matter made by the president of the European Council, Mr Michel.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in most cases, the alienation between institutions and citizens revolves around people' s prosperity.
The issues that are around in our countries are a fear of immigrants, anxiety about loss of jobs and concerns surrounding the relocation of businesses.
Those issues are equally present in the candidate countries, where joining the European Union is measured by the acquisition of, and increase in, income and by employment.
If we study the latest employment figures in the Central European countries, we see that employment has fallen everywhere in 1999 and 2000, except in Hungary, Lithuania and Slovenia.
This is why it is vital that we give our attention to this development.
As far as social policy is concerned, I should like to talk mainly about two points.
I tend to think along the same lines as Mrs Maes.
Paper is accommodating, but one must also learn to read between the lines and look for the hidden meaning.
I should first like to turn my attention to social security.
The great danger is that traditional social security will be dismantled before the new system of social security is operational or is fully operational. As a consequence, a whole generation of people will not be able to benefit from either system.
My experience and the discussions I have had in a number of countries show this to be true.
This is a terrible prospect, since it indicates that a large group of people are becoming poorer.
These people compare the situation with the previous one and feel that they are worse off now than in the past.
That is the first point and I would ask the Commission to focus much more closely on the problem of social security than it has done to date.
Secondly, I should like to mention the organisations which are being set up and developed by the social partners.
Again on the basis of my local contacts, my observation is that here too things are progressing with great difficulty and very slowly.
So, we must once again look beyond the words and face reality.
Let us help them and let us help the social partners to help each other.
. (NL) Mr President, to my surprise I have just heard in the English interpretation of proceedings that my name is now Michel.
It is true that I work closely with Minister Michel, but full metamorphosis has not yet taken place.
I should like to begin, ladies and gentlemen, by apologising for the fact that I arrived a little late and was not here promptly at 3 p.m.
That was because I was also taking part on behalf of the presidency in the Conference of Committee Chairmen.
Since I do not have the gift of ubiquity, I could not be here on time, for which I again apologise.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, many of you have referred either during this morning' s speeches or in the (incidentally very interesting) reports that you have introduced - usually with much pleasure and sympathy - to the contacts you have had with people in the candidate countries, the visits you have made, and so on. The same applies to me.
I have been visiting the capitals of all candidate countries with which we have entered into negotiations at least once and, in certain cases, twice, three times or more.
It is true that that creates a bond and leads to a more than purely theoretical political interest in the countries concerned.
I find it almost touching to see how you, in your progress reports, are concerned almost like godparents with the welfare of the candidate countries on which you have to report.
I should, by the way, like to emphasise that this Parliament, in its successive constituent forms, has been one of the great engines of enlargement.
An engine that has never misfired and never stopped, and I believe that you can wear that badge with pride.
But there is more.
I should like in particular, not only echoing Mrs LalumiÃšre, but also because it reflects my own feelings, to congratulate most sincerely the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen and his department on the gigantic task of negotiation that they are carrying out.
At present, they are conducting over 300 different sets of negotiations.
You have only to multiply the number of headings by the number of Member States.
Of course I know that there are parallels, but two cases are never entirely similar.
Public opinion, which is scarcely aware of this because it is insufficiently informed, therefore thinks that accession is taking so long because we are either having second thoughts or because we have not taken particularly effective decisions.
It has no clear idea of how complex this whole matter is.
That is not the fault of public opinion.
That is the fault of all those, including ourselves, who have not told the public the facts.
Although the work is not yet complete, it has been said that the end is in sight.
As a result, tension is rising, of course, as are the number of sweepstakes on who will be crossing the finishing line first.
I agree entirely with Commissioner Verheugen that it would be wrong of us to speculate at this point on which candidate countries will be in the first wave and which will not.
It is still far too early, but we must all start discussing together how we can effectively translate these accessions into reality.
I would like, if I may, to tell a little anecdote here to highlight just one aspect of all this: when Sweden, Finland and Austria joined - and that was also a chronicle of a much-heralded fact that had long been known about - there were nevertheless insufficient interpreters and translators.
That problem will, of course, become even more complex, but all the institutions will have discuss this too in good time.
I said this morning that enlargement is the future of the Union.
Mr Jonckheer, a compatriot of mine but from a different party, has denied that, saying that the future is uncertain.
I repeat what I said this morning.
I must add that I did not say this just for formality' s sake.
I said it because I am firmly convinced that it is true, although I am just as prepared to say that the future will not be limited to enlargement, but that is the first great challenge that we have to meet in the near future.
That is absolutely certain.
My country' s Prime Minister shares this view, and in fact will undoubtedly be providing, and I say this to you very definitely, a role for candidate countries in his proposals for the preparation for the IGC.
This is in answer to a concern expressed this morning by group chairman, Mr Poettering.
During the so-called "Gymnich meeting" at the end of this week, the candidate countries will be taking part in the discussions on the future of Europe.
During the informal Council of Ghent and, of course, during the European Council of Laeken, enlargement will be discussed at length.
It will be approached in the spirit that Commissioner Verheugen and I myself set out and also in the spirit which you have supported almost without exception in your respective speeches.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the enlargement of the European Union is certainly the most fascinating and most important project that we are working on.
I fully agree with this.
In this respect I believe that the future is certain, as you said; the timing may not be quite certain but it will happen and that is good, that is important.
This should not, however, blind us to the fact that there are still a number of problems which need to be resolved in the process or that enlargement in itself will also create problems which we will need to overcome, and which must not be a reason to delay or abandon the process.
One of these problem areas is, without a doubt, the social issue, which has already been mentioned by previous speakers, because the accession of the enlargement candidates will also make the gulf between rich and poor within the European Union wider.
It is not because the rich are now becoming poorer but because these questions are being posed afresh in the Union; consequently cohesion policy will gain a new and even more important task.
Where rich and poor meet, in particular in the border regions, this will of course also lead to problems because amongst the rich there are also pockets of poorer people and less qualified workers who feel threatened.
Solutions need to be found here.
I am very grateful to the Commission and the Council for identifying a reasonable standard which is to be applied flexibly and for as short a period as possible because the aim is integration.
Integration means living together, not only living alongside each other but living together and growing together.
This is an important task which we need to carry out together step by step.
A second problem which I should like to touch on is the problem of minorities.
Increasingly, of course, we are all living in a continent of minorities.
The protection of minorities is an important task which we have not yet fully achieved in the existing Union either.
Although it is legitimate to protect these minorities, we must, however, also endeavour to prepare the people to live in one united Europe and not create new privileges.
I say this because I have been looking in particular at Hungary and the legislation there may run the risk of creating certain privileges for the Hungarians on the other side of the Hungarian border, that is in the neighbouring countries of Slovakia and Romania.
I believe that we should be cautious here; protection of and solidarity with the Hungarian minorities yes, but no new discrimination.
While I am on the subject of discrimination - and this is my final point - I should like to add that in quite a number of areas, and this is a major achievement of the work we have done together, discriminatory laws have been abolished and, for example, discrimination on grounds of religion, gender or sexual orientation has already been outlawed, including in Romania.
The fact that this is still in the report means, at least according to my information, that it is already out of date because a law has been passed which abolishes discrimination against homosexuals.
This just goes to show that everything is in flux and that our joint efforts have already improved the situation in Europe, even before enlargement.
Mr President, as Romano Prodi said in this debate last year, in Europe we are all minorities.
Today Commissioner Verheugen said that to live in Europe is to live with compromises.
To my mind these are crucial to European values.
It is for the vast majority to make compromises for the minority.
Therefore I was unhappy when I learnt that the European Parliament rapporteur on Slovakia had accused the Hungarian minority parties of setting ultimatums and using methods that are used only in wartime when they made their future in the government dependent on an administrative reform.
The rapporteur's remark seems very unfair and does not take note of the different steps in the development of self-government at different levels, nor is it consistent with the views expressed by the Prime Minister of Slovakia.
The Hungarian political representatives have, in spite of the adoption of new administrative borders that were promoted by nationalist and left-wing parties and deprived them of chances of adequate political representation, signalled that they are ready to continue in the government but that their future participation is dependent on giving real content to the administrative laws.
That is what we are asking for in Resolution No 39.
We should refrain from unfounded accusations.
Mr President, investments in roads, railways and other forms of infrastructure are among the most important that can be made in the countries of the old Central and Eastern Europe.
Anyone who takes a bird' s eye view of Europe can see very clearly where the old borders between East and West run.
This means that the EU and the EU' s Member States have a lot to gain from contributing to investment in better road and rail networks in the candidate countries and from ensuring that these are linked together with the networks in the rest of Europe.
For a country such as Poland, which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has studied from a transport point of view, that is quite obvious.
Poland is far and away the largest of the candidate countries and, in the last ten years, it has invested extensively in improvements in roads and railways.
We often talk in East-West terms within the EU but, where a country such as Poland is concerned, it is probably just as important to see the issues from a north-south perspective.
Poland is now already one of the most important countries in Europe when it comes to transport between North and South in Europe.
Clearly integrating Poland into the EU' s transport system is the same as broadening the waistline of Europe.
North-South transport would obtain a wider range of possible transit routes.
This would ease the burden on Germany, which is something positive - especially from an environmental point of view - and it would also increase competition, which is good for trade.
On the day when Poland, together with other candidate countries around the Baltic, becomes a member of the EU, we shall also jointly be able to make greater demands in terms both of marine safety and of the management of the sensitive environment in the Baltic.
There is therefore a lot to be gained from Poland' s becoming a member of the EU once the negotiations have been successfully completed.
Mr President, enlargement is not an end in itself. It is clearly a means; I would go further, it is a means within a group of means.
For example, the other means are: political deepening, economic and social cohesion and budgetary sufficiency.
The success of enlargement depends on whether these three elements are clearly present.
If it is a means, what is the end?
That people live better, qualitatively and quantitatively, in the countries of the current Union and in the candidate countries.
This is therefore true in the case of a country such as Bulgaria.
We hope that during the next political stage which that country is going to experience after the latest elections, the Europeanist will and effort shown so far will remain as strong and that, furthermore, essential actions will be strengthened in various fields.
Firstly, in the political field.
We must say clearly to the Bulgarian Government that this Parliament would not even consider voting for an accession agreement while, for example, Article 157 of the Penal Code remains in force, which establishes unacceptable discrimination against homosexual citizens in Bulgaria.
We clearly also have to ask the Bulgarian Government to make progress on the reform of judicial power, on the fight against corruption, on improving the social living conditions of the citizens and, particularly, on the fight against unemployment.
We must also ask for progress on the protection of the environment and, above all, for compliance with the commitments made so far on the closure, within certain time limits, of units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power station.
Finally, we want to say to Bulgaria that it is this Parliament' s desire that it be well incorporated into the European Union and on time, but, of course within the political, economic and social framework established.
Mr President, if the political problems cannot be resolved at long last, the issue of Cyprus has the potential to derail the entire enlargement process or to leave us in the ridiculous situation where hundreds of thousands of Turkish Cypriots are notionally EU citizens without having being consulted, while at the same time facing EU sanctions of a political and economic nature.
We cannot afford to close our eyes to the reality.
I look forward to Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot politicians sitting alongside us as parliamentarians in this Chamber and to the creation of a bi-zonal federal state.
But in discussing this issue, it is not acceptable simply to say that the problems of Cyprus started with the Turkish invasion in 1974 without mentioning the divisions of the island from 1963 when Greek Cypriots murdered Turkish Cypriots.
If there is to be true reconciliation between these peoples, then complete objectivity is needed and in this report before us that is too sadly lacking.
Mr President, in its opinion on the country reports the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has confined itself to only a few points which are significant for all of the accession countries without exception and which are, as you would expect, included in the introductory report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Our committee calls for a more developed schema governing the future representation of the candidate countries in the European Parliament than is provided for in the Treaty of Nice.
We call for the discrimination against Hungary and the Czech Republic to be rectified and we think it is necessary for provision also to be made for the period after the 2004 European elections for any candidates acceding then.
Other important concerns of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs relate to the candidate countries' participating as soon as possible in the so-called post-Nice process.
A constitutional reform in Europe without the participation of the future members is politically indefensible.
Of course the candidates will not be able to have an equal say in the decisions for as long as they are still candidates, but they will be affected and we should therefore also attach importance to their opinions.
Our committee continues to be in favour of actively involving civil society in the Member States and the candidate countries in the process of reforming our future institutions.
A prerequisite for this will be high-quality, comprehensive and above all not only one-sided information.
A further concern has obviously already reached the ears of the Commission.
Commissioner Verheugen already mentioned in this morning's debate that the application of Community law will be a priority in the ongoing assessment of the candidates' readiness to join the European Union.
We can only fully agree with him.
I have mixed feelings about another comment which Commissioner Verheugen made this morning.
Commissioner, you said that the border regions would spearhead the EU enlargement process.
In the light of the great restraint being exercised by the Commission where support for border regions is concerned, I fear that some border regions may see themselves as spearheads in a different sense, in the sense that they are being speared.
Perhaps here too it will be possible to find a solution by working together constructively.
Mr President, Malta is one of the twelve candidate countries which meets the general requirements set by the European Union on all counts.
The Stenzel report gives us an excellent description of all these developments and I fully endorse it.
However, there is the problem of why a significant proportion of the Maltese people, all of whom we welcome with open arms, has a number of objections and concerns.
For example, the agricultural population totals 1000 people and agriculture is a problem for Malta and for these 1000 people.
Perhaps they are worried that, because it is so small, a property developer could come and buy up the whole of Malta.
Some other nations are worried about their cultural identity.
The vision of Europe which we impart must be a vision which safeguards all the rights of the nations which accede at a later date, be they cultural, economic or social.
In this sense, because our debates are often highly technocratic and focus solely on indicators, Maastricht, approximations and so on, we should understand that, for these nations, most of whom are experiencing economic problems, the economic factor takes precedence.
If we want to bring these nations - and our own nations - on board, we need to show them a Europe of security, peace, culture and individuality, not just the sexual individuality which is often the subject of debate, but cultural individuality, because people do not just have multiple sexual needs, they also have multiple spiritual and cultural needs and linguistic diversity.
In this sense, I think that Malta, which is Europe in miniature, is a good prospect; at the same time, however, we should use Malta to look at other aspects of our policies.
Mr President, at this stage of our assessment and appraisal of the pre-accession progress of the candidate countries, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities wants to make it perfectly clear that, as an integral aspect of respect for human rights, adopting the acquis communautaire on equality between men and women is a sine qua non to accession.
In other words, these countries have to harmonise their national legislation with the acquis communautaire in the area of sexual equality, on the one hand, and develop institutions and mechanisms which allow appropriate policies to be applied on the other.
It is clear from the opinions of our committee that women everywhere have difficulty accessing the job market and are under-represented at the centres of power.
They also refer to specific problems such as high unemployment in Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia and violence against and human trafficking of women in places such as Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Turkey.
At the same time, we have welcomed positive achievements, such as state mechanisms in Lithuania to facilitate suitable policies and the employment rate among women in Cyprus, which is close to the Community average.
Moreover, as the rapporteur Mr Poos mentioned, Cyprus is top of the league of negotiating countries and meets all the economic and political accession criteria.
Consequently, we are entirely justified in believing and hoping that Cyprus will become a full member of the European Union as soon as the pre-accession procedure is completed even if, despite our efforts, no solution can be found to the Cyprus problem in the meantime, due to Turkey's intransigence.
What our committee is calling for, Commissioner, to come back to women, is for candidate countries to take part in Community programmes which help safeguard women's rights and for civil society, and especially women's non-governmental organisations, to be encouraged to take part in these programmes.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe was founded on the idea of putting an end to war between the various nations in it.
At some point in their history, these nations decided never again to allow themselves to fall into the cesspit of genocide.
At the same time, they abolished the diplomacy of threat and pressure and replaced it with the language of reconciliation, compromise and understanding in good faith.
Primarily, enlarging Europe can only mean one thing: extending the application of these principles.
And nowhere in Europe today is there a more pressing need for the application of these principles to be extended than in Cyprus, whose history of violence, threat, blood-stained borders, military occupation, armed reckonings - all the situations from which Europe has drawn back in horror - is repeating itself for both nations living on the island.
The upshot of this for northern, Turkish-occupied Cyprus has been economic ruin and the abolition of political freedom for its people.
They live under a military regime in the guise of a pseudo-democracy.
In southern Cyprus, which constitutes the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus, and which functions as a true democracy, even if it is handicapped by the Turkish occupation, the economy is flourishing, prosperity is increasing and all the economic and political criteria set in Copenhagen have been met; however, the people are deprived of the natural, supremely human right to travel around their country, to return to the houses in which they were born, to their small villages, to travel the length and breadth of the country without coming up against barbed wire, road blocks, divided towns or armed soldiers ready to shoot.
Under these circumstances, the accession of Cyprus into the European Union, which should not be delayed, will also bring new peace to international relations between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean in general - the European Union's blessing on all three countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur on Latvia's application for membership of the European Union, Mrs SchrÃ¶der, has made some very important and pertinent observations.
They also seemed to me to be very critical.
That is why, with your permission, I should now like to highlight two positive points which present the overall picture in a perhaps more favourable and also, in my opinion, a more realistic light.
In many reports - and the same is true of the report on Latvia's application, there is a statement at the beginning which is simple and which is important but which cannot be taken for granted.
Latvia satisfies the political criteria for membership of the European Union.
This simple sentence represents splendid achievements, achievements which deserve respect and recognition.
In the light of the difficult situation which these countries were in at the outset and the complicated basic conditions, satisfying the first Copenhagen criterion is a remarkable result.
This is especially true for the three Baltic states which, compared with all of the other candidates, were forced to a far greater degree into the totalitarian structures of the former Soviet Union. This applies particularly to Latvia, given the complicated ethnic make-up of its population.
It is precisely against this tragic historical background that the systematic and continuous efforts of its parliament and government to integrate all of the country's inhabitants into society deserve our respect and support.
Latvia is also an excellent example of how clear political prospects for the future can strengthen and accelerate social and economic development.
On 15 February 2000 the accession negotiations were formally opened.
In the same year, growth of 6.6% in gross domestic product was achieved and in the first quarter of this year growth even reached 8.2%.
These are just a few of very many other indicators which point to the opportunities - the opportunities to create political stability and economic dynamism - which enlargement brings.
Mr President, Commissioner. I should like to start by thanking the chairman of our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Elmar Brok, for including important points from the various committee opinions in the joint motion.
As joint draftsman of an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Fundamental Freedoms and an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I am one of the few members of the committees required to give an opinion who has been able to take the floor in this debate and I do so in order to voice my criticism of our in-house procedure.
First, the timing of the debate.
I think that it would have been better to wait for the Commission's next progress reports.
Secondly, it is a great pity that only a few of those reporting on individual countries for the Committee on Foreign Affairs have taken note of the opinions of the other committees and that the draftsmen of these opinions were not automatically allocated speaking time during the debate, as is our custom in the House.
Nonetheless, I am delighted that a number of very important points raised by my committees have been included in the common opinion, including the all-important Article 13 and the acquis developed in the meantime in order to combat discrimination.
I think enlargement negotiations should attach equal importance to this and, for example, internal market legislation.
I also believe that it is important to note that the motion calls, for the first time, for the security of the external borders of the enlarged European Union to be a Community responsibility, rather than the sole responsibility of the country on the border.
Finally, one further request, this time in my capacity as an Austrian member.
I think Mr SchrÃ¶der has written an excellent report on the Czech Republic and I should like to ask the House to support him on all counts.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, enlargement is the greatest challenge that the European political project has ever faced.
It is, however, not an end in itself, but a means towards political, economic, cultural and civilisational ends.
Enlargement must mean more and better Europe and not less Europe, even if it increases in area and territory.
Enlargement must be supported and well received by national public opinion.
Public opinion in many countries is favourable towards enlargement for reasons other than simple economic calculations and national self-interest.
These countries hope that enlargement will strengthen Europe and will be fair and, unless this happens, they will feel cheated.
For example, and if we take account of the opinion polls, the Portuguese are clearly more in favour of enlargement than - irony of ironies! - the Belgians, the French and the Germans.
Why should this be the case?
It is because the Portuguese have benefited from the support of the European Union at a crucial time in their recent history and feel that other Europeans share this right.
These very Portuguese citizens would not have the same attitude, however, if they were afraid that enlargement might weaken the European project and harm Europe' s internal cohesion.
I am delighted at the orderly, methodical and smooth course of the negotiations, but the hard core of the trickiest dossiers has still not been broached.
Some Members have recommended today, in this part-session, that the ten applicant countries should join the European Union by 2004.
I think this is too soon.
We must not delay the process of accession through expedient measures, neither should we rush things.
We must respect the pace of each applicant country.
In the 1930s, the celebrated French writer Paul ValÃ©ry, coined the famous phrase, which said, and I quote, that civilisations are now aware of their mortality.
He also pointed out that Europe' s greatest weakness was its inability to form a political entity with powers that are both solid and legitimate.
This is the problem.
I hope that enlargement contributes to establishing this legitimate and strong entity and not the opposite.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by drawing your attention to the fact that the conclusions of the Wiersma report on the possible accession of Slovakia to the European Union have the full backing of the PPE group.
Slovakia is an example of how, with political will, a country initially at a disadvantage, in this case a country which, under the Meciar regime, lost nearly four years compared with everyone else, can catch up with the other countries negotiating for accession and join with them in resolving problems quickly.
What is most impressive is that Slovakia has successfully stabilised its economy over recent years and has started and, in many cases, completed comprehensive structural reforms, including privatising the banks.
However, the European Union also needs Slovakia to accede, lying as it does between Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, because it will be easier to guarantee an area of freedom and security in an enlarged European Union along a continuous external border.
However, Slovakia will only be able to accede quickly if it is equally quick in implementing government and administrative reform. This includes making the judiciary independent, introducing effective financial controls and reforming the communes and local authorities, all within the next few weeks.
This will also indirectly guarantee the involvement of national minorities, especially the Hungarians, in over 500 communities.
Slovakia should therefore keep up its resolve to deal with outstanding accession problems in liaison with the Commission and the European Parliament, so as to pave the way for fast accession to the European Union.
Mr President, two topics in one minute.
First topic: there are still major deficiencies in the social sphere, including in the country I myself am monitoring, namely Latvia.
I believe it is important to understand that a modern society is most successful if there is a partnership between politicians and the two sides of the labour market.
That is why we must not forget the social dialogue.
It is not merely the internal market which is important for enlargement.
Second topic: there is a positive spirit at present, and this must continue.
We must not believe that enlargement will be without its problems, and we cannot expect enlargement to be nice and easy.
It will have its shortcomings; there will be untidiness and incoherence; there will be lengthy transitional arrangements; and there will be no thorough agricultural reform and no complete structural reform.
I am not saying that we must accept everything. I believe, however, that we must contrive to show magnanimity and that we are obliged to accept that enlargement will be messy and untidy.
Naturally, we must comply with the Copenhagen criteria, but we must count on enlargement' s not being as seamless as we perhaps might have hoped.
I hope that we go for major enlargement, show magnanimity and obtain the 'big bang' in 2003.
Mr President, Mr QueirÃ³ and Mr Friedrich have given Hungary ten out of ten for accession efforts on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Hungary was the first country to raise the Iron Curtain and to start intensive preparations for full membership.
Today, thank God, fear of enlargement is clearly beginning to recede.
We could see in Burgenland, which borders on Hungary, that the Euro-sceptics did not stand a chance and were losing more and more ground.
The same applies in Austria and Germany with regard to the Czech Republic and Poland, although here the problems are patently worse.
But I think that this is a positive development and that this development is thanks to Hungary's policy of settling its minority problems, which it has done in an exemplary fashion, and of taking a clearly pro-European stance across the political divide.
I should like, first and foremost, to call on the Czech Republic, for which I also have a soft spot and which I hope, like Hungary, will be one of the first wave of candidate countries, to follow Hungary's example and resolve its minority problems, discard its historical baggage and, at the same time, find a consensus between the political parties on the question of political integration. I think this is paramount.
I am positive that the so-called candidate countries - not an expression I particularly like - will not become the ballast of European unification; it is precisely Hungary, the Czech Republic and others which can become the driving force behind European integration.
The same applies to Slovakia, although it has internal political problems.
But if it resolves them, I think that Slovakia, together with Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, will become the countries to drive European integration forward.
We should therefore take a less anxious view of this project, which we should not call enlargement to the east but, to quote Pope John Paul II, the "Europeanisation of Europe".
Because a European Union without Hungary or the Czech Republic is no European Union!
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Brok for preparing this report on enlargement.
The decision to open an enlargement process highlights the great, long-term vision of our predecessors.
However, this great vision and long-term perspective is not being matched by an adequate financial and budgetary initiative.
I feel that Member States' contributions need to be revised in order to include our new commitments and needs even before 2006.
Like everything new, enlargement is causing uncertainty among the public.
We must reassure them from the economic as well as political point of view, particularly where the structural and cohesion policies are concerned.
Wealthy Europe must be more generous and the governments must be the vehicles of this generosity.
With regard to Slovenia, I have already had the opportunity to thank Mr Volcic for his valuable contribution and his report.
In my opinion, the accession of the candidate countries will be our first opportunity to tackle the issue of relations with the Balkan countries after the war.
The first, absolute necessity which the European Union must establish and confirm, where it is lacking, is multiculturality based on recognition of and respect for differences, all differences whether physical, intellectual, ethnic, religious, economic or other, to prevent any more ethnic or religious wars.
Europe and the European Union must demand reciprocity from all the countries with which they sustain relations or for which they are finalising solidarity programmes in the area of multiculturality, for this dimension is the basis of all the democratic structures of the States.
I hope that, in the future, Slovenia' s situation will be mirrored in all the Balkan States and bring peace and prosperity to the war-torn communities.
Lastly, I feel that, for the European Union, the economic element of globalisation is not about maximising profit and its social element is not about standardising societies, but globalisation is about the readiness to harmonise existing differences.
Mr President, the upside of the fact that we are so late debating the old progress reports is that we can inject some up-to-date input just before the new reports are finalised.
I have observed developments in Lithuania with interest, and not only since I became the shadow rapporteur for this country.
It demonstrates the classic problems of a candidate country, problems which apply across the board and do not therefore need to be restated.
One specific aspect, and this also costs the EU a great deal of money, is Lithuanian energy policy.
The sector as a whole has already cost three heads of government their job.
First on the subject of Ignalina, which Mr Souladakis has already addressed.
I think that it is up to us to ensure, when the closure process is implemented, that locals are kept properly informed at all times of what it is actually planned to do and what their prospects are in this relatively isolated area.
My personal impression is that this is not yet the case.
As a result, some Lithuanian politicians, admittedly without portfolio, are irresponsibly raising people's hopes in order to curry votes.
This triggers anti-European sentiments because the debate is over-simplified.
Privatisation of the oil and gas sectors is also causing a degree of ill feeling among the people because western investors have acted as if this is a banana republic.
Now, no one even bothers to distinguish between EU nationals and Americans.
People have become sceptical of western capital and more receptive to so-called national solutions.
However, allegedly national solutions in Lithuania are in fact generally a front for Russian money.
I just want to make sure that everyone involved both inside and outside Lithuania is aware of this and bears it in mind when making political and economic decisions.
Mr President, with regard to the accession of Cyprus, we should be pleased by the result of the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs: 55 in favour and just 2 against.
This demonstrates the excellent work of negotiation and consensus carried out by the rapporteur and the cooperation of the whole committee on this report which was not devoid of difficulties, owing, above all, to the occupation of part of the island by Turkey and the stalemate in the dialogue between the Turkish and Cypriot Governments.
My group has wanted to promote a text which does not hinder or compromise a renewal of the negotiations between both sides, but quite the opposite, one which motivates and speeds up the process of resolving the problem which is undoubtedly seeing a change of attitude from the Turkish Government.
We are in favour of approving the report with the amendments presented by our Group which reflect its concern at the political division of the island, supporting, in this respect, the efforts of the United Nations to reestablish the conversations and urging the conflicting sides to achieve a resolution to the problem as soon as possible, for the good of all the citizens of Cyprus.
Cyprus has now closed 22 chapters in the negotiation and presents itself as a firm candidate for accession.
However, intense work will have to be done on the incorporation of the Community acquis, especially in terms of compliance with environmental legislation, where significant shortcomings in the areas of waste management and water quality and management have been noted.
Cyprus must also make progress on putting a stop to its macroeconomic deterioration, as well as on the control of capital movements.
Nevertheless, we insist that a unified Cyprus would be the best guarantee of peace, security and prosperity for the region.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, maybe it is an opportunity as well as an honour to have the last word in such an important debate. I think that this debate has highlighted the potential for the European Parliament, especially when it comes to Romania, on which I should like to say a few words.
As a former national member of parliament, I know that a national member of parliament can do very little.
What Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne has done for Romania, with her report and her hard work, is to get things moving there.
The Commissioner acknowledged as much this morning and I think that we could use this as an example to the numerous groups of visitors who question exactly what we in the European Parliament can do.
To start with, the head of government in Romania reacted as perhaps every head of government in the world would react.
He claimed that Mr Verheugen had said, not to worry, it is only the European Parliament. Talk to the Commission if you want to become a member of the European Union one day.
I am sure that Mr Verheugen said no such thing.
All the Romanian media quoted him, although they then acknowledged that it makes sense to take a closer look at Parliament's reports and opinions; we have reached a legal position on the question of orphans and homosexuals in Romania which now has to be implemented, something which was unthinkable a few weeks ago.
I should like, if I may, to comment on a question which divides the House.
The Socialist group and Mr Sakellariou have tabled a proposed amendment asking if the report should mention euro-Atlantic structures, yes or no?
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy says yes, if Romania wants to join these euro-Atlantic structures, then we want to support this and I think it is important, especially in Romania's case, that we do.
We know that Romania will not accede in the first round in 2004 and a decision to invite Romania to join the North Atlantic Alliance in 2002 is therefore all the more important.
This would bring stability to the whole of Europe and I therefore call on you to reject this amendment tomorrow and support the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I should like to inform the House that I have received a motion for a resolution from the Committee on Foreign Affairs pursuant to Rule 37, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
It gives me great pleasure to hand the chair back to the President.
White paper on the reform of European governance
The next item is the Commission communication on the White paper on the reform of European governance.
I will now give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi.
Thank you, Mr Prodi.
Madam President, I would like firstly to congratulate the President, Mr Prodi, both on the White Paper and on his comments here today.
It seems to me that the forty pages of this White Paper are forty dense pages, full of reflection and proposals.
But I also believe that your comments were splendid, succinct, full of ideas and vision, and I would like to congratulate you on behalf of my group.
Furthermore, I believe that your manner of presenting the White Paper has been correct.
You have done so modestly, and that is to your credit.
The White Paper is a departure point.
It is just a text which leads to reflection and now we have to ask our co-citizens to participate in this reflection, to offer ideas and to send projects.
I believe that all of us in this Parliament agree on the analysis of the situation, that we all wonder what is happening to the European Union and why our co-citizens sometimes show a lack of confidence.
I believe that the White Paper explains this well: the benefits of the European Union are general and they often pass unnoticed; however, the disadvantages are specific.
I remember the effect in my country when lorries of strawberries were overturned by French farmers.
This always happened at the same time of year, one week, and it was just a very isolated incident.
That created enormous anti-European feeling: 'Why does the European Union not worry about us, the European Union does not care for us' .
That ended as a result of the efforts of the European Commission, amongst others.
Surely the Spanish, or many of them, do not realise that.
I believe that our main problem is that we are European without knowing it and without doubt this White Paper has a good role to play in this pedagogical zeal to explain what Europe is and what the European Union is for.
The second idea that I would like to highlight on behalf of my group is that this White Paper stresses the originality of the system which has operated over the last fifty years.
Furthermore, it supports the continuation of this system which we call the 'Community method' , yet nobody questions this.
Today I have been very glad to hear President Prodi talk about maintaining the balance between the institutions: this seems to me essential.
The Group of the European People' s Party, which has always tenaciously supported the European Commission having a monopoly on the exercise of legislative initiative, believes that it is very positive that that legislative initiative, when it comes about, should count on the participation of many more players: of what we call civil society, of local and regional authorities; above all especially if we do so, as Mr Prodi said, without in any way altering the balance between the institutions or the constitutional status of the Member States.
Of course, this Parliament is also going to cooperate in this task of contributing ideas.
And it is doing so by means of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs whose rapporteur on this issue will be Mrs Kaufmann, and it is also doing so on all those issues which are eventually going to be combined with the reflection of the Commission which President Prodi called the third reflection, which is going to come together in the debate of the IGC 2004.
This White Paper is very important because we are at a moment of the historic constituent process of the European Union, and that process opened with declaration 23 at Nice.
I am sure that the presence of Commissioner Barnier is in response to this.
Therefore, this will be a further element of this process, which is important, and visionary, and which is necessary when Europe is preparing for the euro, for enlargement and for the debate on what we Europeans want.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen. I can agree on behalf of my group with much of what has been said today, Mr President.
I just wonder why it was not set out this clearly in the White Paper which you submitted, unfortunately at a time at which we were unable to discuss it directly.
A White Paper on European governance really should have been submitted to Parliament first.
You said, Mr President, that Parliament represents the people of the Union.
Correct.
But if you look at the White Paper, this premise is hardly anywhere to be found, at least not in the prominent and leading place in which it belongs.
I do not say this just to blow our own trumpet but because we should not spread the illusion harboured by many a non-governmental organisation that the parliamentary and democratic process could, to a certain extent, be replaced by dialogue with civil society.
It cannot replace it but it can and it must complement it.
That is one important aspect.
That brings me to my second point.
Yes, our group is in favour of strengthening consultation with civil society, whatever your interpretation of that concept may be.
I just wonder, Mr President, if the Commission has the staff it needs in order to do so to the extent claimed here?
At least, you say nothing about how you intend to bring this off.
Secondly, you barely mention how you intend to liaise with Parliament here.
Yes, you say that Parliament has already started this process. Quite right.
But we need to strengthen it.
We need to approach things jointly, as you said today, because our citizens react to the European Union, rather than to individual institutions.
That is why I call on you to table proposals based on your concept of how a joint, efficient, feasible dialogue can be conducted because what is depicted here will result in a plethora of consultation processes and that contradicts the very principle of efficiency which you stand for.
But we are prepared to discuss this with you.
Thirdly, delegating decisions. You are quite right, Mr President; a parliament which wants to pass every detailed decision and regulation is a very stupid parliament.
But what is the position on the call back or fall back position which Parliament keeps calling for?
You say nothing about it in your White Paper.
Are you for or against it?
You surely do not entertain the notion that Parliament will agree to delegate regulatory powers and jurisdiction without the facility to call them back if things go wrong?
We have already had our fingers burned once with the Lamfalussy report.
Some Commissioner or other - I do not want to name names - did not approve of this process of cooperation, even in the case of delegation, hence our scepticism and suspicion.
Not because we reject it, but because we still cannot condone the practice of the Commission at this point in time.
Mr President, you refer several times in your White Paper to getting back to basics, on focusing on basics once more.
But you do not define them - basics since when?
Basics for the Commission and the European Union are not the same today as they were 20 years ago and they will be different in the future.
I do wonder, with many of the Commission' s proposals, if these really are the basics for the European Union.
In other areas - just think of asylum, immigration and so on, you are faced with new basics.
To think backwards and say, we must get back to yesterday' s basics is hardly the right policy for the European Union.
But I admit that you are right and I hope that the Commission will define what it sees as basics for the future, for the next ten years because that is an ongoing decision which we want to discuss with the Council and the Commission.
Agenda setting, defining political priorities year on year, is not just the job of the Council and the Commission, it is also the job of the European Parliament.
So much for the critical points and now there is no time left for the other points.
But I think that it is more use to you if we voice our criticism and then offer to hold a dialogue with you over the coming months so that we can bring about a joint result.
(Applause)
Madam President, this White Paper between ourselves is worth more than all the recent grandstanding speeches of national leaders, because it combines clarity of purpose with a substantial degree of self-criticism.
President Prodi has drawn attention to the paradox that people want the Union to be doing more in several fields but they still distrust the system of government.
The Commission is therefore quite right to focus on improving the Commission's representative capacity, especially at the pre-legislative stage.
I would also want a strong emphasis on improving the post-legislative phase, monitoring far more closely the way European policies are put into effect on the ground.
My group welcomes the Commission's emphasis on decentralised management and on a reinforced role for the regions.
The European region plays a vital part as the intermediary between the citizen and the supranational authorities.
We also note the kind suggestion that Parliament feeds into the European system the views of its own electors.
What else we are up to, I am not quite sure.
But the place that we intend to do this is in the new convention that we trust will be set up at Laeken, a concept that strangely receives not a single mention throughout the entire White Paper.
Would Mr Prodi agree that the White Paper will be a most sensible contribution to the work of that convention?
Would he say exactly the way he sees the furtherance of the work on the White Paper fitting in with that of the convention?
Madam President, President of the Commission, your White Paper has been widely praised, but we were disappointed in it, because it has not proved the important document that we had expected after your promises.
It is difficult to find any specific detail in the current reform of the Commission, in the fundamental declarations in Nice on the future of the Union or in the new IGC.
We are therefore searching for the meaning.
Could it perhaps be the case that differences of opinion in the board of Commissioners and pressure from some Member States have combined to reduce the scope of this White Paper?
We also support greater involvement of mainstream society.
That is positive.
However, as Democrats, we are concerned about the sections on better policy and better legislation, and on the orientation of policy initiatives and institutions.
We attach special importance to institutional equilibrium.
Other speakers have already made that point, for example as regards the impact on the powers and role of the European Parliament of a greater use of "soft law" instruments.
In addition, we wonder whether the new regulatory bodies we are promised and the proposed external executive bodies can be adequately monitored.
We have not forgotten the whole chapter involving the BTB.
Neither have you, I hope.
We are positively disposed towards the proposal that the Council and the European Parliament should play an equal role in supervising the way in which the Commission fulfils its executive task.
But I have other concerns.
As a regionalist, I feel bound to say that the importance of the region has actually declined.
There is virtually no trace here of 'bottom-up governance' .
We cannot find the 'multi-level governance' in which all administrative strata are involved - which was also asked for by Mr Duff.
The differences of opinion in the board of Commissioners have obviously actually led to regional involvement on the final decision-making being scrapped.
The Commission limits itself to a more systematic dialogue with European and national associations of regional and local authorities at an early stage in decision-making.
In contrast to the draft White Paper and the report of the Commission' s preparatory working party 4 C, provision is no longer made for a differentiation in regional involvement depending on the type of Member State: unitary, decentralised, regionalised or federal.
As a result, we are now going backwards compared to the present constitutional powers already enjoyed by some regions in certain Member States, for example Belgium.
You can imagine that this will not excite much enthusiasm in our regions for the governance outlined here.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, it is well over eighteen months, Mr Prodi, since you announced that the reform of European governance was one of the Commission's four strategic objectives.
It is to your honour that, like earlier Commission presidents, you want to leave your personal mark on the Commission.
Your concern to take measures which will at last close the gap between the Union and its citizens is one which I wholeheartedly support.
As does the overwhelming majority of the House.
We want to do something, at long last, to turn a citizens' Europe from a slogan into a reality.
With all due respect for your concern, Mr President of the Commission, I must say to you in all honesty that I am disappointed in what now lies before us.
I have handed out this White Paper and asked our citizens what they think of it.
Do you know what the immediate problem was?
They had no idea what the 40 odd pages were about.
It is all pure Eurospeak, was the reply.
How, I wonder, can we possibly close this gap if the language is incomprehensible to its target audience?
The White Paper contains positive ideas, such as strengthening the role of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions or stepping up consultation with organisations in civil society, it is true.
Nonetheless, I should like briefly to address a few crucial questions.
The basic political problem of the White Paper is obvious, I think, right from the start.
It says that people think the Union is incapable of acting where action is needed, for example, on unemployment.
This reading of the problem is simply not true.
The citizens do not think the Union is incapable; on the contrary, their experience on a daily basis is that the Union and its Member States have proven they are incapable.
Mr Prodi, you quite rightly said in your speech that, when we speak of governance, we are really talking about democracy.
You quite rightly addressed the problem of the democratisation of the European Union here today, but why can I only find trace elements of it in the White Paper itself?
One last word on the question of revising the Treaty.
The White Paper makes provision for a consultation stage up to March 2002.
The final proposals are then due to be submitted a further six months later.
Surely it is absurd to present proposals geared to the current Treaties in the autumn of this year, when we will already have been working flat out, hopefully in a convention, on revising the Treaties.
Dispensing with amendments to the Treaty, as you have posited, is not, in my view, a viable proposition, quite apart from the fact that you suggest a revision in the White Paper itself.
All in all, Mr President of the Commission, even after what my fellow members have said, I see a need for extensive discussion and I offer you Parliament's and my personal assistance.
Mr President of the Commission, in our common language, the word "governance" does not exist, and it may well be that it does not exist in other European languages either. It could be said that it is revealing - and not just because of the linguistic wrangle which took place this summer - that, despite its best efforts at external openness, transparency and accountability towards the public, the Commission chose, right in the middle of the summer, to adopt a document with an untranslatable title.
There were other terms available which would have been translatable and, most importantly, comprehensible, both linguistically and otherwise: the rule of law, the separation of powers, thorough guidelines for Community mechanisms, democratisation of the Treaties, a European Constitution, legal certainty and so on and so forth. You decided to ignore almost all these pillars of our national States even though, as you know, they are greatly lacking in our European Union system.
I hope that "governance" is not going to become a kind of de facto, free-trade Italian-style Constitution which favours partisan ideals, which, as we are quite aware, is the case with the current Italian Constitution.
Civil society, for example, Mr President, is what exposed Israel at Durban, prompting countries to walk out of that conference. Those countries had a sense of responsibility which I did not see in our Union.
I do not know whether that is the civil society to which you are referring, but I am somewhat fearful because, as Mr Swoboda said, although, today, you have delivered a very pro-Parliament speech, the text itself contains very few references to Parliament.
It is precisely because I want a strong, authoritative Commission that I am saying this. I do not want it to be reduced to a think tank or, at best, a supervisory body for a couple of industry sectors.
So, Mr President, be bold!
In my opinion, this text does not go far enough.
This operation will not suffice as it stands: if the rule of law and the legal certainties are to make proper headway in this Union, they must be defined now.
Madam President, I too want to thank the Commission for a good analysis in the 'Governance' paper.
In some places, the report is so critical that I might have written it myself. What I do not see, however, is an attendant list of practical, precise and binding proposals which would open the legislative process to the people.
In Italy, Mr Prodi has a good proposal about naming those who have been consulted.
We are concerned here with a list, which ought to accompany any bill, of who has been consulted, and all the answers given in consultations should be available on the Internet.
Mr Prodi also has another proposal about preferring regulations to directives.
That runs directly counter to our era' s demand for decentralisation.
On the contrary, countries require greater freedom in implementing directives. Strawberries need not be of the same size in Italy as in Finland.
The paper talks a lot about more consultation, but it looks as though the aim is to create more support for the Commission' s 'top-down' proposal.
What I do not see is a proper concept of democracy that involves starting from the bottom.
Which issues cross borders?
Which can we not manage for ourselves?
In which areas do we want the Commission to produce proposals?
Mr Prodi always has fine things to say about transparency, but he also has a department for refusing the right of access to documents.
Could the Commission not merge that department with the department for fine words about transparency, leaving just the one department?
For example, I have still not received a complete list of the people consulted in the 1,500 committees and working parties that exist today.
Those who support Mr Prodi are not delivering the goods.
It looks as though he too has been imprisoned in his own fortress.
Might I suggest that Mr Prodi issue his promises about transparency as a regulation, binding his supporters in every respect.
Mr Prodi, the introduction to your White Paper on European governance makes the problem clear. We are losing the citizens' confidence, as the no vote in the Irish referendum showed.
However your solutions are extremely weak.
Better governance would be more transparency, increased consultation, increased communication, increased participation and a more open method of communication, for example. To be brief, Mr Prodi, these are the changes that would certainly be desirable for the European institutions to make to the way they work, but they will only have a marginal effect if they are not combined with deep-rooted changes in the balance of institutional powers.
The people think, and we also think, that certain problems would be better resolved by better European cooperation, but, at the same time, they resolutely and constantly attaches most legitimacy to the national framework.
That said, the conclusion is very simple: to strengthen the legitimacy of European cooperation, to make contact once more with the citizens, great influence and a much more visible role need to be given to the nation states within the European decision-making process.
This is the basic condition for a true democracy, a word that is scarcely mentioned, moreover, Mr President, in your White Paper.
All the rest is just idle chit-chat.
For example, how can it be that, in your White Paper, we find developments in the involvement of regional and local structures in European politics, developments in decentralised management, in coregulation with various - non-identified - organisations, and how can it be that there is absolutely no mention of the essential role of national Parliaments in the European decision-making process?
I imagine, Mr President, that, in your position, you were not able to resolve this issue, but the White Paper could at least have raised it.
The best communication you could hope for is useless if European policies do not revolve around the crucial role of national democracies.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking all the speakers, for they have made extremely useful contributions to this debate, which will serve as the foundation for more detailed analysis.
I would, however, like to touch on a few basic points, a few of the points underlying this document, so that we will then be able to work together to improve and add to it.
We have indeed set out a road map in this document, but this is the just the initial proposal: debates will continue to be held and it is only during the next stage that the final document will be produced.
I have therefore taken note (and will continue to do so) of your comments because this is an initial proposal which needs everyone to contribute to it before the final version can be established.
The second point is the issue of the language and title etc. of the White Paper.
You are indeed right but, in all honesty, I have to say that I have read countless national laws and I have also endeavoured to make a great many.
Mention just one which is written in language that the ordinary citizen can understand.
They are all written in specialised language.
We have done absolutely everything possible to use appropriate language but it is the concepts themselves whose technical nature is ultimately a problem for the ordinary citizen.
Our task is precisely that of explaining, of bridging the gap, but we cannot allow proposals to be less precisely worded.
An example is the discussion on the term "governance" .
I understand perfectly what Mr dell' Alba is saying, but the problem is that we do not use one single language: we are fortunate and proud to be able to use 11, and there will soon be 20.
Therefore, we must endeavour to adapt.
The title we have selected is not a title I like much, precisely because there is never a single term which translates appropriately into all the languages.
We have a duty to understand each other as well as possible, even though we do not always manage to do so with the precision we would like.
Finally, relations with Parliament.
My aim in delivering this speech today was not to please Parliament.
What I have said to you today regarding Parliament' s role and relations with NGOs and civil society and their different functions are things I often say, things I have repeated a thousand times and things which I have attempted to put into practice transparently during the last 18 months in relations with this House.
The fact that our relations are certainly more effective, more functional, smoother and more open than they were previously is precisely because I consider that the basis of the new Europe must be a fundamental role for Parliament.
Lastly, I have been criticised for many omissions, including the debate on the definition of the role of local authorities.
As I recall, we imposed a limit on ourselves in this White Paper: we will not amend the Treaties.
Therefore, it is not the purpose of the White Paper to change the delegation of powers.
We must make this enormous effort to best adapt our way of working to our tasks but without amending the Treaties.
Then in the second phase, which is separate from the first phase, we will present the proposals for Laeken, and then, in the third phase, we will make an active contribution and we will have to work on the institutional reforms together.
After the Nice decisions had been taken, we had to take note of this and use a methodology which respected the necessary changes.
However, remember that democracy is made of practices as well as rules.
In my opinion, as we have seen from my speech and your debates, it is possible to improve the way we work without amending any legislation.
I therefore believe that we must work together to that end.
A number of specific points emerged in the debate which I feel are particularly important.
The issue of the delegation of powers to the Commission was mentioned.
The Commission, consistently with what I said regarding not modifying legislation, is not asking for more powers but wants to organise its work more transparently and efficiently, getting back to the definitions in the founding Treaties of the Union, which, in laying down the organisation of the institutions, state that the Council and Parliament make decisions, the Commission executes policy (although not the technical detail) and Parliament monitors.
When we have finished, the Commission will probably have less to do than it does at present, but the confusing part of the comitology practice, which extends processes and does not make the difference between our and your roles completely clear, will be avoided.
In this case, Parliament and the Commission are equally involved because we are both mixed up in this comitology practice and we are both dissatisfied.
Therefore, let us now say what we tell each other in our private conversations regarding the inadequacy of this process, here in this Chamber, for that way we can do something about it.
An objection was raised regarding the direct responsibility of local authorities in the decision-making process.
We must remember that, although the basis for this is the decentralisation, the subsidiarity debate, the objective is to take into account, in an organised and transparent way, the opinions of the end users and executors of the common policies while respecting the institutional structures of each Member State.
We cannot interfere with the sacrosanct organisation of the Member States.
They define the role of the meetings, they define their institutional system and, if we were to interfere, we would be committing an act of violation and, most importantly, we would be going against the principle of subsidiarity by which we are absolutely and closely bound.
I would just like to focus very briefly on some of Mr Swoboda' s objections because he has touched on points which must be dealt with.
One of them is a point which might appear banal: consultation, civil society and resources.
I do not think we are talking about huge resources, but it is clearly the European Parliament itself which will have to describe to us in the debate, agree upon and give us the resources we need.
In my opinion, although we have not done any calculations during this phase, the amount will be a modest sum, but this is one of the areas that we must discuss together for Parliament is the budgetary authority.
A further point is the delegation of competences and agencies.
I am talking about the delegation of practical and technical activities, not political delegation, for no delegation is permitted in these areas. They are subjects which must be dealt with by the institutional authorities.
Lastly, Mr Swoboda raised another, extremely important point: discussing what the Commission' s core tasks are, namely its political priorities.
I would repeat that the Commission has undertaken - and it is no coincidence that I listed it among the annual commitments - to define its political priorities before Parliament each year.
This is the practice we have presented, we have proposed and we believe we must follow closely so that, each year, as happens in the most democratic and transparent government structures, the political priorities are presented to Parliament and debated in this House.
That is why this White Paper, would appear, on the one hand, to be a genuinely innovative, substantial move towards democracy and transparency; on the other, some areas of it are still vague but this is because it is a proposal which we could not present as a finished product today: we need to work together to refine and develop it.
It is the framework, an outline, and I would like to thank you for your criticism today which, I am sure, will be a great help to us in our future work.
I would like to end by thanking you and by saying simply that we must view all this precisely in the context of the three stages of the major European reform which we have outlined and which will be implemented over the next three years: firstly, reorganisation of the way we work internally; secondly, working together to plan how we should organise the major process of reforming the institutions, therefore Laeken; and thirdly, how to carry out the process of reforming the institutions.
I feel that today' s debate is good preparation for the other two stages.
I would like to thank you because, in debating this issue today, we have initiated cooperation which will last for almost a year, until we present the final version of this White Paper and it becomes our self-regulation instrument, as Mr dell' Alba would call it.
That is, it will become the code, the rule which will enable us to work effectively and get back to the true spirit and meaning of the Treaties, to get back to the core working role of each institution.
I would like to thank Mr Prodi, the Members of Parliament who have spoken today and all those who have taken part in this debate.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0332/2001).
Part I
Question No 37 by (H-0602/01):
Subject: Managing the huge potential of the waste market With waste generation in the EU amounting to around 1 300 million tonnes a year and total waste generation increasing by around 15% over the period 1995 to 1998, managing waste represents a huge market for the Member States without even taking into account the potential of the market following enlargement.
What new initiatives does the Commission intend to bring forward to highlight this market, and how can it demonstrate to Europe's young people the potential for new employment opportunities in this market?
Mr President, as Mr Collins so rightly points out, waste management is a huge market.
Indeed, it is the biggest environmental market, accounting each year for around EUR 44 billion and 0.5 to 0.6% of Community GDP.
Moreover, companies whose primary activity is waste management employ between 200 000 and 400 000 people.
In terms of new initiatives, the Commission is currently in the process of developing several that will highlight the potential of the waste market.
First, the Sixth Environmental Action Programme in the waste field; this aims to decouple degeneration of waste from economic growth.
It announces that the Commission will come forward with thematic strategies on both the sustainable use of resources and on recycling.
This will take a long-term look at both questions.
One of the aims of the recycling strategy will be identifying policies and instruments to encourage the creation of markets for recycled materials.
Secondly, in addition to the aforementioned thematic strategies, the Commission intends to propose legislative initiatives addressing specific problems such as batteries and packaging waste.
Together with legislation on electronic waste and end-of-life vehicles, these initiatives should further boost the waste management markets.
Thirdly, following the Gothenburg European Council, the Commission is in the process of preparing a report on how environmental technology can promote growth and employment.
This will be presented to next year's spring European Council.
Finally, the integrated product policy will address issues dealing with design, manufacturing, use and disposal across the whole life cycle of a product and will therefore impact upon waste generation.
It is a challenge to demonstrate to Europe's young people the potential for new employment opportunities in this market.
Certainly, all stakeholders have, at all levels, a role to play.
The Commission can play its role by keeping waste management issues high on the Community policy agenda and providing high quality information.
However, it is clear that education remains within the competence of the Member States.
I thank the Commissioner for her very comprehensive and most informative reply.
Question No 38 by (H-0639/01):
Subject: Infringement of competition rules in relation to DVD sales The DVD market is characterised by the existence of two different systems in Europe and in the United States and Japan, with the result that European consumers are unable to purchase DVDs from countries belonging to a different zone, where prices appear to be lower and delivery faster.
The justification given by large undertakings is that this is a means of protecting themselves against piracy. In my view, however, this is a clear violation of free-market competition rules, to the detriment of European consumers, and I have been informed that the Commission is investigating the matter.
Can the Commission outline the results of this investigation, and can it say how it will deal with the infringement of competition rules in the market for DVDs?
As a direct result of complaints from private citizens, the Commission launched an investigation on DVD pricing and on the DVD regional coding system in June 2001.
The citizens' complaints related to the fact that DVD prices were significantly higher in the Community than in the United States and that, because of the DVD regional coding system under which the world is divided into six geographic regions, a DVD obtained from the US could not be played on a DVD player sold in the Community.
The position of the major film production companies is that the basic purpose of such a regional coding system is to allow them to protect their copyrighted intellectual property and the traditional pattern of releasing their films at different times in different parts of the world, as well as to protect against piracy.
The Commission shares the honourable Member's concerns that the Community's consumers may suffer as a result of the DVD regional coding system.
It prevents them from benefiting from a broader choice of DVD titles and potentially cheaper prices.
The Commission is therefore investigating whether the DVD regional coding system is compatible with Community competition rules.
In this context all aspects relating to the establishment and the ongoing operation of the system are being examined.
Having sent requests for information to all companies concerned by the system, the Commission is currently reviewing the first batch of material.
Commissioner, I should just like to ask you if the same phenomenon applies to other products, i.e. if there are coding systems for other products, because the culture industry is extremely sensitive, there is huge competition from America, which we are unable to withstand, as we know all too well.
But I know that you are sensitive to the question of competition and I am sure that your investigation will bring in results.
Thank you, Mrs Zorba, for this encouragement.
We do not have information on other products being characterised by this system of regional coding.
At any rate not such typology has been conveyed to us by way of complaints, unlike in the case of DVD, which is the subject on which we are conducting the inquiry and to which your question is addressed.
If we had evidence in other areas we would, as always, try to be effective in implementing the competition rules.
Question No 39 by (H-0641/01):
Subject: Lloyd's petitions Following the investigations which it has conducted over the past year, is the Commission yet able to say whether Directive 73/239/EEC on non-life insurance undertakings has been properly transposed and implemented by the UK Government?
As a result of many complaints in conjunction with a number of petitions lodged by EU citizens with the Committee of Petitions of Parliament, the Commission has been examining very carefully whether the requirements of the first non-life insurance directive have been properly transposed and implemented with regard to the association of underwriters know as Lloyd's.
To date the Commission is unable to confirm that all requirements of the first non-life insurance directive have been fully respected with regard to Lloyd's.
The situation is extremely complex.
There are a number of specific provisions in the directive concerning Lloyd's that are clearly reflected in UK national legislation.
The Commission is seeking to complete its inquiries as quickly as possible.
These inquiries are now very close to completion whereupon a decision will be taken, either to close the case or to launch formal infringement proceedings under Article 226.
The Commission will inform Parliament of its decision as soon as it has been taken.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Bolkestein for his reply.
I recognise that he has reiterated what he said in a very full statement to the Committee on Petitions.
He informed the Petitions Committee back in July that the Commission would be ready at the end of the summer to give its response.
When I look outside the Chamber today, with the pouring rain, I think we are very close to the end of the summer.
I guess I am not going to get any clearer statement other than "as quickly as possible".
Could I perhaps also ask Mr Bolkestein whether he is aware of the failure of Independent Insurance in the United Kingdom over recent months and the appointment by the British Government of an inquiry into the Equitable Life insurance company?
Are his services looking at both of those insurance undertakings to satisfy themselves that in those respects the British Government has been properly applying European insurance directives?
The questions which have been put to me just now are twofold.
The first question is rather of a meteorological nature.
It would be absurd to deny that it is raining outside.
Whether that is tantamount to stating that the summer has ended would perhaps be premature.
I have been reliably informed that summers usually end about 21 September and the Commission is still striving to meet a deadline, although I must admit that the case is of such complexity that it will need a thorough investigation by not only the MARKT directorate-general but also by other parts of the Commission.
It may not be possible to meet that deadline exactly, but the Member who has just spoken can count on my personal endeavour to adhere to it as closely as possible, since the Commission ought to take a decision one way or another as soon as possible.
Concerning the second question that was put to me, the Commission has taken cognisance of the most unfortunate failures of the two insurance undertakings that were mentioned.
The Member will appreciate that Lloyd's is a unique case.
There is no other organisation in the world like it.
I would therefore hesitate to create the impression that what happened to the insurance undertakings to which reference was made is of any particular relevance to the case of Lloyd's. My service is looking at the failures of the other two insurance companies.
Naturally one is interested.
I have tried to follow it in the press although I do not know whether the press reports are exhaustive.
The people who help me in insurance undertakings have also taken a close interest, but may I assure the Member that we are fully stretched in looking at the Lloyd's case itself.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein. We shall await the end of the summer, as you have suggested.
Second part Questions to Mr Busquin
Question No 40 by (H-0606/01):
Subject: Exploiting the results of EU-backed research In June, the Commission and the European Investment Bank signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in order to boost research and technological innovation by offering financial support to researchers.
Given the need to exploit the results of EU-backed research and crucially to ensure downstream development and new job opportunities, can the Commission outline how it intends to raise awareness of and equality of access to these funds in Ireland and the other Member States, and what has been the initial reaction to this joint research and innovation agreement?
Questions to Commissioner Nielson
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me firstly remind you that following the Lisbon European Council, the Commission and Member States were invited to implement, with the support of the European Investment Bank, measures aimed primarily at strengthening investments in technological research and development.
The joint memorandum establishing a framework for cooperation between the framework programme for Community research and the Innovation 2000 initiative from the European Investment Bank is a response to this request.
This joint memorandum aims to energise European research and innovation by drawing on existing synergies and developing new ones.
It is not, however, an instrument of the framework programme nor one of the Innovation 2000 initiative.
The Commission and the European Investment Bank have separate decision-making processes.
Efforts are being made to stimulate public awareness of this joint initiative. I would like to point out, for example, that it has been mentioned on television, in the daily papers and by six press agencies in the days following the signing of the memorandum.
In addition to this, the Commission and the European Investment Bank websites are linked and offer information on the memorandum.
A didactic guide explaining the sources of finance, whether these are supplementary, sequential or parallel, from the Commission and the European Investment Bank will shortly be available on the Internet.
Presentations and workshops are planned for the launch of the next framework programme.
Finally, the invitations to tender relating to this programme will draw the attention of candidates to this possibility of supplementary financing.
The Commission also believes that equal access to this finance is crucial.
For this reason, assessments will be founded upon a certain number of principles that have been acquired over a long period, to ascertain quality, transparency, equal treatment, impartiality as well as efficiency and speed of implementation.
Subsidy requests from the Commission and loans from the European Investment Bank will follow the procedures currently in force.
On the one hand, experts from the Commission will carry out an evaluation according to the regulations stated in the framework programme, which are specifically based on scientific quality, innovative nature, added Community value and prospects for economic development.
On the other hand, the economists and financial analysts from the European Investment Bank will assess the projects in order to ensure that they fulfil the objectives of the EIB, including those linked to their Community mandate, that they satisfy the criteria of economic and financial viability, especially in terms of the repayment of loans, and finally that they are acceptable in environmental terms.
The signing of the joint memorandum has already received a favourable response from researchers, universities and entrepreneurs, particularly with regard to venture capital.
They recognise the potential of such an agreement and the opportunity it offers in terms of combining Commission financing for integrated projects such as those proposed in the framework programme and loans from the European Investment Bank.
This is therefore a complementarity that we have been eager to implement.
I thank the Commissioner for his response.
However, I was looking for something more specific, if possible, under three headings.
Firstly, what consultation before the money is made available has been organised with research foundations, for instance universities, private research foundations and so on?
Secondly, will outside technical assistance be used in the operation of the programme?
If there will be outside technical assistance, who will be operating it?
Thirdly, on the evaluation by the Commission and the EIB: is the evaluation purely based on economic return from the work or is it to ensure that there is ground- breaking scientific work which may not have an immediate economic return but could potentially in five or ten years time?
Those three areas are of vital importance to people who are involved in cutting-edge technology that we do not know about today but will be using in ten or fifteen years' time.
I think that Mr Crowley' s questions are absolutely pertinent.
That is the reality on the ground.
So, what is happening at the moment?
We currently have a framework programme for technological research and development that the Commission has been funding since its adoption by Parliament and the Council.
Until now there has been no link between what we do and what the European Investment Bank also does to support loans for innovation and infrastructures.
The objective therefore is to establish a link between the two.
This idea of mutual recognition should obviously not be a mechanism whose sole purpose is to complicate matters.
This is, therefore, why each body upholds its own procedures.
We have our own specific procedures for scientific assessment as well as for the framework programme and the European Investment Bank has its own financial and economic criteria.
It is true that we are currently, with the European Investment Bank, studying solutions that will hopefully be used in the development of new processes that help innovation and new financing procedures, taking account of experience already gained on the one hand by the framework programme for research, and by the European Investment Bank on the other.
This work is in progress.
I cannot foresee what the results will be but I can already tell you that the mechanism has already been implemented at Heidelberg, amongst other places, where a technology transfer centre is to be financed by the European Investment Bank under conditions that are very favourable to this centre, which has chosen to work with the European Investment Bank.
This would not have been possible without the privileged contacts that we had in relation to research programmes.
There are examples, therefore, but a great effort with regard to information and the study of dossiers still needs to be made.
I thank you for your question and I hope that it will contribute to the dissemination of this information.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Mr Busquin for his initiative, because the European Investment Bank has an excellent set of tools for actively supporting research.
My question is, can the European Investment Bank also grant indirect subsidies, e.g. to organisations helping small and medium-sized enterprises, so that the small and medium-sized economy in Europe which, as you know, accounts for 60% of the gross national product and employs two-thirds of the workforce, can also benefit.
We need indirect arrangements here too.
Yes, that is clear and is precisely the idea of the "Innovation 2000" initiative that the European Investment Bank put forward at the Lisbon Summit.
This is, therefore, absolutely possible right now; a sum of EUR 1.5 billion has additionally been set aside by the European Bank within the framework of European Investment Fund.
As there is currently a strong bond between the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, the "Innovation 2000" project includes EUR 1.5 billion to support technological innovation, especially in small- and medium- sized enterprises.
It is possible that this information is, unfortunately, still relatively unknown and I think that it would be useful for it to be disseminated.
Question No 41 by (H-0604/01):
Subject: Eradicating poverty and the European Community's development policy In a statement jointly issued by the Council and the Commission on 10 November 2000, the main objective of Community development policy was confirmed as reducing and, eventually, eradicating poverty.
Despite the extraordinary and unique efforts of the European Union, which provides approximately half of all public aid to developing countries, the fact remains that in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, over 40% of the population are still living below the poverty line, and world-wide, 800 million people, 200 million of them children, are suffering from chronic malnutrition.
Now, almost one year later, what progress would the Commission wish to point to in relation to the worthy objectives set out in the joint statement, and what more does the Commission believe we can do to encourage other countries to follow the EU' s lead and play their part in reducing and eradicating poverty?
Mr President, since November 2000, the Commission has taken a number of important steps towards strengthening poverty reduction in Community development cooperation.
With regard to the EC's own efforts, progress on implementing the poverty focus has been reported through various Commission papers.
The Commission is midway through the process of preparing poverty-focussed country-strategy papers for the ACP countries which will implement the Cotonou agreement.
Developing countries' own poverty reduction policies are the foundation for these country-strategy papers.
A working paper of the Commission services has been drafted on measures taken and planned to take forward the poverty focus of the EC's development policy and poverty awareness training has been offered to the Commission's development staff.
The communication has been produced showing how the Commission is mainstreaming gender equality in development cooperation.
Gender inequality is a significant determinant of poverty.
Progress has also been made in developing policy coherence for poverty reduction, for example, a communication has been prepared on core labour standards and social development.
With respect to other donors, it should be noted that many EU Member States have already made poverty eradication the main objective of their bilateral development programmes.
The EC is explicitly and financially supporting the poverty reduction strategy papers as the main vehicle for ensuring universal and coordinate donor support for efforts by developing countries to eradicate poverty for their populations.
Regular contact has been established between the Commission, the IMF and the World Bank and with the UN agencies to coordinate our support for the poverty-reduction strategies of developing countries.
We strongly endorse the principle of country ownership of development policies which is intrinsic to this PRSP approach.
Finally, it should be highlighted that the Commission has contributed to work by the Development Assistance Committee, the DAC of the OECD, to develop policy guidelines for Member countries.
All in all this means that we have never been in a situation where the coordination and consensus among the donors has been better.
It is very important that we play our part in this common work.
Furthermore, a consolidated report will appear in the annual report on implementation of external aid from the Commission and that annual report will appear later this autumn.
Mr President, very briefly I want to thank the Commissioner and congratulate him on the progress he is making in the particular area of poverty reduction.
It is a terribly important area but in the new ACP-EU partnership agreement there is a special reference to the tackling of corruption.
In the context of poverty reduction, what progress is the Commission making in tackling corruption?
One of the things I noticed throughout the ACP-EU partnership debate was the lack of emphasis on education.
The importance of education cannot be underlined enough.
It is extremely important that, in the tackling of poverty reduction, education is given a high priority.
Would the Commissioner agree with this particular statement?
I shall answer the last part of the question first.
The real dilemma is that everything is lacking and everything is needed.
The response from our partner countries in the ACP group has, to a large extent, been dominated by quite a high priority on infrastructure.
We will continue road building - big roads, small roads - but education and health are the next two items on the list of priorities.
We will be continuing a high-intensity effort on education.
Regarding corruption and the new instrument in the Cotonou Agreement - Article 97 - I can inform Parliament that it will be used.
Within a short time all this will come out in the first case of the new Article 97 being actively used.
This is not to say that we have a powerful and guaranteed effective instrument but it does mean that everything is out in the open and that we are addressing this problem.
It also means that we want to do this by means of a cooperative effort and not just as a sort of punishment.
The lack of capacity to do things right is also part of why things are done wrongly.
A broad-based effort is necessary.
We have to stick with it and we are going to use it.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 42 and 43 will be taken together.
Question No 42 by (H-0613/01):
Subject: Child sex tourism The international organisation, ECPAT, works in conjunction with tour operators to combat child sex tourism.
The Commission has hitherto provided a grant covering 60% of the cost of the project but ECPAT has now been notified that this support from the Enterprise DG will be withdrawn as of next year and the organisation has been recommended to apply for funding from other DGs instead.
The project is the only one of its kind and the Commission's support is fully in line with the Council's 1999 decision on efforts to combat child sex tourism.
The Enterprise DG has a responsibility, therefore, to ensure that the ECPAT project continues to receive support from another DG before the support in its present form is withdrawn.
Can the Commission promise that this unique and innovative project will continue to receive support?
Question No 43 by (H-0616/01):
Subject: Long-term aid to combat child sex tourism ECPAT is an organisation working to combat sexual exploitation of children, particularly in countries where European travel companies operate.
The financial support which ECPAT receives from the Enterprise DG is reportedly to be withdrawn from next year.
During the period that ECPAT has received funding from the Enterprise DG, very important work has been carried out, primarily for the incalculable benefit of an unknown number of children, but also for the travel industry, which has drawn up its own code of conduct.
Does the Commission have any idea how the highly important work done by ECPAT can continue to receive EU funding to ensure that forceful measures to combat child sex tourism can also be taken in the future?
Can the Commission envisage transferring the project to another DG?
The European Commission has been co-funding measures against child sex tourism since 1997.
The Commission intends to continue to fund such measures in the coming years.
The transfer of the management of budget line B7-626 - fight against child sex tourism in developing countries - from the Enterprise DG to the European Cooperation Office means that the human rights and democracy unit of EuropAid is now in charge of identifying and co-funding projects dealing with child sex tourism.
Organisations such as ECPAT, which are interested in obtaining co-funding should submit their proposals to this unit, which will continue to implement Commission policy in managing the budget line for the fight against child sex tourism, taking into account the best interests of target groups and best practice in project implementation.
If the proposal is accepted, the EuropAid Cooperation Office is ready to guide ECPAT through the further steps.
We will continue with this.
We believe that the change here will actually improve the efficiency of our activity in this area.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I note with satisfaction that the Commission is going to continue to provide ECPAT with resources.
Let me just say, however, that the child sex trade has not disappeared just because the newspaper headlines have disappeared.
It is therefore incredibly important that the Commission should continue with this work.
I nonetheless have a problem with the proposal put to us by Commissioner Nielsen, to the effect that this must all take place via Euroaid.
If I have been informed correctly, Euroaid requires that the implementing organisation be an NGO in a developing country.
That would rule out ECPAT, which does not carry on its main activities in the developing countries.
Nor has my own country been spared.
We have recently received a report from ECPAT, estimating that approximately 400 children in Sweden aged from 4 months to 17 years have been exploited.
These are frightening revelations, showing that we cannot withdraw support but must continue to give increased support to these organisations.
I therefore take the Commissioner' s words as a promise that this will happen.
The organisational form is something to which you will have to attend.
I am not sure that we have a problem concerning the fact that this is not an NGO in a developing country.
There is no intention whatsoever of changing the eligibility criteria for judging an organisation.
The principles are totally unchanged.
It is a question of improving handling efficiency.
Doing this in the same office that is handling matters relating to the human rights budget line should increase the intensity and awareness of the staff involved.
I do not think we have a problem.
I want to thank Commissioner Nielson for his positive answer.
In answer to Mrs Theorin' s justified question, he has produced an important clarification to the effect that this does not mean any change to the criteria for assessing whether an organisation, in this case ECPAT, is or is not eligible for continued EU subsidy.
Allow me to say that your fellow Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, has, in the same way as yourself today, Mr Nielson, given positive answers to questions raised by myself and a number of fellow MEPs here in the European Parliament.
It feels as if there is a genuine commitment to fighting the assault on human dignity constituted by one of our modern age' s most loathsome forms of the slave trade.
Allow me also to say - and I believe I can also speak here on behalf of Mrs Theorin - that we hope that the time is past when we have to ask questions about long-term financing for ECPAT' s activities and for the fight against child sex tourism.
Let there be an end to this jumping from one Directorate-General to another.
We definitely agree on the subject.
I just want to add one remark concerning the proportions in terms of money.
The organisation that has been discussed here is the biggest recipient in this field but we are still talking about quite a small amount of money.
Concerning the character of the problem, the visibility and the very official and strong involvement that we show by doing this at Commission level is a very important part of what we doing.
The economic support we are providing here is not a lot of money: about EUR 360 000.
Concerning the real problem, we should not get the wrong impression about proportions.
It is as important that we do it swiftly and efficiently.
Question No 44 by (H-0614/01):
Subject: Humanitarian aid for children During the seminar of 1 and 2 March in NorrkÃ¶ping, Commissioner Nielson presented shocking figures on armed conflicts and their impact on children.
According to UNICEF estimates, 2 million children were killed over the past decade as a direct or indirect result of armed conflicts, whilst a further 6 million children were left disabled or seriously injured, 1 million were orphaned, 20 million were forced to flee their homes and more than 300 000 were themselves involved in the fighting.
According to the Commissioner, these figures are not totally reliable because there is no effective system for recording such data.
Bearing in mind that the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office has spent around EUR 40 million on these children since the start of 2000, will the Commission act on the wish expressed by the Commissioner responsible and develop a standardised information system which might be used by those responsible on the spot - peace-keeping troops, staff working for humanitarian organisations, etc. to gather and record data, which would help to determine the real scale of the problem and deal with it more systematically?
Reliable figures on the impact of armed conflict on children are hard to come by.
Although data is available it is often context-specific, anecdotal or piecemeal.
The same consolidated numbers - two million children killed in armed conflict, 300 000 children involved in armed fighting, etc, which were brought to the attention of the international community in the excellent report prepared by GraÃ§a Machel back in 1996 are repeatedly invoked without qualification, although they cannot continue to hold true.
I first highlighted the serious lack of reliable data at my meeting with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr Otunnu, in December 2000.
Inspired by the discussion with him I took the opportunity of the seminar organised by the Swedish presidency in NorrkÃ¶ping in March this year to call for increased efforts to improve the knowledge about children in conflict.
Since that time ECHO has sought to build momentum for the initiation of a large-scale data collection project.
The main purpose of the endeavour is to get an impression of the real scale of the problem because the lack of reliable data is both detrimental to our advocacy efforts and a major obstacle to improving our humanitarian response.
But I do not want to initiate just another project resulting in a report which might never be used.
Numerous studies have already been conducted on children in conflict.
But, as long as there are no common concepts and common definitions, a complex project seeking to establish hard facts has little chance of succeeding.
Therefore, rather than focusing on instant results, we are seeking to build broad international support for a comprehensive initiative on a data collection methodology which will enable comparisons across regions and over time.
Last month, ECHO participated in the seminar in Florence - Filling Knowledge Gaps: a Research Agenda on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children - organised by the office of Mr Otunnu, Unicef and others.
The workshop succeeded in establishing a network of researchers from both the north and the south, who are ready to undertake research around four themes, one of which will be data on children affected by armed conflict.
In parallel with this initiative, ECHO will continue the cooperation with Unicef.
As the UN agency mandated with protecting and assisting children, Unicef has the potential to play a central role in data collection.
Therefore the Commission is encouraging Unicef to develop a substantial international data collection project on children in conflict, using Mr Otunnu's research network as a sounding board.
I am ready to make a political as well as a financial commitment to improving the availability of data on children affected by armed conflict as long as any new initiative includes general agreements on definitions, concepts and methodologies for the data collection.
The goal is to create a system that enables people working in the field, from all different kinds of organisations, to feed information into a uniform system.
This will also have a strong effect on the advocacy work in the countries in conflict because they will know that the numbers, the boys and girls we talk about, the real statistics that emerge from this operation, have been produced on their own home ground and are not something which may or may not be true found in a report.
Commissioner, I share your care and concern to improve the system and you have our support.
I have two real - not rhetorical - questions.
You said that often there are no common concepts or common definitions and that often we do not have the support on the ground which we need in order to conduct a proper investigation.
Who is stopping you?
I think that this is not just a national question. There are also political aspects which I do not expect you to take completely in hand, but they are there.
I also have a second question, which relates to this and the previous debate.
Wars do not only kill children; they also leave them orphaned or in poverty, which are traumatic experiences, and there are other aspects and I should like to ask if you are honestly addressing them.
For example, we have seen sexual abuse of children by our soldiers, soldiers of the European Union, in Somalia and elsewhere.
There is a huge campaign in Bosnia and Kosovo to prostitute children, young children, both boys and girls.
Is there anything you can do about this?
In relation to this question the most important supplementary aspect here is: who is stopping us?
Obviously we are being stopped in this effort by those who are causing the problems and who are responsible for the conflicts.
The conflicts we are facing today are conflicts where the civil population is not detached from the conflict.
On the contrary, they are more than hostages; they are victims.
This means that nobody fights an honourable war and the guilt of having abducted children and made them participants in the warfare is psychologically the main reason why it is so difficult to get the truth.
The environment is difficult, politically, and in every other sense of the word.
A free press does not have easy access to the places on the earth where these things happen.
Next week I will be in Afghanistan to show our support for the organisations we are funding there and who have volunteers working there.
The visit will also show the people of Afghanistan and the victims of the conflict that we are taking more than just a political interest.
We are taking a real, tangible, humanitarian interest.
By doing what we are doing we may also be pushing the limit for what is possible.
Question No 45 by (H-0636/01):
Subject: Humanitarian aid in the Caucasus What percentage of the humanitarian aid earmarked in 2001 for Chechnya and for Chechen refugees in neighbouring regions, including the Republic of Georgia, has already been distributed in the crisis region, and what is the schedule for the remainder of 2001 and for 2002?
Mr President, since the beginning of the conflict in 1999, the Commission has granted some EUR 44 million in humanitarian assistance to the victims of the Chechnya conflict.
So far this year, three funding decisions totalling EUR 18.5 million have been adopted.
They cater for the most urgent needs of those affected by the conflict, benefiting IDPs and the most vulnerable population in Chechnya as well as Chechen IDPs in Inguchetia and Dagestan.
This implies that in 2001, EUR 18.5 million of the EUR 25 million originally provided for have already been committed.
In order to determine further funding needs this year, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office will undertake another assessment of the humanitarian situation in September and subsequently submit a funding proposal to the Commission.
The main objective of this forthcoming decision will be preparation for the winter.
The geographic scope of the aid activities will be determined as per the identified priority needs.
The minimum amount required to this end is currently estimated at around EUR 11.5 million.
In 2002, ECHO intends to continue funding operations in line with its humanitarian mandate.
Obviously, the scope of ECHO's involvement will depend on the security situation and the humanitarian working conditions.
This notably concerns our operations inside Chechnya where things are still very difficult for us and where we are still engaged in a so far unsatisfactory dialogue with the Russian authorities concerning radio communication, access, and working conditions and security in general for the people working for our money there.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I should just like to ask two more questions.
First, what is the situation regarding humanitarian help for Chechen refugees in Georgia?
Unless I am mistaken, you have not yet said anything about that.
And secondly, are you planning a mission to Chechnya and does the Commission plan to set up a permanent representation there?
Mr President, on Georgia, I can give the following information: an estimated 7 000 Chechen refugees are believed to be in the Pankisi Valley in Georgia.
Since the outbreak of the conflict in the autumn of 1999, ECHO has allocated a total of EUR 820 000 in humanitarian aid to this beneficiary group.
The operations funded focused mostly on basic healthcare.
However, given the limited budgetary resources and the increasing humanitarian needs in the northern Caucasus, allocations need to be prioritised.
Therefore, so far this year, no funding has been earmarked for Chechen refugees in Georgia.
An ECHO assessment to be undertaken in September - the one I spoke about - as well as the further evolution of needs on the ground will determine possible further ECHO assistance in favour of Chechen refugees in Georgia.
This is a very cautious evaluation, but so far I am confident that the balance of our actions is correct.
On the Chechnya situation proper, I am not currently planning any mission there.
We are following very closely every activity there.
The setting up of an internal office is not considered to be the most efficient way to proceed at this time.
We go in and out and are monitoring as closely as possible and as closely as we are allowed to.
Question No 46 by (H-0666/01):
Subject: Oil exploration in Sudan Is the Commission aware of the scorched earth policy practised by the government of Sudan to clear the way for oil exploration and exploitation by major European oil companies in the Upper Nile region of Sudan?
In light of this policy what action is the Commission planning to take to assess the impact of this oil exploration on the human rights situation in the area?
Would the Commission promote a temporary investment ban on European investment in the Sudanese oil sector and a closure of its borders to Nile Blend crude oil until a lasting peace has been agreed in Sudan?
Would the Commission ensure the introduction of binding human rights legislation to hold companies accountable for their activities overseas, either directly or through affiliates?
I will start by quoting the last part of the question - 'would the Commission ensure the introduction of binding human rights legislation to hold companies accountable for their activities overseas either directly or through affiliates?'
I would react by warning against rushing into the principle of extra-territoriality in our legislation.
I have a clear impression of this House's strong opinion concerning the Helms-Burton Act with its extra-territoriality and the problems it creates.
It is necessary to approach this with caution.
As regards Sudan, we are following the political situation closely and we are actively participating in the political dialogue between the EU and Sudan that was resumed in November 1999.
Despite continued concerns about the human rights situation and the lack of progress in the peace process, the political dialogue is considered to be generally positive and it has been agreed to continue it for another year.
The Commission supports initiatives in favour of human rights in Sudan and is planning a study to prepare a more comprehensive strategy in this area.
The Commission is aware that economic issues, like sharing Sudan's oil wealth, play an ever increasing role in the conflict.
So one could say that the development of this oil sector has raised the stakes for the peace negotiations.
Hopefully it could be turned into an asset for that peace negotiation process.
The Commission is aware of the accusations that many people living near the oil concessions have been forced to leave and that they have been exposed to human rights abuses.
We believe that there is no doubt that militias armed by the government to protect the oil fields and militias supported by the SPLM are involved in human rights violations.
However no accurate independent and objective information is available to confirm a large-scale scorched earth policy organised and implemented by the government.
As regards a possible investment ban, the Commission doubts the utility of unilateral sanctions as a foreign policy tool.
We are convinced that a policy of engagement rather than isolation is the best way to have our concerns heard and expectations met.
As far as legislation is concerned, the Commission already promotes respect of human rights by EU companies wherever they operate, in particular through the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises.
This instrument, although not legally binding, entails strong recommendations by 33 governments to their multinational enterprises to operate in a socially responsible manner worldwide.
It is clear that this is not the same as what is asked for in the question but having broad international support for these principles is in any case necessary to promote efficiency.
I believe this is the best way of proceeding.
I will be brief.
I do not see the relevance of this idea of ex-territoriality.
We are talking about major European oil companies and they should be held accountable for their activities.
We must not forget that the money and the profits that are being made by these companies are coming back into Europe.
Major European companies have to be accountable in how they operate in other parts of the world.
If there was binding legislation that major European companies had to adhere to, then you would not have the situation we have at present.
This does not just concern major oil companies, it also concerns other European multinationals which ignore their responsibilities for human rights, for the environment and for basic civil liberties.
They are making huge profits and we here are benefiting from those profits.
We have to address that issue.
If I were in a more cynical mood I would say that you are slightly optimistic in saying that we are benefiting from the profits of the oil companies.
What I said about the principle of extra-territoriality is right.
It is a real problem to legislate here for what is going on in another country.
The real problem is that what is legal on paper or in practice in a country like the Sudan can be very different from what we would accept as being legal here.
But that difference is part of the reality of our world.
So I will stick to my warning against this Parliament following what the American Congress has done with the Cuba problem, seen from their point of view and the Helms-Burton Act, by imposing outside their own principles of jurisdiction.
We can agree with them or not, but these principles were only decided on by them.
That is the core of the problem.
