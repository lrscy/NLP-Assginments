One is a first-class politician on agricultural matters; the other is a first-class jurist.
I simply wanted to clarify that for you to avoid there being any confusion about who will speak.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
You are as it were our resident lookout.
Nothing escapes you!
Thank you for pointing that out.
I am sure that I would have noticed later on, because the right Mr Mayer is also in the Chamber.
(Verts/ALE). (IT) Mr President, I must say I do envy Mr Posselt his powers as a tribune, which not all of us in this House possess.
However, the twenty-seven countries which have ratified the Treaty of Rome include eight Member States of the European Union, while the other seven have failed to respond to the call.
That is one of the paradoxes of the European Union and it is also a consequence of the lack of a genuine common foreign policy.
Indeed, what other motive can there be for the Member States of the Union which have not yet ratified the court statute, apart from hesitation about a real, significant further transfer of sovereignty and a certain lack of confidence in themselves, perhaps still fearing that one day they may somehow find themselves in the uncomfortable position of the accused?
That obviously applies even more to the other major players on the international scene.
It was right to note, as we did in our resolution, that President Clinton signed the Treaty of Rome at the end of last year, but it is legitimate to wonder if he would have done so had the Florida vote chanced to give the victory to Al Gore.
There is still a long road, fraught with obstacles, to be covered before the court can actually start work. As the resolution suggests, it is vital to prevent changes to the statute and there needs to be action to bring the implementing regulation rapidly into force or, at least, finalise it.
We hope the European Union will make this one of its foreign policy priorities since we are all in agreement, in theory, and we also hope Parliament can continue to play an influential role to make the court a reality, putting the issue of the criminal court on the agenda for every meeting of the mixed delegations, and supporting and adopting resolutions like the one we will be voting on shortly.
I therefore regret the fact that the joint motion for a resolution does not pick up the issue of the mixed delegations, but I fully endorse the proposal and hope we will be able to adopt it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes Parliament will be adopting a resolution on the International Criminal Court for the eighth time in four years.
This is evidence of Parliament' s determination and resolve in following, step by step, the slow development of an increasingly necessary international justice - as demonstrated by the cases of Milosevic, Mladic, Pinochet and so many others. They are now beginning to lose the impunity which has so far ensured that so many assassins and criminals have been able to carry on in their posts undisturbed, and even take retirement with full honours.
It also demonstrates how committed Parliament is to that development, pointing the way for the European Union in many cases.
I remember the early resolutions, when we called loudly for a European Union with 15 Member States united and resolute in this fight, defending the essential principles of the court: the independence of the prosecutor, the court' s autonomy in trying criminals, the definition of the purpose of the court' s mandate and so on.
Those objectives have been achieved.
Mrs Frassoni has rightly stressed the importance of confirming those objectives and defending the content of the statute from those who sign up to it - such as Clinton, for instance, or others - to continue to belong to the Court Assembly of Member Parties, but actually in order to influence the negotiations negatively, even seeking exemption for American soldiers.
Exemption is not what is needed; what is needed is to achieve the sixtieth ratification as soon as possible. That is the real test for the fifteen.
I hope the issue will be on the agenda in our relations with third countries, and I hope the seven countries of the Union which have not yet ratified the statute will do so this year.
Mr President, it does indeed cause some confusion when two people have the same surname and not even the parliamentary staff are able to distinguish between them.
Our post also gets mixed up sometimes for the same reason.
Following the horrific events of the Second World War, the United Nations refloated the idea of setting up an international criminal court.
Further impetus was given to this initiative by the violations of international law in Yugoslavia and the massacres in Rwanda.
Some people are asking where the International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction compared with the courts which already exist.
The ECJ in Luxembourg rules on the application and interpretation of the treaties of the European Union.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague rules on international disputes.
The International Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg passes judgement on violations by States of rights arising from the Human Rights Convention.
The International Criminal Court is being set up for the four particularly serious crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.
Until now the United Nations has authorised special courts, for example the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the crimes committed in Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
In the future, the International Criminal Court will send out a clear signal that perpetrators of any of these crimes will be prosecuted and punished.
War criminals will no longer be able to hide behind the borders of sovereignty.
The new Court is an important achievement for the international community which will allow it to close loopholes in criminal prosecution.
I should therefore like to call on all of the Member States to ratify the Statute soon, and I would recommend adoption of the resolution.
Mr President, this joint motion for a resolution on the ratification of the Rome Treaty to establish the permanent International Criminal Court comes at an opportune moment.
Only yesterday in this House we debated our priorities for the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The Swedish prime minister once again reiterated the importance of human rights during the Swedish Presidency.
The discussion this afternoon is yet another vivid reminder of injustices around the world.
Therefore it must follow, and I hope the House will agree, that if we are serious about the human rights of men, women and children, then we must have a permanent International Criminal Court to prosecute those who carry out or commission crimes against humanity.
We need a criminal court with international jurisdiction, which can independently judge those accused of such atrocities.
Only with complete determination to implement the Rome Treaty will we be able to end the impunity of the perpetrators of these crimes and contribute to the deterrence and prevention of such crimes in the future.
As we have heard, 139 governments have signed the Rome Treaty yet sadly only 27 have ratified it.
Sixty such ratifications are needed for the Treaty to enter into force and for the Court to be set up.
Therefore I believe it is imperative that the Member States set an example.
Already Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Germany, Austria and Finland have notably and honourably ratified the Treaty.
It is now time for the remaining Member States of the Union to follow suit.
Cynicism is an easy option and I will not indulge in it.
I believe we should welcome the signing of the Treaty on 31 December by the United States of America and we should also welcome the Yugoslav Federation signing the Treaty on 19 December 2000.
We must now call upon those parliaments to ratify the Treaty.
Nonetheless, at the same time we must urge all states to continue to support the work of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia.
History teaches us that we must never forget.
Therefore, look back across the last millennium.
Look now across the world as it is and remember that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
Future generations will never forgive us if we turn our minds away from those who have suffered such terrifying atrocities and who continue to suffer as I speak.
Words are not enough.
The time for action is now.
Sign the Rome Treaty on the ICC and thereby signal our commitment and our challenge to the rest of the world.
As co-author I urge the House and the Council to support this motion.
Mr President, if we look at the list of EU Member States which have already ratified the Treaty, we see that five of the six founder Members have already completed ratification.
Only the Netherlands has not, although it campaigned exceptionally hard for this Court and also for its headquarters.
We therefore wonder what lies behind this.
Of the remaining nine Member States of the European Union, there are only three which have already ratified it, including much maligned Austria.
I should also like to call on the other States of the European Union to initiate the ratification process as soon as possible.
We need this Criminal Court so that international crimes against humanity - which, as you know, have unfortunately not diminished but tended to increase in number - can finally be referred to a significant, objective and worldwide body.
Earlier we spoke about Cambodia.
We are debating the former Yugoslavia.
The special tribunals which are set up there are certainly justified. But we must be aware that they are being defamed by some nationalist forces in these countries who say that they are victors' courts.
To prevent this from continuing to happen, it is tremendously important for there soon to be one unified criminal court throughout the world so that we no longer need to operate through special courts.
The Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague is very commendable. It needs our support.
But you will have seen that two days ago President Kostunica, who only recently was making solemn speeches in Parliament, refused to receive Justice Del Ponte because she was allegedly not of equal rank in accordance with the rules of protocol.
This is scandalous.
It shows how important it is not only to enshrine legal standards in international law throughout the world, directed against expulsion, mass murder and aggression, but also to provide the corresponding instruments with which to enforce them.
This is first and foremost this Criminal Court.
We have worked hard for it and it is high time that it be able to take up its duties.
Even though the setting-up of the International Criminal Court does not come within its remit, the Commission hopes that the required number of 60 ratifications will soon be reached so that the Court can become operational.
As of 31 December, the statute was signed by 139 countries and ratified by 27.
The Commission notes, with satisfaction, that the United States signed the Rome Statute on 31 December and the Yugoslav Federation earlier on 19 December.
In its relations with third countries the Commission will make every effort to recall the necessity to sign and ratify the statute as swiftly as possible.
In the meantime, the Commission will continue to provide grants to initiatives in support of the International Criminal Court.
So far, approximately EUR 4.8 million of grants have been provided to support the activities of NGOs or institutions working on information campaigns concerning the International Criminal Court.
The Commission will provide further support for these activities this year.
We want to promote this and use our cooperation with NGOs to keep up the momentum to make this Court a reality.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at around 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in El Salvador
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0068/2001 by Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the earthquake in El Salvador;
B5-0074/2001 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on El Salvador;
B5-0079/2001 by Mr Seguro and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the earthquake in El Salvador;
B5-0079/2001 by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the earthquake in El Salvador.
Mr President, disaster has struck once again in El Salvador, two years after Mitch, the terrible hurricane whose effects are still being felt to this day and for which, I might add, it would seem the European Union still has not come up with the money it had promised.
I welcome the resolution which we were able to draft together, but I do consider it to be the bare minimum after all the disasters which El Salvador has experienced, and now after this last earthquake disaster.
If truth be told, I find it a bit of a flimsy resolution, for although the feeling of solidarity which we all share and which gave rise to this resolution may be expressed well, we need to translate our solidarity into action, and that is why, on behalf of our group, we have tabled a few more amendments in order to bring this idea more into focus and to reinforce it.
Among other things, this is to enable the existing plans for improving the situation to be put into practice, especially the reconstruction programmes, but we should also deliver the money that Europe had set aside for this.
Despite this, we believe that the entire world, and we, along with the world, must express our dismay and solidarity, now that thousands of people have fallen victim to this earthquake.
An earthquake in a poor country is, of course, all the more serious the less resistance and less resilience the country has.
El Salvador has survived a war and natural disasters, and now there is this on top of everything else.
In order to work ecologically in environmentally responsible circumstances, the government too should set its political preferences for certain forms of politicisation of aid to one side, and we, on the other hand, must meet our obligations.
Mr President, with regard to this resolution, which has received the consensus of all the groups, I would like to mention the last section, which refers to the need for effectiveness of the economic aid which, on this occasion, we are going to send to El Salvador, that very needy country.
I have just spoken to the office responsible for humanitarian aid in Nicaragua and I would like to communicate to this House, and to the Commissioner, the great concern of all those self-sacrificing people who, today, are working on emergency aid, and who, tomorrow, will be involved in cooperation work, and the concern of the Spanish and international media about the fact that we have yet to send the promised economic aid following hurricane Mitch, when we are now facing the next tragic event.
Members of the Commission, let us see if, this time, we can make it on time.
I am saying this not only as a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, but also as coordinating spokesman of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
To spend so late is to throw money away.
Money must be spent on time and the officials - not only those in El Salvador, but also those in Brussels - will have to assume their responsibilities.
Mr Kinnock' s reform must serve some purpose. Let us see whether or not, this time, the aid to alleviate the consequences of the earthquake arrive before another tragic event strikes this sister country.
To be effective, aid must arrive at the right time.
Otherwise, there will be so many people working with no compensation in those countries, so many people waiting, so many administrative costs, and for what?
If we cannot do it any other way, let us send aid by means of the Member States.
We already give money to the UN - to the UNHCR - we are the main contributors, and they only fly the United Nations flag.
So, although it does not look good, let us do it by means of Spain or Austria, or under two flags, but the emergency aid, and especially the cooperation aid, must arrive.
Let us not make fools of ourselves again.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the figures and images coming out of El Salvador are terrifying, with the hundreds of dead, the thousands of wounded, the hundreds of people who have disappeared and the approximately 26,000 who have lost their homes.
There are continual aftershocks in El Salvador and even in Nicaragua.
This situation occurring in Central America is nothing new.
As Mrs Maes and Mr PomÃ©z Ruiz pointed out, Hurricane Mitch, in November 1998, also had tragic consequences in both human and material terms in that part of the world.
Central America is one of the world' s poorest regions.
Around 40% of the population live below the poverty line and Europe therefore has a particular responsibility to the region not only because it is a region that has experienced much serious conflict and where there is still tension, particularly over borders, but also because we need to assist their recovery for the sake of democracy.
I am happy to say that all bodies there are democratically elected, but very undemocratic habits still remain in these Central American countries.
Apart from this, they have a very large foreign debt and only two countries are involved in the initiative that has been launched.
Therefore, the impression we receive from the principal authorities in Central American countries - and on Tuesday we had the opportunity to receive the President of Honduras - is of a people that is suffering and that, just when it sees a little light at the end of the tunnel and starts to pick itself up in order to confront its problems and its history, is struck by tragic situations caused by these natural disasters.
Europe acted promptly in sending emergency aid, both in November 1998 and this time.
Nevertheless, the problem requires - as my two fellow Members have already stated more than adequately - more structural aid.
It is vital that the Commission implements its reconstruction programme for Central America.
What we are proposing, Commissioner Nielson, is that there should be a rapid redefinition of this programme, with greater resources, both human and financial, to achieve the objective of assisting El Salvador as well.
On 26 March of this year, another meeting will be held between the San JosÃ© Group and the European Union in Guatemala.
A positive way to conclude this meeting with the San JosÃ© Group would be to proceed to implement the reconstruction programme for Central America with the new procedure for helping the victims in El Salvador.
Mr President, my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, would like to add its voice to the expressions of sympathy for the families of the victims of the recent earthquake, and for the people of El Salvador, following this latest tragedy.
In fact, I had the honour and gratifying responsibility of presenting a report to this House, on behalf of the Committee on External Affairs, on aid for the reconstruction of Central America following Hurricane Mitch, which was adopted unanimously.
The truth is that I feel frustrated that our hopes and efforts have not been accompanied by efficiency on the part of the people responsible for the implementation of this programme.
On that occasion, I pointed out that, when the hurricane struck, the Commission acted quickly in terms of initial aid.
This has been the case this time as well, but we must continue to provide this aid. We must be more efficient.
The scale of the earthquake was considerable.
This region was beginning to recover and it is going to be essential that we make an immense effort to achieve levels of economic, social and democratic security.
The European Union has to do some very hard work in this area and, amongst the problems to be faced, there is one I would like to highlight: the fraudulent diversions of the aid sent.
The European Union - and the Commission in particular - must prevent this from happening, by guaranteeing that associations, NGOs and local authorities actively participate in the utilisation of the aid, for the sake of the efficiency and justice of the efforts made by the European Union.
Mr President, the PPE-DE Group is shaken and filled with consternation at the news of the severe earthquake in El Salvador.
We express our deep sympathy and solidarity with the many who died or were injured and the many who have lost their family and their possessions.
The PPE-DE Group supports the motion for a resolution tabled by several groups in the European Parliament.
It is good to know that the Community has responded to this natural catastrophe so promptly by dispatching experts and money.
This is a convincing example of solidarity.
This is a suitable occasion for me to add that, as a positive member of the generation of 68, when I was a reserve officer in the German army in the seventies, I did not throw stones as other young men did, but searched with my own hands for the dead and injured in an area of Italy which had suffered an earthquake.
On that occasion we were able to rescue very many people who had been buried alive.
This is a great joy.
I can still see the dreadful images from the seventies of the earthquake in Italy, and I can understand the sense of distress prevailing in El Salvador.
It is excellent that Europe has sent help so quickly.
It is to be hoped that the aid will not come too late and that it will enter El Salvador through the proper channels.
Mr President, I really must say that I am quite amazed at how one can manage, in a debate about an earthquake in El Salvador, to say that one was a reserve officer in the German army and a "positive" member of the generation of 68 and to talk about stone-throwing members of the 68 Movement.
I do not know what one has got to do with the other, apart perhaps from the fact that Mr Knolle felt compelled to tell us a little of his own biography, but this is perhaps not without interest either.
According to the descriptions of my colleagues, the events in El Salvador are dramatic and we have heard many speakers state quite correctly that if the question being asked here is how quick and efficient our aid is, then in the case of this natural catastrophe it does actually seem to be arriving quickly, our initial assistance I mean.
What concerns us, however - and what also characterised the discussion about the motion and how it should be worded in our group - is the fact that we know from experience that this has not always been the case.
We call on the Commission to ensure that the aid - when the European Union helps by providing a go-get-it approach, know-how, equipment and people on the ground - does not only arrive when the people have, for the most part, already helped themselves or when the next natural catastrophe is due to be dealt with.
The European Union's credibility, both internally and in its relations with its partners, is threatened when money is admittedly made available and aid is promised, but because of bureaucratic obstacles the aid either arrives far too late or not at all.
On the one hand, therefore, this is about immediate help for the poorest of the poor, who need our solidarity, but on the other hand it is also about the fact that we need to bear in mind that our aid is futile if it becomes entangled in a jungle of red tape.
That is why we are glad that this motion has been drafted jointly by several groups.
We hope, Commissioner Nielson, that the Commission will work just as quickly on this motion as Parliament has.
As for Mr Knolle, I hope that he does not encounter any stone-throwing foreign ministers.
Mr President, let me reply to Mr Seguro, who talked about the situation in Honduras.
I want to make it clear that as part of our decision last year, supported by this House, to increase our stake in the whole HIPC initiative - EUR 1bn, we decided to spend it globally, not just on the ACP countries.
The reason for this was that, as a consequence of Hurricane Mitch, Honduras was included in the HIPC initiative.
We needed to find a budget line outside European Development Fund money to make it possible for the European Union to be even-handed and support Honduras.
Honduras will receive EUR 15m as debt alleviation from us because of this.
This is, of course, in addition to what Honduras is receiving from the Hurricane Mitch mid- and long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction follow-up as part of the regional programme.
Several Members have raised concerns about the slow delivery of the more long-term reconstruction part of the Hurricane Mitch follow-up.
I can only agree with the criticism.
I myself have characterised this as a real scandal.
It took almost one and a half years for the Commission services to find the six to seven people to send to Managua to form the unit to run the implementation of the regional reconstruction programme of EUR 250m.
This is pathetic.
It is not just bureaucracy, it is a totally dysfunctional set-up of different parties who do not talk to each other.
This is exactly why I am still in the market for more TNT to blow up those kind of structures which are blocking good performance in the Commission.
The situation today for the implementation of this programme is that these people have now been working in Managua since early autumn.
Of the EUR 250m, we have specifically earmarked and started the execution in a number of the states covered by the reconstruction programme of more than EUR 80m.
So EUR 80m out of EUR 250 are now set to work.
Things are finally starting to happen on the ground.
I still want to make the very clear distinction - which I urge everyone who has spoken in this debate to note - between the immediate humanitarian short-term response to disaster and the long-term reconstruction work.
They are two totally distinct types of activity and this has to be borne in mind.
Nothing has moved slowly in the Hurricane Mitch follow-up, except, as I mentioned here, finding seven people to send to Managua.
But this is bad enough.
Let me now turn more specifically to the terrible situation in El Salvador.
Of course, the Commission fully shares the consternation and solidarity expressed in Parliament's resolution on the terrible earthquake which struck several countries of Central America, and in particular El Salvador.
The Commission - President Prodi, Mr Patten and myself - immediately expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and the authorities and announced a quick and efficient Community response to this catastrophe.
As in the past, when it assisted El Salvador after the 1986 earthquake through the construction of a new hospital and provided very substantial humanitarian and reconstruction aid to the countries stuck by Hurricane Mitch, the Commission stands ready to help Central America and El Salvador to face the present dramatic challenges.
As soon as the earthquake occurred the Commission humanitarian aid office, ECHO, directed a field expert stationed in Honduras to go directly to the scene and he was there by Sunday.
ECHO also arranged this Monday for a mission to be sent to make an initial assessment of the needs as regards cooperation with other donors and the local authorities.
It left yesterday.
On Monday I decided that the first response in terms of money should be EUR 2 m.
This would cover the things that we knew would be necessary in any case.
Without any type of coordination or further studying, it was clear that drinking water, sanitation, shelter, food aid and medical supplies would be needed.
We also were immediately clear as to the organisations we should ask to take care of this on behalf of the Commission, namely a couple of European NGOs and the Red Cross family.
We will follow up these initial decisions with further commitments, depending on the feedback we get on what we are going to do compared to other donors and so on.
Let me add here that this terrible catastrophe once again proves that poverty as such is dangerous.
Most people think that earthquakes and these types of catastrophe are much more damaging in our sophisticated societies with all the elaborate infrastructure we have, yet in El Salvador the immediate consequence has been that more than 50% of water provision to the whole nation is cut off because of damage to pipes, electricity etc.
So the secondary impact is enormous, often because the systems are vulnerable, not functioning very well.
For instance the flooding in Mozambique caused much greater damage to dams, road, bridges and so on than it would have done if the country had had normal, well-maintained, strong and more expensive infrastructure.
So poverty is dangerous, and this has to be kept in mind.
For this reason, we are giving more emphasis to disaster preparedness activities as part of our humanitarian assistance.
We are also considering as favourably as possible the requests for a re-orientation of resources available in Commission-supported development projects in the zones and sectors affected, including those foreseen in the framework of the post-Mitch reconstruction programme.
My view here is that we need additional resources for this.
It is not acceptable to divert money from the post-Mitch reconstruction programme which has had enough problems already due to our bureaucratic difficulties, but it is an asset that we have a unit in place in the region which consists of people who are specifically engaged in these kind of reconstruction activities.
Of course, this is an asset and we will definitely come back to the more long-term problems for El Salvador when we get beyond the immediate humanitarian response.
So I thank you for the very strong support here.
We will come back on how to do these things.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I now turn also to colleagues in their offices who should be here not at 6.30 p.m., as stated on the printed programme, but at 5.30 p.m., depending on when we are able to begin the vote.
The President already said at midday today that it would be 6 p.m., and it may be that it will be 5.50 p.m., and depending on the result of the vote on Mr Deprez's request it may even take place earlier than that.
I would therefore request, in accordance with the decision of the Conference of Presidents, that you please ask your colleagues to come into the plenary as early as 5.30 p.m. for the vote and help us to ensure that we are all here at 5.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Long-stay visa
The next item is the report (A5-0388/2000) by Mr Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on freedom of movement with a long-stay visa.
Excuse me, Mr President, but I thought that you had received an official request to postpone my report to a later part-session.
I have not received an official request, I was in fact waiting for an official request.
That is why I delayed slightly in announcing the debate, but apparently no one wished to approach the Presidency.
Mr President, as far as I am aware, a signed document was submitted to you earlier on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Therefore, I assume that you have received it.
And, again, as far as I am aware, this document is valid.
This certainly shows that the President of this sitting is utterly impartial.
I have not received this document, but I take it that what you say is true.
You are aware of the procedure concerning requests to postpone a report, we take a speaker in favour of the request, then one against, and then, if necessary, we hear from the rapporteur.
Mr President, I was distracted by Mr Knolle, but I will spare you the details of what he wanted to tell me.
Those who were in the Chamber just now know what I mean.
If I remember correctly, Mr Deprez wanted his report to be postponed.
Now I do not know why I have been given the floor first.
As rapporteur, he has in fact not yet told us why he is requesting this postponement.
That is why it would be only fair for you to give him the floor first.
Afterwards I will give my opinion and that of my group on this.
As a rule, we ask for a speaker in favour of postponing the report.
You were the first to raise your hand, Mr Schulz, you were the quickest.
However, I would, naturally, like to allow Mr Deprez to speak.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this morning' s sitting, the President informed the House that the Mr Ferri' s report had been postponed to a later part-session.
At that point, I myself accepted that the report that I had worked on and which, moreover, was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, would be postponed until this afternoon.
However, in the meantime, I was informed that most of the people who had taken part in this debate in my committee, and who I hoped would be able to speak before the House, had unfortunately sent their apologies as they were unable to take part in the debate.
This affects more than half of the speakers who were to attend this debate on a matter on which we are basically at odds with the Council, since, in the legal basis, there is a contradiction between what I propose and what is acceptable to the Council, and this is likely to have significant consequences for thousands of people who, every year, would like to benefit from free movement in the Schengen area.
Regretfully, then, I have had to note the absence of Mr Watson, chairman of the committee; Mr Pirker, coordinator of the Group of the European People' s Party; Mrs TerrÃ³n I Cusi, who was due to speak and who is coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, who also sends his apologies, being unable to attend, as well as two other speakers.
In these circumstances, concerning a matter where we require all the political groups to adopt a clear position, where it is a question of fundamental conflict between Parliament and the Council, I believed that it was important to have an in-depth debate and a full vote.
That is why I request that this report be postponed until Parliament' s next part-session.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle I support Mr Deprez's request.
I also support it on behalf of my group, because we believe that this is such an important issue - as Mr Deprez has said - that it requires the attention of the whole House.
And he has put forward a persuasive argument that many of the speakers who commented on this in the committee and who wanted to speak this morning are no longer here.
What was right for the Ferri report this morning must also apply to the Deprez report this afternoon.
But of course I should also like to qualify this by saying that we cannot deny that this debate is, amongst other things, about an agenda and calendar problem.
If we do not change our minds and make both Thursday and Friday working days here, then we will discuss this problem over and over again every Thursday afternoon.
In my opinion this can be resolved by creating a coherent and internally logical system for doing our work which runs until Friday afternoon.
In this specific case Mr Deprez has a right to have better attendance than he has now.
Mr President, of course I entirely agree with Mr Schulz's last point, but I should like this once to state quite clearly that, now that the Friday sitting has been abolished, there is a systematic campaign to abolish the Thursday sitting too.
On the other hand, the responses to this are far from systematic.
On Monday, Mr SeppÃ€nen said that his report was too important to be taken on Thursday evening.
Nevertheless, following Mr SeppÃ€nen's speech, this House made a democratic decision to take his report on Thursday evening.
Then at midday on Wednesday, the President of the sitting explained that with the agreement of the groups Mr SeppÃ€nen's report would be moved to Thursday morning.
This morning we were presented with an agenda, out of which it emerged that the Ferri and Deprez reports would be dealt with this evening.
This morning nobody protested against this.
At lunchtime Mr Ferri realised that he would be leaving and asked for his report to be postponed.
His request was granted, and Mr Deprez sat there and did not protest.
This afternoon Mr Deprez realised that his speakers had gone astray and now this evening he wants his report to be postponed.
This is looking increasingly like a Punch and Judy show, I really do have to say.
I should like very clearly to oppose this postponement.
Mr Schulz, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and I are Members of this committee.
We can air our views on this issue, and we should go ahead with the debate.
However, I would hope that proceedings could be more orderly in the future.
Mr President, I shall be taking more than five minutes, because the speakers from my group who have withdrawn have left 15 minutes.
Therefore, I can take 20 minutes.
So, Mr President, I shall speak as slowly as appropriate, because I believe that you do not intend to disallow a genuine debate that includes a full presentation of each argument.
Mr Deprez, I shall apply the Rules of Procedure.
You have been allotted five minutes and I shall allow you to speak for five minutes.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report is based on an initiative by the French Republic concerning third-country nationals, who are holders of what is called a national long-stay visa; in other words, one valid for no more than three months, which has been issued by a Member State of the Schengen area.
These third-country nationals are awaiting their residence permits in the Member State that approved their entry.
Under current Community law, namely, Article 18 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, third-country nationals are only permitted to transit through the territory of other Member States in order to reach the country which issued the long-stay visa.
Following their arrival in this country, third-country nationals cannot travel any further within the Schengen area until they have obtained what is called a residence permit.
This is exactly where the problem lies. It can take several weeks, if not several months, for a residence permit to be issued, mainly due to cumbersome administrative procedures, poor coordination of administrative departments in some Member States, and because the person concerned has difficulty in finding out the correct procedure to follow.
Accordingly, and this concerns thousands of people every year throughout the Union, a holder of a long-stay visa and who has not yet received a residence permit, is in the least favourable position by comparison with other third-country nationals as far as freedom of movement in the Schengen area is concerned.
The fact that a whole raft of extremely stringent conditions must be fulfilled, in each of our countries, in order to obtain a national long-stay visa makes this situation even more paradoxical, and, to my mind, even more scandalous.
Apart from cases involving family reunion, applicants for long-stay visas are subjected to a preliminary in-depth enquiry.
They must prove that they have adequate resources and, depending on the circumstances, produce either a document to certify that they have been accepted in an educational or research establishment, or a valid employment contract.
The objective of the French Republic is simple and is very clearly stated in the Explanatory Statement.
The aim is to enable freedom of movement in the Schengen area for holders of a national long-stay visa who are awaiting their residence permit.
All of us, or so I hope, at least, share this objective which aims to facilitate freedom of movement for these nationals.
Therefore, the problem lies not in the objective itself, but in the way that the French Republic has chosen to achieve this goal and the consequences of this in terms of the discretionary powers of Member States with regard to citizens' rights.
It is rather surprising that the French Republic initiative takes Articles 62(2) and 63(3) as its legal basis, as both of these relate to procedures and conditions for issuing visas.
Yet, if the real aim of the initiative is to facilitate freedom of movement for nationals, the required legal basis is Article 62(3), which stipulates that the Council shall, within a period of five years of the Treaty of Amsterdam' s entry into force, adopt measures setting out the conditions under which nationals of third countries shall have the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States during a period of no more than three months.
Ladies and gentlemen, the choice of legal basis is never an innocent choice.
In reality, the legal basis selected in the French initiative proves that the main aim of this initiative is to harmonise conditions for issuing long-stay visas by bringing them into line with uniform short-stay visas.
This means that, if we accept the proposal as presented by the French Republic, it would give any Member State involved in the closer cooperation under the Schengen Agreement the right to be informed of all requests for a long-stay visa made in every other country of the Schengen area, through what is called the prior consultation procedure, and, as a consequence, it would be able to block the freedom of movement by persons that this country does not approve.
In practice, if we accept these arrangements, it would mean that, through the prior consultation procedure, the French government could request to be systematically informed if Spain were to issue a long-stay visa to an Algerian national tomorrow, and it would have the right to object to the request, without anyone' s knowledge, because currently no one knows which countries make use of the prior consultation procedure and the Council refuses to release the list of countries.
Therefore, I myself chose to amend the initiative of the French Republic in order to bring it into line with the stated objective, as set out in the Explanatory Statement, which is to facilitate the movement of holders of a national long-term visa while awaiting their residence permit.
Moreover, I support the aim to implement a uniform long-stay visa system, as already currently exists for short-stay visas.
However, I hope, and I believe that we should all hope, that this initiative should be part of a clear, consistent, overall proposal from the Council and not part of an initiative which is sketchy in scope and shaky in its arrangements, like this one.
That is why I shall ask the House to accept the amendments that I have made with the full support of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak for the Committee on Petitions.
This is not the only issue concerning legally resident third-country nationals where we have a problem concerning the appropriate legal base.
I am thinking, for example, of the extensions of the 1408/71 Regulation concerning the coordination of social security systems.
The Tampere Summit in 1999 spoke of according similar rights to third-country nationals as those enjoyed by EU citizens.
Yet we still have those who wish to view them as short-term travellers, rather than as people who have much contribute to the Union.
Otherwise why would our governments be so keen to encourage inward investment from American and Asian companies?
We believe we need political coherence in our policy-making in this area.
The lack of such coherence partly explains the argument over the legal base.
The Committee on Petitions supports the view taken by the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, and thanks him for his diligence in this matter.
It was our committee's view that we could reduce the number of such disagreements with the Council in future by reducing the number of individual national initiatives in this area and looking instead for Commission proposals which go through an initial vetting procedure.
I know that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has already raised this with the Swedish presidency and we must hope it bears fruit.
On the substantive issue, while being aware that not all Member States are involved in the Schengen Agreement, of course, it seemed to our committee that we should bring the rights of third-country nationals into line with those of citizens.
This is particularly important where partners, not parents as it says in my explanatory statement for some very strange reason, are affected by a different legal status, and we have had a number of petitions on these issues which we added to our opinion.
We felt it was also important to support the position of Mr Deprez, as the need for this proposal itself is more the result of bureaucratic delay than decision-making.
It is our hope and expectation also that the Committee on Petitions will automatically be asked for an opinion in good time on such issues in future.
Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate Mr Deprez on his brilliant report which deserves our full support.
We have of course worked very hard on this report in our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
My dear Mr Deprez, I could not have wished for a better time for this report to be dealt with, because this is an excellent time - whenever Parliament sits is an excellent time - but I would have wished you better speakers.
But irrespective of this, I believe that the speakers who will now take the floor instead of the original speakers are perfectly able to make a contribution to this debate.
I should like to say quite clearly that both Mr Deprez's comments on the legal basis and his criticism of the Council and the Commission's approach to this area deserve our full support.
The Council and the Commission are acting just as unsystematically on this important issue as we almost did just now and as we have done this week regarding the agenda.
Where asylum and immigration are concerned we are dealing with a completely confused policy where individual initiatives are put to us one after another - sometimes by the Council, sometimes by the Commission, sometimes by individual Member States - but where there is no strategic approach.
But this is also precisely what this proposal - which is perfectly sensible in practice - is suffering from.
There is no strategic approach which draws a clear distinction between asylum and immigration, which regulates both appropriately and which deals with the important issue of burden-sharing, and all of this gives rise to problems.
These problems are then once again resolved by the back door by means of bureaucratic chicanery, and they are not resolved for good: these are pseudo-solutions.
If this initiative really does make the lives of those people who have a long-stay visa in the European Union easier then I welcome it.
But you cannot treat cancer with aspirin.
The way in which we have handled this important field in the last few years - and unfortunately still do so - cannot be allowed to continue. That is why I believe that Mr Deprez's critical comments are more than justified.
Practical easing of restrictions in the interests of people, yes.
Sensible burden-sharing where burdens arise, yes. And of course free movement for third-country nationals within the European Union.
But we call on the Council and the Commission finally to move from patch-up jobs to a systematic, strategic policy in this area and to present an overall, unified vision through which we can move step by step.
Mr President, I should like to express my satisfaction.
When we were talking this afternoon and I would have had to begin my speech with the phrase, "Mr President, absent friends," because altogether five colleagues were present, Mr Posselt said that if there were no other speakers there from his group apart from him, he would take over all of the PPE Group's speaking time.
This would have meant that we would have had to listen to Mr Posselt for a whole fifteen minutes.
Imagine that!
Now this cup has passed from us and we can turn to the issue addressed by Mr Deprez.
Mr Posselt, burden-sharing, which you talked about - one of your favourite subjects - has nothing to do with what we are discussing today, although I do concede that we need to talk about burden-sharing.
Allow me first of all to say to the Council that we are dealing with an initiative of the French Government, and recently in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs we have seen individual Member States taking initiatives time and again, and we have then seen that the Member States sometimes happen to be mistaken about their choice of legal basis.
For once I will dare to take up something which Mr Posselt said.
There is no strategic plan, particularly in the Council.
That is why the Council would be better advised to adopt Commissioner Vitorino's strategic plan, which is actually available, instead of blocking most of his ideas.
I say this as a point of principle to the Member States and the Council itself.
My second point is, why is there no strategic plan?
There is no strategic plan for one simple reason.
Policy in the European Union as far as freedom of movement is concerned, to the extent that it is pursued by the individual governments of the Member States, is characterised - not in all of the Member States but in the vast majority of them - by a defensive attitude, because in principle most governments in the European Union have as their premise the restriction of freedom of movement and not the granting of freedom of movement, which, incidentally, is defined as one of the four fundamental freedoms in the Treaty establishing the European Community.
We are dealing with a deficient strategic plan because we talk about the free movement of services, capital and goods, and from cattle to uranium they can move around freely in Europe.
It is only people who are subject to restrictions in the European Union.
They are subjected to these restrictions because of a defence mechanism.
When Mr Posselt talks about freedom of movement, he mainly means people from the southern hemisphere or asylum seekers.
But I am talking, say, about an American professor who accepts a chair at a German university, receives a residence permit for the Federal Republic of Germany and who, when he wishes to give a guest lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris has to apply for a visa, which he is possibly still waiting for because the French or German authorities are not making progress on it. This is because of the diverse and - for the lack of a strategic plan - very heterogeneous administrative provisions in the Member States.
I am talking about the engineer who is sent from a third-country to the EU by a firm which has offices in various different locations.
He is subjected to the same bureaucratic obstacle, which incidentally ought not to exist at all in a free market and in a free economy.
That is why, in connection with Mr Deprez's excellent report, I call on you, when you are debating the freedom of movement and its regulation, not only always to employ a defence mechanism against those whom we supposedly or really do not want here, but finally to realise firstly that freedom of movement is a human right and secondly that it makes economic sense in the European Union.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, the French initiative that we are discussing today once again demonstrates the importance of clarifying all the measures on free movement which present the problem of opening up borders.
All the statistics show that migratory flows have not diminished and that they will even increase over the coming years.
Therefore, the problem of free movement of third-country nationals within the Schengen area will again rear its head and become even more acute.
Yet, the citizens of Europe expect a clear and consistent overall policy on migration.
The amendment of Article 18 of the Schengen Agreement is the key element of the French initiative.
A holder of a long-stay visa should not enjoy fewer rights than a person who holds a short-stay visa.
The issue is to facilitate the free movement of migrants who return home regularly, whatever visa they hold.
We should be aware that, currently, third-country nationals may only transit through the territory of another Member State in order to reach the country which issued their long-stay visa.
From then on, they can no longer move around within the Schengen area until they have obtained a residence permit.
This is where the difficulty lies.
In terms of the principle of free movement, third-country nationals with a long-stay visa are in the most unfavourable position, even though they might have had to wait several months or even years to obtain the visa.
Furthermore, the text of the French initiative omits the problem of family reunion, a problem which arises in particular when citizens of the Union marry third-country nationals.
Why not therefore treat those who hold a long-stay visa as already resident so that they can enjoy the same right to freedom of movement?
As Mr Deprez also highlighted, the legal basis of the proposal could have been envisaged in a different way so that it covered all aspects mentioned in these arrangements.
To sum up, it seems right to reject an imprecise and incomplete initiative relating to a matter as sensitive as Community immigration policy.
In order to respect and fully guarantee Community legislative power, we must urgently adopt legislation on rights to freedom of movement, immigration and asylum.
The only way to prevent a Fortress Europe being built is to make our repressive visa policy considerably more flexible. The current system does nothing to reduce the migratory flow, on the contrary, it encourages networks of smugglers of illegal immigrants to thrive.
Mr President, I absolutely agree with Mr Deprez.
This is a really important issue which goes to the whole heart of why we have the European Union.
The fundamental principles of the Union are freedom, respect for democracy, human rights, and if you remove freedom of movement, if you stigmatise people because they have applied for a visa or they hold a particular type of visa, I believe you undermine the fundamental principles of the Union.
That is why I welcome the broad thrust of Mr Deprez's report.
It is a well-considered report and, as he said quite rightly, it is relevant to thousands of people.
But even if it was relevant to only one person, we would still be acting, I am afraid, years, decades, after the time when we should have acted.
It is, as he said, a means to achieve a goal and I welcome his legal basis of Article 62(3).
I share Mr Deprez's concerns and his amendments afford freedom of movement for those awaiting a definitive visa.
I welcome his refinement of the French proposals.
There is a real need for these proposals. We must treat people fairly and with dignity and remove the stigma of visa stays.
Some Member States will have reservations, but we must recognise that change is essential and that people must not be penalised in terms of their freedom of movement by unjustifiable and cumbersome administrative procedures.
I congratulate Mr Deprez on an intelligent and reasoned approach, with measures that facilitate freedom of movement for third-country nationals on Member State territories for a maximum period of three months.
This is a guarantee.
We should welcome it and therefore welcome his report.
Finally, perhaps this report will at some time enable us in this Chamber and in the Union to have a rational and reasonable debate on immigration and visa issues, decoupled from the ugliness of nationalism and xenophobia.
I welcome Mr Deprez's report.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to offer my congratulations on the thorough and exhaustive work of the rapporteur, Mr Deprez.
The Commission supports the objective pursued by the French initiative to facilitate freedom of movement within the Schengen area for holders with long-stay visas prior to the issue of a residence document with equivalent status to a visa.
However, the Commission cannot support the selected legal basis, which has obvious implications for the content of the actual instrument.
The Commission accordingly shares your rapporteur's position.
It considers that the proper legal basis for this regulation is Article 62(3) of the EC Treaty, "measures setting out the conditions under which nationals of third countries shall have the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States during a period of no more than three months".
For the sake of consistency with that legal basis, the Commission also agrees with your rapporteur on the need to amend Article 21 of the Convention for the implementation of the Schengen Agreement, which regulates the movement of foreigners, rather than Article 18.
The latter article merely specifies that long-stay visas are issued on a national basis and sets the conditions for transit by holders of long-stay visas.
The only further point that the Commission might add to those made by the rapporteur is this: it regards the amendments to the Common Consular Instruction as going far enough.
It is also necessary to amend the Common Manual so that border police can be informed of the new status of the long-stay visa.
Finally, the Commission can confirm its intention of shortly presenting an overall proposal for legislation as regards the right to travel in the Schengen area to avoid fragmentary action that would not be conducive to transparency and clarity in the public mind or certainty as to the law.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote on the report will take place immediately after the votes on the topical and urgent subjects of major importance, which are about to begin.
VOTE (continuation)
Mr President, this is the last explanation of vote of the part-session and if, with my foot broken and in plaster, I succeed in getting to the end of this last explanation as well, I shall have some hope of not having put my foot in it too often.
That said, I want to tell you that I consulted my daughter Elisabetta about this report.
She is a young lawyer and also a regional assembly member for the Pensioners' Party in Lombardy.
Her advice as a lawyer was to vote for the report as it stood, because it would mean more cases and lawsuits.
But as a legislator and assembly member, she said she should do, and advised me to do, what was best for the citizens, and vote for it only if it was amended.
And that is what I have done, Mr President.
We should like to thank the Fatuzzo family for their comments on the Deprez report.
The directive proposed by the French Republic is based on the mutual recognition of deportation orders as soon as they are issued by a Member State of the European Union.
The Communist Party of Greece rejects this approach because, at a time when deportation orders are already being abused in various countries of the European Union, the new directive will foster further violation of the law.
Experience has shown that the administrative authorities are even prepared - all too prepared - to issue deportation orders against legal immigrants who happen to violate certain rules (including the highway code), using the pretext of the threat to public order and national security.
The new law on aliens currently passing through the Greek parliament contains provision to this effect.
For these reasons, we voted against the Deprez report.

The Deprez report proposes that the holder of a long-stay visa who is awaiting a residence permit should enjoy the same rights to freedom of movement as the holder of a residence permit. This marks an improvement on the French initiative which proposed that a long-stay visa should offer the same rights in terms of movement as a short-stay visa.
In 1986, when, on the pretext of combating terrorism, France reintroduced tourist visas, the European Parliament requested that these be withdrawn, perceiving "discrimination towards citizens of non-member countries" .
Today, such discrimination has been made commonplace by the Schengen Convention and by communitising policy on migration.
Visas are refused by consular offices that operate with a total lack of transparency and rarely have to explain their reasons.
European consulates simply refer to "the migratory risk" or registration in the Schengen Information System.
In addition to the vast number of official rejections, an incalculable number of verbal requests have been refused point-blank.
A good deal of trafficking goes on in consulates because so few visas are issued.
This constant humiliation of nationals from the Southern hemisphere has no purpose except to stop them crossing borders and no effect except to encourage illegal immigration.
The Deprez report rightly concludes that there is a lack of transparency and democratic control when it comes to visas and movement in Europe.
That is why I shall vote in its favour.
Adjournment of the session
That concludes the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 18 January 2001.
Announcements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, on 26 January, ETA claimed another victim in a bomb attack in San Sebastian, which cost the life of Ramon DÃ­ez GarcÃ­a, an army cook, and injured two other people.
I should like to offer the European Parliament' s sincere condolences to the family of the victim and to send our wishes for the prompt recovery of those injured in this attack.
Unfortunately, all we can do is to reaffirm our feeling of revulsion and absolute condemnation of this indiscriminate violence.
At the same time, let me welcome to the visitors' gallery Mr Luis de Grandes and Mr JesÃºs Caldera, respectively the heads of the Popular Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party delegations of the Spanish parliament.
They have come to present to the European institutions the agreement for freedom and against terrorism signed by their political parties on 8 December 2000, to which many trade unions, employers' associations and Basque peace associations, among others, were signatories.
Your stance is all the more courageous, gentlemen, since ETA recently declared that all the present and future signatories to this agreement will be targeted by their actions.
Please be assured that you can count on the European Parliament' s solidarity.
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a statement to make.
The President of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities issued an order on 26 January in which he set aside the decision of the European Parliament of 23 October 2000 recognising the French Government' s notification announcing the ending of Jean-Marie Le Pen's mandate.
The order states that Mr Le Pen should rejoin Parliament and, of course, it is my responsibility to apply this court decision immediately.
Furthermore, I have asked the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for an opinion on what action the European Parliament should take in respect of this matter.
I have already noticed one new element: the President of the Court of First Instance has conferred upon the European Parliament discretionary powers in relation to a decree ending the mandate of the European Parliament.
If this decision were to be confirmed, the Le Pen case would be a further step to establishing the powers of the European institutions over national governments
Madam President, when, at your instigation, I left the Chamber of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, I paraphrased General MacArthur' s famous saying, when forced out of the Philippines by the enemy, "I will come back" .
Like him, having returned, I can today say, "I am back!"
The Court of Justice has indeed reinstated me as a legitimate Member of the European Parliament, acknowledging the sound basis of my defence.
Indeed, the House must be aware that, on the pretext of a trivial incident occurring during the election campaign, the Socialist-Communist Government elected several days later has, for three years, flouting all legal principles, conducted a veritable witch hunt against me with a view to ridding themselves of a political adversary in Parliament, even though I had the mandate of millions of voters.
It is, I believe, this fumus persecutionis, in combination with the violations of the law and of parliamentary immunity, primarily, which led the Court to make its ruling.
I am certain that all democrats will rejoice at this principled and just decision.
I wrote to you yesterday, Madam President, because the largest democratic country in the world, India, is going through a particularly tragic experience, and I think it would be appropriate for Parliament to show its intention of standing by the Indian authorities and people at this time, and I would ask you, with your approval, to observe a minute' s silence.
Thank you, Mr Dupuis.
I did of course send a message to this effect to the Indian authorities immediately.
Thank you for your suggestion, which, I believe, is the same as the suggestion Mrs Gill wished to make. I will readily invite you to observe a minute' s silence in honour of the victims of this horrendous disaster.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Madam President, thank you very much for that message of condolence, which is what I wanted to talk about concerning India.
Madam President, I rise concerning Rules 7(1), 7(2) and 8(4) of our Rules of Procedure to ask whether you or your services have received a communication from the British Government informing you that the Conservative Party has asked to change one of three names on its list, which would remove the name of someone elected in the East Midlands region in the European elections last June.
The change would be to remove the name of Mr William Newton Dunn and replace it with Mr Javed Arain, the fourth-ranked Conservative, who is here with us today in the public gallery.
You will no doubt know that the system of proportional representation was used for the first time in the UK in the last European elections and the people who voted in these elections voted for a party whose views they agreed with, not for an individual.
Perhaps if no communication has been forthcoming you could contact the British Government to ask for their official, legal position.
Finally, under Rule 7(3), I ask that the committee responsible, mentioned in this rule, look into the credentials of Mr Newton Dunn to see whether he has, in fact, proceeded in accordance with the Act of 20 September 1976, as detailed in our Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure says that we all sit here as individuals, not as agents of political parties and we do not take orders from outside.
(Applause from the centre and left) The essence of democracy is that individuals have guaranteed rights against the state.
The Conservatives, I am sorry to say, are now wishing to introduce a new doctrine that political parties have power over individuals.
That is the beginning of totalitarianism and that is why I left them.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Madam President, Mr Newton Dunn is perfectly correct when he draws attention to Rule 2, but what he forgets is that the elections in 1999 took place under proportional representation.
No elector voted for Mr Newton Dunn, or indeed for me or for Mr Heaton-Harris.
They voted for a party list and Mr Newton Dunn represented himself as fully in support of the Conservative Party, its leader and its European policy.
He has now completely abrogated that position and he is therefore denying the democratic rights of the voters of the East Midlands, over 40% of whom voted Conservative.
I call on Mr Newton Dunn to resign.
Although this British debate is very diverting, Mr Helmer, we do have an extremely important Commission communication on economic and social cohesion.
Madam President, I shall be very brief, but I too wish to speak on the subject of Portugal.
This was an enormous tragedy and the most serious aspect is the fact that six people were killed.
In addition to these deaths, which we can do nothing about, it has unfortunately already been predicted that there will be huge material damages and it will therefore be necessary to obtain the solidarity of the European Union.
As Mrs Figueiredo stated, we hope this House will support us in Strasbourg.
Madam President, it is the case that, although the United Kingdom electoral system is a list system, the names of those on the list appear in the order in which electors are invited to vote for them.
Therefore, it is the case that we are here as individuals as well as representing a political position.
That is very important and it should be known that the United Kingdom Conservative Party was among those parties that voted for the provision that names should be on the ballot, not off the ballot.
I should like to draw your and Parliament' s attention to a man-made disaster with which we shall be confronted in the course of the next few days.
Last week, I and two of my colleagues, Feleknas Uca and Konstantinos Alyssandrakis, were on a visit to Istanbul where we met former prisoners, their families and their lawyers, together with human rights campaigners in Turkey.
A large number of prisoners in Turkish jails are on hunger strike, with some of them prepared to die because of the Turkish Government' s policy towards prisoners.
I should like to call upon you, Madam President, to make contact with the Turkish authorities and press for a new dialogue to be embarked upon between the Turkish Government, on the one hand, and prisoners' organisations and the human rights organisations, on the other.
Otherwise, we shall see a succession of fatalities next week, for the hunger strike has been going on for months.
Thank you, Mrs Frahm.
I have certainly taken note of your comment.
Madam President, for reasons of a topical nature, I am in a position to give this issue my wholehearted support.
The day before yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak to Turkey' s Minister of Justice, and I made him aware of the urgent nature of the situation.
I would therefore ask you to take action accordingly.
Madam President, I wish to add my voice to those of the speakers who raised the issue of the tragedy that took place in Portugal last weekend.
In order to gain some insight into what happened, we need only bear the following in mind: last winter was the driest of the century and last December and January were the wettest in living memory.
These factors meant that all of the country' s actions to control the floods failed.
Furthermore, everything happened so quickly that unexpected deaths and floods occurred as a result.
We therefore need to make a much greater effort than might be considered necessary, because the situation has been truly exceptional.
Madam President, I too would like to express an opinion on the issue raised by Mrs Frahm.
I was a member of the delegation, as she rightly said, and like the rest of the delegation, I too was highly embarrassed in front of the parents of the political prisoners because, although they did indeed beg us to help their children, we were unable to respond.
I am surprised that, despite repeated appeals, by both my fellow Member Mr Korakas and me, still no representations have been made to the Turkish authorities.
I should like to ask you to make such representations as quickly as possible, before we start to mourn even more victims than we are mourning already from the attack on the prisons by the Turkish authorities in December 2000.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days, various parts of Portugal, especially in the north and the centre of the country, have suffered from terrible weather conditions, with torrential rain that has led to the loss of human life, the destruction of homes, families being displaced, damage to buildings, enormous harm to farming, fisheries, industry and trade, the destruction of communication lines and the closure of harbours and ports.
Not all of the damage has, of course, been fully assessed yet, but the total cost may reach billions of escudos. This will require the mobilisation of Community special assistance grants in order to deal with the economic and social problems caused by this devastation.
Therefore, in addition to sending our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expressing our sympathy for the people who have lost their homes and their possessions, in which, I am sure, all Members of this Parliament join, we ask you, Madam President to make representations to the Commission, urging it to provide, in conjunction with the Portuguese Government and the local authorities, emergency aid for the most badly affected communities so that economic activity may be restored.
I would also ask the Conference of Presidents to include this matter in the topical and urgent debate in Parliament' s next part-session.
Madam President, as a Basque MEP, I would like to express my rejection and condemnation of the terrorism and violence of ETA.
I would also like to express my condolences to the family of RamÃ³n GarcÃ­a and to all the families of victims of terrorism and violence.
On behalf of the Basque Nationalist Party, I would also like to say that our overwhelming priority is the ethical principles of human rights and, above all, the right to life.
You have presented us with the anti-terrorist agreement drafted by Spain' s Popular Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party.
I must tell you that this agreement does not offer anything new and that it contains only repressive measures, police measures and impositions.
It does not offer any valid proposal to resolve the political conflict in the Basque Country.
It is now ten years since the Basque parliament approved the right to self-determination but, nevertheless, the Spanish Government has deliberately ignored this free democratic decision adopted in the Basque Country.
In the Basque Country we need less fascism from ETA and less centralism and imposition from the state; we need more dialogue, more democracy and more respect for the democratic decisions of the Basque parliament.
Madam President, two days ago, after the announcement concerning the pardons for 14 torturers and the medal awarded to the former head of the political police of San Sebastian, Amnesty International concluded and I quote: "The award of pardons and honours for torturers sends out a clear message. The violation of human rights will not be effectively punished in Spain."
This is not the first time that pardons or honours for torturers have been granted or awarded by the Spanish authorities.
In its June 1999 report, Amnesty International stated its belief that there is a climate of impunity in Spain.
Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam . . .
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, referring to this document that he mentioned, Mr Ortuondo talks to us about centralism.
I do not know if he is referring to the centralism of Spain in relation to the Basque Country.
I am sure he is not, because, as he knows, the Basque region has the highest degree of self-government of any European region.
However, I would like to ask him whether that document also talks about the statements by the leader of his party when he said to ETA: "Do not kill the cooks, kill the powers that be" .
By "the powers that be" he is referring to the Popular Party. I am sure, Mr Ortuondo, that in this respect "the powers that be" means the Popular Party, and the Socialist Party, and that the whole of this Parliament embodies that power.
The whole of this Parliament is therefore in a position to consider itself a victim of ETA.
Madam President, Parliament knows, because we have said it many times and today we have explained it to some of you, that in presenting and defending an agreement in favour of freedoms and against terrorism in the Basque Country, we are defending and presenting an agreement which goes beyond the merely political field, since it is an agreement in defence of freedoms, in defence of life, in defence of pluralism.
There may be people who do not support this agreement; there may be people who criticise it; there has even been one organisation - the terrorist organisation ETA, of course - which has threatened to kill the signatories, and those people who might sign it later, for defending it.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, despite all of this, we will always continue to defend freedoms.
We will always continue to defend the right of any citizen of the Basque Country, whether they are in favour of autonomy or of independence, to be able to move around our country without escorts.
I want no more and no less than Mr Gorostiaga does: I want to move around my country with my children, like they do, without having to take escorts.
Madam President, I wish to speak briefly, following the latest speeches by the representatives of the Basque Nationalist Party and Euskal Herritarrok, to express my solidarity and agreement with the statement you have made, Madam President, on behalf of the European Parliament, in defence of democracy and peace in Spain.
Our main problem in Spain is terrorism, and fascist positions such as those of Euskal Herritarrok are a threat to peace in Spain and in Europe.
The fact that there are internal problems in Spain resulting from the political differences between the central government and the Basque parliament does not prevent us here in the European Parliament from standing for peace and democracy and against fascism.
Economic and social cohesion
The next item is the Commission communication on economic and social cohesion.
I give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before coming to the main subject of my address on behalf of the Commission this morning, I should, with your permission, like to raise one point very briefly.
Madam President, I should like to respond to the concerns expressed earlier by Mrs Figueiredo, and by the Secretary of State, Mrs Torres Marques and the Minister, Mr Cunha, following the very serious natural disasters which have stricken the northern region of Portugal.
As I am the Commissioner responsible for dealing with these issues, I wish to inform them that we shall take advantage of every possibility of reallocating appropriations, just as we have done in other circumstances in the event of natural disasters elsewhere in Europe, in order to stand by the Portuguese authorities in meeting the exceptional costs of reconstruction, repairs or indeed preventative measures necessitated by these disasters.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, the greater part of the discussion in the European Commission was taken up with approving the report, the Second Report on Economic and Social Cohesion in the Union, which it was my honour to present, with the agreement of my fellow Commissioners, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Fischler.
I presented this report pursuant to Article 159 of the Treaty, with which you are familiar, just as Monica Wulf-Mathies did in 1996. It was as a result of this 1996 report that the first information became available, which was used in drawing up Agenda 2000.
A detailed summary of the report is available in three languages at the entrance to the Chamber. The first part of the report which I am presenting gives, for the first time, a snapshot of the European Union in terms of cohesion for the 27 countries of the Union post-enlargement.
The second part of the report analyses the impact of other Community policies on the Union' s objectives.
It assesses the results achieved by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds.
Finally, in the synthesis section, the report outlines a number of potential avenues or recommendations for the future. Let me repeat, we have already made a summary available to each of you.
The complete report, ladies and gentlemen, will be available as of this evening on the Internet, along with all the appended maps and statistics pertaining thereto.
There are two points I would like to make in my opening remarks, before listening to your views. What are the issues at stake in cohesion within the enlarged Union and how can we address these issues?
The first issue I shall raise is that of a global environment undergoing rapid and far-reaching change, which affects each of our countries and hence also the European Union as a whole: the issue of globalisation and the context of new activities based on intelligence and knowledge, the new economy, the information society, and the issue of demographic structure.
This is compounded by the ever greater expectation on the part of our fellow citizens, as you are well aware, for our policies to be clearer, to involve the citizens themselves, and for increased partnership.
The second issue is enlargement.
We face the prospect of a European Union with 27 or perhaps even 28 members, and what becomes clear from reading this report carefully is that this enlarged Union will contain greater disparities, greater inequalities, to an extent unprecedented in previous rounds of enlargement.
There are three key figures you should bear in mind in this respect: with the forthcoming enlargement, the population of the European Union will increase by 30%, and the surface area of the Union will increase by 30%, yet the Union' s gross domestic product will increase by only 5%.
That is why in this report we identified a third group of countries, which will include the eight poorest candidate countries, which will comprise 16% of the population of the enlarged Union, where the per capita income is approximately only 40% of the Community average.
This is where the main challenge and the real change lie.
Consequently, with enlargement, the centre of gravity of cohesion policy is going to shift eastwards.
Of the 105 million inhabitants of the candidate countries, 98 million will be living in regions where the level of GDP per inhabitant is less than 75% of the average in the enlarged Union.
Yet, ladies and gentlemen, the entry of extremely poor Eastern European countries into the European Union is not going to turn the existing poor regions in southern, northern and central Europe - I am thinking of the remote and outermost regions too - all of a sudden into prosperous and rich regions, as if by magic.
The regions currently covered by Objective 1 are still in difficulty, even if there has been some progress.
There has been progress.
Per capita income in these regions has moved closer to the Community average.
It has increased from 63% in 1988 to 69% in 1997.
Partly with the help of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds, the countries covered by cohesion policy have experienced economic growth at a rate higher than the Community average.
Yet, within an increasing number of Member States, the tendency is not towards the elimination of disparities.
Disparities continue to exist and are even being exacerbated.
Unemployment stands at more than 20% in some regions, regions which have for a considerable length of time been left out in terms of progress due to their remote nature and depopulation, and the employment rate for women is 19 percentage points below that of men.
These are the observations you can read in the report, in which we describe the territorial inequalities, the pockets of poverty, sometimes extreme poverty, in some urban districts and some rural areas.
How can we address these issues?
Ladies and gentlemen, in our view, cohesion policy must continue to be the key element in the European Union' s societal model.
We are part of a European Union which wishes to formalise its structures of solidarity.
This means we have to ask three questions of cohesion policy: why, for whom and how?
Why?
I sometimes hear it said that it is not possible to do everything from Brussels and that more subsidiarity is needed.
I am all in favour of greater subsidiarity, but I am not and I shall never be in favour of allowing cohesion policy to become nothing more than the transfer of funding. It is not enough just to send cheques.
We cannot accept any form of renationalisation of cohesion policy for we still have shared priorities, genuine Community priorities and it is in our shared interest to ensure the sustainable and balanced development of a frame of reference for cohesion policy.
The debate is only just beginning.
I do not have any decisions to offer you, just some thoughts, perhaps.
One of these thoughts is based on the experience gained over more than ten years of cohesion policy, and leads me to think that there are matters that are more crucial and more serious than others for the development of our territories.
As I have mentioned already, there is the urban issue, networking, or even the specific issues affecting areas that are handicapped in geographical terms; by remoteness, mountainous topography or other natural handicaps.
Human resources, too, must be taken into account, since that affects employment.
Our report specifically lays down some guidelines to achieving more high quality jobs, improved social integration and equal opportunities.
Finally, taking this debate into consideration, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission could be ready, when the time comes, to propose a more strategic and coherent approach to EU territorial development to the other community institutions, so that our continued objective of economic and social cohesion would be strengthened by an increased territorial dimension and territorial support.
For whom do we implement cohesion policy?
I am convinced of two points in this respect, and these convictions are shared by the Commission as a whole.
The first is that we must continue to prioritise support for the regions lagging the furthest behind in development terms, for future Member States but also for current EU Member States.
The whole problem of priority support for the most underdeveloped regions, of course, raises the question of the level at which we shall have to set the eligibility threshold for regions which are developing too slowly.
My second conviction is that the regions lagging behind in development are not the only ones facing problems to which we must find solutions. Other regions within the enlarged Union are affected too.
If we are to have Community priorities then we must contemplate measures that can be implemented throughout the territory of the European Union for often, within a single state, there are regions that are richer than others and sometimes even within a single region there are areas of exclusion right next to highly dynamic areas - as is shown in the urban audit which I issued a few months ago.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is increasingly possible to delegate implementation to the Member States, applying the principle of subsidiarity better than in the past, on condition that we are sure that Community priorities are being respected and that European funding continues to go to those that have the greatest need.
How are we to carry out this cohesion policy?
This can be summed up in two phrases, improved efficiency and improved management. I have presented my explanations to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and I shall present my explanations to the Committee on Budgetary Control - but it must be a credible policy with ambition, as I have just mentioned, and with sufficient funding.
We did not, at this stage, wish to carry out assessments or budget estimates.
It would be too early; we would be putting the cart before the horse.
Let us first discuss objectives, content and European priorities.
Only afterwards will we have to find the resources to support these priorities.
My only observation, one which I wish to bring to the attention of the House, is that among the various issues decided in Berlin in 1999, one specific decision was that in 2006, at the end of this programming period, by adding up the amounts allocated to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds and the pre-accession appropriations, particularly ISPA, and the appropriations set aside to cover the costs of the first accessions prior to 2006, we obtain a total allocation, combining all these, equivalent to 0.45% of Community GDP.
I see that figure as a reference point.
It will be a key figure in the discussion of financial matters that we shall have with you and the Member States when the time comes.
Ladies and gentlemen, whatever the level of expenditure in relation to the increase in disparities, I think it safe to say that any cohesion policy will be credible only insofar as it is supported by adequate funding.
Whatever the level of structural expenditure, the key thing is that the content of other Community policies should also promote cohesion, as the Treaty recommends.
In terms of coordination with other Community policies, there is still progress to be made, particularly in order to improve synergy.
I am thinking here of the common agricultural policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. Before answering your questions, I would like to stress that this report does not offer any firm or definitive guidelines.
It does not put forward any decisions, it merely opens the debate.
It is a tool for information and assessment, a snapshot of the European Union which includes 27 Member States for the first time, and at the end we ask a few questions and make a few recommendations.
We shall be much more precise in the third report in 2004, which will be issued very shortly before the time when decisions are taken on the new agenda.
I merely consider that this debate on cohesion policy and this report testify to the fact that cohesion policy has been effective and useful, in accordance with the goals of the Treaty.
Increased European unity, increased solidarity between the peoples of Europe and respect for the diversity of the territories of Europe: this continues to be our objective.
This debate on cohesion forms part of the broader debate on the future of the European Union which was initiated in Nice and in which we are going to take part.
You may count on us in the next three years leading up to the new intergovernmental conference in 2004 in the matter of this broader debate and of the specific debate on our concept of the European Union, the concept of the level of solidarity between nations and territories.
Thank you, and may I assure you of the European Commission' s respect for the valued role that Parliament will play in these discussions.
Commissioner, as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I have to say that the report on cohesion is indeed an excellent basis for discussion and I trust that we shall be holding this discussion in the Committee on Regional Policy very soon and that it will be a very global discussion.
Now, as a Member of the European Parliament, I have to say that it is clear from the report on cohesion that there has been a relative improvement in our efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union and that, as you rightly said, we have had more success with the economic indicators than we have with the social indicators.
Some countries, such as Ireland, have taken greater advantage of the opportunities given to them than have other countries.
So the message which we should send out from the House today is that we need more efficient administration on all sides, especially on the part of the Member States and regions and, of course, we need incentives, such as the performance reserve, so that we can use European taxpayers' money more efficiently.
Obviously, I agree that we need to start focusing on the poorest regions and countries of the European Union right now and again after 2006.
But we must not forget one very important point: today's poorer countries are not going to get richer purely and simply because enlargement will artificially reduce the average per capita GDP in the European Union.
That is something we must bear in mind if we are to avoid straying into misguided policies.
I therefore think that we need to concentrate resources, we need to make better use of resources, we need to call for better administration both on the part of the Commission and of the Member States and regions; however, that must not cause us to forget one basic fact: that more people will want a slice of the cake after enlargement and as far as I am concerned, Commissioner, it is vital that we increase the size of the cake, that we increase the resources of the Structural Funds after 2006.
I should like to hear your views on this.
Mr Hatzidakis, I go along with your analysis, of course.
I formed my own assessment in the same spirit and on the same bases as yourself.
I should point out to the House that if the twelve candidate countries were to actually join the European Union right now, then the mean GDP for the Community would drop by 18 points.
This would automatically have the mathematical effect of raising regions which continue to be in difficulties above the mean in one fell swoop.
It would not, therefore, be fair.
We are going to have to find some solution for these regions which would thereby be placed automatically above the Community mean.
Mr Hatzidakis, you tell me more money will be needed.
At this stage, I can express only a personal opinion.
We have not yet reached the point of discussing the future Financial Perspective.
I have only given you a rough indication, and a personal opinion at that.
I think that the figure of 0.45 % of Community GDP, which will be achieved in 2006 in line with the Berlin decisions, if we add together the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Funds, pre-accession appropriations, SAPARD, PHARE, ISPA, as well as the appropriations placed in reserve to support the first accessions in 2004, for example, will give a total representing 0.45% of GDP.
I see this as a reference point.
To elaborate further, my frank opinion is that if we take on board another twelve countries in the state they are at present, then we shall not be able to conduct any credible policy at anything less than this percentage.
That is all I can say for the present.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the open manner in which he chose to present his report in plenary.
It is the beginning of a debate - an honest debate - that we want to be involved in as parliamentarians.
The Commissioner and Mr Hatzidakis said that regional disparities will become twice as great.
The challenge to achieve cohesion will be greater: we have an unprecedented expansion of the Union and we still have poor regions.
There is a multi-million euro question which is, to use the words of a former French Commission President: "Have we got the means to match our ambitions?"
That is not to say that the means have to be financial, but we must also look at other policies.
It is clear that there will be a cap on budgetary contributions.
Therefore I ask you, Commissioner Barnier and your colleagues, to look at the opportunities offered by other policies, in particular the real and tangible benefits of involving the private sector in regenerating our regions.
Can you be sure, Commissioner, that an enlightened view will be taken, in particular by Mr Monti, the Commissioner responsible for competition, to ensure that we have private sector innovative approaches to reducing regional disparities across the Union?
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy, for your assessment.
I can indeed confirm the attitude of the Commission, which I, in particular, share, and our determination to take part, not just here but also in the national parliaments, and in and with the regions, in as decentralised a way as possible, in a major debate. My whole team in the Directorate-General is going to participate in presenting the results of the assessment of this snapshot and open the debate over the next two years, in an extremely transparent and open manner.
The current annual allocation is approximately EUR thirty billion.
Once again, I have told Mr Hatzidakis what I though of the lower limit beyond which we should not go if we wish this policy to have any credibility.
I also think, like you, Mrs McCarthy, that this European policy must act as a lever, bringing other funding and other synergies to bear.
That is why I attach great importance to partnership, the modernisation of private funds, and the intervention of the European Investment Bank as our partner.
I quite understand, moreover, your concern for greater coherence with the competition policy for which Commissioner Monti is responsible.
We have to find a way forward which reconciles complying with the Treaties, especially in terms of the rules of competition, and regional policy.
Quite simply, Mrs McCarthy, let me share my personal conviction that we shall not achieve solidarity and cohesion in Europe simply by counting on the laws of the market, on supply and demand or on a simple tax transfer policy.
I do not believe that liberalism alone can help the poorest regions cease to be the poorest or that it can help reduce the gap between them and the richest regions.
That is why I shall fight to ensure that we continue to have public intervention in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank you warmly for your excellent report.
I am sure it will provoke solid, but also controversial discussion, and so I would just like to take this opportunity to stimulate debate a little with a two-fold question.
The current system will actually remain in force until the year 2006.
Given that we are negotiating with the candidate countries with the aim of their acceding in 2004/2005, how then, can we make it clear to them that, even if they join under the current conditions, they cannot rely on our being able to continue the system, in other words, how are we going to make them understand that irrespective of what they sign up to now, they are going to have to adapt to an amended cohesion policy?
Secondly, perhaps you could allay a little the fears which prevail across a good many regions by explaining to us how is it going to be possible for the regions which may receive less support after 2007, regardless of the ceiling we apply, not to lose support and solidarity at a moment' s notice?
How can we make it possible for them - as has, in fact, been done hitherto using the phasing out method - to achieve the upturn gradually, without their being dropped from the system straightaway?
You may be able to assuage quite a number of fears with your answer.
Thank you for asking this question, Mr Jarzembowski. It is probably the main question to be debated in terms of finance.
Let me specify, nonetheless, that the Berlin Financial Perspective made provision to set aside some EUR 39.5 billion for the candidate countries likely to join before 2006, to enable them to be integrated into the current cohesion policy. After 2006, however, they will of course be entitled, like the current Member States, to participate in a policy which will probably be rather different.
My report outlined four possible approaches to cater for the regions which would automatically find themselves above the cut-off threshold as soon as we incorporate a number of very poor countries into the Union, and all I can do at this stage is outline these options.
The first option is to continue to apply the strict threshold of 75% of Community GDP which is the current threshold below which regions are eligible for Objective 1 status, and therefore a greater concentration of appropriations.
The second option is to link this 75% threshold with a phasing-out policy over a set period, supported by a substantial amount of money, in order to facilitate the transition for regions which, post-enlargement, would suddenly find themselves above that threshold.
A third option is to raise the threshold above 75 % to make more regions eligible.
In that case, we should probably have to tackle the issue of finance.
The fourth option is to have two thresholds, one for regions currently within the Union and one for the regions of countries joining the Union.
I am not in a position, nor do I have any wish, to decide the matter right now.
I am here to listen to your views.
I shall be listening to the views of the Member States, and the members of parliament and elected representatives of these regions.
In the end, though, we shall have to opt for one of these four alternatives.
Mr President, Commissioner, you said that in the future, the main focus of cohesion will lie in the East and that a cohesion policy of this kind will only be possible if there are sufficient means available.
Would you agree that we also need to allow sufficient time for this, because we know from experience that it takes time to develop regions?
How can we rely on the Commission having the commitment to allow both time and money, in order to pre-empt the effects of the cohesion policy?
EUR 4 billion are available in Category VIII for the year 2002.
Would it not make sense to deploy this with a view to achieving cohesion in the East, even before enlargement takes place?
Where do you stand on this?
Mrs Schroedter, we do need time.
In the report I even mentioned the fact that for the countries which are currently in the greatest difficulty within the European Union, the regions lagging furthest behind in development, it would take another generation to reduce this gap.
I pointed out that it would take roughly, and I can only make a rough prediction, two generations for the countries scheduled to join us in approximately 2004-2005.
I concur with your view that we shall be able to make a greater success of enlargement and the actual accession of these countries if we make the best possible preparations at this stage.
That is why, alongside my fellow Commissioners, Mr Verheugen and Mr Fischler, who are responsible, respectively, for the PHARE programme and the SAPARD programme, whilst I myself am responsible for the ISPA programme for the environment and transport, I am committed to ensuring that this money is used properly, and that part of the technical assistance associated with these funds is used to set up territorial frameworks.
This is the real weakness of the candidate countries whose regional divisions have not existed for very long.
The Voivodships in Poland have only been in existence for two years.
We must therefore support the territorial frameworks by means of these Structural Funds. Indeed, I never miss an opportunity to urge local communities within the current Union to set up twinning partnerships and decentralised cooperation agreements with candidate country regions in order to establish more ongoing cooperation on the human level within each territorial community.
We attach great importance, therefore, to using these pre-accession funds as usefully as possible.
I cannot, however, make any commitments, Mrs Schroedter, as to what we shall do with the money placed in reserve after 2002 - I mentioned approximately EUR 40 billion - if these countries do not join in 2002. For the time being the funds have been set aside to cater for those accessions that do actually take place.
In response to your question, however, I should like to point out that we have pre-accession instruments and that these are what we should be using, when the time comes, to carry accession through successfully.
Commissioner, I agree that there can be no union without economic and social cohesion, and that there can be no cohesion without means.
I also agree that the Structural Funds used have been effective and positive.
My specific question is therefore: is enlargement possible without an additional effort on the part of the European Union - from the moment of the first accessions - above and beyond this budgetary reserve?
Secondly, Commissioner, I must say that there is disquiet in certain European regions and some of your replies do not provide any comfort, although it is true that we are in a context of a very rapid dialogue.
However, for this very reason I believe it is necessary to specify something else.
You say that we have to find a solution for those regions which are currently receiving funds, especially the Objective 1 regions.
I would like you to be more specific, Commissioner.
What is going to happen, according to your criteria, to Castilla-La Mancha, Estremadura, Andalusia, Galicia, regions of Portugal and Greece, and 'LÃ€nder' which have just entered Objective 1?
Let us be specific, because disquiet in those regions will only be prevented by clarity.
Mr Izquierdo Collado, I do not have all the answers at this stage, and if I did, you would be justified in criticising me.
We are only launching the debate.
The budgets have been determined; the regulations have been defined.
All these EU regions have received guarantees until 2006.
I have endeavoured to tell the truth, because we cannot make speeches on enlargement and the enlarged European Union, integrating the closely related peoples of Eastern Europe, without looking at the figures as they stand.
This is a truthful report.
Yet I did not want to wait until 2005 before telling the truth and asking the questions which have to be asked of the Commission proposals, when the time comes, by the Heads of State and Government and by Parliament.
So there is a problem, but there is no need to panic.
I should also like to say, in answer to your specific question with regard to specific regions, Extremadura, southern Italy or the LÃ€nder of eastern Germany, that it will depend on the level of income achieved by around 2005-2006.
What I do know, however, is that if we retain the criterion of per capita income - which I hope we do, since it is an objective criterion - then the average Community GDP is going to drop as a result of enlargement.
The rate is going to drop to a greater or lesser extent, Mr Izquierdo Collado, according to whether the twelve candidate countries join at the same time or not.
Once again, then, there is no need to panic.
The drop will perhaps not be as much as the 18 points I mentioned earlier.
The fact remains, however, that some regions currently covered by Objective 1, which are currently enjoying a good level of development even though this is still below average, are liable to find that they are above average following enlargement.
We are going to have to find a solution to this.
As I have said myself, these regions are not suddenly going to become rich just because Eastern European countries are joining the European Union.
We are going to have to find a substantial solution for these regions and continue to support them, and I have outlined a few possible approaches.
One of these, for example, would be to have a total budget allowance, similar to the system we set up for Ireland and other regions, to cover phasing out and a transitional period, particularly for those regions which were closest to the average.
Even then, even with the new average, there will still most probably be, even looking at the maps provided in the report, which I urge you to examine carefully, extremely poor regions such as still exist in Spain, Portugal and Greece, and even in Italy, within the European Union of today.
A solution, a largely financial solution, will have to be found for the band of intermediate regions, and what I am seeking to do is to ask the questions to obtain the help I need in order to find appropriate solutions when the time comes.
Mr President, this debate is our opportunity for a proper discussion on the issues facing us.
My question is quite simple.
It is clear that enlargement will not just mean problems for the struggling regions which we are attempting to embrace in the Union. At the same time, if in this case the single market works, other regions will also reap the benefit.
Now, in all honesty, I am a little concerned about this reasoning on averages, for it may be that the problem of income distribution will highlight regions which we could induce - although I do not know how - to contribute a little more to the overall financing of the system in view of the enlargement process.
I therefore feel that it could well be appropriate to set rather more refined benchmarks for the cohesion policy and I continue to call for the implementation of the project to enlarge Europe to provide us with less rigid objectives and establish a more flexible scale, rather than necessarily tying us to this idea of a totally automatic process, which sends the regions flying from category to category.
Mr Costa, as I said earlier quite forcefully - you will forgive me repeating it - I wanted to initiate this debate immediately, early enough to discuss the essential issues and our vision of Europe, which is not just a supermarket but a community.
I want us to discuss solidarity and to reach agreement on our political objectives.
Thereafter, once we have agreed on the objectives and priorities and the line of approach, we must give ourselves the resources to carry them forward.
So, discussing the money involved at this stage would be a poor way of opening the discussion.
I know perfectly well that we shall have to discuss finance when the time comes.
That is my first point.
My second point is solidarity.
We must continue to promote solidarity between States.
You are well aware that there are States that are net contributors and others that are not.
I therefore feel that this form of redistribution is quite fair and quite efficient.
Thirdly, I must thank you for stating in your initial speech that enlargement entails problems and risks but also provides opportunities. This is also my view.
If you look at developments over the last twenty years, with Spain, Portugal and Greece, my own personal conviction - and I never miss the opportunity to say so in the public debates I take part in - is that in the medium and long term, any enlargement process ultimately contains more opportunities than risks and problems.
Quite apart from morality and politics, it is just not in our interests to allow people living on our doorstep to continue to live in poverty.
Poverty, of the kind we have right next door to us, as in the countries of Eastern Europe or Albania or the Balkan states, always leads to the same outcome.
When people do not have enough to eat, they emigrate.
People living in poverty are prey to all sorts of nationalist conflicts, war, trafficking, and mafia exploitation.
It is therefore in our own interest, quite apart from moral or political concerns, to undertake this enlargement and to pay the price for sharing progress.
I must also thank you for giving me this opportunity to say that this debate must also prove that in the great challenge of enlargement there are more opportunities than risks.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have not yet had the opportunity to read the report, but the first report on cohesion clearly showed that the common agricultural policy was not contributing to cohesion in the European Union.
The Agenda 2000 reform was limited to maintaining the status quo in the CAP.
I now wish to ask the Commissioner whether he can tell us anything about the report' s conclusions on the CAP.
Mr President, what I have to say to the Commissioner is far simpler.
Very quickly, then, I would like to suggest that other criteria are used for the allocation of funds than just the rate of GDP and of unemployment.
Surely other factors such as population concentration and distribution, potential or lack of potential in terms of new technologies and research, and geographical accessibility should be taken into account?
And finally, my last question: surely the current situation forces us to contemplate redefining the Financial Perspective before 2006?
Commissioner, at the beginning of your speech you indicated that the challenges facing us are globalisation and enlargement.
Together with other MEPs, I have just attended the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, where it was clearly shown that with the problem of globalisation we are entering a new era, in which the European Union must play a fundamental role in the world.
This problem of world social balance must form part of our economic policy and, since you referred to it, I would like to ask you what the European Union is going to do in this respect, because this is clearly going to have an influence on our internal economic problems and also on our budgetary problems.
Secondly, Commissioner, I would like to ask you: to what extent do you consider it fair that States, such as Spain, which still receive cohesion funds, are considering zero deficit as an economic policy, at the risk of...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, thank you very much Commissioner, you mentioned that we will also require new rules for enlargement, and probably more money too.
I would like to ask a couple of questions on the subject of new rules and, as such, on the subject of new ideas.
Would it really be feasible, indeed would it also be wise in the future, to largely target the support at one particular area, time and time again?
Would it not make more sense to place more emphasis than we have done hitherto on particular project ideas, or else on particularly needy areas?
This would also allow us to spend the money in a more targeted way.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to be able to say that I am glad to hear this.
I have not yet had the opportunity to read the report, but I liked what you had to say about it.
I would like to ask you whether the Commission is prepared to fight to see the Community budget increase from the current 1.04%, to 1.27%, as has been approved?
I ask this because if we have the budget that has been approved, then we will have money.
My second question is: what will happen to the outermost regions?
You have not said anything about these regions and they are of concern to me.
Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for using the word solidarity in connection with this report.
This is, of course, precisely what cohesion policy and regional policy are about.
I also want just briefly to ask whether the future debate will also cover all other policy areas in the European Union which are important for regional growth - education, research and social policy - so that it is possible to make use of everyone' s ability to get involved and contribute to regional growth.
Mr President, I am the one who should apologise for having gone on too long, most of all to those Members of Parliament who were unable to ask their questions.
I shall, however, remain at your service, as you know, in the weeks and months to come in order to continue this discussion.
Mr Cunha, if you read the report, you will see that we actually say that the CAP, whose objectives are production, export capacity and sufficiency, has not actually become involved in the way we might have hoped in this territorial cohesion policy, particularly because, in the regions likely to benefit from cohesion policy, farm sizes are that much more modest.
I have, therefore, myself, stressed the fact that we should, as I said earlier, improve synergy through the common agricultural policy.
One of the means to do so would perhaps be, in future, to boost the emphasis on the rural development arm of the CAP, which was started in Berlin.
Mrs Darras, I do not believe that we shall need to renegotiate the Financial Perspective in the matter of cohesion policy.
The plans made in Berlin seem to me perfectly adequate.
In anticipation, we even made provision for 2002, and now it is quite clear that no new countries will join in either 2002 or 2003. Sufficient sums were set aside to cope with these accessions, and so I do not think we shall need a new Financial Perspective.
You mention changing the criteria, if necessary.
We might continue to discuss possibilities, Mrs Darras, but I should like to point out that we are not too far off the real situation when we work on the basis of the standard of living, of per capita GDP, because it can be observed that where there is the lowest standard of living there is also the highest rate of unemployment, the worst environmental conditions, and the lowest levels of Internet access.
Thus, in some way, taking a snapshot of the per capita standard of living, we have produced an accurate snapshot of the real state of the regions - and indeed it is no mere accident that my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, and all the other Members of Parliament who have given some thought to these questions all agreed on this criterion.
Now, you know we can combine this criterion with other aspects, especially unemployment, but I would like us to retain this criterion as I think it an objective one.
Mr Nogueira, I do not have sufficient time to take part in a debate on globalisation.
I even, as you identified earlier, mentioned the new context of cohesion policy associated with globalisation, which constitutes the risk which Jacques Delors and others clearly identified fifteen years ago, and which impelled them to propose this cohesion policy.
In the same single market, there is a risk that wealth, trade and people will continue to be concentrated in the same locations and that the poorest regions are impoverished and marginalised further.
That risk in the single market is exacerbated in a Europe living in an age of globalisation.
That is why I think we do indeed need a cohesion policy and support for cohesion in future.
Mr Rack, yes, I am willing to look into new methods with you, particularly as far as development of the new Objective 2 policy is concerned.
I wonder, for example, about the sense and usefulness of the Brussels-driven zoning for Objective 2, in which I am required to officially specify, in agreement with the Member States, whether every individual district, community or village is or is not to receive Objective 2 status.
I do not think that all this bureaucracy is particularly useful, and that is why Objective 2 policy, concerning regions other than the most underdeveloped, could be simpler and more decentralised, with instruments subordinated to Community policies or to regional development, the urban areas, mountainous regions, island regions, border regions or cross-sector objectives such as social cohesion and the fight against poverty.
I am perfectly willing to look into developing instruments which are decentralised in terms of their administration within the Member States and which do not convey the impression of excessive bureaucracy that the people of Europe sometimes have.
Mrs Torres Marques, I cannot go any further than I already have on the subject of the Financial Perspective.
I have not forgotten the outermost regions; I even mentioned them in my opening remarks.
There is a specific paragraph on these regions.
As Mr Prodi requested, I do a great deal of work for these seven outermost regions.
This is why, a few weeks ago, the Commission published an important report on adjustments or exceptions in the field of structural aid, and aid for agriculture and fisheries which, overall, have been well received by the authorities in these outermost regions and I think that, pursuant to Article 299 of the Treaty, we must continue to have a special policy for these outermost regions precisely because they are our outermost regions and, as such, our most remote active frontiers in the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic or near the American continent.
Mrs Hedkvist-Petersen, thank you for pointing out the importance of the term 'solidarity' . I also consider it important.
The title that we wanted to give this report, ladies and gentlemen, is "European Unity, solidarity between nations, regional diversity" , and, as you will see when you read it in detail, I was careful to stress - since this was a concern of mine - the need to coordinate Community policies with regional development and cohesion, particularly in terms of research or the social agenda while noting that Member States and national governments will, of course, retain their jurisdiction on social policy.
I am working within the scope of the Community' s current jurisdiction.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes this item.
Mediterranean region
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Mrs Muscardini (A5-0008/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the common strategy of the European Council of 19 June 2000 on the Mediterrannean region - European Council Declaration on the common strategy on the Mediterranean region [C5-0510/2000 - 2000/2247(COS)], and
the report by Mr NaÃ¯r (A5-0009/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: to prepare the fourth Meeting of Euro-Mediterannean Foreign Ministers: Reinvigorating the Barcelona Process [COM(2000) 497 - C5 -0630/2000 - 2000/2294(COS)]
Mr President, I would like to thank those Members who, through meetings, discussion and dialogue, have contributed to what we consider to be a step forward in Europe's strategy for the Mediterranean: the Mediterranean as a gateway not just to the Middle East but also to the Atlantic, a cultural as well as economic area, consolidating the South-South dialogue but also the North-South and East-South dialogues at a time when impending enlargement calls us all to assume specific responsibilities.
Development must respect human dignity and the protection of the environment and health.
Economic development must not disregard human rights or mutual respect for differences.
We all realise that Europe needs a new philosophy, namely that in order to be effective, common strategies must be realistic and practicable. Therefore, we must set ourselves clear, achievable targets so that, step by step, progress can be made towards development, security and stability.
On the one hand, a poet would say: "Woe betide the man who does not dare to dream great dreams!" but a statistician would reply: "Woe betide the politician who gets carried away on empty dreams and does not see or resolve the problems which are staring him in the face!"
We have attempted to make our hopes practical and realisable in the short and medium terms.
In other words, we have put forward proposals which will give all the countries of the Mediterranean the same dignity and the same opportunity for development in a new multi-faceted relationship with an increasingly large and more complex Europe, a relationship that will have to fight for its international credibility in the tough competition with the whole of the rest of the industrialised world.
Protecting the environment and health, dignity for workers, safeguarding the quality of products in order to protect the consumer and safeguarding a free - as long as it is fair - market, attentiveness to the specific cultural differences and traditions including architectural styles of each country and registered designation of origin products, a ban to prevent us Europeans from outrageously abusing the partnership relationships and exporting products to our partner countries which we have banned in Europe because they are dangerous, the boost for the development of all the capabilities of our Mediterranean partners, including assistance for placing the thousands and thousands of young people who have studied or trained in Europe in employment, child protection, the fight against the exploitation of minors and modern-day slavery, attentiveness to the situation of working women and, in any case, to the dignity of all human beings are significant steps forward, just as Europe's commitment and endeavours to do all in its power to bring about peace and mutual respect in the Middle East must be substantial and given priority status.
It cannot be denied that, although the successive Summits were a milestone in that they pinpointed a large number of problems, they did not do anything to resolve them.
Indeed, I regret to say that the governments have not implemented the proposals adopted at Barcelona: democracy, the rule of law, transparency, social rights and an internal policy to prevent communities being forced to leave their countries.
A new policy of trilateral trade, safeguarding typical productions, including European productions, condemning and preventing counterfeiting and fraud, food and environmental safety, the development of craft products and the establishment of programmes to fight desertification and facilitate the conversion of non-drinking water into drinking water and the development of tourism are some of the many points which we have discussed.
At this point, I would like to thank the officials of the committee and of the political groups for their work, which was particularly demanding because of the need to meet the earlier deadlines.
The time is now ripe to tackle practicable projects, and practicable projects are those which do not originate from specific preconceptions or concealed motives but from a policy's ability to marry the needs of the citizens with economic and social concerns.
This is why Europe as a whole, not just Mediterranean Europe, to which, as an Italian, I have the honour to belong, must now recognise its strategy on the East and on the South and its commitment to these regions as absolutely essential, and confirm that if healthy, lasting progress is to be achieved, the requirements of the economy must go hand in hand with human dignity.
This text was not written in order to be published as a mere declaration of intent: it was written to be implemented, and for this we place our confidence and our trust in the Commission and the Council, so that their cooperation with the European Parliament becomes practicable and updateable.
Mr President, last November, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy appointed me as rapporteur on the Commission communication entitled 'Reinvigorating the Barcelona Process' .
This Commission communication serves a dual purpose: to assess the achievements of the Barcelona Process and to put forward recommendations in preparation for the ministerial conference to be held in Marseilles in November 2000.
Before proceeding to discuss the actual substance of the issue, let me first thank my fellow members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with whom I had many discussions that were extremely helpful for the final draft of my report.
I should also like to say that I framed this report taking into consideration what has already been achieved in Parliament, and Parliament' s regard for the Mediterranean question, and at this point I would like to pay special tribute to the work carried out by Mr Yannis Sakellariou.
In its text, the Commission once again sets out the three main goals of EU-Mediterranean policy, namely: the creation of an area of peace and stability, the creation of an area of shared prosperity through the progressive establishment of free trade and, finally, the improvement of mutual understanding amongst the peoples of the region and the development of an active civil society.
Mr President, of these three goals, only the establishment of a free-trade area can be deemed to have actually got off the ground.
So I was pleased to hear Commissioner Barnier comment in this vein earlier, since in the midst of profound inequalities, liberalisation alone cannot bring about economic development nor the integration of deeply divided societies.
This is, furthermore, a free-trade area on European terms, as may be illustrated by a single statistic: total transfers from the EU budget to the Mediterranean countries amount to EUR 1 billion per year, whilst those resulting from the Mediterranean countries' trade deficit with the EU amount to EUR 34 million per year.
In other words, the Union' s financial contribution to the Mediterranean countries represents less than one-thirtieth of the advantages which Europe derives from the free-trade area.
As regards the creation of an area of peace and stability, the European Union does not carry much political clout, despite the fact that in the countries of the South there is a genuine demand for Europe.
There are many areas of conflict, which are liable to jeopardise the entire Barcelona Process.
As to the development of an active civil society, it may be said that the people who actually benefit from the MEDA programmes are mainly those who had previous contact with Europe or who have close links with governments.
Civil society has demonstrated a clear lack of interest.
Finally, the programmes for decentralised cooperation, which are supposed to enable representatives of civil society from both sides of the Mediterranean to meet for the purpose of devising joint projects, have been frozen since 1995.
The degree of success is rather modest, then, and the degree of frustration rather high. Many saw the Marseilles conference as a partial failure.
In my view, the grand vision of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which was inaugurated in Barcelona in November 1995 has now given way to a negotiating process which lacks any genuine political will.
In my report, I attempt to present a number of proposals intended to overcome this situation.
I shall now introduce the six major areas to focus on.
Firstly, I think that the free-trade area must be set in the context of a proper strategic approach.
Together with our Mediterranean partners, we must lay the foundations of an associate common market, capable of interacting satisfactorily with Europe' s economy, taking local parameters of development in the South into consideration.
We should advocate converting the planned free-trade area into a genuine 'common market' encompassing goods of all kinds.
Secondly, migration must be placed at the very heart of development today.
There will be no real partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean until the organised movement of people is put on the agenda.
This is why I feel that, in coming years, migration is going to represent a crucial aspect of our relations with these countries.
We need joint management of migration flows, including measures to combat illegal immigration and the mafias which profit from it.
We also need to lay down policies on temporary migration, similar to what the International Labour Organisation is currently proposing, without entitlement to permanent residence.
I also feel that we should introduce a special travel visa for those involved in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
We should also harness immigration to assist development in countries of origin.
Immigrants contribute to the development of the country of origin.
I know that the European Union and the Commission are working hard to achieve this.
I would urge the Commission to go further by financing immigrants' micro-projects.
In this vein, I would also suggest setting up a monitoring centre on migration to study migration flows with a view to presenting proposals to the European Union.
We must also facilitate the enhanced association of the Euro-Mediterranean states that so wish.
Turning to a proposal from Commissioner Patten which I find extremely interesting, the Commissioner said that certain regional projects should be accessible to a variable number of directly interested Member States and Mediterranean partners on the basis of configurations which could vary from one project to another.
I support this approach as I believe it establishes genuine, and genuinely strong, relations between the countries to the north and south of the Mediterranean who wish to go further together.
My fourth point is that we also have to reform the management of the MEDA programme.
The Commission tends to be critical of our Mediterranean partners.
It must, however, be noted that, while it is true that some partner countries have experienced difficulties, particularly because of deficient infrastructures, the under-implementation of MEDA funds is primarily the result of the Commission' s inability to manage these funds and to rely on operators capable of implementing them properly.
The defence of human rights must also be made into something more than a mere statement of principle, for the goal is actually to assist the development of constitutional states in the countries of the southern Mediterranean, and not just to create economic systems which fit into the proposed structural adjustment programmes.
My sixth point is that considerable funding must be allocated.
The deadlock in the Middle East peace process is an obstacle to any sub-regional dynamic, be it economic, social and/or cultural.
I think the Commission should take this situation into account.
In conclusion, I shall say that the organised movement of people, codevelopment and decentralised cooperation are the main concerns behind the report I am presenting today. I think they should also be the main concerns of the Commission.
Mr President, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport on the Barcelona Process, I would like to communicate some of the concerns and suggestions which have been unanimously approved in committee.
Firstly, I wish to draw attention to the need to promote cultural programmes, which I know is not what attention is usually drawn to.
We know that the Euromed Heritage programme has been the most successful of all programmes for cooperation with the Mediterranean.
Furthermore, we believe that culture promotes wealth.
For example, where would Egypt be without its cultural tourism, which has been one of its main links with the world and one of its main sources of wealth?
Culture, therefore, is one of the factors which is most easily accessible, closest to hand, most developed and which has accumulated the most experience in the field of Mediterranean development, which means that it can be closely linked to communication between people and can continue to open doors.
At the same time we wish to draw attention to education.
We believe that if a Mediterranean trade area does not deal with the issue of education, it will become an area of Mediterranean colonisation.
Therefore, the only way that there can be a social scheme capable of being incorporated into the business world and the Western world is through education.
Furthermore, we believe that that is where a genuine and indigenous scheme also can be found for establishing the pillars for future development.
Furthermore, the only way in which we can spread our ideas about human rights is by creating a better trained and better educated population.
We are therefore not talking about clichÃ©s, but about reality.
Another point that also concerns us is the way in which the Commission adapts to the philosophy and circumstances of the countries towards which the aid is directed.
I believe that a large part of the failure of the MEDA programme is due to the fact that we are applying a European-scale mentality, which suits Commission projects.
What we need, however, is many small projects.
We need to look to the internal social structures of the countries involved, the universities, the educational institutions, the museums, the cultural field, and society itself, so that we can rely on it for future development.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has on several occasions made considerable contributions to the debate on the European Union' s Mediterranean policy and on reinvigorating the 1995 Barcelona Process.
We played a major part in the discussion on the MEDA activity report that I presented on 5 September 2000, which was adopted almost unanimously by Parliament, as was, moreover, the amendment of the MEDA Regulation (MEDA II).
We would have liked the meeting at Feira to refer to the MEDA programme, since it is the main instrument for implementing this policy and will be allocated a financial package of EUR 5.37 billion for the period 2000-2006, excluding funds from the European Investment Bank.
Furthermore, we hope that this budget will be increased, as European Union Mediterranean policy should not have to suffer because of the appropriations that have been legitimately allocated to the Balkans.
All the debates, regardless of the committee in which they are held, whether it be Foreign Affairs, Industry, Agriculture or Culture, or in Parliament, are unanimous in constantly reiterating the same recommendations. As far as we are concerned, we would like to stress, first of all, the need to define a Mediterranean strategy, in conjunction with third countries.
Secondly, the need to develop decentralised cooperation that aims to enable contracts with local authorities and civil society, particularly NGOs, for both cross-border regions and in the South-South context, as well as for regional integration. Thirdly, we should like to highlight the decision of Parliament and the Commission to carry out an annual assessment of the human rights situation in signatory countries.
My fourth point is to stress the urgent need to adopt the Charter for Security and Stability so that we can play a more active role, particularly in restoring peace in the Middle East. We consider it particularly important to encourage local measures and sustainable development, although this was omitted from the Feira Council conclusions, and to carry out progressive evaluation in this area, to implement major programmes on the environment and water, to reinvigorate the Start programme, and for third countries of the Mediterranean region to take part in the Sixth Research Framework Programme of research and technological development.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy gave its unanimous opinion on this range of questions.
Mr President, assuming a driving role in the European Union means implementing a series of guidelines which have thus far existed more on paper than as part of practical action.
We have already committed ourselves to developing a lasting partnership with North Africa, Asia Minor and the Balkan states, but we are pursuing this too slowly.
It is one of the duties of Europe, which has the task of being the driving force of a balanced system of trade, the market, development, growth and economic prosperity.
This is also necessary in order to stem the disturbing migration flows of this last decade, which are a clear indication of the lack of a bilateral cooperation policy.
It is precisely from these last two issues that we must start if we genuinely want to restore the Mediterranean area to its former glory and, above all, to resume our leading role with political dignity.
It is essential for Europe to be at the forefront in this geo-political scenario, using the association agreements as springboards towards the financial instruments granted by the EIB and, in particular, by the MEDA programme.
At the same time, the adoption of the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability, in which the two sides of the Mediterranean cooperate actively and the bases of which derive from the rights of individuals, of the family unit, of cultural diversity and of religious dialogue, cannot be put off any longer.
In fact, the issue of immigration, which is one of the greatest challenges, must be tackled in respect for cultural and historical differences and itself become a means of development.
It cannot be denied that the European labour requirements are constantly increasing, but, at the same time, we must put an end to illegal immigration and the numerous existing cases of illegal trafficking.
Failure to establish an effective, solid barrier blocking all that works against legality or the laws of democracy can only exacerbate division, annoyance and even violence once again, which would cancel out all the effort put in and undo any progress made in dialogue thus far.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency sees the EU' s Mediterranean cooperation as an important and pressing issue.
I therefore listened with great interest to Mrs Muscardini' s and Mr NaÃ¯r' s presentations of their reports.
It is gratifying to note that criticisms made in both reports relate to the Swedish Presidency' s main priorities.
In political terms, the presidency wishes to promote democracy and human rights, social and economic progress and progress on environmental matters and, in addition, equality and the struggle against various forms of discrimination.
In the economic and financial sphere, we want to work towards an economic and financial partnership which is both dynamic and has a human face.
The concept of prosperity includes both economic growth and social equilibrium.
To date, no conference of trade ministers has been held within the Barcelona Process, in spite of the fact that trade and the economy form one of the three pillars of Barcelona cooperation.
The presidency is therefore going to arrange a meeting involving the 27 countries' trade ministers.
The aim is to give a dynamic edge to the most important aspects of trade covered by the Barcelona Process and to agree upon the guidelines for continued work.
The need for regional integration is another important issue which should be discussed.
Other priority sectors include rules of origin, accumulation, harmonisation measures, norms and standards and intellectual property protection.
In this context, I also wish to point out that the presidency shares the view that agricultural products ought not to be excluded from the free-trade discussions.
It is also important to encourage and support trade and cooperation between the partner countries themselves.
This is a neglected area in which a great deal must and can be done.
More than five years have gone by since the Barcelona Process was embarked upon.
A lot has been achieved, but it has not been possible to implement many of the plans.
To some extent, the way matters stand in the peace process has restricted the potential for progress, but other factors too have had a part to play.
We are convinced that a good deal can and should be done to give more impetus to Mediterranean cooperation and to make everyone involved feel that they own more of the process.
I shall therefore be listening with great interest to today' s debate, which I am convinced will make a valuable contribution to strengthening the EU' s Mediterranean cooperation.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mrs Muscardini and Mr NaÃ¯r, who have produced sound, high-quality reports on the future of the Mediterranean policy.
I feel that a boost needs to be given to the political, cultural and economic aspects of the Mediterranean policy: because we must increasingly consolidate democracy and the parliamentary system, because we must expand the borders of the rule of law, because we need to realise the importance of protecting human rights, because we need cultural exchange promoting mutual awareness of societies, particularly where Islamic communities are concerned, because we need to create multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious and multicultural societies and therefore reassert the principle of respect for minority cultures as part and parcel of democracies and emphasise the importance of peace in the daily lives of the citizens of the southern side of the Mediterranean, thereby excluding from the cultural process all radical or fundamentalist behaviour and all hate, which leads to conflict, massacre and war.
Moreover, commercial interexchange is important for Europe, and it is also important to be able to provide and guarantee vocational training and adequate financial instruments, and also support and advice in respect of the currencies of these countries, for, apart from anything else, the free-trade area will then have to become a euro zone.
This is what we expect.
However, I feel that the European Union needs to do an about-turn for, in my opinion, the current line is to withdraw from the expected prospects and commitments.
The cutback in the MEDA programme, for reasons which I see as excuses, and delays in the partnership processes are alarming.
Declarations of principles have been followed not by action but by delays in action.
We must prove wrong the theory that enlargement means a decline in interest in the Mediterranean.
We call for decisive reversal of the trend; we also call for resolute commitment to the Mediterranean peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, and not just between these two peoples but in the entire area, to tackle the problems of the Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Iran, so that all this can bring peace and tranquillity to that region of the world.
Let us therefore make our Mediterranean a sea of peace - for it used to be a sea of culture - where children, women and citizens can trade and move freely throughout the area.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs and point out that this debate has brought progress in Parliament's position on the issue of the Mediterranean policy, progress which is extremely important because, apart from anything else, over and above the differences between political groups, I can see that we have common ground on this matter which adds to our strength and the strength of the European institutions.
The Union's Euro-Mediterranean strategy is just as important as its strategy on enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but we have outlined a path to follow for enlargement whereas we are still searching for a strategy for the Mediterranean policy, even though we have the partnership established by Barcelona behind us and despite the region's numerous problems, starting with the continual conflict.
I will not dwell on this as the matter will be discussed later on when Mr Solana is here.
For now, I just want to say that we call for a more active, more substantial role to be played by the European governments, giving the High Representative the power to develop a policy which is not in conflict with or an alternative to the policy of the United States, but is much more substantial than the strategy currently employed by Europe with regard to the partners, whose job, I regret to say, we cannot do for them.
We must therefore always bear in mind that the agreement must be based, first and foremost, on understanding and dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis.
On the other hand, we cannot lose sight of other areas of conflict such as the Western Sahara.
We must never forget that the United Nations exists but that, within that framework, there is room for a European initiative, and my opinion is that, at the moment, there is room for a European initiative in the Western Sahara issue and that we could put an end to this last colonial battle.
On the subject of the partnership, I feel that we should tackle the more recent aspects, to which we invite the Commission and the Council to attach more importance than we have here today.
I would like to focus on human rights and the rule of law.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union represented a considerable step forwards: that is, we acknowledge that the social and individual rights of all people are recognised on Union territory.
This places us in a position where we can have dialogue with these countries, tackling the question of a Euro-Mediterranean citizenship where human rights issues are not a question of us interfering in their affairs but of the common need to establish values which are at the basis of the kind of peaceful coexistence we want.
Similarly, with regard to immigration, I would argue that it is in both our and their interest to fight illegal immigration and therefore establish a European-scale policy.
With regard to agriculture, I would point out to the Swedish Presidency that it is very easy to say that we are going to open up agriculture to free trade as well.
You must realise, gentlemen, that, even now, when they are subject to duties, our products are already competitive with local products on the markets of those countries: let us therefore take care for liberalisation could destroy a sector which is of vital importance for some countries.
Our Moroccan friends remind us that agriculture means keeping people in the countryside, maintaining employment and protecting the environment.
Let us therefore avoid superficiality and undue haste in developing strategies on sectors where we need to progress in a partnership which does not harm these countries.
Mr President, I would firstly like to offer our thanks for the work carried out by Mrs Muscardini and Mr NaÃ¯r and for their receptiveness to our proposals, and I would also like to say that our group supports both reports.
More specifically, I would like to highlight some positive aspects which have been introduced, particularly in the field of human rights, and more especially an amendment from our group which asks for condemnation of the death penalty and a moratorium on pending executions.
It would be cause for great hope if the moratorium were to take effect immediately.
On a different issue, I would also like to express our confidence in the impetus that the amendments provide in the regional and local field and to civil society, especially to private investment as a genuine driving force for development, over and above state aid and European aid at the highest level.
I will not go into any more detail, because I believe that the main points have been made clear by Mrs Muscardini and Mr NaÃ¯r in their speeches.
However, I would like to make two observations in relation to the debates which we have held in committee and in our group.
One of these concerns political priorities and the other concerns the coherence of our actions.
We do not all believe that we have to set the priority of enlargement towards the East against the priority of the Mediterranean.
I also believe that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Lindh, made this clear the other day in committee.
They are two real priorities but they are different.
Enlargement is an operational priority for which we have set objectives, we know where we are going and we know what we want and, in reality, there are no alternative strategic options.
On the other hand, Mediterranean policy is a strategic priority, in which we do not know where we are going or, to be more precise, we are moving inexorably towards a place to which we do not want to go.
The foreseeable change in income, bearing in mind current demography and economic growth, indicates that our average per capita income will rise and the average per capita income in North Africa will decrease and, unless this is prevented, the problems we all envisage, and which there is no need to mention, will increase.
We know what will happen, but we do not know how to prevent it, although we want to prevent it at all costs.
Let us not, therefore, set political priorities against one another.
My other point concerns the coherence of our actions, because, in order to get results, we must be more coherent.
Clearly, we need will and we need resources, but, in fact, resources are not being used; and this means that there is insufficient capacity for management on our part, and there is insufficient capacity for absorption on the part of the receiving countries.
More is requested and then is not used.
Therefore, somebody should ask 'why do we not readjust the figures?'
But what we really need is a budget and it must be used.
For all these reasons I believe that we need conviction as well as the capacity for absorption.
I hope that these reports will help us to find the correct method, but quite honestly I am not convinced they will.
Mr President, I am going to focus on an aspect of the common strategy for the Mediterranean region which is not being taken into account in all respects: the South-South dialogue, which is an important driving force within the strategy for relations between the European Union and the Maghreb countries.
The creation of centralised authorities and mechanisms which thoroughly monitor the most pressing problems is essential.
The management of projects on specific points and on common aspects is a need which has become a real one in relation to cases in which, on a private level, citizens and cities from both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar have been cooperating with wonderful results and without Community patronage.
For the purposes of this local management, it would be necessary to create a new body which, as a decentralised and permanent mechanism, would bring together all the institutional, political and social leaders of these territories which are so close and yet so far away.
The 14 kilometres which separate the European Union from the Maghreb are real, but let us ensure that this does not become an insuperable distance which prevents the closest possible cooperation.
Immigration, its causes and consequences - which are sometimes terrible and irreparable - business, agricultural and fishing exchanges, social, technical, educational and university exchanges, aspects of common development, such as those in the energy sector, and the essential democratising political aspects which the European Union must promote in those countries all require the creation of new mechanisms and instruments which, in a decentralised fashion, would respond to these needs, which are local but which have widespread repercussions.
Mr President, although the Barcelona Process raised hopes and expectations, today we must register disappointment.
What yesterday were laudable ambitions, such as calls for an area of shared prosperity, for a balancing of North and South, a commitment to enhancing peace and stability, are now urgent issues.
While we all see the need to relaunch the partnership, there is, however, a divergence in the options we favour.
The future of the very concept of a partnership lies not in adjusting the needs of these populations to the market forces at work in the North and to our personal ambitions, but instead in ensuring their own development and resolving their urgent issues.
I believe, therefore, that Europe should adopt some approach other than simply supporting these countries in establishing the free-trade area that Europe was to set up.
Enabling cooperation agreements, particularly through public services, seeking other financial resources, by introducing a Tobin-style tax, for example, and reducing or even writing off debt would give real substance to a fair and useful partnership.
This approach would favour North-South relations without the element of domination.
The same applies to human rights.
Our associations with countries in the Mediterranean region can only be built on trust. We are, therefore, extremely concerned about human rights violations in Tunisia, for example, because the agreements signed by both parties oblige them to respect human rights.
The same applies to the European Union' s respect for the rights of all citizens.
I am thinking here of the need for a more integrated and more generous approach to migration.
It is inhuman and ineffective to advocate the free movement of goods and capital but not of people.
Experience shows that closing borders serves only to force immigrants with no identity papers and no rights into the hands of smugglers and other unscrupulous dealers.
How can we speak of managing immigration in a more humane manner, how can we hope and pray for further integration, if we do not question its foundations?
We must safeguard the freedom of movement of persons and equality in social, economic, cultural and political rights.
To sum up, in order to create an area of peace in the Middle East, the European Union needs to take much more direct and resolute action.
From now on, the United Nations resolutions must be applied in full, Israel must respect its commitments and we must recognise the Palestinians' legitimate right to their own state.
The same problem - I am about to finish - can be seen in the Western Sahara, where there is a risk that armed conflict will be resumed.
Despite all this, the European Union has everything to gain by bringing together all parties, such as associations, local authorities and unions, who are already establishing a different form of partnership.
Mr President, Mrs Muscardini' s report on Mediterranean policy, or what claims to be a report on this subject, stands out, first of all, for one simple reason but one that is always disregarded in this Chamber.
At long last, it puts the problem of common foreign policy back in its natural context, by which I mean the geographical context, i.e. physical space, the confrontation of land and sea, the grouping of nations in terms of their own areas of activity, their own bonds and their own community of interests, even if these are focused away from those of the mythical Europe, a continent so intangible that it does not have any real borders.
So this report puts foreign policy back into context.
As I mentioned, geographical position is the repository or sanctuary, if you prefer, or, in other words, the narrative which enables us to read, understand and hence respect the invariable political factors that are dictated by geography.
This shows, moreover, just how problematic, if not, as we might more accurately say, impossible, it is to implement a common foreign policy through pathetic puppets such as Solana.
Yet, the way that political Europe currently operates automatically rules out the geo-political approach since, as there is no definition of what constitutes Europe' s common interest - by which I mean a European res publica - it still favours, after all the usual free-for-alls, the law of the jungle, allowing the strongest at any given time to make the rest of the 15 support its strategic choices, even if it has to shove them down their throats.
We therefore come to understand that, in this game, the upper hand on Mediterranean policy, as well as on many other subjects, is held by northern Europe - i.e. Great Britain plus Germany and its age-old allies. That is why priority has clearly been given to enlargement to the north and to the east including the Balkans, where we are paying the price of German policy, while our friends in the Mediterranean region bear the costs of every adjustment.
Therefore, the rapporteur and my good friend, Mr NaÃ¯r, are both justified in denouncing Europe' s lack of commitment to the Mediterranean region and Middle Eastern affairs.
I would just like to add that all the Latin countries may sooner or later reject, perhaps even violently reject the prospect of a future which relegates them to the sidelines of a group over which they no longer have any influence.
Even today, we believe that it is the duty of the southern European nations, or rather the northern Mediterranean nations, to work together with the southern Mediterranean countries, firstly, the three Maghreb countries, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, to create this area of solidarity, which is a part of our history and geography and that is, moreover, of importance to us in the century that is just beginning.
Mr President, the two reports which we are debating today have at least one thing in common: they contain a whole raft of unfulfillable wishes and desires with regard to the Mediterranean region.
Financially, we simply lack the resources to do an awful lot and what is more, the European Union' s external relations have been such that we cannot afford to be overly confident.
It is high time we established priorities, thus allowing us to do the things we do outside the Union well.
Recent statements made by Mr Solana confirm the need to prioritise.
He referred to the Union' s strategy documents, including those with regard to the Mediterranean countries, as purely bureaucratic exercises.
Ideas on paper hardly ever turn into reality in practice.
However, the endless recitals and paragraphs in the documents before us do raise expectations among our partners, expectations which we cannot possibly fulfil, because we also have other responsibilities.
Both reports are disparaging about those other responsibilities.
According to the rapporteurs, our relationship with candidate countries, in particular, has led to the neglect of the southern countries, and that must now be put right.
However, I do not agree with this line of thought.
Enlargement deserves all our attention in the near future.
If we want to do this properly, we will have our hands full.
There is therefore certainly no chance of spending as much money on our southerly neighbours, certainly not if we bear in mind how reluctant Member States are to put more money into the Union' s fund.
