That objection is based solely upon not agreeing with particular decisions in one or two areas of technology.
It takes no account of the publicly available record showing that technical boards of the EPO are independent of both the EPO examining division and EPO practices.
It ignores the fact that, in the EPLA structure, such technical judges would be in the minority among national judges who have been praised by those of the same persuasion as MrÂ Rocard for their stance in those areas of technology.
However, I question whether we would want them to be able to have the two jobs at once â I do not think that was intended â and I think that could be clarified.
Also, the appointment of judges via representatives from Member State governments follows the precedents of many institutions, including the ECJ, so I do not think there is huge substance in these arguments and it would certainly be a mistake for the Commission to miss out on contributing to and learning from the EPLA process.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to speak on behalf of my colleague, Evelin Lichtenberger, who is unable to attend this afternoon.
We always speak about a competitive, knowledge-based Europe, but some people put so little trust in Europeâs potential that they prefer to strengthen a non-EU body â the European Patent Office â to the detriment of European Union interests.
If what we want is harmonised jurisdiction, why do we not pursue that aim through EU directives?
That would be the most obvious way to proceed.
Some people are afraid to face the democratic process.
After the software patent fight, apparently there are people who are worried about the amendments that the European Parliament would propose. Therefore they want to proceed as undemocratically as possible.
They want to put the fate of Europeâs companies in the hands of the patent bureaucracy instead of elected policymakers.
Furthermore, the cost of litigations would be tough to meet for SMEs because every litigation concerning an EPO patent would go directly before a new international court â a real own-goal for Europeâs competitiveness.
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that some big multinationals such as Nokia and GlaxoSmithKline are very concerned about such a proposal.
If this proposal neither helps SMEs nor is welcomed by big countries, who will help?
What we can infer for sure is that it will only increase the work for some patent lawyers.
Europe does not need merely more patents: it needs more high-quality patents that foster real innovation.
The number of patent applications filed at the European Patent Office per year has, over the last seven years, increased by about 60%.
However, that number does not correspond to an increase in innovative activity, therefore giving us cause for concern over an extension of the scope of Patent Office subject matter.
We will keep repeating to our colleagues, and especially to the Commissioner, that only a Community framework creates the conditions for an effective, competitive European patent law at international level.
Â Â  . Mr President, last year Parliament rejected by 684 votes to 14 an attempt to impose patents on software, because, like books and all written materials, software is best described as âideas in symbolic formâ and should continue to be subject only to copyright.
Parliament was also persuaded that patenting software would stifle invention, cripple small businesses and harm the economy, and yet this year the Commission returns with an even more sweeping proposal, which would permit software to be patented.
The proposal is for a single patent court, whose judiciary would be appointed by the same board as that which appoints judges to the present appeals court of the existing â purely advisory â European Patent Office.
The Commission has a seat on the Board and, under this proposal, would acquire voting rights as well.
This raises serious doubts about the independence of the new court, especially when we consider that the EPO has no scruples about issuing patents for software and that this proposal commits a single patent court to following the precedents set by previous EPO decisions.
By the proposalâs own admission, litigation in this new court will be two to three times more costly than litigation in national patent courts, which this proposal will also abolish, thus putting appeal to this court beyond the reach of all but large corporations.
I thought the computer-implemented inventions directive was bad until I saw this proposal.
If it goes through, I shall gladly take the Leninist view that worse is better.
Nevertheless, we should say no again and ask the Commissioners what part of no they do not understand.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the significant increase in patent applications is adding to the impact of unclear patent law.
That is why solutions are needed which will enable the process of harmonising patent law to begin.
Accordingly, a clear definition of what can and cannot be patented is required.
It is important not to resort to using patent law in isolation from the innovations themselves, because by its very nature a patent implies that free competition is restricted to a certain degree.
A harmonising directive would be the best solution from the point of view of the Communityâs interest, but Parliament rejected the Commissionâs previous proposals.
Other solutions must therefore be sought.
One idea mooted is for all Member States of the Union to accept and ratify the EPLA Convention.
It should be borne in mind, however, that we can only support this Convention when it meets the criteria deemed essential by the Union.
Amongst others, these criteria include drawing up a clear definition, as far as is possible, of what may be patented ensuring the independence of ruling bodies and guaranteeing the total impartiality of the judges who rule on patent protection and the validity of patents.
The costs relating to the protection of patent rights must also be balanced and easy to implement.
These are the reasons why we are not in a position to adopt the Convention at present.
Its implications may be difficult to assess, because although it is obvious that the EPLA concerns institutional solutions, the potential impact on substantive law should not be overlooked, particularly where the practices of the European Patent Office are concerned.
That is why I am asking the Commission to provide a detailed impact assessment for each of the proposals submitted here.
Nonetheless, it is most important to make it clear that Parliament does want a change of patent policy.
The kind of change we have in mind, however, must satisfy the needs of both large businesses and small and medium-sized European firms.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to congratulate MrÂ McCreevy on his work on the creation of an internal market, particularly with regard to patent law.
Nevertheless, I must point out that we Members of the European Parliament are here representing our constituents, and the reactions I have received from constituents from the industrial sector in my country to this proposal have been negative.
They are negative for various reasons: the issue of languages â I believe that the solution proposed is much worse than the one we have in the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, which offers greater language plurality â and the issue of jurisdiction, which has already been discussed here.
We have our own jurisdiction, which is that of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Court of First Instance, and the creation or multiplication of jurisdictions outside of the European Union raises a series of problems that we must take into account.
My feeling is that this proposal may be doomed to failure, like previous proposals, as a result of not taking these factors into account.
We need to make progress on patents, but, in order to do so, we must have a broad political base.
Firstly, I would say that, at the moment, jurisdictional procedures which extend beyond the structure of the European Union do not inspire confidence â we have great confidence in the wonderful institutions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance â and, secondly, that the issue of languages is not a trivial matter.
I know that many people have a language of a more universal nature, but within the European Union we have sought solutions to the language problem, because the European Union includes diverse cultures, diverse models and diverse legal systems, and they must be able to co-exist.
I hope that the Commissioner and the Commission in general will reflect on this issue and will be able to offer us a proposal that is acceptable to the whole of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your efforts at getting this slow-moving vessel steaming ahead again.
We have spent more than thirty years talking about patents, and it is particularly strange that so many Members should be critical of your ideas, even though almost all the EUâs Member States are signatories to the Munich Convention.
By so doing, they are implying a lack of confidence in our Member States; that I find in itself a pretty strange kind of deadlock, and I also think that there is something odd about the fact that a Community patent still cannot be discussed at Council level.
At the present time, the EU has no democratic control over the European Patent Office, and that is of course much to be regretted.
We go along with your way of thinking, and it would be good if the EU were to do as it did at the Hague conference, were to take part as a political and economic organisation, so that we, as part of it, could have influence on what happens.
If that happens, then intergovernmentalism is no longer the order of the day, and the community method will have been adopted.
We would be happy to see the EU taking part in the Munich Convention in the same way, so that the Commission â and, perhaps, Parliament too â might be able to exercise ongoing democratic oversight over what goes on.
Together, then, with the Group of the European Peopleâs Party and with the Liberals â and I hope that the Socialist Group will join us in supporting this â we have brought in a resolution endorsing your position and with the intention of examining what options are available.
We see that as the only solution if the Council is going to keep sitting on this for so long.
We are not talking here about the rules governing languages or about the costs, and we certainly have no desire to suspend the national courts, but there must eventually be a special chamber at the European Court of Justice with specialist judges capable of determining how patents should be dealt with across Europe in the event of cases coming to trial.
As for the computer-implemented inventions to which MrÂ Rocard referred, we do not want to open that particular Pandoraâs box again; I agree with him that doing that would be a very tedious business.
We can also see that mistakes may well still be being made within the EPO, and, for the simple reason that we cannot correct them, it is important that we follow this up.
I was very struck by the words of an Irish Commissioner, who recently said, in Finland: âNo more fine words about Lisbon; we are now going into actionâ.
I hope that that is what you are going to do, for you, Commissioner, were the person who said that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have listened carefully to the debate this afternoon.
We all agree that the situation is not perfect and we all know that there are different views as to the right solutions.
I am convinced that in an ideal world the Community patent the solution, but in the real world there is no prospect of agreement on the Community patent in the near future.
So should I sit around doing nothing, just waiting for something to turn up?
Well, that would certainly be an easy way out, but it would also be grossly irresponsible, because nothing will happen unless we take the initiative.
The consultation delivered some clear and important messages.
There is an overwhelming desire for a patent system that is simpler and more cost-effective and maintains the highest standards in the quality of its examination and grant procedures.
All the stakeholders went to great lengths to convey their views to us.
Now, quite rightly, they expect action. And I agree.
I believe the time has come to make a concerted push to improve the patent system in Europe.
As policymakers and regulators, it is our duty.
Currently, we are at a standstill.
We have to take the first most difficult step in one direction or another.
There no perfect solution.
No single element will provide all the answers.
We need to combine different instruments to meet the different needs of different stakeholders.
As I said in my introductory remarks, the Community patent and the EPLA are not mutually exclusive initiatives; indeed, our aim should be to ensure that they converge.
In both cases our goal is the same: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system.
I am not blind to the potential drawbacks and dangers of the EPLA.
But we have a better chance of getting the right outcome for Europeâs business if we actively engage in the negotiation of the agreement.
The patent strategy now contains more than just our future plans for a Community patent and EPLA.
There is a whole range of framing and supporting measures that we need to consider, most of them directed at smaller companies.
Our objective is to produce a system that meets the needs of all stakeholders at all levels â national, European and Community âand provides a fair balance between the diverse interests involved.
I would like to make one final point.
As a politician for 30Â years now, I am not easily surprised.
But this week I have been mildly surprised.
I was mildly surprised that the outline for our future strategy, which I set out in a speech in Helsinki some weeks ago, has been used by some to make assertions that the Commission wishes to bring the computer-implemented inventions question back on to the agenda.
Now I am used to hearing strong arguments and to links being made, but this one leaves me quite perplexed.
I have stated before this House on various occasions that as long as I am Commissioner for the Single Market and Services the Commission will present initiative and will not carry out any work on this.
Some might like that, others might disapprove.
But this Parliament rejected the common position last year.
I respect and accept that decision and will do absolutely nothing to turn it around.
Let me reassure you that I am a man of my word.
When drawing conclusions from the consultation exercise, computer-implemented inventions were not in any way on my mind.
That will remain so for the rest of my mandate.
Â Â  Please note that the deadline for tabling motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure is 12 noon on Monday 9Â October 2006.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on ThursdayÂ 12 October at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  I have grave doubts about the proposals for a system of patent courts that would be at armâs length both from democratic institutions and from proper judicial review.
The draft resolution on the European Patent Litigation Agreement could, if implemented, place patent disputes in the hands of these who have a vested interest in a very wide use of patents, it would lead to extra costs for SME, cause an explosion in litigation and potentially restrict innovation in Europe.
Supporters of the EPLA make reference to the USAâs central federal patent court, but this system has led to excessive use of patent,Â and a considerable volume of litigation and malicious threats of litigation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it is not even 4 p.m. and this week's topical and urgent debate, which would only have lasted an hour, has been cancelled.
In other words, we would have been finished at 5 p.m.
There were important matters to discuss, such as the coup in Thailand and the situation in Moldova, but the Conference of Presidents arbitrarily decided that there would be no topical and urgent debate.
I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this.
We were told that this was the second sitting in September, but that is incorrect: we held the August plenary session at the beginning of September, and this is now the September plenary session, so to speak.
As such, it is our right to hold a topical and urgent debate at each regular sitting in Strasbourg.
I would ask to you pass this protest on to the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  Your comment will be passed on to the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 28 September 2006.
Tribute
I must begin this sitting by passing on some bad news.
Firstly, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Antoni GutiÃ©rrez DÃ­az, who was a Member of the European Parliament for many years, from 1987 to 1999.
As you are very well aware as am I, since I got to know him very well within the context of Spanish political life he was a member of the Communist Group and then the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, of which he was Vice-President from 1992 to 1994.
Mr GutiÃ©rrez DÃ­az was also Vice-President of our Parliament from 1994 to 1999 and President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Regional Planning and Relations with Regional and Local Authorities from 1992 to 1994.
To those of us who knew him, his death is a great tragedy.
I believe that political life has lost one of its best representatives.
I would ask that we observe a minute's silence in memory of our late colleague.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Statement by the President
I have further bad news to communicate to you.
It was with sadness and indignation that I received the news of the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya.
I believe that the European Parliament must pay tribute to this journalist, to her courage and her exceptional determination.
As you know, following the news of her murder I issued a press communiquÃ© urging the Russian authorities to do everything in their power to ascertain the causes and perpetrators of this horrendous event as quickly as possible.
We hope that in identifying the culprits Russia will demonstrate the state of democracy and freedom of expression there.
This event, on the eve of the Lahti meeting, is clearly of particularly crucial significance to us.
On my own behalf and on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I would like once again to express our sincerest condolences to her family and friends.
I also believe, however, that this is a good opportunity to remember that the murder of journalists is not, unfortunately, something that happens only on the odd rare occasion. On the contrary, many people lose their lives defending freedom of expression and information.
It has happened in Russia today, but it happened in Lebanon the day before yesterday, in many Latin American countries, in many African countries and in many South-East Asian countries.
People who produce information and create opinion often do so at risk of their lives.
This latest murder is no more or less tragic than any of the many other cases we have seen.
I believe, however, that the case of Anna Politkovskaya's death and the cases of the 63 journalists murdered and more than 120 imprisoned warrant an expression of our respect for these people.
I would ask that we observe a minute's silence in tribute to Anna Politkovskaya and the 63 journalists who have been murdered while carrying out their work.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting
Mr President, thank you for making this statement on the occasion of the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya.
Russia has become one of the deadliest countries for journalists, and her cruel death...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Kelam, I am afraid I cannot give you the floor.
Mr Kelam, I cannot give you the floor at this point.
We are asking whether there are any comments concerning the Minutes.
You will have the opportunity to express your views on this during the one-minute questions.
For the moment, however, we are in the process of approving the Minutes.
Are there are any comments concerning the Minutes?
Mr President, I have a mandate, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to extend the topic of ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is not the right time, Mr Kelam.
You can do it at another time, but I cannot give you the floor now.
I am sorry, Mr Kelam. I am sorry.
This is not the right time to speak on behalf of the groups.
We are currently approving the Minutes.
With regard to the Minutes, are there any comments?
(FR) Mr President, if that presents a problem, then I myself am also presenting a problem.
We are calling for a change to the agenda, in fact to an item of the agenda.
That is all, and we would ask you to make the change straightaway.
Excuse me.
It is very clear what the Minutes means in Spanish.
It is extremely clear.
We are talking about the approval of the Minutes, and I imagine that the interpreters are able to translate what we are talking about for you.
Do you have any comments with regard to the Minutes?
If you do not, you will have the opportunity to speak about other items on the agenda later.
Mr President, I do not want to delay the proceedings, but Question Time at the last part-session was a shambles.
I would ask you to ensure that it does not happen again.
Question Time is being moved around far too often and Members are not being given the opportunity to do their duty.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
We shall try to ensure that it is not a shambles this time, at least in your judgment.

Agenda
With regard to the agenda for today and tomorrow, the corresponding corrigendum has been distributed, drawn up with the agreement of the political groups and including the following changes, as well as those that were announced on 28 September:
- Wednesday:
From 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., we are adding the statements by the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the nuclear test by North Korea.
We welcome Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner who are here for that purpose.
With regard to the oral questions on footwear from China and Vietnam, I must point out that the Council will not take part in that debate.
(DE) Mr President, we are, in principle, happy with these alterations, and particularly happy that Mr Solana has found ways and means of getting here.
We are, however, very far from happy with the fact that the Council's willingness to agree to be present only to a very limited extent means that a great deal of today's agenda has had to be put off to another day.
Although this also happened under the Austrian Presidency, we did manage to come to an arrangement.
I ask that the Presidencies of the Council be reminded that a provisional agenda is not final, and that it can of course happen - as it has on this occasion - that we have to respond to events as they happen.
I would also ask the governments of which the Council is composed to ensure that they are able to be present for the sittings in Brussels at least until the evening.
That is absolutely vital, for if they cannot, we cannot get through all the things that are - and indeed have to be - on the agenda.
I would ask that this be communicated to the Council and that it be urged to be more visibly and more frequently present in this House.
(Applause)
There is a change of title concerning the Council and Commission statement on the Informal Meeting in Lahti.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asks that the title read as follows: Council and Commission statement on the Informal Meeting in Lahti, EU/Russia relations following the murder of Mrs Anna Politkovskaya, with a motion for a resolution on her murder and freedom of opinion in Russia.
You will be aware that, according to our Rules of Procedure, this amendment must be approved by plenary if the President sees fit to put it to the vote.
Given the circumstances, I believe it appropriate to do so and I am therefore going to ask plenary to give its opinion on the proposal of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Does anybody wish to speak?
(DE) Mr President, we have no objection to a change of title, nor, indeed, to a resolution, but we do think it premature to adopt a resolution within the space of a day before matters have been clarified, so I would ask that consideration be given to such a resolution being adopted at the next plenary session, when there will be a sound basis for it.
We will of course be stating our own position on it, and by then we will have more detailed information.
For that reason, then, I would keep the two separate.
You propose separating the decision on the change of title from the decision on whether to debate a resolution.
In that case, let us vote solely on the change of title for the time being.
(Parliament approved the change of title)
(DE) Mr President, Mr Swoboda, we do indeed have only one day available to us, and the reason is that we have been asking for this ever since Anna Politkovskaya was murdered, but certain groups have been standing in the way, and hence it is only today that this vote has made it possible, for, right through the preparations, certain groups - your own included - have said 'no' to this addition.
Yes, it is difficult, and we are quite happy that it should be done next week, but I ask you to admit that it is your fault, for it is you who have stood in the way of this issue being debated the whole time.
That is something that has to be said.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, our group's Mr Kelam has tried to raise this issue; it may be that he made the attempt at the wrong point in the proceedings, but, now we are discussing the agenda for today's sittings, it might be not merely appropriate but also a matter of courtesy to allow Mr Tunne Kelam to take the floor and speak, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to this agenda and the alteration of this item on it, rather than going straight ahead and allowing votes on a single motion on this subject after so many other views have been expressed on it.
(Applause)
Mr Rack, the President and the Bureau are trying to apply the Rules of Procedure strictly.
The Bureau had only received one proposed amendment to the agenda in writing in this regard before the beginning of the sitting.
Mr Kelam will certainly be able to speak at the appropriate time, but this is not it.
(DE) Mr President, it sometimes happens that unfortunate events make things take a turn that we would not have wished.
One example is this sad case of the murder of a journalist, which we will be debating.
This sad murder is not something about which we should be at odds with each other.
We will have the debate, but I would echo what Mr Cohn-Bendit said and recommend that we agree to wait until the next part-session before adopting a resolution; that will be a fitting response to this sad event.
If nobody objects, we shall discuss whether or not there will be a resolution during the next sitting.
Mr Kelam, do you wish to add anything?
Mr President, I apologise for attempting to speak at the wrong time, but I had a mandate from the PPE-DE Group to propose that we should extend the first item on today's agenda to include a discussion on the murder of the Russian journalist, Anna Politkovskaya.
I am satisfied that has been done.
Furthermore, the PPE-DE Group proposes that the House should adopt a resolution on freedom of the press in Russia, which is a burning topic.
I think it was rightly said that this horrible murder should not divide this House.
We need to be united in order to send a very clear message in support of a woman who many say was the last independent investigative journalist in Russia.
I hope that this House will support the proposal.
The death of Anna Politkovskaya was not planned and so we could not plan our reaction to it.
We need to react immediately.
(Loud applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Kelam.
I believe that it is clear.
We have followed our Rules of Procedure to the letter.
I do not believe that the Presidency has shown any lack of consideration by giving you the floor at the appropriate time, Mr Kelam.
Mr President, you did not take a vote on whether we should have a resolution at this part-session.
I request that we take a vote.
A proposal was submitted to the effect that we react immediately with a resolution, and you did not take a vote on that proposal.
(Applause)
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, let us not play cat and mouse.
There was a proposal from Mr Poettering, and I asked whether there was a consensus on it.
Nobody rose at that point to speak against.
You must pay attention to the debates, Mr Saryusz-Wolski!
There has been a proposal, and I asked whether there was a consensus on it.
Since nobody has expressed any objection, I have continued with the agenda.
The subject is closed.
(The order of business was adopted)
Future action in the field of patents (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
Nuclear test by the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea (debate)
The next item is the Statements by the European Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the nuclear test by North Korea.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have asked me here this afternoon, together with the Commission, to give a brief assessment of what happened early on Monday morning, when the North Korean Government may have carried out a nuclear test.
I say that it was very probably a nuclear test, as we cannot, from the information available to us at present, be completely certain that it was indeed that.
The most likely explanation is that a nuclear device made from plutonium was detonated, plutonium no doubt coming from the Yongbyon nuclear reactor constructed in North Korea in the 1980s and 1990s.
In all probability, it was a nuclear test and was therefore an act which we condemn, which we condemn in the strongest terms and which we also condemn because of the degree of irresponsibility it shows on the North Korean Government's part.
That nuclear test is not just a threat to the region around North Korea but also an act of aggression against stability and security across the world.
It is not inconceivable that such an act may have implications for the global arms race generally.
I would like to begin by saying that countries in the area have reacted calmly and responsibly.
I have had an opportunity, over the last 48 hours, to talk to all countries involved in the region: to South Korea, to China and to Japan.
I have also talked to Russia and the United States of America.
All countries have shown the same firmness in response as we Europeans are showing, but also the same calmness, lest the situation get out of hand.
I would like to point out very clearly that this reprehensible act came just a few days after the election as Japanese Prime Minister of Shinzo Abe, who immediately upon taking office, in a gesture which does him credit, visited Beijing, which the previous Prime Minister had not visited for years.
After Beijing, he went on to Seoul, embarking on a full tour of the countries most affected by the North Korean threat.
In the middle of that kind, good-neighbourly trip, North Korea decided to carry out its nuclear test.
With regard to the condemnation expressed by all countries in the area and with responsibility being the watchword, I should highlight yesterday's meeting at the Japanese parliament, where Prime Minister Abe stated very clearly that Japan would not respond by developing nuclear weapons.
That, I think, shows great responsibility on the part of the Japanese Government, which we should all commend.
Emphasis should also be placed here on the constructive response by the People's Republic of China.
As you will be aware, China was leading the 'Six Party Talks' which, although stalled since before the summer, were regarded as a positive way of trying to resolve the North Korean nuclear proliferation problem.
As I said, I have recently been speaking to all political leaders in the region, including the future Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is at present still in office as South Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs.
I told them all that North Korea poses a threat to peace and security, not just within the region; and, I should add, not just in its nuclear activities but also in its attitude towards missile proliferation.
As you will be aware, North Korea is continuing to produce, and maybe illegally exporting to other parts of the world, technology for missiles to deliver either nuclear or conventional warheads.
It is important also to point out that this act by North Korea is an act directed against its own population.
North Korea is a poor country, where most of the population go hungry and do not enjoy the living conditions we would all wish them to have; yet their government goes on spending millions of dollars on an arms race and on achieving a nuclear capability of which it has no need whatsoever for the development and well-being of its people.
I would add that the response of the United Nations Security Council, since Monday night, has been correct, and that the reaction of the European Union's Member States has also been extremely correct.
It is important to point out that China has also made constructive statements concerning its willingness to cooperate on approving a tough resolution which clearly condemns North Korea's conduct and will prove effective in avoiding proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons.
I would like to say, lastly, that the European Union, which voiced its unanimous and urgent condemnation of Monday morning's act at the appropriate time, has also to consider its commitment to and attitude towards North Korea.
As I said earlier, this is a poor country, with which we have increasingly tenuous relations, but with which we do still have a humanitarian link, to which I am sure Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner will be referring.
We shall be keeping a close watch on developments over the days ahead, and I shall personally remain in touch with the political leaders of all countries in the region.
I would like, Mr President, before drawing to a close, once again to condemn in the strongest terms on behalf of the European Union what was very probably a nuclear explosion carried out by North Korea.
Mr President, Secretary-General, High Representative of the Council,
the nuclear test which North Korea claims to have conducted at Gilju on the morning of 9 October is an extremely serious matter, which I unreservedly condemn.
As the High Representative just said, not only does it threaten regional stability in north-east Asia, it also constitutes the latest in a series of challenges by Kim Jong-il to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.
Following the announcement of its intention to carry out such a test last Tuesday, North Korea has proceeded in defiance of the near-unanimous advice and wishes of the international community.
This action increases North Korea's international isolation and it is difficult to see how it can serve the interests of the country's long-suffering population.
As ever, North Korea's motives are very opaque.
It does not seem unreasonable, however, to regard this as a deliberate escalation and provocation by the DPRK, possibly to test the ability of the international community to remain united.
The European Union has spoken out very clearly in response to this nuclear test and I am pleased to note that the international community has been swift, resolute and united in condemning these actions.
The very forceful and clear-cut position of China is particularly significant and welcome.
I have just come back from a trip to Singapore and Malaysia, and I can assure you that my colleagues are most concerned by this act by North Korea.
I am pleased that we will have an opportunity to discuss the EU's response at the General Affairs Council next week.
But what should we do next?
Over the past decade, the European Union has played an active role in support of wider international efforts to promote peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
Since the beginning of the humanitarian emergency in the early 1990s, we have been a major donor, delivering some EUR 345 million in assistance since 1995.
We also played our part in support of earlier non-proliferation efforts through the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation, and we have offered political support for the six-party talks, although we are not direct participants in that process.
Clearly, as a global player that has done its share in the past, we should now play our part again in response to what is clearly a global problem.
The international community will have to take clear action.
Somebody will have to talk to the North Korean regime to bring it out of its very paranoid and aggressive posture, and the man who I believe has been designated as the next UN Secretary-General might be the right person to do so.
It is still a little early to say what action we should take, although various options are on the table.
As a staunch advocate of multilateralism, the European Union must pay particular attention to what is decided in the United Nations.
In line with the Treaties, we look to the EU Member States sitting on the Security Council to take due account of EU views as they participate actively in these important discussions in New York.
I am pleased to note that the negotiations within the Security Council appear to be making good and rapid progress towards a substantive and clear resolution on this matter.
With regard to humanitarian assistance, the population has suffered enormously, and therefore I would like to keep up the humanitarian assistance to these people in the future.
They should not be put at risk and punished even more by the terrible regime.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, North Korea's nuclear tests are a provocation and a threat to the international community: a provocation, because North Korea is a dictatorial regime in the Stalinist style, Mr President, which keeps its people starved and which should dedicate its resources to a nobler cause than nuclear proliferation, rather than taking advantage of the suspension of the six-party talks and of the fact that it is outside of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Mr President, it is also a threat to international security because it seriously compromises the values of peace and stability in a region of the world that is particularly sensitive, namely South-East Asia.
It is therefore very important that the international community react effectively and appropriately, and hence it is good news, as Mr Solana and the Commissioner have said, that the permanent members of the Security Council and Japan have met to examine a whole list of sanctions in response to that provocation.
Mr Solana, it would be good to hear the Council's position on the list of measures or sanctions that could be applied to North Korea by the United Nations, a list of sanctions that range from the application of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to that of Article 41, which only provides for economic and commercial sanctions.
I also believe, Mr President, that it is excellent news that, for the first time, China has been prepared to respond, within the context of the United Nations and the Security Council, appropriately and with possible sanctions.
Mr President, this is very much a model case.
We must not forget that Iran will be watching how this crisis develops extremely closely.
On behalf of the European Union, Mr Solana has been involved in the resolution of Iran's nuclear escalation; it is therefore clear that the international community in general and the European Union in particular cannot remain blind, deaf and dumb in the face of this provocation, and its response must be firm, effective and appropriate, in accordance with the values of peace, democratic consolidation, reconciliation and multilateralism that we in the European Union advocate.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is being conducted against the backdrop of a difficult situation, but I do think that what Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have said shows that the European Union, in the persons of its High Representative and its Foreign Affairs Commissioner, is trying to respond to it in the right way.
It is only normal that our response should be one of anger.
It is quite clear that what is happening is that a system that is on its last legs is trying, by means of provocation to get others to respect it and pay it attention, and perhaps to reap some advantage in so doing.
That is not a matter of doubt, and the normal response is to say that this will not be allowed, that it cannot be allowed, and that boundaries must be set, knowing full well that the choice of possible responses is limited by that fact that - to turn the argument on its head - the possession of a nuclear weapon by a regime such as this one, whose actions are so unpredictable, itself constitutes an incalculable risk.
In a situation such as this, we have to think before we act, and so, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, our group unreservedly endorses what you said about the need for a distinction to be drawn between what a delusional dictator gets up to with his armed forces and what the other side needs to do with humanitarian considerations in mind.
The people should not be punished for the madness of the dictator who rules over them, and it is for that reason that we support these measures.
Secondly, we must try to reopen diplomatic channels; there is no alternative to that, for, whatever this dictator does, one must try to read his behaviour and discern what chances are still open to us.
Have all the avenues been closed off whereby North Korea might be brought back to talk to the Six?
I do not believe that they have been.
Not every avenue has been closed off.
It is still possible to make the attempt to get the North Koreans back to the negotiating table.
Difficult though that task might be, it is also clear that it is not merely fortuitous that North Korea should test a nuclear weapon at the same time as South Korea's foreign minister is elected Secretary-General of the United Nations.
We have to read the signs and ask ourselves whether they were shutting the door on us, or whether the action of shutting the door might be seen as an attempt at drawing attention to themselves; I believe the latter to be the case.
It is for that reason that we, the Socialist Group in this House, along with the international community of social democrats, take the view that we must, despite everything, carry on with dialogue, quite simply because, at the end of the day, there is no alternative.
Mr Solana, I think that the reactions to date have been level-headed, not least in North Korea's immediate vicinity; the Japanese government and the governments of the other neighbouring states have, I think, been appropriate.
What is not appropriate is a policy of arrogance.
Let me remind the House that there was a time when the United States of America, under the Clinton administration, reached agreement with North Korea on energy supply programmes.
I would also remind the House that what was known, in the 1990s, as the Kedo programme, was not intended to appease the dictator, but - in so far as possible - to keep the regime on-side.
The administration that succeeded Clinton's put a stop to all these efforts.
Nor do I have any desire to conceal, or make a secret of the fact, that our group sees this as another failure on the part of the United States and an example of its unilateral approach.
While that does not excuse what the North Korean dictator is doing, it does indicate that the only way to resolve international conflicts is to bring all the parties together.
The last thing I have to say I say on my own account to all those who always recommend the development of nuclear energy as the solution to the problems of mankind; I would remind them that every nuclear power plant and every enrichment facility that is built becomes, in the hands of a criminal such as the North Korean dictator, something that puts the whole world at incalculable risk.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, two days ago, North Korea crossed a red line.
The Presidency of the European Union, in its statement, strongly condemned the nuclear test, which is unacceptable.
The Presidency signalled its willingness to work in close cooperation with the international community towards a decisive international response to this provocative act.
The High Representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner confirmed and repeated this stance.
I am very happy about that, and I welcome the statement, but we expect it to be strictly implemented.
North Korea has always tried to negotiate using threats and intimidation.
It has worked for them so far, but we must be clear that it will not work for them again.
There seems to be an unprecedented international consensus on possible counter-measures against the North Korean regime.
Let us take this opportunity to send a clear signal that we will not tolerate acts that lead to instability and that further increase tensions.
North Korea's action is a threat to regional stability because it might trigger a regional arms race, which is highly undesirable.
It is also a threat to the immediate security of all if North Korea succeeds in enhancing its position in the illegal arms trade with shady regimes, not to mention international terrorist organisations.
When dealing with North Korea, we must also keep Iran in mind.
By taking a firm stance on this matter, we also create incentives for Iran to return to the negotiating table.
North Korea must refrain from further tests and unconditionally return to the six-party talks.
At the same time, it must be obvious to all participants that the aim of the six-party talks is to convince North Korea to abandon its military nuclear programme and provide for its participation in the NPT regime.
Nothing less is acceptable, and we have to achieve that now; we can be flexible on modalities and specifics, but we must be firm on the principles.
North Korea must see that a military nuclear programme is not the way to guarantee its safety and stability.
We have seen in the past that North Korea can be open to limited but mutually fruitful economic cooperation with its neighbours and other partners.
The European Union and other donors have provided substantial humanitarian aid, as the Commissioner indicated a few minutes ago, and we have always been open to giving further assistance and continuing dialogue, but with conditions.
The question is: why is North Korea turning its back on the international community now?
The answer is simple: the leaders of North Korea think they have nothing to lose.
They are wrong: the price they have to pay for growing international isolation and possible sanctions will increase dramatically.
We already know that they do not care much about the welfare of their own population, but through such irresponsible acts they risk losing international support and cooperation for a gradual opening-up of their country and for reforms without which the political and social structure of their country will inevitably collapse.
They might understand no other argument, but they must understand this argument.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I come from a country that 'deals' in nuclear technology.
It is therefore very hypocritical to be surprised that this danger has resurfaced when it has been spread here, there and everywhere.
That being said, I am going to focus my speech on North Korea. I could not care less about whether it has nuclear technology that is genuinely fully-developed or an appropriate vehicle for such technology.
I am one of the very few MEPs to have stayed in North Korea.
That country is not just a harsh dictatorship that plunges its people into complete poverty: during my stay there, I also visited one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in the world.
It must be pointed out, in fact, that millions of people living there are completely out of touch with reality, unaware of the outside world.
Their lives consist in grovelling before a leader who tells them each morning that the entire world wants to overrun them.
In North Korea, we are confronted with a world that would appear to be very close to that of George Orwell.
What sanctions should be applied under these circumstances, then, when dealing with a regime that is on the fringes of what is generally accepted to be reasonable behaviour and that could not care less about its own people, since it let a million people die only a short time ago?
Block what when they are already cut off from the world?
Destroy what industry when the one they have is already in ruins?
Try to starve them even more?
That would be downright disgraceful.
In my view, the only real card that we can play is China, China that created this regime, China that has kept it going, China - and this is a very interesting point to note - that was amongst the first, if not the first, to condemn this week's explosion.
If we really want to be of help in this matter, I believe that we must show determination, a great deal of composure and, given that we disseminate nuclear technology, a great deal of humility, too.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, North Korea's nuclear test is, quite clearly, deserving of condemnation, for it makes the region even less stable and, like every other of its kind, exposes the people who live there to the risk of radioactive fall-out.
It is particularly cynical of North Korea to invest money in nuclear testing that the government could instead have used to feed the country's people better, and it is good that the EU wants to carry on providing aid to this end.
The Russian Defence Minister has said that this nuclear test makes North Korea, the de facto ninth nuclear power, joining the USA, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Israel, India and Pakistan.
The situation must now be prevented from escalating further.
Those now talking of the need for military strikes are dangerous warmongers.
On the contrary, it is negotiations that will provide the solution we need, and the EU could certainly play a part in them, as indeed Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have already indicated.
One of the North Korean government's core demands would appear to be that it should be allowed to negotiate directly with the USA.
Why, then, should it not be possible for the USA to conduct bilateral negotiations with North Korea directly?
That is what the US administration must do, even if it seemingly involves a superhuman effort.
Calling for sanctions will only make the situation worse; those who are doing that right now must explain how they propose to prevent the sanctions hitting only the North Korean people, who are starving already.
The experience of imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan in the days when they were fledgling nuclear states shows that sanctions very rapidly run out of steam.
The Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty was always inconsistent, but is now in serious danger; in its sixth article, the parties to it undertook - and I quote - 'to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control', which amounts to a requirement that all nuclear weapons be disposed of.
Europeans, too, have their own obligations where nuclear weapons are concerned.
I would remind Mr Solana that the nuclear weapons within the European Union are not held legally, contrary to what your colleague Annalisa Giannella tried to tell those of us who sit on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
On the contrary, the EU's Member States have committed themselves, on the basis of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to nuclear disarmament, and this is where we come up against the problem of the double standards that are so characteristic of Western and EU policy.
I ask you: what nuclear power do you know of that abides by Article 6 of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which nuclear disarmament is laid down as an obligation?
I can tell you that the EU Member States are doing the precise opposite, in that the United Kingdom and France are not merely failing to dispose of their nuclear weapons but are also developing new and powerful ones.
Nuclear weapons are always criminal in nature, and the testing of them always produces misleading and dangerous results; what is interesting is the differing treatment meted out to North Korea and Iran.
Let me spell it out: threats of military attack always have the opposite effect to that intended.
There are no such things as good nuclear weapons; they must be got rid of everywhere, and all nuclear tests are worthy of condemnation and must be stopped.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, this nuclear test has undoubtedly been highly detrimental to stability, peace and security.
We can, however, once again sound a warning regarding this issue and, of course, we can here and now condemn it.
It should be said that in this situation, of course, we should voice support and appreciation to all those who have reacted speedily to the specific situation brought about by North Korea's actions.
On the other hand, however, listening to the speeches by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana, I was not really convinced that the reasons for North Korea's actions have been thoroughly analysed.
Certainly, we are all aware that North Korea is a totalitarian Communist state, and that consequently plain common sense is perhaps not a characteristic of that regime.
On the other hand, however, I would just also like to ask some provocative questions that occurred to me a few days ago, reading the comments made in the media by Mr ElBaradei, head of the Atomic Energy Agency, our watchdog.
In something that I read by him, he said that in fact double standards lie at the root of the whole problem.
Here, the question I would like to put to our foreign ministers is whether they agree with these comments by Mr ElBaradei to the effect that the USA and the EU states conduct a hypocritical policy in relation to Israel on the one hand and to states such as Iran and North Korea on the other since, undoubtedly, Israel can possess weapons of mass destruction, Israel can have that defence system, but for other states which have not signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty such an option is forbidden.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the destabilising effects of Pyongyang's nuclear test last Monday are evident, particularly in North-East Asia, but also globally.
We are now facing two nuclear crises: an acute one in North-Korea, and an urgent one in Iran.
The question is whether both remain manageable without military means, and the attitude of two members of the UN Security Council, namely China and Russia, is of decisive importance in this respect.
What importance do Beijing and Moscow still attach to the Non-Proliferation Treaty?
Their conduct in the Security Council will tell.
I expect the Member States of the EU, sitting, as they do, on this high-level UN body, to insist on reminding China and Russia of their crucial responsibility in this.
Meanwhile, what matters is that the international community should keep tabs on Pyongyang's trade activities, especially the maritime routes.
Indeed, only last week, the North Korean regime announced that it is supplying technology, materials and nuclear weapons to other countries as it pleases.
That sort of explicit provocation cries out for a tough response from the international community.
It is, without a doubt, also up to the EU Member States to adopt tough sanctions that affect the North Korean leadership whilst sparing the emaciated and brainwashed people as much as possible.
I dare say that the Council and the Commission can imagine the enormous concern in Israel surrounding the reckless North-Korean nuclear test, which, at the same time, gives the Islamic Republic of Iran enormous encouragement to follow Pyongyang down the nuclear path, probably with actual technical and material back-up from Kim Jong-Il's terror regime.
The Council and the Commission claim to guarantee Israel's continued existence as a state; I urge them to translate this into political action in this twofold nuclear crisis.
(PL) Mr President, it is a good thing that the world is no longer divided between the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
It is a good thing that the former states of the Soviet bloc are today united in the European Union and NATO, or are on their way to membership.
United, Europe is stronger and in a better position to face the issue of the day - North Korean nuclear tests.
Fortunately, today even Russia has supported the voice of the civilised world and, like us, has condemned the nuclear tests, although some terrible events have been going on there such as the murder of journalists, the latest being Anna Politkovskaya.
North Korea is today one of the last blank spots on the map of the world as regards political, economic and democratic development.
What is actually the problem with North Korea?
Perhaps it is simply trying to attract our attention, and this is a desperate cry for help.
We are pleased to note that even China has condemned Korea's proposed arms race.
Today, more than ever in world history, all countries want economic development and to live in peace.
North Korea also needs food and prosperity more than it needs weapons.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, what has happened is particularly problematic and dangerous, and for two reasons.
The first is the obvious one that a dangerous weapon has got into the hands of a dictator who is well known for his lack of concern for human life, even for the lives of his country's people, and who is, then, prepared to take any risk, even that of their being wiped out.
This makes it extremely difficult to assess the precise degree of risk involved.
The second point to be made is that, if this test really does turn out to be successful and has been carried out using rocket technology, the region could see a new race to acquire and deploy weapons of mass destruction.
I do not know what debates there will be on that subject in South Korea, in Indonesia, in the Philippines or elsewhere.
It also needs to be borne in mind that there is an exchange of rocket technology going on between North Korea and Iran.
The Iranian Government is playing the hedgehog to our hare and it seems less and less likely that it is doing this only to secure its own peaceful use of nuclear energy - far from it, it is up to much more besides.
You, Mr Solana, have tried unstintingly to get things on track and conduct the talks accordingly.
There are particular dangers in this alliance, and that is why Iran is under a special responsibility to clear the decks once and for all and get stuck into some proper negotiations.
Mr Salafranca asked what sort of sanctions we are talking about.
We have to come up with some that really will have a serious impact on this man; if they affect the people, he will not be bothered, so what is needed is sanctions that hurt him personally, and they must be implemented and complied with.
What I will say to Mr PflÃŒger is that we should not now be seeking refuge in blaming one party or another for making mistakes at one time or another; the USA is not to blame for the fact that we have a deranged dictator to deal with.
We should ensure that this man is not given more escape routes by this House, for he is defying every rule made by the international community, and so we must compel him to return to the meetings of the Six, and, if they prove successful, he can be guaranteed security for his country, but this must be spelled out plainly if we are not to end up in 20 years' time with a world which will have 30 or 40 countries with nuclear weapons, and all set to destroy it.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, as a European Parliament, we have no choice but to associate ourselves with the universal condemnation of the nuclear tests apparently carried out by North Korea.
Our firm condemnation should be accompanied by a commitment by the European Union and the whole international community to try at this time to find a solution to this very grave problem by negotiation.
We must persuade this dictatorship to respect the rules of international coexistence.
Nevertheless, the international community has no choice: we must seriously find a way to achieve non-proliferation.
I should like to say to Mr Brok that this is not a matter of blaming anyone; but it is in my view impossible not to recognise that the weakening of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was clearly due also to the failure of the 2005 conference, was a fatal mistake.
I therefore consider that any prospective emergency solution must be based on the resumption of the negotiations for the revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
This is an obligatory task that the international community must carry out consistently, since only thus - although in another situation - shall we have the necessary clout to impose respect for this line of conduct upon the Pyongyang dictatorship.
It must be said that this pre-emptive Iraq war has, perversely, convinced dictators that possessing nuclear weapons is a sort of safe-conduct.
It is our job to convince world governments, including the rulers of authoritarian states, that this is absolutely not the case: otherwise we will not halt rearmament.
Finally, Mr Solana, I should like you to explain the differences between North Korea and Iran, since the two cases are too often associated with each other - yet I believe that there lies in the differences the details of a possible solution.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enough has been said about North Korea, but too little, I think, about how it can be an object lesson for us in Europe and for the world at large.
When North Korea, in 1962, embarked on its nuclear programme, it was of course described as 'civil', with talk of 'atoms for peace', 'we do not want bombs' and 'we do not want weapons'.
Not long afterwards, just as also happened with many other countries, it came to be suspected that this was not the case.
When Pyongyang, in 2003, after a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing, admitted that it was reprocessing for military purposes, it was established that what was described as a civil nuclear programme was being misused for military ends.
In 2005, it was reported from Pyongyang that the country was in possession of nuclear weapons, and the test was carried out at the beginning of this week.
The only thing I can say right now is that all those who argue in favour of more widespread civil use of nuclear energy are, at the same time, ensuring that it is also used for military purposes, and repeatedly paving the way for, among other things, the war in Iraq, which was claimed to be justified by the suspicion of misuse.
And what was the background to that?
The stuff had been exported to Iraq - for civilian purposes - from Europe.
Why, then, does Iran possess the technology, allegedly for civilian use?
There are those who represent Europe and claim that new reactor technologies could make it possible to clamp down on the military use of nuclear energy: they are lying, they know they are lying, and they should desist from further undermining the Non-Proliferation Treaty by making civil atomic technology more widely available.
Mr President, it is indeed chilling to think of the possible consequences of the totalitarian, Stalinist regime in North Korea now having a nuclear capacity.
Quite apart from the opportunity for direct aggressive use, an aspect which would alarm me is that North Korea may now be in the marketplace with crazed terrorist groups for the export of nuclear devices and technology.
North Korea is already heavily involved in, and indeed reliant upon, multiple illegal export businesses, including drugs and, especially, counterfeit currency, and this is on a massive scale.
If it were now to be in the marketplace for selling nuclear technology, then we all have very great reason to fear, for those in the terrorist world who would seek such technology know no constraints in their lust for killing.
I think it is a very alarming prospect that we could have rogue use by a rogue state selling nuclear technology to rogue elements.
It behoves the EU, and more particularly the more relevant United Nations, to be extremely robust and resolute in handling this crisis.
Mere condemnation is unlikely to be anything like enough.
I have no doubt that severe sanctions will be required.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, by carrying out this test, North Korea has demonstrated that it cares not a whit for the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty; its political leadership has thereby presented the international community with a serious and deliberate provocation, quite heedless of the fact that it would, by carrying out this test, be imperilling the peace and security of the region and of regions beyond it, and, finally, accepting the possibility of a new nuclear arms race being triggered within and beyond Asia.
It has also - and without any regard for its own people - taken on board the inevitability of the country being completely isolated.
We in this European Parliament must make our position abundantly and forcefully clear.
We must denounce in the most vigorous terms the carrying-out of this test; we must call upon North Korea's political leadership to return to the negotiating table in order to discuss the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in order to resume the six-country talks, and, ultimately, to bring about a peaceful solution to this temporary crisis.
This House must also call upon the international community and the Security Council to respond with greater firmness than they have to date.
It is quite simply unacceptable that the government of North Korea should use its own money and money sent to it from elsewhere to develop nuclear weapons at the same time as it relies on the world community to supply its starving population with food.
Further to what you said earlier, Mr President, I ask you to put out a written statement setting out this House's protest to the government of North Korea, to the international community, and to the Security Council, along with the demands that it makes of them.
We cannot accept that a second test should be carried out, thereby repeating something that was deserving of the most forthright condemnation the first time it occurred.
Mr President, this debate is about a nuclear test by the deplorable North Korean regime.
However, Mr Solana has stated on more than one occasion that this is only a 'possible' nuclear test.
In order to be clear about what we are discussing, would Mr Solana reassure us that he will be able to tell us in the very near future whether in fact it has taken place?
Mr Matsakis, that is in no way a point of order.
You have jumped the queue of speakers.
I would ask you not to abuse the Rules of Procedure in order to take the floor.
Mr President, North Korea's latest challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime is clear, and deserves to be condemned in the most forceful terms.
We all agree on that, but we also have to find the right, smart response, directed at the authorities responsible but sparing the population.
We should also stay focused on the ultimate objective, which is to achieve verifiable denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, as the foundation for lasting peace and stability there, given the tense armed stand-off across the demilitarised zone.
In the end, only diplomacy can achieve this goal.
With regard to a possible analysis of the motivation for this, I am sure the reasons are manifold.
The fact that it is misinterpreting the stance of the international community could be a result of the regime's total isolation, but it could well also be aimed at enforcing bilateral talks, which it has not yet achieved.
This week's developments will make it harder than ever to relaunch the six-party talks, but, in the medium to long term, this framework remains the best chance for a lasting solution.
I therefore sincerely hope that the resumption of talks will come sooner or later, even though the outlook now is not at all promising.
The European Union is not a direct participant in the six-party talks but, as a responsible global player with a clear stake in preserving regional stability, we have been profoundly supportive of this framework.
We have also signalled that we stand ready to play a more active role, if the six-party talks find it useful.
In the end, dialogue will be the answer to this very difficult, provocative situation.
North Korea's stated objective is to increase its own security; this goal could be achieved through the six-party process, which is what we would recommend.
Mr President, at the conclusion of this debate, there is a point which I think we have to underline.
Not a single Member of the European Parliament has spoken out against condemnation of North Korea's behaviour.
I think that is a very important conclusion to this important debate.
There may be some doubts about what to do next and how to deal with North Korea in the future, but the fact that the test has been a source of concern for the international community - and that the international community has taken responsibility for addressing the issue - has been supported by all the Members who have spoken in this debate.
I think we should be happy about that, because on issues of this nature and of this degree of importance, the responsibilities of Members of the European Parliament are on a par with those of the members of the international community.
There are different conclusions we can draw as to why the test was carried out and what the consequences are for the future.
Some of us have been to North Korea.
I have been there and talked to the country's leader on several occasions.
In Kuala Lumpur in July, I had the opportunity to talk with the Foreign Minister and he told me then that there was to be no return to the six-party talks.
So it was almost certain by then that something of this nature might happen.
We have to praise the Chinese, who have been leading the six-party talks and standing their ground.
This time, however, they unfortunately failed to convince North Korea, and instead of a meeting, a nuclear test has taken place.
I agree completely with those who have said that the Non-Proliferation Treaty should be reviewed.
Mrs Napoletano made that point most coherently and vehemently.
I share her concern about the fact that the last revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty was a failure.
It was a failure on the part of everybody involved in the revision, including the nuclear powers, some of which are Member States of the European Union.
The Non-Proliferation Treaty dates back to 1968.
We have gone through five revisions already and none of them has been able to address the difficulties and loopholes involved in that Treaty.
That must be said.
Let us also point out, however, that North Korea is not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
It abandoned the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, and therefore is under no obligation to comply with it.
It abandoned the Non-Proliferation Treaty because it did not want to admit inspectors, which is something that is mandatory under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
As we are seeing today, and as we will see in the future, the Non-Proliferation Treaty needs to be revised and updated.
As I said, the Treaty was drawn up in 1968.
That is a long time ago in historical terms, and therefore we have to make an effort.
The Europeans can plead that these regimes be adapted to the realities of today and not to the realities of yesterday.
I quite agree with that.
As far as sanctions are concerned, I do not think that the Security Council can just make a statement.
The Security Council has to act, otherwise other countries that are watching to see how the Security Council responds will draw the conclusion that the international community does not take an act of this nature seriously.
Remember what happened when Pakistan did it?
North Korea was watching for the international community's response to Pakistan's actions.
And probably part of today's situation is a reflection of what happened then.
That does not mean, of course, that any sanctions must target the people of North Korea, who have already suffered a great deal.
They suffer politically, they suffer economically, they suffer in their daily lives.
Therefore, other things have to be put in place and taken into account. I think the most important kinds of sanctions that should be put in place are sanctions which prevent proliferation by North Korea and prevent North Korea from passing nuclear technology on to other states which might be looking to acquire such technology so that they too can move in the same direction.
This is probably the most important step that the United Nations Security Council can take.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, everybody in this House will agree that diplomacy is what we like to do.
We Europeans like to solve complex, difficult problems with what we value most: our minds, our intelligence, our diplomacy.
And there is no doubt that this problem is indeed complex and difficult.
Before we proceed to the next item, Mr PflÃŒger has requested the floor to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 145 of our Rules of Procedure.
According to this Rule, Mr PflÃŒger, you may speak for three minutes, on the understanding that you may only make observations relating to opinions that have been attributed to you or correct observations that you may have made in the course of the debate.
(DE) Mr President, further to Mr Brok's statement, in which he implied that I had laid responsibility for North Korea's nuclear test at the door of the USA, any such insinuation is utterly false.
On the contrary, the issue - and Mrs Napoletano raised something similar - of those governments - the USA, but also, and to an increasing degree, the EU, among them - that believe they have to use nuclear weapons to defend themselves against attack is something that calls for serious discussion in this House.
For that reason, Mr Brok is quite wrong to make that insinuation.
Atomic warfare is threatened not only by the USA, but also by Jacques Chirac, and that is why this issue has to receive serious consideration, and why Mr Brok is wrong to imply what he did.
I fear that Mr Brok has not been able to hear you.
I hope that someone will pass on to him what was said.
(DE) Mr President, if I might be permitted to make a brief comment, it has to be said that those who are ready to give it out have to be willing to take it as well.
Mr PflÃŒger has made an accusation, to which I have responded, and he should accept that.
This is a political statement rather than an insinuation.
Mr Brok, nobody is going to take any measures against you.
You have made a comment, and Mr PflÃŒger has seen fit to respond to it, but that is the end of the story.
That concludes this item.
Informal summit in Lahti and EU-Russia relations following the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya (debate)
We shall proceed to the next item on the agenda.
This is the Council and Commission statements on the Preparation for the Informal Meeting of Heads of State or Government in Lahti and also, in accordance with the House's decision, relations between the European Union and Russia following the murder of Anna Politkovskaya.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank you sincerely for the opportunity to come here and discuss the informal summit of the Heads of State or Government in Lahti, to be held on 20 October.
We decided to hold the Lahti Summit because we want to give the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union the opportunity for an open and informal debate on two themes which are important for the Union's future and for economic success: innovation and external energy relations.
We need a firm, consistent policy on building a favourable environment for innovation and on energy issues.
In this way we will be able to improve conditions for economic growth and employment in the Union.
If the Union does something tangible to promote welfare and prosperity, we can also expect the Union to become more acceptable in the eyes of the people.
A consistent common policy on energy will at the same time strengthen the Union's credibility as an international player.
To guide the discussions at the Summit of the Heads of State or Government, two communications are being drafted by the Commission.
One is on external energy relations, and the other is on innovation policy.
The communications are to be released tomorrow, 12 October.
They are not meant to be approved at the meeting, but they indicate those questions which we want to address at Lahti.
Before the unofficial Summit at Lahti, an Informal Tripartite Social Summit will also be held on the Friday morning.
The way in which a European job market of 200 million employees will function and adapt to change is of crucial importance for Europe's future.
That is why the Social Partners have a vital role to play when the goal is to strengthen European competitiveness.
Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, has been invited to the dinner following the Summit of Heads of State or Government.
Discussions with the President are aimed at focusing on the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, including cooperation on energy.
The immense challenges which the Union faces in issues of energy - securing its supply, climate change, continual price rises, and recent crises - have prompted the development of a common energy policy for the EU.
With regard to securing the supply of energy, the ever-increasing dependence on energy imports is a particular challenge for the EU.
If no action is taken, it has been estimated that this dependence will grow from the present level of 50% to 70% over the next 20 years.
Before the Finnish presidential term started, the evolution of a common energy policy was discussed at two meetings of the European Council held at the beginning of the year.
During the Finnish Presidency, we will focus in particular on external energy relations, and these talks will prepare the ground for a large-scale energy debate, to be held next spring, to lead to the adoption of an energy policy action plan.
Although the Lahti talks will focus on external energy relations, obviously our objective for external relations cannot be looked at as a separate issue.
Among all the priority areas mentioned in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, it is close contact that stands out.
Other areas include the single market in energy, solidarity between the Member States, the diversification of energy sources, energy efficiency, renewables and innovations in the domain of energy.
In external energy relations, the Member States need to reach a common understanding and establish a view concerning what sort of strategy should be adopted to make progress in relations with countries outside the EU, and what sort of common outward-looking goals the EU should have.
This means that the Member States must be able to commit jointly to an agreed way forward that also covers bilateral relations, and to speak with one voice in these contexts too.
In committing to common goals, the Union will also be better prepared to deal with changes in the world's energy markets.
At the Lahti energy talks we will be exchanging views on how external energy relations might be developed in the immediate future.
The discussions are intended to focus mainly on three themes.
The first is the principles on which EU-Russian energy relations should be based, and how they should be implemented.
The second is closer relations with strategically important third countries.
The third is more effective gathering of data as a basis for decision-making with regard to a common energy policy.
Russia, whose share of imports of both oil and gas is 25%, is the Union's most strategically important energy partner.
In all strategic partnerships, including the one with Russia, it is important to find something which is in the interests of both parties in order to develop the partnership.
The common interest in EU-Russia energy relations is obvious.
The EU is dependent on imports of energy from Russia, and Russia needs long-term contracts for energy exports at market prices, as well as Western investment in the basic production of energy.
Opening up the market on both sides will be a key factor.
The talks by the EU Heads of State or Government will also prepare the ground for discussions with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, later that evening, one central theme of which is energy issues.
The purpose is to communicate to Russia the EU's objective of a binding framework agreement on energy, which would take account of the interests of both parties, reciprocity and an impartial operational environment.
The talks will also certainly make reference to the challenges that the EU and Russia have in common, such as energy efficiency, where both sides stand to gain.
Extending internal energy principles to the EU's neighbouring regions, and the strategic development of relations with important third countries, are goals we must aspire to if we want to secure the supply of energy.
80% of the world's oil resources are to be found in the regions surrounding the Union.
There is a whole range of instruments available to improve relations with third countries.
It includes the Neighbourhood Policy Action Programmes, the agreement on energy cooperation, bilateral agreements and regional ...
(The President cut off the speaker due to technical problems)
Energy policy must be one key element in the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The European Union needs enough information to practise a more coherent energy policy.
In addition, it must be able to respond to external problem situations and crises connected with energy.
The Union should establish a system which will help bolster cooperation between the Member States and the institutions, and enhance solidarity in issues connected with energy.
The other main topic of the Summit of Heads of State or Government is the development of a policy on innovation.
It must be possible to improve the way in which research work done in Europe is exploited in the shape of commercial goods and services.
Moreover, the Union must be able to introduce new technology as efficiently as they do in the countries that are our competitors.
If we stick with the way we do things now, the innovation gulf between us and our major trading partners will only grow.
Production, mainly in the growing economies, is in ever greater competition with Europe, not only in industry but also in the service sectors.
China and India train highly educated people for the job market far more than is the case in the EU.
The markets in the growing economies, however, also mean that there is a huge potential for exports from the Union.
Success can come just from an ability to create something new - in other words, innovation.
In an open market, the best commodities succeed.
It is impossible to stay ahead unless there is continued investment in research and product development.
The Member States of the Union are committed to increasing future investment in research and development by virtue of the decisions taken earlier on.
It is nevertheless vitally important to ensure that Europe can make good use of investment so that research work leads to new, better and commercially exploitable goods and services.
The intention at the Lahti Summit is to mention issues and challenges which call for joint action on the part of the Union.
The aim is to create an environment where innovations can emerge and be adopted efficiently.
In its position on the Lisbon Strategy, the European Parliament has also highlighted the importance of a policy on innovation.
To support effective innovation, there would need to be created an EU-wide strategy on immaterial rights.
Immaterial rights are of major importance for a company's success and competitiveness.
One fundamental question, for example, is the quality of patents, which is a basic principle for a workable, reliable patents system.
The Presidency believes that Europe must have a cost-effective patents system, but one which adheres to the notion of quality, regardless of the choice of alternative that will form the basis for developing this system.
If we can develop the patents system further, companies will be guaranteed considerable savings on the costs of patents, which can only encourage innovation and research in Europe.
Improved collaboration between universities and the business world is a precondition of a successful policy on innovation.
The intention is to create a new network-based European Institute of Technology, and the Commission will be putting forward a proposal on this next week.
The partnership project between science, business and training will be characterised by excellence.
The priority will be the promotion of innovation.
The Presidency believes that the European Institute of Technology will allow Europe to exploit existing opportunities in companies and the scientific community more effectively.
Furthermore, cooperation between the private and public sector needs to be stepped up in order to promote competitiveness.
Europe has seen the creation of the so-called Technology Platforms, company-based strategic research initiatives, which are excellent examples of partnership between the public and private sectors.
To their credit, companies have indicated their willingness to invest in their selected platforms, and a similar commitment is now needed from public bodies financing research.
It is very important for innovation for the creation of European standards to be speeded up.
Without a common European standard, many innovations can remain unrealised.
Where, for example, would the European mobile phone market have been without the GSM standard?
The creation of pan-European technical norms for mobile phones in practice made it possible for the world's leading player in this sector to come from Europe.
On the other hand, if national standards alone had been adopted as a basis for developing mobile phones, there would not have been the same sort of major, geographically huge success.
The speedy adoption of open, compatible standards is one of the keys to success in business.
It will also have clear benefits for the consumer.
At the same time, it will strengthen our competitive status and be a response to rapid technological development, so that the technical development solutions realised in Europe can genuinely compete with development work done elsewhere in the world.
Moving on, illegal immigration is a problem that affects the whole of the European Union.
That is why we need to find solutions together.
Solidarity is at its most conspicuous in the effective implementation of concrete measures.
At the Lahti Summit we will be discussing illegal immigration, which has become a particular problem in the Mediterranean and the southern parts of the Union.
For us, it is important that the Union can establish a comprehensive, effective policy on immigration control, one which takes account of issues relating to both illegal and legal immigration, including integration.
We must use the existing instruments effectively and think of new ways to support countries of origin and transit in their efforts to prevent illegal immigration.
Immigration issues have been on the agenda at all the Justice and Home Affairs Councils.
The matter is also to be discussed next week at the informal dinner of the Ministers for Development Co-operation.
The intention too is that the work of the Justice and Home Affairs Councils should serve as a basis for decisions for the European Council in December which could help the European Union to respond effectively to the problem of illegal immigration.
At a working lunch in Lahti, the serious situation in Sudan and Darfur will also be addressed.
As I said at the beginning, following the informal summit of EU Heads of State or Government, the participants will dine in Lahti with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
This will be an excellent opportunity for an informal discussion on the development of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia.
The spectrum of our association is very broad, and it contains elements which could serve to develop the partnership further.
An example of this is international issues.
The international policy agenda this autumn includes matters where cooperation between us is very important, such as the Middle East, Iran and Kosovo.
Energy is an important element in the strategic partnership, and we are expecting to hear President Putin's assessment of developments in his country's energy sector and the energy partnership between the Union and Russia.
Mr President, we were all shocked to hear the news about the death of the well-known journalist and defender of freedom of expression, Anna Politkovskaja.
We are calling for a thorough investigation into this horrendous crime and for its perpetrators to be brought to justice, something which is of particular importance for Russia's progress towards the rule of law.
Not only is Politkovskaja's death an appalling incident and a loss for her next of kin, but it is also a setback for freedom of speech in Russia.
Furthermore, the frank and robust talks that are going on between the European Union and Russia against this background of recent events are a valuable exercise.
As I have already said, the strategic partnership is a framework within which all the important issues will be discussed.
Mr President, the informal European Council next week comes at a good time.
I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency, Prime Minister Vanhanen and all his team for their very important contribution.
Since the Minister made such a comprehensive presentation on behalf of the Presidency, I will focus on innovation, energy policy and immigration.
I will also make a few remarks about relations between the European Union and Russia.
These are all issues in respect of which the challenges we face require not just a national response, but a European response; challenges which show why, more than ever, a strong European Union is necessary, and why we need the Union to equip Europeans for globalisation.
I welcome the Presidency's decision to focus on innovation.
Finland is a prime example of how innovation can boost economic growth.
However, it is more than that.
It is only by unlocking people's imaginations that we can tackle the major issues facing us today, such as climate change, social exclusion, demographic change and unemployment.
Even though I know you know the figures, they are worth repeating.
European Union spending on research is equivalent to 1.9% of its GDP, whereas the United States currently spends 3% of its GDP.
It is indicative that most of the recent Nobel Prize winners come from or work in the United States.
In Europe about half of all researchers are employed by business.
In the United States, that figure stands at over 80%.
The truth is that Europe is falling behind in terms of innovation and research.
The status quo is not an option: we need to do more in this matter.
We urgently need a strategic approach which focuses on each link in the innovation chain, from the birth of new ideas and knowledge right through to their exploitation and marketing in the economic sphere.
The communication which the Commission will present at the informal summit in Lahti sets out such an approach.
It pinpoints the weak links in the chain and puts forward solutions.
We need financing, we need the right intellectual property framework to bring the right rewards and we need to tackle obstacles to innovation sector by sector.
Above all, we need to start with a strong political message of commitment: innovation deserves encouragement, and we need a European approach for it.
Size matters on this issue.
One of the big differences between us and the United States is that we have no pan-European institutions for innovation and research.
The United States is much more committed to a real global approach.
There are great institutions supporting innovation throughout the United States, not just in one or two states.
Until now, we had nothing in Europe.
Now we have the European Research Council and we are proposing the establishment of a European institute of technology.
We are proposing a network system to lend a real European dimension and a real European mission to those institutions.
That is why we are insisting on this approach.
That is the importance of the European institute of technology.
It will bring the private and public sectors closer together for cutting-edge research, become a centre of international excellence, bring together the top brains, provide a stream of top class PhDs and promote spin-offs of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises.
In short, it can become a symbol of Europe's ability to work together and innovate.
We have been developing the finer details of the EIT over recent months and we will bring forward a detailed proposal next week.
I am confident that the Heads of State and Government and the parliamentarians here in the European Parliament will look at it in the spirit in which it is designed: yes, it is something a little different, but something which can provide an example of Europe taking a fresh direction and finding new ways to work together.
One of the fields in which I think we as European leaders can give a mission to a European institute of technology is that of energy and climate change.
When we have a problem that we need help to solve, we should ask the best scientists, the best brains on our continent.
Energy is one of the most important challenges we have today.
Let me now turn to the issue of energy and let me make it plain: we need to create a truly European energy policy, not 25 energy policies.
It is absurd in the 21st century to go on with 25 or 27 energy policies.
We need a truly European energy policy.
The problems we face - high energy prices, climate change, increasing dependence on imported hydrocarbons - are global and European problems.
They need European solutions.
National solutions will not be enough.
At Hampton Court last year, European Union leaders agreed to develop a common approach.
In our Green Paper of March 2006, the Commission defined clear objectives for a European energy policy, long-term sustainability, security of energy supply and economic competitiveness.
The Member States have endorsed our approach, and the reaction from stakeholders to our Green Paper has been overwhelmingly positive.
The next step is a strategic energy review which the Commission will propose at the very beginning of next year.
I look forward to reading the European Parliament's report on it.
It is obvious that we need coherence between the internal and external aspects of energy policy.
We clearly need an effective internal market in energy.
Having 25 or 27 different energy mini-markets is not the answer to the European energy challenges.
However, we must link internal and external policy.
Our paper for Lahti will look at the three external challenges: Russia, which I will return to; developing our energy relations with our neighbours; and creating a network to deal with external energy shocks.
It is essential to build up energy cooperation with strategically important supply and transit countries.
This is already happening with initiatives such as the new Energy Community Treaty and the memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation with Ukraine.
We need to extend the principles of the internal energy market gradually throughout our neighbourhood.
We also need to join the different areas of expertise which exist around Europe to create a more effective network to deal with external energy shocks.
Of course, in the medium term, the best way to cope with energy shocks is through diversity: diversity of energy sources, of country of origin and of country of transit.
Indeed, we need to mainstream energy to make it a major focus of our relations with partners worldwide.
Finally, energy efficiency is another crucial element of this strategy.
I can announce to you today that next week Commissioner Piebalgs - the Commissioner for Energy - and I will propose an ambitious action plan to fulfil our commitment to save 20% of primary energy use by 2020.
Naturally, with 25% of the oil and gas consumed in the European Union coming from Russia, energy cooperation with Russia is crucial.
The President-in-Office of the Council just explained why it is important.
We must have a reinforced energy partnership with Russia.
Such a partnership must be based on reciprocity, transparency, non-discrimination and openness to competition, including a level playing field for upstream and downstream investment.
This is the only way to have a stable and secure platform for our energy relationship.
The meeting with President Putin will be a chance to deliver a clear and hopefully coherent message from European Union leaders.
We see three long-term objectives in our relations with Russia: we want to see a functioning democracy and market economy in which Russia lives up to the international commitments it has undertaken; we want to see a broad and strategic EU-Russia relationship based on interdependence - Russia needs the European Union and the European Union also needs Russia - and we want to enhance our cooperation with Russia on international issues.
When we talk about effective multilateralism, this is what we mean.
We have set our goal of a wide-ranging agreement to follow the current partnership and cooperation agreement.
There are mutual benefits to be realised in areas such as investment and market-opening, as well as in energy and energy efficiency.
We both have so much to gain from a real partnership.
I also take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy with the family of Anna Politkovskaya, who was so brutally murdered last week.
I want to pay tribute to her relentless pursuit of truth.
She was a great defender of freedom of expression in Russia.
(Applause)
I sincerely hope that the perpetrators of this heinous crime will be found and brought to justice.
Another point we are going to address is that of immigration.
The massive arrival of illegal immigrants at the frontiers of the European Union's southern Member States is a European problem that requires a European solution.
In November 2006, the Commission presented a communication with a series of practical proposals for the European Union to respond to this challenge.
On that basis, the European Council adopted a global approach to migration, outlining in detail how to respond in its internal and external policies.
In less than a year we have seen the start of a lot of practical action: joint operations in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic under the coordination of the borders agency, Frontex; enhanced cooperation among the law-enforcement services of the Member States; better coordination of the work of the immigration liaison offices in Africa; and dialogue with key African countries of origin and transit, both bilaterally and multilaterally.
For the first time, Member States are working together in joint operations protecting the European Union's external borders under the coordination of Frontex.
However, let us be frank: it is not enough; much more is needed to tackle the illegal flows effectively.
In order to strengthen the European Union's response capacity, it is of the utmost importance that all Member States of the Union work together in a spirit of solidarity, not least to assist those Member States that are, let us say, in the front line.
With a view to the informal European Council to be held in Lahti on 20 October, I have written personally to the Heads of State and Government underlining the need for such solidarity.
Of course, the ideal would be to have already established the Community instruments, but we have not got them yet.
Of course, the ideal would be to have a European migration policy.
It is absurd to have 25 or 27 migration policies in an area in which people can move around freely, because decisions taken by one country have a direct effect on the other countries.
But before we have a true Community method to tackle these issues, we at least expect Member States to cooperate well among themselves.
(Applause)
We believe this is also a practical example of European solidarity.
We also need to work much more intensively with the countries of origin and transit.
The implementation of the action plan agreed in Rabat in July is a key priority.
The Commission will work hard to ensure proper implementation in close partnership with the countries concerned.
Let us also be frank about this.
Security matters are not enough.
The solution to this problem will come only with our support for sustainable development in Africa.
By the way, I think we have to engage in a high-level dialogue with African countries.
Is it not strange that the European Union has dialogue with Asia and Latin America at the level of Heads of State and Government, but not with Africa?
Is it not about time now for Europe to make a commitment to establishing a high-level dialogue with Africa?
I believe we have the right and the duty to do so.
That was the message I took recently to our counterparts in the African Union Commission in Addis Ababa.
That is why we are also actively engaged - via our cooperation with our African partners - in looking collectively at this issue.
In European terms, we also need a European Union decision-making process.
When there are urgent and serious problems, the European Union needs to be able to react appropriately.
This means using the bridging clause in Article 67 of the Treaty.
We cannot deny ourselves the means to deliver effective action.
To conclude, the informal European Council meeting in Lahti provides a good opportunity to take stock of the current European Union actions in the fields I have outlined and in several other fields as well.
We are looking for a renewed commitment from the Heads of State and Government to deliver solutions to the real and pressing problems of the citizens of the European Union, and to deliver a Europe of results so that we can have more confidence to solve some of the very important problems in our Union.
Let me give you a final thought.
A week ago I was in Darfur.
Amidst the terrible conditions experienced by the people there, I saw something that I resolved to tell my friends back in Brussels: in the NGOs and other humanitarian organisations, there are so many young Europeans, so far from their homes, putting their lives at risk every day to help Africans.
This is the kind of Europe of which I think we should be proud; a Europe that is ready to deliver solidarity and help, showing great courage.
That is the kind of Europe I believe we all want: an open, outward-looking, generous Europe.
That is the Europe we should strive for.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, Mr Barroso, we are deeply distressed and outraged by the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya, and we have many questions about the reasons that led to this crime being carried out.
It is vital that the Russian authorities get right to the bottom of this tragedy as soon as possible, and we expect the Council to send out the message that it will stand firm in the face of this fresh blow to a profession that pays a heavy cost each year for carrying out its work.
Allow me to pay tribute, through Anna Politkovskaya, to all of the journalists who risk their lives throughout the world in order to defend freedom of expression, to which we are so attached.
The Informal Meeting to be held in Lahti on 20 October will provide another opportunity to raise some recurring issues, such as competitiveness, innovation, immigration and energy policy.
I fear that competitiveness and innovation will meet the same fate as sustainable development: everyone talks about it, everyone subscribes to it, but when it comes to taking concrete action, good principles go out the window.
There are numerous examples of this.
I could cite that of Galileo, the usefulness of which was so highly praised, but when it came to planning the budget for it, all of a sudden it was no longer a priority.
With regard to transport infrastructure and rail links, we recommend their being completed for the sake of competitiveness, but we sacrifice them on the budgetary altar.
What can be said about the much-hyped ambitions in relation to research when it is clear what kind of support is actually given to innovation?
I am thinking not only about financial aid, but also about the application of the laws that encourage investment in Europe and that clear the way for our SMEs to export outside European territory.
I therefore expect a great deal from the Council's commitment to the European Institute of Technology, to which our President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, is, I know, very attached, as, I might add, is our Parliament.
Indeed, it is no longer strong commitments that we expect from the Council, but concrete action.
Competitiveness is also the outcome of the regulations that we adopt, which must represent opportunities and not constraints.
I expect the European Commission to take these principles as its starting point when it presents its 2007 legislative programme and the Council to follow that trend.
I expect Parliament to have the courage to reject proposals that only deal with big ideas without doing anything specific with them.
Policies, too, must be competitive, and thus effective.
Competitiveness also means striking a trade balance worldwide.
Anti-dumping measures are certainly along these lines, but could we not have other strong political decisions, such as a demand for equivalent quality standards for all goods imported into the European Union?
Finally, on the energy issue, I hope that the discussions with President Putin will enable Europe to implement all of the structures necessary to guarantee the independence of its energy supply.
It must also be able to equip itself with renewable energy sources so as to guarantee the independence of its energy supply from a nuclear energy perspective.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and to you, Mr President of the Commission, for your very exhaustive description of what you intend to discuss at the informal summit.
As so often happens when summits are in the offing, we have high hopes of this one.
Mrs LehtomÃ€ki and Mr Barroso have told us marvellous things about innovation, immigration, energy policy, the partnership with Russia, and about Darfur.
The whole range of our concerns has been put before us in no more than some forty minutes, and I now find it difficult to respond to all these things with the necessary brevity.
If, after the summit, we get a forty-minute summary of what happened there that is just as closely packed with achievements and decisions reached, then I will be a happy man, but I have, at the back of my mind, the fear that we will have the same experience that we almost always have, for we are good at describing our problems, but find solving them a bit more difficult.
The President of the Commission is right to say that investment in innovation is indispensable, not only here, but in all the Member States, and particularly in researching and developing energy-efficient technology.
One of the crucial long-term decisions we will have to take over the coming years has to do with the question of whether achieving greater energy efficiency will enable us to cope with the exponential growth in demand for energy around the world.
It is worthy of note that enhanced energy efficiency also involves us abandoning an economy founded on extravagance by means of such things as technological developments and investment in research that helps to ensure that the products we are able to develop reduce energy consumption rather than increasing it.
Europe is the continent that must lead, and give good example, in this area, and that is why you are quite right to say that our policy on innovation must give priority to innovation in energy.
My second point is that both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council are right to highlight immigration as a problem we must get on top of, but the way in which this problem is currently being addressed does nothing to solve it, and I am much obliged to Mr Barroso for describing that so graphically.
I do not want to go over again what others have rightly pointed out, namely that sustainable development in what we call the Third World addresses the causes of the immigration problem, but the external borders in southern and eastern Europe are external borders in which we all share; those who manage to enter our territory are free to move anywhere within the Schengen area.
Member States cannot then say that they are going to arrange these matters for themselves or that the most they will do is to address them at the intergovernmental level, but that they will not allow any of their powers to be transferred to Brussels, and that I say not least for the benefit of my own country's government, with which you, Mr Barroso, met today.
Germany too must understand that this sort of thing is just not on; this is a lesson that must be learned, even by the German minister of the interior.
Let me add something to what has been said about our policy on Russia.
The policy that we, together with Russia, are currently engaged in adopting will be the basis for a renewable cooperation agreement with that country.
It is obvious that discussions such as that we are having today, in relation to the case of Anna Politkovskaya, will always be emotional affairs.
Mr Saryusz-Wolski, for example, who is listening to me with such attentiveness, is one of those who always get particularly worked up by anything to do with Russia, and so what I have to say, I say not least to him.
Is there not a great deal going on in Russia that is not to our liking?
To be sure, we want - as you have said - a functioning democracy and market economy to prevail in Russia, but there is one thing about which we must not be in doubt.
Quite apart from the issue of whether we are further entrenching or extending Russian democracy, Russia is - even as it is constituted today - an indispensable strategic partner for the European Union.
So let me say that we must indeed talk about the state of democracy in Russia, but we cannot talk down to that country in a lofty and schoolmasterly way.
It has to be clear to us that Russia will, without a doubt, be needed as a partner in energy policy, and above all as a partner in the resolution of conflicts around the globe - be they in Iran, in the Middle East or anywhere else - and that it will try to cooperate as our equal and with equal rights, and that equal status is something that we must concede to Russia just as we do to all our other partners.
So, then, while I regard dialogue about democracy as indispensable, it must be founded on a realistic assessment of the situation.
I much appreciate the President of the Commission's reference to Darfur.
What that situation shows - and not for the first time - is how vital it is that the European Union, by being the peacemaker that it is, brings people together across religious, ethnic and national boundaries, and, by means of that integration, fosters peace.
That is something for the export market, and if you let the wider world have it, that is something to be welcomed.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Madam President-in-Office, Liberals and Democrats wish you well for Lahti.
A Presidency in the second half of the year is never easy, and informal talks with 25 Heads of Government round a table are difficult to imagine.
I bet you cannot even fit them all into one sauna!
On your agenda there will be important matters as diverse as energy, innovation and migration, although, as you say, the real story will be entertaining the President of the Russian Federation.
We believe that the Member States must stand foursquare behind the Union flag in condemning attacks on freedom and private property in a country where one more candle of independent thought has just been extinguished.
Mr Putin has clearly studied Machiavelli's dictum: 'Princes who have achieved great things have been those who have given their word lightly, who have known how to trick men with their cunning and who have overcome those abiding by honest principles.'
While President Putin concedes that his country is tarnished by the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, he fails to add that 40 other journalists have been murdered in his country in recent years.
(Applause)
Liberals and Democrats pay tribute to Anna Politkovskaya.
Among her criticisms of the state of freedom and democracy in Russia, she wrote, in a book called Putin's Russia: Life in a failing democracy, 'Yes, stability has come to Russia.
It is a monstrous stability under which nobody seeks justice in law courts, which flaunt their subservience and partisanship, nobody in his or her right mind seeks protection from the institutions entrusted with maintaining law and order because they are totally corrupt.
Lynch law is the order of the day.
The President himself,' she continues, 'has set an example by wrecking our major oil company, YUKOS, after having jailed its chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Putin considered Khodorkovsky to have slighted him personally, so he retaliated.'
Madam President-in-Office, Russia needs the European Union just as much as the European Union needs Russia.
They need our market for oil and gas.
We are their biggest customer.
So let our Heads of State and Government talk to Mr Putin about oil and gas, but do not have them mince their words about an increasingly dictatorial regime.
Let them also prepare for life without dependency on Russia through joined-up thinking on energy and the environment.
In a week in which Al Gore has promoted his film on the 'inconvenient truth' of climate change, our energy policy must in any case reflect an urgent need for a change of direction.
Lahti is a follow-up to Hampton Court a year ago, where leaders approved plans to create a European energy market, raise competitiveness and educational levels and tackle the growing pressure of migration.
In the past 12 months, the urgency for action in all those areas has increased.
The Commission has rightly identified the needs, but Member States continue to deny the means.
The Commission proposes a genuine internal market in energy, unbundling networks as we did with telecoms, creating an observatory to monitor stocks, developing a more sustainable energy mix, making energy savings.
We welcome these proposals, but we need the Council to get on with them.
Mr Barroso wants a European institute for technology.
Get on with it, if you can raise the money!
Migration is presented, on the one hand, with data showing we need to encourage migration of labour and skills, and, on the other, with media headlines stoking populist fears of uninvited guest workers taking away jobs and benefits.
To succeed the Council must act effectively, for which it needs the provisions of the Article 43 'bridging clause'.
I hope the Finnish Presidency will continue to press for this.
We support the Finnish Presidency and its modest and pragmatic approach to EU business.
However, Madam President-in-Office, we fear you are being eclipsed already by the forthcoming German Presidency.
Issues are being postponed; foreign leaders are courting Mrs Merkel.
The German Foreign Ministry is taking the lead.
Let us not raise excessively high expectations of what Germany can deliver, nor lower our expectations of what the Finnish Presidency can achieve.
The Presidency needs to show that, in the words of the Monty Python song, 'Finland has it all'!
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Anna Politkovskaya, visited this House on two occasions, at the invitation of our group, to report to us on the situation in Chechnya and the state of play as regards freedom of speech in Russia.
I really do think it is high time that we named names.
Someone said that the guilty parties should be condemned; well, you will be dining with one of them tonight - with President Putin himself.
Let us make an end of this constant self-deception; Russia is at present subject to a system engaged in the day-by-day curtailment of freedom of opinion, with newspapers being bought up and then disappearing from the scene, and their owners thrown into jail.
That is going on day in and day out.
(Applause)
Mr Schulz is right; we do indeed need Russia, but we have to be aware of the fact that the Russia with which we have to deal is a Russia that does not shrink back from taking people out of circulation, and I can predict how its story is going to turn out, for it has already been written down in a book that is about to come out, entitled 'The Day of the Opritschnik' by Vladimir Sorokin, and I urge you to read it.
In it, the author describes, from the point of view of an officer in the security services, the things that go on in Russia today, and we will read it: we will read about how some small-time crook, some small-time drug pusher gets caught, gets sentenced to 'life', gets taken off to some prison on the other side of the Urals, and then they will say, 'Look, we've caught one!'
As for those, though, at whose behest the crime was committed, those who gave the money - as we have seen with the forty other journalists and the newspapers - well, nobody will ask, because nobody will be interested, for - as we saw yesterday evening on German television when Chancellor Merkel met him - we need Vladimir Putin.
And why do we need Vladimir Putin?
We need him because we - by which I mean Germany, with its Grand Coalition of red and green that has entered into an impossible treaty with Russia and avoided the Europeanisation of energy policy - because we have established a link with Russia.
Even so, names do need to be named, and then, perhaps, we might get somewhere.
Yes, of course there have to be negotiations with Russia, but I am firmly convinced that now - yet again - is the time for us to display the necessary attitude; yes, of course we can laugh when Schalke 04 is bought by Gazprom, when Chelsea is bought by Roman Abramovich; all these things we can find amusing, just as we think it is terrific that Mr Putin is with us everywhere and turns up to watch Federal League matches every Saturday; the only problem is that the price we are paying is the price that the people of Russia have paid and the price that the people of Chechnya have paid, namely the price that you pay for doing no more than cohabiting with one of the most dangerously oppressive systems, smiling sweetly at it and otherwise looking the other way.
I find it simply shameful that we look the other way.
We say how appalled we are, and then we come back down to earth and say, 'Oh, Vladimir, do you think you have a problem?
What makes you do these things?
But it is good that you are paying your bills more promptly.'
So that is all right, then.
That is our attitude.
All I can say, by way of summary, is that we will resolve the energy issues, the immigration issue, and all the other issues only if - and this is where Mr Watson has got it right - we, at some point, speak frankly about what the problems are and say honestly about what we will or will not do.
We must, I think, negotiate with Putin, but that does not mean that we have to dine with him like mates together.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Madam President, Minister LehtomÃ€ki, the Finnish government wanted to hold an EU summit in Finland, probably with the purpose of spreading the glad tidings of Finland's excellent competitiveness to others.
The passage of time has brought other matters to the agenda, and, to Finland's delight, the Russian President will be attending the evening meal organised for the Heads of State or Government.
The matter of investigating the murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaja should then be raised as a test that the rule of law in Russia actually works.
(Applause)
In the name of the new liberalism, the EU's right-wing forces want to break and crush good educational systems and the good social security system.
I call on the Finnish government to tell these EU new liberals that public services are the secret of Finland's excellent competitiveness.
Please tell them too that the advanced liberalisation of the electricity markets in the Nordic countries has raised the price of electricity, and that the state, and not the market, has to take responsibility for energy security.
Do not harp on about the Lisbon objectives.
The EU will not be the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010.
An economy built on dreams reminds one of Mr Khrushchev, who 50 years ago in the UN promised that the Soviet Union would surpass the standard of living in the United States of America within 10 years.
Our group fails to understand the move by the Finnish Government to ratify the defunct EU Constitution in Finland.
To my government, I would say this: you are up against alien forces, the same way you were when you insisted that the EU should decide on a common penal code with a qualified majority.
That way, you would be wiping out the historical memory of nations.
I send my greetings to the Prime Minster, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki.
Hold your head high for the rest of the presidential term.
You could even try to think for yourself sometimes, instead of always being a kind of warm-up act for the next presidency, a far bigger one than Finland.
To Mr Barroso, I would say that in several cases there is no proper legal basis for implementing his very ambitious ideas, although there is certainly room in the world for ambitious ideas.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the President-in-Office and President Barroso for their presentations here today.
I will deal with the easy questions first of all and then go on to the more difficult ones facing the summit.
We have a right to tell the Russians that we demand standards of them with regard to freedom of expression, freedom of accountability and the freedom and the security of human life when people question and challenge authority.
As Mr Watson rightly said, 40 journalists have been killed in Russia in the last two and a half years.
Interestingly enough, not one person has been arrested in connection with those 40 deaths; not one person has been convicted in connection with those 40 deaths.
If we are to expect that suddenly action will be taken because of the horrific gunning-down of Anna Politkovskaya in recent days, I think we are like ostriches sticking our heads in the sand.
Only when real engagement and dialogue takes place with Russia can we guarantee a relationship of equality between the EU and Russia, despite our dependence on Russia for energy, despite Russia's dependence on us for markets, and despite the interaction that there is in geopolitical terms between eastern Europe and Russia.
I think that what we really have to do is show courage now in laying down clear standards and guidelines of what we expect from our partners with regard to their relationships.
This is not just about the death of the journalist, horrific as that is; it is not just about Chechnya; it is also about Russian treatment of Georgia in the recent past and what they have done.
While the Russian authorities condemn Chechen resistance fighters on the one hand, on the other hand they support 'resistance fighters' in parts of Georgia.
They have put the economy of Georgia under tremendous strain, not just in economic terms but also in human terms, deporting hundreds of thousands of Georgians from Russia back to their home country, denying them access to education and to businesses which they legitimately own and control within Russia.
All for the sake of 'clarification'.
My next point touches upon the European institute for technology, research and development and what is required for that.
I am a great supporter of President Barroso's plan with regard to the necessity for Europe to take the lead and take the leap from the 20th century into the 22nd century with regard to what we need to do for research and development and investment in technology.
But first, before that can happen, we must ensure that the intellectual property rights and patenting rights are protected to allow for innovation to take place, to allow for investments to be made.
It is easy to build the structure of a building to house an institute of technology.
It is more difficult to put in place the legislative framework to allow for this to happen.
Finally, Madam President - if I may be allowed the same latitude as the other group chairmen were allowed - when we speak about energy and common energy policy and energy needs, one of the biggest opportunities that we are denying ourselves is the renewable energy that we can create and grow on our land.
When farmers are suffering because of bad deals made by Peter Mandelson at the WTO talks, or when agriculture is under threat, then we need to invest in renewable energy.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Madam President, Anna Politkovskaja's Danish friend cannot obtain a visa for Russia, and I have asked Mr Solana to raise this matter at a suitable opportunity.
I turn now to the Finnish Presidency.
I love Finland.
I sit on chairs, and put flowers in vases designed by Alvar Aalto and use a Nokia phone.
I have had respect for Finnish politicians ever since I was a young man and I have cooperated with your foreign minister in the EEA and with your prime minister in the Convention.
Now, I have to ask with some dismay: what has happened to Finland?
How on earth can Finnish politicians persuade themselves to ratify a Constitution that has been rejected in France and the Netherlands and therefore no longer exists?
Is it true that it is members of the Centre party's parliamentary group who are to vote against their own conviction?
The great majority of Finnish voters are opposed to the Constitution, yet you force it through without a referendum.
Shame on you!
Instead of submitting to Mr Vanhanen's whip and adopting a new policy of Finlandisation whereby Finland turns itself into Germany's seventeenth state, you should start afresh with a new directly elected Convention, referendums in all the countries and a document that the electorate can happily vote for.
Finland currently has 7.8% of the votes necessary for achieving a blocking minority in the Council of Ministers, so the other countries are obliged to listen to Finland.
That is precisely why we have a valuable culture of consensus in the Council of Ministers.
The Constitution would introduce double majority voting, with the result that we should be voting on the basis of population figures.
That would cause the Finnish portion of a blocking minority to fall from 7.8% to 3.3%, so there would no longer be any need to listen to Finland and other small EU countries.
The German share of the vote would correspondingly increase from 32% to 51%.
Germany and Turkey would thus be able to determine the speed at which an enlarged EU developed.
A double majority would destroy the EU's culture of consensus, and the removal of the national Commissioners would make it difficult to get the EU to operate properly on a day-to-day basis.
Nokia would no doubt get by, but the many small and medium-sized companies and local authorities would miss having contact through the Finnish cabinet when there was no longer a Finnish Commissioner at the table.
Moreover, the rotation system would only, of course, continue until, true enough, the turn of the wheel replaced France with Malta.
Stick to one Commissioner for each Member State and to the culture of consensus in the Council of Ministers instead of adopting the rejected draft Constitutional Treaty.
(NL) Madam President, as has already been said, the European Heads of State or Government will, when they meet in Lahti on 20 October, also be broaching the subject of immigration.
The question is, however, what conclusions they will draw.
Two weeks ago, yet another tragedy struck before the European coasts, involving ill-fated asylum seekers.
Yet again, the blame rests with unscrupulous traffickers prepared to take huge amounts of money off people in order to bring them to Europe in search of their fortune.
Yet again, the capsizing of a vessel of illegals off the coast of Lampedusa claimed casualties; the bulk of passengers and crew could only just be saved.
In order to prevent such tragedies from happening again - off Lampedusa, off the Canary Islands and anywhere along our external borders - Europe has to send out clear signals, for desperate times call for desperate measures.
We must come down hard on people-traffickers.
The penalties cannot be tough enough.
This should go hand in hand with a strict asylum policy, one that demonstrates to the rest of the world that Europe is serious about protecting its borders.
That is why I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Swiss on the sensible choice they have made in all their cantons to tighten up legal conditions for immigration and asylum, because, paradoxically, in these matters, firm, humane and fair policy is the best way.
I should therefore like to express the hope that the European Heads of State or Government, at the informal Lahti summit, will ponder the Swiss example, for Europe must learn to listen to its people where major social issues are concerned.
We have, for example, seen the arrogance with which the eurocracy wants to persevere with a constitution that was rejected by the bulk of the people, such as in France and the Netherlands.
When the people have their say, their opinions are often wholly incompatible with the decisions taken over their heads by an elite unfamiliar with the real world.
This is without a doubt also the case for the pressing issue of immigration.
Madam President, I think the best way to honour Anna Politkovskaya's work is to read her book Putin's Russia, as Mr Watson has indicated.
We need to be aware that systematic intimidation, harassment and murder of independent journalists, as well as the lack of any results from any investigations, have created a climate of impunity in which killers seem not to fear the law.
Such a trend is seriously damaging to Russia's reputation as a Council of Europe Presidency State.
It also casts doubt on our common values.
Therefore, I would like to ask the Presidency of the EU Council to raise this issue at the forthcoming Lahti summit.
The PPE-DE Group also calls on the Commission and the EU Member States to take a principled stand in insisting on the restoration of the freedom of the press and respect for independent journalists as among the main prerequisites for renewing the PCA agreement next year.
Only when the EU sends a clear signal that we value the life of this courageous woman not less than oil and gas will things start to change in Russia.
(Applause)
The only way truly to honour Anna Politkovskaya's passionate commitment to truth, justice and human dignity is to launch a common effort to make real her dream of a democratic Russia where citizens will not need to pay with their lives for telling the truth.
(FR) Madam President, Anna Politkovskaya knows why she is dead.
The postscript to her last book is entitled: 'Am I scared?'
Why did she write?
She wrote because she believed that words can save lives.
She knew that she was in danger; she had been kept locked up; she had been the victim of a poison attempt; and she regularly received death threats.
She was executed simply because she was telling the truth.
In her book, 'Chechnya: Russia's disgrace', she writes: 'Putin and his people have given their blessing to something that no country can accept, namely a form of corruption based on the bloodletting of thousands of victims, an army ravaged by military anarchy, a chauvinistic attitude within the government apparatus that is passed off as patriotism, wild rhetoric about a strong State, and official, popular racism against the Chechens, the fall-out of which extends to other Russian peoples.
Putin's Russia now produces new pogrom enthusiasts on a daily basis, and attacks against the Caucasians have become routine.'
Do you know when she wrote that text?
She wrote it in 2003, and what do we see happening today?
We see raids, arbitrary arrests and persecutions of the Georgians and of the human rights NGOs, which, I might add, have just lodged a complaint.
How does Mr Putin respond?
Mr Putin declares that the measures taken against the Georgians are appropriate and that the State agents are acting in accordance with Russian law.
Mrs Politkovskaya never stopped denouncing human rights violations.
I hope that the 25 will have the courage to say to Mr Putin what that woman alone had the courage to say and that they will not merely utter a few fine words about the investigation ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Madam President, the Finnish Presidency has declared the implementation of an energy partnership between the European Union and Russia.
I would like to ask how it intends to achieve this.
So far it has been less a question of partnership than of the 'Finlandisation' of EU-Russia relations.
The EU's policy towards Russia is mainly one of concessions, and it is also ambiguous in its positions. This is often at the cost of the new Baltic Member States, as well as Poland.
A textbook example of this is the German-Russian agreement to build a north European gas pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
Russia is skilfully using its position as a monopolist on the European energy market.
Operating the principle of 'divide and rule', Russia is making agreements with stronger states over the heads of weaker ones, and the EU meekly accepts this.
So far we have not even managed to get Russia to ratify the European Energy Charter, a fundamental EU document relating to the energy market.
The informal summit between the Heads of State or Government in Lahti in which the Russian president is to participate should bring about a change to this state of affairs.
In this matter more than any other, the EU must speak up with a single voice and from a decisive negotiating standpoint.
(FI) Madam President, my city of birth, Lahti, may be the stage for an important event when it hosts the EU summit.
The subject-matter is most apt for Lahti, an area which for a long time has had a high profile as a centre of excellence in environmental technology - because there is no point talking about energy without energy efficiency.
The most effective way of quickly increasing self-sufficiency in energy is to improve energy efficiency and conservation.
When we hold the energy dialogue with Russia, we also need to say that it is not politically wise to increase our dependence on Russia for energy any further.
In the light of the climate challenge, we need all the resources we can muster.
All low-emission energy must be given the credit it is due.
It is high time we did away with the idea that renewable energy and emission-free nuclear power are somehow opposed to each other.
This is an illusion: it is something that is more in the mind than what is actually the case when it comes to practical attitudes to energy.
I have asked the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry to include the re-examination of Bulgaria's accession conditions on the Lahti agenda.
I am alluding to the unfair and unnecessary decision to close four of the six nuclear reactors at Kozloduy.
When we look at the criteria behind the decision today, we can see that the condition imposed on Bulgaria in Helsinki seven years ago is now obsolete.
It is also unreasonable in view of European energy policy objectives.
Improvements have been made, and the Council's working group has itself stated that the power plants meet safety conditions.
Even so, they have to be closed by the end of the year.
If Finland does not address the problem now, there will be a shortage of energy not only in Bulgaria but also in its neighbouring countries, whose electricity needs Bulgaria has met these last five years.
The Commission's claim that these reactors could be improved in economic terms has proven wrong.
Kozloduy produces electricity at less than two cents per kilowatt-hour.
Closing them can be partially compensated for, and that will be through the use of power plants burning lignite, the dirtiest of all energy sources.
Consequently, EU cash is being used to switch from a cleaner technology to a dirtier one.
That is madness.
