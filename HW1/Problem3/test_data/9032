I find this to be very questionable reasoning that we could debate for some time and, in any case, in fairness, I think that it was a sufficiently important debate for written statements to be accepted from Members who were not able to take the floor.
I am therefore speaking on my own behalf but also on behalf of other Members and, Mr President, I would like our written statements, which were issued within the required time, to be annexed to the debate.
Mr Berthu, your remark does not pertain to the Minutes for yesterday. Nonetheless, it has been noted and a response will be provided when appropriate.
Mr President, further to a statement by Mr Gorostiaga last Monday, I wish to make one point clear. Mr Gorostiaga referred to a report by the United Nations Committee Against Torture, and subsequently sent an e-mail to all Members of the House.
I shall forward the aforementioned committee's full report to Members of the House so they can read for themselves the positive comments on action taken in Spain in recent years. A number of adjustments have been made to legislation in order to prevent torture.
I should also like to emphasise that in my view it is somewhat surprising that Mr Gorostiaga himself should be condemning torture when he has failed to condemn the sustained attack on human rights we are enduring in the Basque Country. This is particularly true for those of us holding elected office.
The most significant torture is actually that perpetrated by ETA terrorists as they murder, blackmail and kidnap.
Mr Oreja, you must be aware that the House is in the habit of dealing calmly but firmly with the many statements by Mr Gorostiaga bearing no relation to reality.
I myself am well aware of the situation, as I hold elected office in Spain. I cannot however become involved.
Nevertheless, your comments have been noted.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0369/2002) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on extending the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by these provisions solely on the grounds of their nationality [COM(2002) 59 - C5-0084/2002 - 2002/0039(CNS)].
Mr President, it is with mixed feelings that I stand here, not because this debate failed to be concluded before lunch and I am due to give a speech this evening in my own country, but because on the one hand, I am pleased and delighted that we today managed to settle an issue that will be concluded successfully in the Council of Ministers and on the other, I would have taken the greatest pleasure in defending what we believe ourselves entitled to as a Parliament - and for which I would have been quite happy to go to the Court of Justice - namely the legal basis underlying Regulation 1408, which involves codecision.
I did not do this and I am also grateful to my fellow MEPs who were dissuaded from fighting this battle.
Why are we not facing the battle?
Because of the great importance of extending the regulation to include third-country nationals and due to the fact that something is finally being done about the legal position of those who reside legally in a European Member State but who subsequently, when they live or work elsewhere, have no rights whatsoever.
The European Court of Justice has said several times that the coordination regulation should apply to these legally resident citizens as well.
The Commission has submitted a directive, an amendment to a regulation, on this very subject.
It chose to use a different legal basis but failed to get the Council to ratify it.
I am indebted to the Commission, but also, as I have already stated, to my fellow MEPs, for deciding to turn their backs on envy and political squabbling and for opting, with good reason, to bring these citizens within the scope of Regulation 1408.
I think that an institutional battle over what would have been the correct legal basis would have lasted for many years and would certainly not have benefited these people.
We as Parliament have therefore seized the earliest opportunity - and I believe that the Council of Ministers will be taking a decision on 3 December next - to establish the rights of these citizens - their duties have already been set out.
The fact that the Danes and even the British felt they should be involved in this regulation filled me with particular joy.
It will in any event also create clarity, which is desperately needed.
When the amendments will be adopted shortly, we will say to the Council that if further amendments are made to our opinion or if the legal position of the people concerned is changed, we will retain the right to join this institutional battle with the Council over these points.
What we have included is just about acceptable, but in any event, it contains the serious warning that if things are not going as planned and as agreed, we will keep the avenue to the Court in Luxembourg open.
I would once again like to thank all fellow MEPs who have worked on this system with great commitment and a great deal of dynamism and who, along with me, were prepared to support the Commission in this proposal.
In addition, I should like to make an observation which concerns one of your officials, Mr Verschueren, who is at the moment unwell at home, but who, in my view, is the best spokesperson on behalf of the Commission on this subject matter.
I should like to extend to him, via yourself, my warmest wishes for a very speedy recovery.
I am certain that I am also doing this on behalf of the fellow MEPs who are working on this dossier.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and the MEPs for the excellent report and for their support for the Commission proposal.
It is an extremely important proposal and its adoption would be a significant political signal from the Union regarding the integration of third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union, since it offers them, in terms of social security, the same protection which Community citizens moving within the European Union enjoy.
It is therefore a major contribution to a balanced, coherent Community immigration policy.
On 27 October 1999, this House called for prompt action regarding the fair treatment of third-country nationals legally residing in the Member States, so that they might be granted rights similar to those enjoyed by citizens of the Union.
The proposal in question responds to this call and goes even further, granting third-country nationals rights that are identical, and not just similar, to those enjoyed by Community citizens moving within the European Union.
The proposal will also encourage worker mobility, the importance of which was illustrated by the Commission's action plan presented at the start of the year.
The proposal will therefore simplify the rules, reducing the number of national and international instruments which govern the coordination of social security systems for this category of people.
As the rapporteur rightly pointed out in her explanatory statement, this proposal for a regulation, based on Article 63(4) of the Treaty, aims to build a bridge.
It simply extends the scope of Community regulations on social security to third-country nationals, regulations which are and will continue to be based on Article 42 of the Treaty.
This means that, for any future amendments to Regulation 1408/71, Parliament will continue to be a codecision-maker.
As you know, the Commission proposal already contains a recital which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but I agree that there is a need for a specific reference to Article 34(2) of the Charter.
The Commission is therefore able to support Amendment No 1.
I fully agree with the assertion that the coordination of social security for third-country nationals is of great importance, but this is so obvious that it - and likewise a recital in this regard - is superfluous.
The importance of coordinating social security systems for third-country nationals is already amply conveyed in the first nine recitals proposed by the Commission.
While it agrees with the underlying concept, the Commission therefore cannot accept Amendment No 2.
I understand that it is appropriate to refer to the forthcoming, imminent enlargement of the European Union in the recitals: the Commission can therefore accept Amendment No 3.
It is, however, unable to support Amendments Nos 4 and 5.
With regard to Amendment No 4, it must be said that it is inappropriate to refer in a regulation to a proposal for a Community instrument, the outcome of which is still unknown.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 5 for a number of reasons.
First of all, the aim of the proposal is to grant third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State the same rights as Community citizens moving within the Union.
Amendment No 5 seeks to grant third-country nationals different rights to those given to Community citizens.
I do not see why an Afghan or Indian worker, in the Netherlands or Finland for example, should have to face profoundly different problems - owing to unfamiliarity with the language and/or with the administrative procedures in the host country - from those faced by a Greek or Portuguese colleague.
The Commission will also launch a vigorous information campaign and, once the proposal has been adopted, all those concerned will be made aware of it so that they can assert their rights when the time comes.
Moreover, there is already a high degree of media interest in this proposal.
Lastly, Mr President, I am extremely grateful to this House for having included the proposal on today's agenda, thereby enabling the Council to formally adopt it at the meeting on 3 December.
You will understand that the Commission does not have enough time to submit an amended proposal to the Council, but my fellow Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, intends to recommend that the Council adopts the proposal together with those of Parliament's amendments which we have just accepted.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to join the rapporteur in welcoming the prospect of implementing such a legislative provision, i.e. a position on the substance of the draft text.
Indeed it was high time, and the European Commission had a political responsibility towards the people affected by this draft regulation, particularly since the Tampere European Council in October 1999, which had established, in its conclusions, the need to take swift measures to ensure that nationals from third countries living legally in the European Union are treated equally.
What we welcome is the respect for equal treatment for residents of third countries with regard to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and the social equality resulting from it which, as has been said, provides quite substantial help towards integrating them but also encourages mobility.
We are aware that this mobility, which we talk about so much, is much more difficult to put into practice than free movement of property and goods.
I would like to stress, because it should be done, the important contribution that the residents of third countries make to the European Union, both in terms of boosting the economy and in terms of a rich cultural diversity and when we talk about them we are potentially talking about around 13 million people in the Union.
That is not an insignificant number.
However, like the rapporteur, I would like to draw your attention to the issue of the legal basis chosen by the European Commission following pressure from the Council.
The European Parliament had the consultation procedure imposed on it, whereas the first proposal in 1997 was based on Article 51, now Article 42, which assumes codecision.
That decision, the motivation for which seems to be more than questionable, as pointed out by the rapporteur, and therefore contestable, in fact places the European Parliament in a dilemma, that it can only solve by giving in, because that is exactly what is happening here.
And unfortunately, it is not the first time that there has been an attempt to genuinely dismantle, as we could describe it, the prerogatives of our institution, which could be seen as a dangerous precedent.
I fear that there is an underlying trend, and I think that our institution will have to be vigilant.
The Commission, following the Council's recommendations, knows full well that Parliament is going to choose the path of pragmatism, and that it will prefer to abandon what you, Madam, called, legal hair-splitting, in order not to endanger urgent Community legislation.
We would not like to take responsibility for the failure of something that we desire.
We do not wish to cross swords, but the question is there: in the future, should we penalise the citizens who are awaiting decisions from this House simply in order to ensure that Parliament's position is respected?
I think that this decision, the quite reasonable position of the European Parliament, should be used to help discussions on matters that will arise in the future or that we know are already being considered by the Council.
Mr President, on behalf of my group and on behalf of Jean Lambert, I want to warmly congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
We fully support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's approach, including the way she handled the legal basis.
I think it important that agreements reached by way of European coordination now also apply to third-country nationals.
Speaking quite honestly, it is a scandal that such was not already the case, in view of the fact that these people do indeed pay taxes and social security contributions, but then find themselves falling between two stools when working across frontiers.
Parliament has already expressed its desire that the Tampere conclusions should be transposed into real action in a similar way as regards the rights of third-country nationals.
The regulation that we are now discussing has to do with cross-border working, but the others, a naturally far larger category, also have to have their social rights secured in the same way as those of workers originating from the European Union.
My group hopes that the struggle that must still be engaged in will lead to the necessary consensus being reached in this House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the Commission statement on climate change.
Mr President, thank you for inviting the Commission to report to this House on the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change held in October 2002.
I wish to begin by saying that the European Union adopted a strong and unified position during the talks and we would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its excellent work.
The Commission is also pleased to acknowledge the sound political support it received from the NGOs present at the meeting.
However, the Commission and my colleague Mrs WallstrÃ¶m particularly want to express our appreciation of the European Parliament's ongoing support for the EU's position in international climate negotiations and your continuing interest in this issue.
That interest was reflected by your dedicated parliamentary delegation led by Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo in New Delhi.
We hope to continue our effective cooperation in the future.
Around 170 countries, representing over three-quarters of the world's population, met in New Delhi for their eighth regular meeting as parties to the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The meeting made good progress on a number of technical issues, such as monitoring and reporting, and paved the way for the use of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
The CDM is an important tool for reaching emission targets in developed countries and, at the same time, for reducing emissions in the developing world and contributing to its sustainable growth.
During the final ministerial part of the meeting, ministers and senior officials discussed the actions taken so far to combat climate change, the links between climate change and sustainable development and the disturbing findings of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which show that most of the acceleration in global warming is man-made.
They also debated the need for further action to continue the fight against climate change.
The meeting ended with the adoption of the Delhi Declaration.
Allow me to briefly outline the Commission's political assessment of the New Delhi Conference.
The Delhi Ministerial Declaration represents the political outcome of the conference.
Although it includes the call for all countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and underlines the need for greater efforts to combat climate change in the coming decades, we would have liked it to be stronger in other areas.
Let me briefly address some shortcomings.
First, the Delhi Declaration fails to underline the need for a closer link between science and policy action.
The findings of the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirm that more emission cuts are needed if the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be attained.
This must be used as an important input for furthering the work of the climate change convention and the Kyoto Protocol.
A science-based approach will give us more confidence in our policy scenarios for the future being on the right track.
Secondly, our mandate as agreed by the Council on 17 October was to seek a forward-looking discussion on more inclusive and longer-term global cooperation based on broader and balanced action and participation consistent with the ultimate objective of the Convention.
Such discussions should have started at the Conference of the Parties at its first session after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
Regrettably, the EU did not succeed in persuading other parties to recognise the need for starting such a process.
However, through a number of bilateral contacts with other parties and groups of parties the EU did seize every opportunity to explain our way of thinking.
The issue is now on the table and these discussions have provided a solid foundation on which we can build.
A third but more general point is that the debate in Delhi tended to focus on sustainable development rather than on climate change.
While there is a clear understanding in the EU that climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development, the UN framework convention on climate change is about just that.
It is the framework for climate change which is well defined and in place.
We should not allow the sustainable development discussion to distract us from the climate change process.
Following this conference, what prospects can we see for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol?
This is obviously a crucial question.
As you know this requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55% of the CO2 emissions of the industrialised countries in 1990.
The first threshold has been largely met - 97 countries as of 13 November - as ratification continues steadily.
In this context, we gladly welcome the confirmation by Canada that they will soon ratify.
However, we have only reached a figure of 37.4% for the second threshold.
Given that the EU, Japan and almost all the candidate countries have now ratified, this means that ratification by Russia is necessary to bring the Protocol into effect.
It seems that Russia is still inclined to ratify, especially after the results of the recently published study on the effects of climate change in that country.
However, a final decision has yet to be made and no specific timetable has been set out.
It is the Commission's intention to continue to encourage Russia to live up to its responsibility as a key player on climate change and to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.
Internally, the Commission will proceed within the framework of the European Climate Change Programme to enable the European Union to meet its emissions reductions targets as agreed.
Internationally, on the other hand, the Commission will continue its efforts to encourage our partners to ratify the Kyoto Protocol so that it can enter into force.
At the same time we will also continue to build on the good bilateral relationships we have established with some developing countries and with the majority of the developed countries in order to reach a better understanding on what needs to be done in the future.
Everybody knows that the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step in the fight against climate change and we have to start to discuss how to proceed beyond it.
I would like to conclude by stressing once again how deeply grateful the Commission is for the Parliament's support and for its very dedicated presence in Delhi itself.
Mr President, Commissioner, although Commisioner WallstrÃ¶m is not with us today, I would like to start by saying, on behalf of the European Parliament's delegation to the 8th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention, how much we appreciate her cooperation with delegations from the House at the various conferences she has attended.
We certainly missed her in New Delhi.
I should like to make a few points regarding that conference.
The European Union must continue to take the lead in the international fight against climate change. It must therefore promote political debate on objectives for beyond 2012 at the earliest opportunity.
COP8 had seemed a good opportunity to consolidate decisions on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol taken earlier at Bonn and Marrakech. Unfortunately, the opportunity was missed.
No broad debate was launched on the main issues for the second period.
Significant progress on technical matters was made at the COP8, however. These related in particular to mechanisms for clean development, reporting, and review procedures.
On the other hand, progress on a political level was disappointing.
As the Commissioner stated, attempts to water down the specific features of the Kyoto Protocol by means of the much broader concept of sustainable development won the day. In this connection it has to be said that the attitude of the United States delegation was not very constructive.
It consistently avoided references to deadlines and specific objectives.
The members of our delegation all agreed that ratification of the Protocol by States which have not yet done so must be speeded up. We had in mind Russia in particular.
If Russia ratified the Protocol it would come into force.
It is however worrying that Russia maintained a non-committed attitude throughout the conference.
Regarding the position of developing countries, concern over inadequate financial support from developed countries was expressed. Transfer of technology to facilitate the adoption of measures to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects was also deemed inadequate.
Further, we feel we should consider the possibility of setting up an interparliamentary committee to deal with India in particular.
India is home to a thousand million people. It has an emerging economy which is growing continuously and its Parliament has expressed a clear political will to cooperate with the European Parliament.
Finally, I should emphasise that there was constructive cooperation with the Council and the Commission.
The latter both recognised the essential role of delegations from Parliament in conferences of this sort.
It is precisely for that reason that we believe it is not acceptable for our delegations to be excluded from coordination meetings. We therefore request that delegations from Parliament be admitted to these meetings in future, at least as observers.
Mr President, I shall attempt the trick of representing two people here today - myself and Mrs Corbey, who was present at the New Delhi conference.
That does not mean that I shall convey two different messages. Instead, I shall try to make the message as stringent as possible.
Having read the Commission's and Parliament's report on the New Delhi conference, there is a question that keeps going round in my head.
What is it that causes us, or the EU, to fail in communicating our message and our desire for change to, above all, the developing countries?
Why is the United States more successful in doing so?
The United States's message is, at least in our eyes, worse in terms of combating the climate change that is under way.
It is essential for the EU now jointly to begin to reflect upon how it might try to reduce the credibility gap that in actual fact exists between ourselves and those whom we wish to get on our side.
That also applies to the possibility of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.
These all no doubt constitute the most important aspects of our continued strategy for trying to progress further.
It is, above all, a question of making further progress with the important work that will now commence when this part of the Kyoto Protocol has been concluded.
Mrs Corbey, who was present at the New Delhi conference, made some notes that I think are worth communicating to the House.
They are, above all, about the Kyoto process in actual fact constituting a serious political danger because political support for the whole process is evaporating.
There are two essential aspects to trying to increase political support again and to raising the issue for discussion at a more subtle and serious level.
One factor, for example, is the one I have just addressed, namely the situation in the developing countries and our relations with those countries.
At the New Delhi conference, quite a few of them reported extreme weather conditions.
It was not just one country but a number that did so, and they also expressed opinions as to what costs the situation would entail.
Even though we in the EU cannot accept responsibility for all these forms of climate change, we must nonetheless regard ourselves as one of the parties which, together with the rest of the industrialised world, has contributed most to creating the climate change now under way.
We must adopt a clearer role in helping the developing countries to protect themselves against climate change.
We must, of course, also help them find ways of making progress in terms of development that are not merely a case of taking the route that we ourselves do not consider to have been entirely successful.
What is perhaps most important is that, in spite of everything, the EU should continue to push for something's happening after 2012 and that we should not give up, in spite of the surrounding world's actually wanting something different.
That is perhaps the most important message to have come out of the New Delhi conference.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to start by congratulating the European Parliament delegation to the New Delhi Conference and I would single out Mrs Garcia-Orcoyen Tormo, who led the delegation.
I am sorry that once again the Commission and the Council did not allow Parliament's delegation to participate in the EU coordination meetings.
We knew, even before the Conference started, that the outcome would be extremely hard to achieve: this Conference was designed to prepare for the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol, whereas the political priority is still, unfortunately, to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol enters into force in order for the first phase to begin.
Although it is regrettable that no result was achieved, it should nevertheless be highlighted that we managed to improve the definition of the Clean Development Mechanism and of emissions monitoring procedures.
What I believe to be more serious is not so much the failure to reach an outcome but rather the political attempt to water down the Kyoto Protocol.
There was a definite attempt by some delegations, specifically the delegation representing the United States, to take the debate on climate change backwards in time to 1997, when there were neither targets nor protocols intended to achieve action.
It is also a pity that the developing countries have fallen into this trap.
It is precisely in the developing countries that the consequences of climate change are having the most damaging effects.
We believe the choice remains clear: firstly, the Kyoto Protocol is the only instrument capable of mitigating climate change.
Secondly, the second phase of the Protocol must be set even more ambitious targets than the first phase, which represents only a tiny step forwards.
Thirdly, action must first be undertaken in the industrialised countries and only later in the developing countries.
Mr President, this was the first time I had taken part in one of these delegations.
I found it fascinating, but also frustrating.
As has been said, this 8th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention in New Delhi was intended to be a transitional one - more a matter of keeping the momentum going on the climate change debate than making headline political decisions.
I concur with what colleagues have said and also express my frustration with the exclusion of the parliamentary delegation from the daily coordination meetings.
As a result, the Commission ended the last day trying to exclude us from the press conference, albeit very politely and diplomatically.
When we parliamentarians were briefed that morning, we indicated our frustration with the weakness of the draft declaration.
The Commission did not want us to express that view at a press conference when it was taking what it thought was a more diplomatic line.
These differences would not arise if we were part of the coordination meeting and on the inside.
The Commission was very good to us in that it gave us briefings outside the loop, but we need to be inside the loop if we are to be involved and if we are to be described as 'members as participants in the European Community delegation'.
The Council and the Commission were on one side and Parliament on the other.
The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing.
The title was changed from 'The Declaration on Climate Change' to 'Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainability'.
That is a precedent we have to be careful of.
It is very hard to talk about these issues, be objective and keep the focus on climate change if it is suggested that sustainable development is not included.
It is a sort of 'hit-me-with-a-child-in-my-arms' argument, i.e. how can you justify what you are saying if you do not include sustainable development?
The Americans and others used the serious issue of sustainable development to divert focus from climate change and from the Kyoto Protocol requirements in general.
It was a fascinating exercise.
I would like to thank the leader of our delegation, Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo, and all colleagues for making it that.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what Mrs Doyle said gives great cause for concern in terms of both procedure and the subject matter, and it is this latter aspect which I would like to consider for a moment.
We are in a situation where agreements on the environment are never observed: the most striking example is the Kyoto Agreement.
I hope that the Commission will reflect on its future approach to cooperation with Members of Parliament - including outside the European Union - but above all, with regard to the subject matter, I hope that it will work much harder to preserve the conditions necessary for the survival not just of the European Union and its almost 400 million inhabitants - which soon will exceed 400 million - but of the whole planet.
While I am anything but anti-American, I nevertheless feel that great pressure needs to be exerted on President Bush's administration so that issues such as the climate, climate change and the environment are given more attention and not just addressed from a financial perspective and with a narrow rather than a far-sighted monetary approach.
We should work much harder in this respect, and I trust the Commission will do so.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the implementation of the so-called Erika package on maritime safety, and on the action required to deal with socio-economic and environmental disasters.
.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate ought never to have been necessary. Sadly, the Commission has today been proved right.
The Commission proposed the speedy withdrawal of old-fashioned single-hull tankers some time ago. Unfortunately the Council did not follow our advice.
It failed to act with the necessary urgency and adopt the Commission's proposals following discussion with Parliament. Had it done so, the Prestige would have been banned since 1 September 2002.
It would therefore never have broken up and sunk off the coast of Europe.
There are lessons to be learnt from all this.
Those were my very words when the Erika sank off the coast of Brittany.
I must reiterate them today, as we discuss the case of the Prestige which sunk off Spain, off the coast of Galicia to be precise.
There are lessons to be learnt and measures to be taken. The first lesson is crystal clear.
Speed is of the essence, and so are determination and decisive action. These situations need to be dealt with once and for all, to ensure no further similar tragedies happen.
The immediate action required is obvious.
The authorities must compensate those affected and they must undertake the clean-up operation required to return the coast to its previous condition. I will remind the House that this is a particularly rich coast, both in terms of fish and shellfish production and from an environmental point of view.
Almost all of it is covered by Natura 2002.
So, the affected areas need to be cleaned and restored. The chain of events leading to the disaster must also be traced.
It should be borne in mind that back in 1997 a number of oil companies rejected this vessel, on the grounds that it was dangerous and unsafe. It appears that the last time the vessel underwent an inspection as required in the European Union under the Paris Memorandum was in 1999.
Furthermore, the vessel had put into two European ports before this summer.
Regrettably, in neither of these was it inspected as required.
It is important to study all the links in the chain and establish what exactly happened and where responsibility lies. The lessons to be learnt to prevent a repeat of such situations should then become clear.
The present situation involves a vessel with a Greek owner, flying the flag of the Bahamas, inspected by a United States classification society and managed by a Swiss company. It has links with other countries too, all of which offer substantial tax advantages.
We are called on to take all the urgent action in our power to prevent a further tragedy of this kind.
That involves the immediate application and implementation of agreements and directives adopted by European Union Ministers.
Application of the Erika I package cannot wait until June of next year, nor can the Erika II package be left until February of 2004. They must be put into practice now.
They must be made effective, which means meeting the target of inspection of 25% of vessels entering a port by the port authorities, 25% of the most dangerous vessels, those posing the greatest risk. The standards specified in existing provisions must be applied.
Single-hull tankers must be replaced by double-hull ones as a matter of urgency.
The Community system for following up information on maritime traffic in all areas must be set up at the earliest opportunity. Steps should also be taken to facilitate emergency intervention, by designating protection areas, mooring areas and areas for emergency shelter.
The European Maritime Safety Agency should start operations too. It is tasked with ensuring that the correct procedures are followed in all European ports, and also with providing technical support to the various countries and to the Commission.
Discussions with the COPE Fund ought to be pursued. This fund was set up for the specific purpose of covering compensation and the cost of restoring and cleaning the environment.
This is over and above standard compensation. It complements the FIPOL Fund.
In addition, at the next Council of Ministers meeting on 6 December, as an urgent measure, I shall propose the adoption of an administrative decision by all Member States of the Union to ensure that heavy fuel oil is only transported in double-hull tankers during the transitional period until single-hull tankers are phased out as already planned. Heavy fuel oil is after all the most polluting of all these products.
Each of the vessels involved in the latest three accidents, namely the Erika, the Baltic and the Prestige, was an old-fashioned single-hull tanker carrying heavy fuel oil. Heavy fuel oil is the most dangerous product.
Consequently, stricter safety measures are needed. This could easily be achieved through an administrative decision by the governments of the Member States.
We need to go further. That means working to increase the FIPOL and COPE Funds.
It also means persevering with the Commission's work on future criminal sanctions in the European area. Going further also means that port authorities should improve the application of the directive on inspection.
It has been shown that there are ports where hardly any inspection takes place.
These could almost be termed ports of convenience. This amounts to taking fraudulent advantage of the present situation and has to be stopped.
In addition, going further means reconsidering the basis of international maritime law at global level within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation. International maritime law is based on Nineteenth Century principles, yet here we are in the Twentieth Century, when our seas are criss-crossed daily by hundreds of thousands of vessels loaded with cargoes that are highly dangerous because of their volume or content.
A century and a half ago this just did not happen.
Going further also means strengthening the rights of coastal states in the 200-mile zone, and in straits. In particular, these rights need to be strengthened so that they can be defended against the risks of those particularly dangerous cargoes.
Ladies and gentlemen, going further should also mean talking to our neighbours. I have in mind those who share with us a common interest in certain enormously fragile seas.
For example, the Baltic which we share with Russia, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. We should cooperate with Russia and with other states in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the Prestige disaster need never have happened.
As a Commission, we did everything in our power to prevent it.
We were unsuccessful, but we must ensure no second Erika or second Prestige founders off our coasts.
We must also strive to ensure that such incidents do not occur along the coasts of other seas, off other continents. We should remember that the seas are a common heritage, and that our concern has to extend to their farthest reaches.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, as a native of Galicia I feel devastated. I am quite overcome by the spectacle unfolding before us.
As a politician, I am keenly aware of the heavy responsibility we bear as Members of this House.
We are charged with defending the interests of our constituents and we must succeed in so doing.
Vague statements and half-truths simply will not do any longer.
As the Commissioner said, this has to be the last tragedy at sea.
I should indeed like to begin by commending Commissioner de Palacio on her work.
To all intents and purposes, before she was appointed there was no such thing as a European policy on maritime safety. We now have a substantial package of measures on the table, namely Erika I and Erika II.
The question as to whether these measures are adequate and whether they are being applied correctly has already been raised in the House.
Clearly, the answer is no.
The European Parliament must unite and throw its political weight behind the European Commission. It has to send out a clear signal.
We need to work together to speed up implementation of these measures. They must come into force.
The Commissioner referred to double hulls. The latter are compulsory in the United States, and had that been the case here, this accident probably would not have happened.
The Commissioner also mentioned inspections at ports within the European Community, which is where we should start, and at all other ports in Europe and across the world.
All ports should actually be monitored, be they colonies, tax havens or ports of convenience as some have been described.
The Maritime Safety Agency has to start operating as soon as possible.
Sadly, as a native of Galicia I am all too aware of the unfortunate record held by that part of Spain. Eight such accidents have taken place there over the last thirty years.
Six of these accidents happened in the last twenty years.
In Galicia the Atlantic coast of the Cape Finisterre area is known as the Coast of Death.
The European Agency should be located in an area affected by maritime accidents.
It should be in one that has experienced their consequences. Perhaps others could offer more than my region.
Locating the Agency in Galicia could however go some way towards compensating the area. I know this falls outside the competence of both Parliament and the Commission, but I feel moved to express my thoughts aloud.
In any case, the resolution calls for the establishment of special maritime fishing areas.
Undoubtedly, Galicia does fall into that category because of its rich shellfish and fishing resources mentioned earlier, and also because of its diversity and marine ecosystem. We are eager to move what could be termed the lanes of death further away from where they now are.
We want to prevent our sea from becoming a sewer. We want to prevent vessels that are no better than rusting hulks from sailing on it.
The sea is Galicia's life. Galicia's economy is based on it and I could go so far as to say that its distinctive culture is too.
Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, that sea is now poisoned.
These measures must be strictly implemented as from tomorrow. We must insist that Member States do so.
Mr President, I really feel the time has come for European solidarity to make itself felt. I would recall that we have ourselves shown solidarity to other Member States in the past.
We now call on them to respond in kind. Any assistance offered to Galicia will be welcome.
I would like to refer in particular to the Solidarity Fund. I studied Article 2 and it certainly does apply in this instance, especially if the reports approved by the House are borne in mind.
It should also be taken into account that Galicia is an Objective 1 region whose fish and shellfish resources represent more than 10% of its gross domestic product.
Given that these are in danger of being totally wiped out for an unspecified period, Galicia does indeed meet the conditions for benefiting from the Solidarity Fund.
In conclusion, I should like to assure the Commissioner that she can count on support from the Group of the European People's Party. Indeed I am sure the whole House will support her in her efforts.
We need to be able to start doing what is required as of tomorrow.
Then we shall never again have to regret accidents of this kind. Thank you in advance, ladies and gentlemen, for the support I am confident you will offer us.
Mr President, I should first like to thank the Commissioner for her presence in the House today. It is evidence of the great interest I know she has in this issue which is causing such concern to us all.
The Prestige was carrying twice as much crude oil in its tanks as the Erika.
The oil slick it caused is already an economic, social and environmental disaster for Europe, especially for my home region. It represents a mayor problem for Europe and its consequences will be felt for many long years.
More than 300 km of coastline have been polluted. Three further spills have been detected and the strong wind from the south-west is bringing them closer to the coast.
Shellfish production, inshore fishing, aquaculture, tourism and the very image of Galicia have all been seriously affected.
Galicia is known to be an area prone to oil spills, yet it remains unprotected, despite the fact that 70% of Europe's crude oil goes past its coastline.
No effective lessons seem to have been learnt, even after enduring five oil spills.
Sadly, it also has to be said that lack of equipment is currently hampering the efforts of many citizens eager to help.
Pictures of hundreds of fishermen sewing together an enormous net four kilometres long to create an amateur device for holding back the oil speak volumes. So do pictures of people on beaches armed with buckets and spades.
They show twenty-first century citizens coping with a nineteenth century disaster using Stone Age tools.
Information has failed too. Spanish public opinion believes attempts were made to play down the gravity of the situation.
This is in stark contrast to the grave concern expressed by European governments.
The Commissioner rightly said that the disaster could have been prevented if European regulations had been applied. In addition, she stated that the Erika package will come into force in 2003.
She went on to say, however, that despite Parliament's express wish to the contrary, vessels without protective ballast tanks will be able to ply the seas until 2012. Those that do have such protection will be permitted up to 2026.
Furthermore, the requirement for double hulls does not apply to small tankers, so they will still be able to sail also. That is why I am delighted with the Commissioner's swift response.
I welcome it and urge Member States in the Council to accept her proposals as a matter of urgency.
Nonetheless, further action is needed.
For example, tankers carrying dangerous goods should be required to set routes along the furthermost part of the shipping lane, and the Finisterre lane should be relocated away from the coast.
It is certainly true that this issue calls for legislation at world level, but the European Union has to press ahead.
The Socialist Group calls for a policy on transport and sustainable development based on the principle of maximum safety and prevention. Such a policy must reinforce cooperation within the Community, along with the means of inspection and safety standards.
We reiterate the call for Community funds to be channelled to this disaster.
Community aid must retain its credibility, however. You will recall that Galicia was recently let down when no Community agreement was reached with Morocco.
The victims' interests must come first. We therefore believe that the European Solidarity Fund set up recently is the most appropriate instrument in this case, as it is flexible, immediate, and was devised as a Community instrument.
Mr President, Commissioner, you stated a moment ago that the sea belongs to all of us, but I should like to see it only being used by people who respect it.
This was clearly not the case here.
I have to say, I am shocked and I should like to ask my fellow MEPs from that region to extend the sympathy of our group to everyone involved.
As a legislator, I am furious, but also a little despondent because this is the second time that we have faced the same problem in less than three years.
We do not yet have all the facts by a long way, but we have a few.
The question I am asking is whether the Erika package is sufficient.
The Erika package is clearly valuable and should enter into force at the earliest opportunity, but is it sufficient?
I have a question concerning airports.
I mentioned airports and safe berthing places in one of my previous reports.
I do not think that this legislation is completely incontrovertible.
I should like to know, once we have all the facts, what we can do to improve the situation, so that a ship in distress is not turned down, which, I assume, exacerbated the situation, but can berth somewhere so that the disaster is kept down to an absolute minimum.
Another reason why we should improve the situation is so that we can also mention compensation - something that was unmentionable in my report - for a port which suffers damage in this case. No provision has been made for this.
We should do this. In fact, a start is only just being made.
Secondly, as you have already stated, Commissioner, we are very weak internationally speaking.
Would it not at long last be possible within the IMO and if necessary just for our own sake to work with a black list of states that allow their flags to be misused and in that way enhance the power of the port state?
Should we not reconsider all our options and use our influence to enhance the IMO's role in the process?
This is also a task for the Council; we cannot do this on our own.
We therefore need to improve our rules. This applies to the Commission, the European Parliament, all the groups - party politics should not come into this - but also and, above all, the Council and Member States.
However, we should, first and foremost, help the people involved and alleviate the despair in that region.
I believe this to be the duty of the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, my mother tongue is very rich in popular proverbs and sayings.
One of those sayings, which my mother and my grandmothers would use when some irreversible domestic accident happened, was 'why cry over spilt milk?'.
This saying is relevant here because we are once again having to express our regret at something we should have prevented through stricter control measures and by bringing forward the date for the disappearance of single-hull ships - and please note, Commissioner, that I wrote this before hearing you speak and I am therefore in agreement with what you said at the beginning.
We must demand compliance with the laws we adopt, but also revise those which are not sufficiently rigorous.
The wrecking of the Prestige once again damages an area which has suffered three serious accidents of this type over recent years: in 1976, the Urquiola, the Mar Egeo in 1992 and the Prestige this year.
I have not yet been to Galicia - I am going tomorrow - but I am sure that one really needs to talk to the fishermen and shellfishermen in order to understand exactly the extent of the tragedy they are facing and their need for help, help which our Group is fully in favour of providing.
But we must prevent anything like this from happening again, because, as well as the social and economic disaster it represents, it is an ecological disaster which affects areas belonging to the Natura 2000 network, biodiversity and the wealth of a region such as Galicia.
Commissioner, when it comes to voting in this Parliament, we must remember this catastrophe, because in the coming months we are going to discuss a very important directive, which relates to responsibility for environmental damage, and all of us here will remember what it is we are voting for.
Because there are times when stricter measures are required and there is much resistance - on the part of the lobbies present in this very House - to voting for these stricter, more serious and more rigorous measures.
In the last few seconds remaining to me, Mr President, I would like to say - on behalf of my colleague, Ilda Figueiredo, who has had to leave - that she also would like to express her solidarity with the victims of the oil slick, that she demands more rigorous control measures in order to prevent it happening again, that she considers it important to establish a list of sensitive maritime areas and that they must be subject to special protection in Galicia, Brittany and, as she points out, Portugal as well - which is close by - and she insists that the Erika I and II packages must be applied, and their dates brought forward, and she requests effective measures against flags of convenience and the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the repair of environmental damage and compensation for the victims.
Mr President, Galicia's national poet, Rosalia de Castro, who always felt great solidarity with the fate of the Galician people, coined the phrase 'black shadow' to express a sense of anguish that troubled her.
Today Galicia, and also the whole of Europe, is suffering from the 'black shadow' caused by political irresponsibility and the contemptible interests of the mafias that control maritime traffic and flags of convenience.
The Prestige disaster is now the fourth to have occurred off the coast of Galicia in recent years.
The names 'Urquiola', 'Aegean Sea' and 'Casou' are, together with that of the Prestige, part of our consciousness and of our collective misfortunes.
On the Coast of Death and in the Rias Baixas and the Rias Altas, these misfortunes are remembered even more sharply.
Therefore, in these emergency situations, we, the men and women of Galicia wonder: what good to us is the Spanish State - the authority whose main task and responsibility at this historic time is to protect our people, our nature, the marvellous Galician nature, and our economy, the persistent and long-suffering Galician economy?
What good to us is the head of the State government who was absent from Galicia at a tragic time, whilst the inhabitants of the Coast of Death and the Rias were under attack from the Prestige, and who, to universal scorn, was in Prague with NATO, dining out and sycophantically applauding President Bush and his unilateral and 'preventive' strikes?
As a Galician and a supporter of European integration, I wonder, what major action have the Galician and EU authorities taken in this tragic situation?
It is precisely in this Parliament that reactionary positions by Members contributed - and in this context I must agree with the Commissioner - to changing the legislation contained in the 'Erika' package, which would have prevented this accursed ship from continuing to move around our seas.
Let us not be under any illusion: this disaster has consequences identical to those of a natural disaster, but it is really a political disaster and we know who the guilty parties are.
Mr President, the location of the European Safe Seas Agency has still not been decided on, in contravention of the 'Erika' legislation.
Once again, the governments of the Member States have not been equal to the circumstances.
Following what has happened in Galicia, can any doubt remain that the Agency should be based in a region in which there is the greatest concentration of intercontinental traffic and where there is the greatest risk of accident?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 'Prestige' was a disaster waiting to happen and this is what makes the matter particularly intolerable and makes it all the more difficult for us to respond to the concerns, fear and desperation of the populations of Galicia and of the Minho in northern Portugal.
This was a disaster waiting to happen because we know how enormously vulnerable our coasts are, particularly in Brittany, Galicia and in Portugal's seas, both in continental Portugal and in the seas around Madeira and the Azores, which are all busy maritime passages and crossroads.
It was also bound to happen because of the appalling conditions in which many ships still sail, carrying dangerous and highly polluting cargoes, whilst we are hesitant and slow at European and world level about adopting rigorous and mandatory measures for prevention and guidance, confiscation and destruction.
The disaster was bound to happen, lastly, because it could be seen that the Prestige would break up and sink, leaving questions as to whether the measures adopted at the time the emergency was declared one week ago and thereafter were correct and adequate.
We now have a time-bomb sitting at the bottom of the sea; nobody really knows what it is going to do and at the same time the ecological, social and economic effects of the spilt fuel are already terrible for hundreds of kilometres of coastline and the threat hanging over the coast, the river estuaries and the immediate future of hundreds of thousands of people who are directly and indirectly affected, both our Galician brethren and those in the north of Portugal, who are praying for the danger to recede, is enormous.
We must provide three types of response: to the present, to the future and to the past.
We must respond to the present in four ways: we must mobilise all available means to monitor and minimise the polluting effects, rigorously investigate the risks arising from the sunken ship with 60 000 tonnes of oil in its tanks and keep them under strict control, we must make those responsible pay, provide sympathetic help for the frightened and worried populations by giving them all the help they need and by assisting the recovery of the local economy.
Next, we must respond to the future: we must get the European Safe Seas Agency up and running - I personally would like it to be based in Portugal - and increase resources for port and coastal inspection. Above all, however, we must go along with the positions of Commissioner de Palacio.
Commissioner, do not hesitate: go right ahead.
Parliament and the Council must prove themselves able to provide what these communities are calling for.
Lastly, we must respond to the past: preventing future disasters of this scale and more effectively limiting the damage caused require all the facts and the reactions to such disasters to be verified and established objectively and rigorously, enabling us to make a technical assessment of whether the reactions were right or wrong.
We must assure ourselves that in the face of any similar emergency in future, all the competent authorities will be able to respond rapidly and courageously in the way that most effectively anticipates real environmental damage and risks and consequently is most able to limit and control these.
Mr President, everything was said here during the months following the sinking of the Erika, on waste boats, the inadequacy of checks and the complacency of the flag states.
We voted on two blocks of measures.
Many of them are good.
However, nothing has changed, and while Parliament is talking, every day vessels set out into the Ouessant lane ready to pour out their oil onto the coasts of the VendÃ©e or Galicia if by chance there is a storm.
As a lawyer, before joining Parliament, I spent hundreds of hours with the victims of the Erika, professionals and local groups.
Tomorrow, will I have to go back and say to them: 'we are moved, very moved, but we cannot be effective in less than three years because of codecision'?
Commissioner, you were just saying: 'I want it hic et nunc', but the system replies: 'non possumus'.
So while the Americans protected themselves in a few months, with immediate measures, we take years to adopt measures with a delayed effect, the content of which will ultimately be inadequate.
Inadequate for two reasons.
First of all, because the Treaties do not allow the countries that are threatened, such as France and Spain or Portugal, to protect themselves unilaterally and rapidly when circumstances require it, and equally because those countries have to admit defeat with countries for whom maritime safety is not a priority.
Also, because we will not have done anything until we have forced the oil companies to take prime responsibility for transporting their goods, so that security is ensured by rich companies that are well-known and laying their reputation on the line, and not by ship owners with no identity or nationality.
Mr President, what happened off the coast of Galicia was indeed dramatic and we must express our support for the people and our honourable friends from the area; of course, for me it is doubly dramatic because, by coincidence, this has happened in the country of the Commissioner responsible for transport who, as we all know, has made a tremendous effort to improve safety at sea.
Be that as it may, I think it is up to all of us here to investigate what happened and why it happened as quickly as possible and of course it is not easy to draw any conclusions when you have a ship flying under the flag of the Bahamas, a country which, I may remind you, is not on the black list, it is hardly even on the grey list of the so-called Paris ??U, a ship operated by a Liberian company, owned by a Greek and registered with an American shipping register, in fact one of the best shipping registers in the world, a ship which was built in China, comes from Latvia and Russia, was fitted out in Gibraltar and so on and so forth.
So we need to find out who of all these was or was not to blame and we must, of necessity, be level-headed and persistent.
I think that we will get to the bottom of this in the end and the European Commission will be a great help here.
So what do we need to do next?
We obviously need a set of measures.
I have been talking with a number of Members over recent days who are all in favour of double hulls.
Others want port controls, others are talking about the responsibility of the shipping registers and flags of convenience, others still point to the lack of ports of refuge.
I think that those of us who happen to deal with these issues on a daily basis know that there is no universal panacea.
There is no panacea, ladies and gentlemen, we need a set of measures, we need to proceed on all these fronts at once.
If we are to do something about this, I think that, first, the European Commission needs to be strict in applying the Community legislation which is already in place.
Countries which do not comply with Community legislation should be hauled before the Court of Justice and I think Mrs Palacio will do so.
Secondly, we really must speed up the application of the Erika I and Erika II packages.
We adopted 5 directives almost unanimously here in Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and they obviously need to be applied, together with a previous directive on dumping waste at sea which - theoretically - is being applied.
Now all that remains is to see if it is being applied in practice.
We also need to push ahead with the European Commission's other proposal on a European Solidarity Fund.
May I remind you that the European Parliament approved these proposals by the European Commission and that the proposal has stuck with the Council.
So pressure needs to be brought to bear on the Council.
I totally agree with a ban on the carriage of heavy petroleum products by single-hull tankers.
May I remind you that, as rapporteur, I personally proposed this when we were discussing withdrawing single-hull vessels.
Unfortunately, it is recorded in the Minutes of the European Parliament but was not accepted because certain know-it-alls popped up left, right and centre and said that the proposal was not feasible.
I believed it was feasible then and I believe it is feasible now and that you should move in this direction, Commissioner.
What Mr Sterckx said about environmentally sensitive areas is also right.
We need to mark out corridors for tankers so as to ensure that these areas are not polluted.
Most importantly at this stage the European Union needs to show its solidarity with the people of Galicia.
We need to help these people.
We have the Structural Funds, we have the Solidarity Fund and we need to do our very best to help Galicia get back to normal as quickly as possible.
Mr President, the 'Prestige' tanker disaster is an appalling tragedy.
We must show solidarity here, and - as our Portuguese and Spanish colleagues should know - it must be tangible rather than abstract.
That is why the region and the people there need assistance from Europe quickly.
I do not think that anyone would question this.
We should be aware, however, that this disaster could be repeated any day, Commissioner, because for years it has been the same old story.
The combination of an ancient tanker that is only fit for the scrap heap and a flag of convenience - this time of the Bahamas - is usually the cause.
Flags of convenience are synonymous with poor quality, a poor vessel, poor technology and a poor crew.
Usually the story ends with a coordinated reluctance to claim responsibility so that no one knows any more who is actually to blame for what.
That, Commissioner, is the reason for Paragraph 3 of our motion.
As soon as all of the information is on the table, we will expect to receive a report from you stating who was responsible for this disaster, when, how and why.
I think that a few words will also have to be reserved for the Spanish authorities in this context.
I have been surprised at some of the statements made by ministers of transport over the last few days and at the demands that they are now making.
Clearly these transport ministers have forgotten that, for example, the regulation on compensation in cases of liability for oil pollution, which the Commission and Parliament have passed, has been lying on the table in the Council for over a year without any action being taken.
Commissioner, you have Parliament's full support if you want to put a bomb under these gentlemen in the Council so that we finally get legislation soon.
Where incidents of this kind are concerned, we have to call to account the oil companies, the shipowners, the cargo owners and the classification societies.
The system of flags of convenience cannot continue in its present form, Commissioner.
I appeal to you to consider making a proposal on this.
We need European shipping; we need good European vessels with good European crews.
Flags of convenience are a blight on the system.
Help to eradicate them by making a good Commission proposal.
Parliament will give it speedy consideration.
Mr President, I as an EU citizen feel greatly affected by the fact that it was possible for this disaster to take place.
This is yet another disaster, although we said after the last one that it was too late to lock the stable door after the horse had bolted.
The stable door had clearly not been locked.
The facts had not been sufficiently spelled out, something for which the politicians are at fault.
I agree with Mrs de Palacio when she states that the Council has failed to assume its responsibility.
It has done a disservice to the people who live along the Spanish coast, a disservice to the fishing industry, a disservice to the environment and, above all, a disservice to transport by water, a topic to which we want to devote so much attention.
It is particularly unfortunate that we need another disaster to put this topic on the agenda.
I also think that we should adopt this resolution and that we all need to ensure that it is accepted across the political spectrum so as to avoid another repeat.
After all, citizens are not concerned with which political body is responsible for this.
They are left to pick up the pieces, so they need help.
I think it is our joint duty to keep a very close eye on this and also to monitor the implementation of the solution of the problem which we are now facing.
I see that the first towed hopper dredges are now at work.
However, according to the weather forecast, the winds will pick up this evening and then we are back to square one tomorrow.
In short, I hope that, given this thick crude oil, you will also ensure that oil can possibly be drained from the actual tanker.
Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of Mr Dhaenen, my Flemish and Green colleague, who is a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
First of all, I should like to put on record my and our solidarity with the people in Galicia.
This is a social tragedy for those who live by the sea and tourism.
The true scale of this economic and ecological disaster is starting to dawn ever more clearly.
A true catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes.
Galicia's green coast is gradually turning black.
The indignation is growing by the hour.
Everyone is asking how this is possible after all those previous disasters.
The disaster involving the Erika is still fresh in our memories and the wreck of the Amoco Cadiz in 1978 awakened an environmental awareness in many of my generation.
Every time a disaster strikes, we are faced with the disastrous consequences of negligence.
It is a disgrace that the agency for maritime safety is not to be launched until some time next year.
It is a disgrace that port control should only be scant and, in many cases, implemented in a questionable manner.
It is a disgrace that single-hulled wrecks should still be bobbing their way around the oceans and that they should take their course past vulnerable regions.
There is something fundamentally wrong with our transport sector.
I would quote Mr Rijnigerd, a former director of the Rotterdam-based recovery firm Smit, who stated that 'trying to transport an oil shipment as cheaply as possible from Latvia to Gibraltar in an obsolete and poorly maintained tanker is asking for trouble'.
There are therefore bad apples that need to be removed.
They are sharks that slip through the net.
However, we should admit that the net that is supposed to catch them is yet to be put in place.
We as Greens support more transport by water, but those highways at sea should not be accessible to cowboys and environmental criminals.
We would argue in favour of less transport, less use of fossil fuels and more involvement by a greater, fully-fledged, ecological European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin, of course, by expressing my solidarity with the communities that have been affected.
On these occasions, we must focus on what is most urgent: the need to mobilise technical and financial resources in order to minimise environmental damage, to regenerate ecosystems and to support the economic activities that have been affected by this accident.
There is, however, a debate which, although not quite as urgent, is nonetheless of the utmost importance: that of responsibility.
In this matter, the 'polluter pays' rule must be enforced, by investigating, prosecuting and punishing those responsible.
We must, however, go beyond looking for someone to blame.
We must determine the responsibility, firstly of those who should have inspected but did not and of those who did inspect but did not act.
Secondly, we must determine the responsibility of those who managed the crisis, in particular, we must clarify the reason why the EU as a whole was not involved in managing the risk from the very outset, given that it was known that the consequences of the accident would easily move beyond the confines of one country and would affect the entire natural heritage of Europe.
As for the future, I hope that the Member States will heed the well-drafted call and the leadership of Commissioner de Palacio, with a view to immediately implementing the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages and give a boost to the creation of the European Safe Seas Agency.
Mr President, first of all, with the sincerity that everyone will acknowledge in a Frenchman from the Atlantic region, I would like to express my solidarity and compassion to all the people and professionals in Galicia and Portugal who are affected by this further disaster.
I think that the situation that we are in is extremely dangerous, as the public has good reason, as these disasters keep reoccurring, for wondering, doubting, becoming impatient and even rising up against the impotence of the public authorities.
However, Commissioner, you are right in saying that the European Union has done a great deal, that it has done its duty in a quite remarkable timescale in terms of legislation.
So where is the problem?
I think that it was stated by Mr Varaut.
The problem is that we are in a field in which there is urgency, in which the task of the public authorities to ensure security is highly desired by the people and in which, in reality, joint sovereignty creates considerable problems.
My government, in recent days, was upset that measures had not yet entered into force; France is lagging behind in terms of checks in ports.
I think that we will only overcome this situation if one day, as soon as possible, we manage to create an independent European area of maritime safety, with independent legislation, which would use regulations rather than directives - as the directives are still not practically transposed in any Member State - with independent checks and penalties.
I think that this should be our ambition, or we will fail and will condemn our people to the sad spectacle of a ping-pong match between the Commission and the European Union, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other hand, each of them trying to beat the other in dramatic circumstances that the people do not understand.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is very little 'prestige' here, quite the contrary.
What has happened off the Galician coasts with this peculiar oil tanker, originating from a tax haven, with a flag of convenience and furthermore, in unfair competition and trading oil in a very strange way, cannot and must not happen again in any of the seas of the planet.
It is clear that we must be increasingly demanding in terms of safety in transport, especially in the transport of dangerous goods and at sea.
In our case, we must adopt appropriate measures so that there is no repetition of disasters such as the one that has taken place with this dreadful oil slick, the significant ecological impact of which should oblige us Members of this Parliament to reflect.
It begs the question, how many more oil tankers do we have to endure?
Has account been taken of the negative impact of this ecological disaster on fishing, on nature, on tourism, on the society in this Galicia Finisterre?
Until when?
It depends on us, but we must speed up and review the measures adopted in the Erika case - as the Commissioner has just rightly pointed out.
Finally, I would like once again to express our solidarity with the Galicians and I hope the European Union demonstrates that same solidarity through its actions.
Mr President, Commissioner, the feelings that we have in the face of this tragedy are feelings of anger.
Anger at its tragic consequences, and also anger because we have had enough of Europe being accused.
If we had followed the Commission, if we had followed the European Parliament, we would not be in this position.
We have had enough of being accused for no reason when we have adequate legislation and there is no further need to legislate.
The legislation needs to be applied and that is the problem.
After the sinking of the Erika, France, which then held the presidency of the European Union, and the Socialist government at the time, had made maritime safety an absolute priority.
If the situation was not so tragic, one could laugh at it.
You know the result!
France was criticised by the European Commission for not respecting the directive on checks in ports.
That is enough!
We have had enough of the failings of the Member States and the Council.
Indeed, the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, has just asked for maritime safety to be a priority on the agenda of the next European Council meeting.
I hope that no coastal Member State will fail to answer that call.
We have the legislation, which is adequate, with the 'Erika II' package.
It needs to be applied.
We need to increase checks, ensure the integrity of those who carry out those checks and define which ports should be able to receive vessels in distress.
We should also express our complete solidarity with the people of Galicia, who are going to suffer terribly in terms of fishing and tourism.
Having said that, the environmental tragedy is even worse, as it cannot be repaired by just giving subsidies.
Brittany is suffering and will continue to suffer for a long time in terms of its biodiversity and ecological balance, which are essential for maintaining fish resources and preserving species.
What is the use of 'Natura 2000' and our protection directives if we do nothing about maritime security?
Today the Council is responsible for having blocked the legislation that we adopted.
Today, it is the people of the coastal States, European citizens, who are asking you, Commissioner, to be uncompromising.
Mr President, this is without doubt a global disaster affecting all European coastlines and Europe must pool all its resources to combat it.
That is why I am dismayed by the reports that the Commissioner is suggesting Gibraltar was in some way responsible because it failed to inspect the ship.
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that the Prestige has only called in at Gibraltar once in the last five years and then it did not even enter the port, it refuelled outside.
In that period it has also put in at several other ports, including Algeciras, Las Palmas, Dunkirk, Cork, Rotterdam and Kalamata.
We have a saying in Glasgow: if you live in a glasshouse you do not have sex with your gardener!
After the Braer sank off the coast of Scotland in 1992, Neil Kinnock put forward legislation on double-hull vessels.
As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, that was deferred by the Council until 2015.
However, we need new legislation now to close up the loopholes.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Prestige disaster once again demonstrates the insufficiency of Community actions to put an end to the strategies of certain ship owners and owners of oil cargoes of ignoring the legislation on safety in maritime transport.
Despite the fact that history repeats itself, it is still difficult to establish data on the origin and destination of the cargo, as well as its exact characteristics.
Old ships are still operating, using flags of convenience of countries which are less demanding in terms of safety, with crews which in most cases do not have the necessary professional qualifications and knowledge for this type of transport.
It is clear that a problem that is repeated so often and which has such serious consequences for the economy of a region and for its marine and coastal ecosystems must be dealt with rigorously and quickly by means of joint measures in all the Member States of the European Union.
Measures such as the extension of sea corridors should not be made to wait, so that ships transporting dangerous goods are further from the coast, especially when they are sailing through areas of high ecological sensitivity such as the Galician coasts.
We must also urgently consider bringing forward the obligatory demand for double hulls and intensify and improve the quality of inspections.
This has been said very clearly by Commissioner de Palacio.
Furthermore, all the Community legislation must enter into force as soon as possible: the Erika I and Erika II packages.
But above all it is essential that the existing rules are applied.
Neither must we forget the human face of this disaster and the importance of the aid reaching its destination as soon as possible.
Yesterday I was in Galicia, where the desolation of the fishermen is truly striking.
These people deserve, by means of this debate and the urgent measures stemming from it, a decisive contribution from the European Union aimed at recovering their confidence in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable natural landscape of Galicia's coasts and the Minho estuary as well as the communities living along the coasts are once again under threat, this time from this appalling shipwreck, which is a veritable showcase of everything that should no longer be happening on our seas.
How many more disasters do we need before effective measures are adopted?
There is considerable indignation, but this indignation must be followed up with emergency measures; we must not simply wait for these long deadlines for the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages to be met.
Expressing moral solidarity and demonstrating sympathy are not enough; we must act as rapidly as possible and, as I said, adopt emergency measures.
There must now be effective solidarity, particularly with the communities of northern Portugal, which will be the first to suffer the consequences of this accident, of this shipwreck, the likes of which must never happen again on our coasts; unless we adopt such measures, the people themselves will make their scepticism about Europe and European governments clear.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say firstly that I am speaking on behalf of Mr PÃ©rez Ãlvarez, a Galician, who has had to return to his region urgently.
I would like to say that I fully agree with the Commissioner's words and support those measures which offer a clear line of action.
We also share her desire for their application to be speeded up.
This is what is needed, and what we do not need is any more political demagoguery such as that expressed in some speeches we have heard here.
Perhaps these are the thoughts of a Galician countryman, whose future and family situation is looking grim following what has been described as the worst ecological, economic and social disaster in the history of Galicia.
We understand that the people of Galicia are today sad and angry, and that sadness and anger has known and identifiable faces: each and every one of the people directly affected by the oil slick caused by the oil tanker disaster, and each and every one of the Galicians who, in Galicia and throughout the world, love their homeland and all of those of us who feel solidarity with them.
On the other side are the people responsible, whose faces are obscured behind flags of convenience and legal procedures distorted to this end, and with a view to fraudulently avoiding the rules of the internal market, without caring about possible ecological damage - which is now real - and social and economic harm, and, without wanting to be alarmist, the damage which may also be in store for other coastal areas as the result of a domino effect.
I believe that enough has been said and that we must look forward, learning from the lessons of the immediate past.
The Galician Government has said that it is not going to impose any limits on the aid to the people affected.
The Spanish Government and the European Commission is announcing measures.
But situations such as this cannot and must not happen again, and we must repair and prevent the effects which may yet extend to other areas of Galicia or Portugal, because the risk remains there.
We will all be grateful for the measures taken, especially those who live, work and suffer along our coasts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by expressing my deepest political solidarity with our neighbours and friends in Galicia, for the suffering that this tragedy is causing them now and will cause in future.
The European Union and its Member States must therefore spare no effort to help to minimise the scale of the effects of the disaster and compensate the main victims as far as possible for the damage caused.
We must take the opportunity of the Prestige oil tanker disaster to make a few observations.
The first is that this accident must be subject to a rigorous inquiry, not only with regard to the EU's safety rules covering this type of transport but also into the reason for the course taken by the ship, which having moved away to the west, suddenly headed southwards, and sank only thirty miles outside Portuguese waters.
My second observation is that we must understand that this disaster could also seriously affect the northern coast of Portugal, if not now, then later, and the European Union also needs to consider aid for Portugal to improve its resources for mobilisation, monitoring and prevention.
The fisheries sector, as a matter of fact, has already begun to be affected.
Lastly, despite the fact that the tragedy's effects will clearly be felt in many sectors of the economy, there is no doubt that the most badly affected sector is that of fisheries and aquiculture.
I therefore feel it is crucial that, in the framework of the aid that is to be mobilised, thought is given to the need for a specific emergency plan for these sectors.
I do not think that the EUR 117.7 million Commissioner Fischler announced for Spain and the EUR 15 million for Portugal will resolve the problems, not only because of the overall amount, which is limited, but also because, where Portugal is concerned, the option must be left open for this amount to be increased if the situation on its coasts grows worse.
Furthermore, we will have to bear in mind that compensation for the prolonged suspension of fishing alone will not suffice.
What is needed, perhaps, is to think about another, more fundamental type of measure to provide alternative employment for these fishermen, for example, fishing in other waters in the medium term.
Mr President, the wreck of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Galicia is a great misfortune the like of which should never again have happened in the Union after the Erika accident.
Member States have committed to the practice whereby loading ports are obliged to assess the condition of vessels and, if necessary, stop the ship from leaving without repairs being done if the risk is considered to be too great.
Unfortunately, this practice still does not apply to the applicant countries, and this ship had picked up its cargo at a port in the Baltic Sea.
The risk is especially great in the Baltic, where there is heavy regular traffic and consignments often consist of materials and substances that the Baltic ecology simply would not be able to withstand if harmed by them.
As someone who lives on the Baltic coast I now wish to express my deep sorrow for the residents of Galicia and all those whose livelihood is now in great peril.
Obviously, making ports responsible for the condition of vessels to be loaded is not enough.
The owners of freight must also be made accountable, as they also have an interest in ensuring that their consignments are organised responsibly and safely.
Secondly, the practices of insurance companies and the terms and conditions they offer will have to be changed if necessary by means of Community legislation so that the cheapest option for a shipowner is not sinking his ship when it is in distress.
Insurance law must be based on the notion that rescuing the ship must be possible and the cheapest option for the policyholder.
We have to switch to these practices swiftly and without making any exceptions.
It is regrettable that the legislators should become wise and energetic only after an accident has happened.
When, however, the accident has faded in people's memories no wise or urgent measures are taken to avoid accidents in the future.
On the contrary, everyone frantically starts looking after their own interests and the struggle to lengthen the periods of transition commences, as people want to dodge the regulations in the hope of getting off lightly.
We need a Prestige package as an extension to the Erika package, which the Commission should start drafting right away with a view to producing something quickly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to reply to Mr Miller, because I believe he has the wrong information.
I have here for your perusal the precise movements of the Prestige during 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, provided by the maritime authority of the Bahamas.
In 1999, it reached the port of Rotterdam and that is when for the last time it had an in-depth inspection in accordance with the Paris Memorandum in a European port.
Then, before the summer, it reached the port of Kalamata, in Greece, and I have contacted the port and authorities there to ask what the state of the Prestige was in Greece and it was not inspected in accordance with the Paris Memorandum.
It then reached the port of Gibraltar and I have also approached the British authorities to ask why they did not carry out the control.
It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that I have not just asked them about the Prestige.
I have asked the Greek and British authorities about the application of the current legislation, of the Directive which demands control by port authorities, in accordance with the commitments relating in practice to the Paris Memorandum.
I have asked about controls and the application in these ports - Kalamata and Gibraltar - of the Directive currently in force.
I must tell the honourable Member that I have some statistics.
I can say that in Gibraltar, in 1999, five ships have been inspected. In 2000, six.
In 2001, two.
In 2002, twelve. Those are the statistics.
That is why I am saying the legislation must be reviewed in order to guarantee that these controls by port authorities are carried out in all the ports of the European Union. Because controls by port authorities have a deterrent effect, they have the effect of keeping away substandard ships, and this must happen in all ports.
Because if we leave gaps in our network, in our system, the whole thing is automatically weakened.
That is what I am saying. This is not a criticism of any particular port.
In this case, these two are involved: Kalamata and Gibraltar.
And I have asked for information.
But the problem is not with any particular port.
The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is that there has been an ecological disaster, a catastrophe which we should have prevented, and which we could have prevented if the Commission's proposals had entered into force.
And I would like to extend all the gratitude and acknowledgement expressed here today to all the members of the Directorate-General for Transport who have worked like Trojans, that is, extraordinarily hard, without watching the clock, so that, when the Erika disaster happened, within just three months, we could present an entire coherent and global package to this House and the Council of Ministers so that these problems would not happen again.
That is what I am talking about.
And I am talking about the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that only 23 months have passed.
And precisely because only 23 months have passed and because there was a lack of ambition - as we all know - there has been another disaster.
How many more?
Well, that is my point.
Is it not possible that between now and June 2003 or February 2004 there will be a disaster in the Baltic, in the Mediterranean, in the Atlantic or off any other European Union coast, because the measures already adopted have not been implemented?
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have to demand - and this is what I have done in a letter to the Ministers - is that they be applied now.
The problem is that the Governments are behaving incoherently.
The Heads of State and Government said in Nice that the implementation of these measures had to be brought forward and then they do not apply them...
Infringement procedures have been opened against some of them for lack of application, not of the new rules, but of those currently in force, which are much less strict and much easier to comply with.
Our proposal meant that single-hull oil tankers, of category 1, that is, the largest ones, would have a maximum life of 23 years. Because there is clearly a problem with structures associated with the stress on metals caused by blows at sea, which arise after twenty or so years.
And what I regret is that this proposal of ours should not be accepted and that it be raised from 23 to 27 years.
And that is what the current problems stem from.
Aid, ladies and gentlemen.
We are working on this.
There will be the aid provided by the Spanish authorities.
What we clearly have are the FIPOL funds.
And I would point out that there is an expert from the Directorate-General for Transport, in Spain, cooperating with the Spanish authorities, just as it cooperated with the French authorities to facilitate the payment of all that aid and of that compensation for the various people affected.
We are also looking at issues relating to fishing to see what possibilities there may be for support in terms of the FIFG funds.
We are looking at the possibility of applying the Solidarity Fund, but I believe it will not be possible - I say this clearly.
The thresholds for the use of the Solidarity Fund are so high that I hope that the damage does not reach that level, because then it would really be an horrendous tragedy.
We would be talking about more than EUR 3 000 million, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us hope that it does not go that far.
We are therefore also looking at the support that can be provided if, despite everything, that EUR 3 000 million is not reached but there is a significant effect on the region of Galicia, in which case support could also be provided by means of this Solidarity Fund.
I hope that Portugal can be spared from this tragedy.
I hope that the winds will not allow the oil slick to reach their coast.
I would like the Spanish coasts not be to be affected any further, but let us hope, at least, that the Portuguese coasts stay clean.
In any event, if Portuguese coasts were also affected, the funds would be available to them as well, in the same form and the same way that they are available to the Spanish authorities and the Spanish people affected.
Ladies and gentlemen, what has been adopted must be put into practice.
There is a whole range of measures which form a coherent global whole, with a Maritime Safety Agency to guarantee, together with the Commission, the appropriate application of the rules.
We are going to set up this Maritime Safety Agency provisionally in Brussels, while they are deciding or not deciding on where the headquarters will be.
I am very sorry, but I am not going to wait for them to come to an agreement.
I hope it will be set up before the end of the year.
The second issue.
Amongst the aspects which correspond to the countries - the strengthening of port control, strengthening the demands on classification societies - we are of course going to hold a full investigation into what has happened - as I said before - of the whole chain, and I will present the results of our investigations to you: the whole chain of events which has led us to the final result, in relation to the classification societies as well.
We will also demand that the States of the Union designate ports and refuge areas in order to deal with situations such as that of the Erika, which was also one of the controversial elements, or that of the Prestige in this case.
Strictness in application. In the application and the demand for compliance with the regulations.
We are talking about going further.
I have made this very clear: International Maritime Organisation, corridors for dangerous products, sea room distances, special control in passes and straits, greater capacities for coastal States.
All of this within the context of the International Maritime Organisation, genuinely adapting maritime law to the demands and new circumstances of the 21st Century.
Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, we also have to deal in more depth with the issue of responsibility, we must present the issue of the COPE Funds once again to the Council of Ministers, as a complement to the FIPOL Fund; we must present the issue of criminal responsibility once again to the Council of Ministers and we must demand of the Ministers that, in all the Member States - and I believe this is possible in all of them by means of an administrative regulation - double hulls be required for the transportation of the most dangerous and polluting products, such as heavy fuel oil.
Mr Savary spoke of an autonomous European area of maritime safety.
The truth is that this is an issue which, of course, could be considered in the discussions within the Convention and the next Intergovernmental Conference.
I am sure you can imagine that it will not be I who disagrees with these ideas.
I would like to end by saying to Mrs GrossetÃªte that, in fact, all I feel, with everything that has happened over recent days, is a great sense of anger and rage, knowing that we could have prevented it and did not do so.
(Applause)
Commissioner, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos would like to ask you a further supplementary question.
Mr President, I only wanted to ask the Commissioner a very brief question.
I would firstly like to thank her, as a Galician, for the solidarity she has expressed in her speech today and I would like to ask her to present a report, as soon as possible, to the Transport Committee, on the application of the aid - in this case, clearly - she has just mentioned and, in particular, I would like to know, with regard to FIPOL, whether she could present us with a report on the timescales within which this insurance fund pays aid to the people affected.
Mr President, I will speak very briefly to say to the honourable Member that she knows I am especially sensitive to Galicia and that I can relate specific names, faces and landscapes to this tragedy, which undoubtedly means that one feels even more.
This does not mean that when the Erika accident happened - which was off the French coast - I acted any differently.
I went to Brittany then and tomorrow I am going to Galicia.
In any event, it will be a pleasure for me to present all the data on the issue of the FIPOL, on the analyses we make in relation to the Solidarity Fund, on whether it can be applied or not, on all the aspects, and I will also ask Commissioner Fischler for information on the fishing aspects, although I imagine he will give full explanations within the Committee on Fisheries.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 50).
The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions on the situation in Sudan:
B5-0593/2002 by Mr van den Bos and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Sudan;
B5-0594/2002 by Mr SjÃ¶stedt and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Sudan;
B5-0601/2002 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Sudan;
B5-0604/2002 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Sudan;
B5-0605/2002 by Mrs Carlotti and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on human rights in Sudan;
B5-0610/2002 by Mrs SchÃ¶rling and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Sudan.
Mr President, this debate on Sudan has had a successful outcome even before it has begun.
The invitation to the EU/ACP Assembly has, in the meantime, been withdrawn.
It is detrimental to cooperation in the spirit of Cotonou that the proposal of Sudan was adopted by the ACP states.
Did these states really think that we could hold an Assembly in a country where there are still constant and large-scale breaches of human rights?
In a country in which women and children are kidnapped and enslaved?
In a country in which the people in the south could be scourged by bombing for years on end and where Western oil companies looked after the interests of their shareholders while turning a blind eye to the victims of the slaughter?
There now, fortunately, appears to be a truce, but how long will it hold?
There can be collaboration with the European Union only when there is a lasting peace and when the government restores all freedoms and puts an end to all the abominable injustices.
Only then will anything durable come of debates such as this one today.
Mr President, Commissioner, in this afternoon's topical and urgent debate we must also turn our attention to the war in Sudan, one of the largest and most populous countries in Africa.
Civil war has been raging there for 19 years.
More than two million people have lost their lives because of this war.
It has brought immense suffering for the people in the south of Sudan who are fighting for cultural, political and economic independence.
In the larger part of Sudan that is under government control there is no freedom of thought or religion and no possibility of peaceful assembly.
Human rights continue to be treated with contempt. Government forces are blanket-bombing regions in the south with heavy civilian casualties.
More than 200 death sentences have been passed by unconstitutional emergency courts in Darfur State.
The oil discoveries in Sudan have not yet led to a return to peace.
On the contrary, they serve to replenish the war chest of the Khartoum government.
There is a ray of hope: the peace talks in Machakos in Kenya, which have led to the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement.
This has been drafted, but is not yet in force.
First, unimpeded access must be provided for aid consignments for the people starving in the south of Sudan.
This must also lead to a permanent ceasefire on both sides, which is respected by everyone.
While the situation remains critical and the peace process has not yet made sufficient progress, there is no prospect of holding the sixth meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Sudan in spring 2003.
In any case, we will not go there while the current situation persists. We do hope, however, that this will be possible at a later stage.
I should like to stress that Sudan's Ambassador here is doing a great deal through diplomatic channels to hasten a return to peace.
We therefore call on the African countries to organise the next ACP-EU Assembly in another, more peaceful country in Africa.
Mauritania, which wishes to take on this task, should be specifically encouraged to do so.
Mr President, the emergency in Sudan has become very acute.
We only need to consider the title of the recent report by the International Crisis Group, 'Ending starvation as a weapon of war in Sudan'.
Indeed, famine and death from starvation on a huge scale are being used as weapons of war in Sudan.
Yet, as the report also says, we really have no idea of how serious the emergency is, because of the remoteness of regions in which the war is raging unabated and in which these weapons are being used.
In the meantime, the warring parties appear to have concluded an agreement to extend the memorandum of understanding on humanitarian aid and the suspension of hostilities to 31 March.
Despite this courageous development, the decision indicates that the final peace settlement has not yet been achieved.
Fundamental bones of contention such as the fair distribution of power and of the income from oil wells still need to be solved in ways acceptable to both parties.
Now that the negotiations are only to be resumed in January, the international pressure upon the warring parties to reach a definitive peace settlement definitely must not be relaxed, however, and certainly not now that a solution appears to be in sight to a conflict that has already lasted for 19 years.
It is estimated that approximately two million people have already lost their lives.
Twice as many people have been made homeless, and countless atrocities have been committed.
In particular, the Christians in the south have had to suffer severely from violence committed by the Muslims in the north.
I would therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to proceed extremely cautiously during the EU Troika mission to Sudan, planned for 9 and 10 December.
Only when a comprehensive peace settlement has been signed may relations between the EU and Sudan be normalised.
Finally, I would ask the Council, the Commission and also the Member States, if possible in cooperation with the Sudanese Government, painstakingly to investigate the rumours of a potential revival of al-Qa'ida's financial centre.
When all is said and done, we must not forget that, as you are all well aware, Sudan played host to Osama bin Laden from 1991 to 1996, and it would therefore be very useful to know whether activities are still going on in that quarter.
Mr President, we have to bear in mind that the situation in Sudan varies greatly depending on the region.
In the north we are dealing with a problematic regime, which is however displaying clear reformist tendencies, and which is supported by Egypt.
In the south we have a brutal and bloody civil war, which it would be too simplistic to describe solely as a conflict between Islam and Christianity.
There are also conflicts amongst Muslims themselves and amongst Christian tribes, although the main conflict is indeed between Christians and Muslims.
This shows that this is not actually a war of religion but a series of tribal conflicts, ethnic conflicts, and that interested parties, including interested parties in the oil industry - for once this must be said - are systematically fanning the flames of these conflicts.
That is why I am very grateful that the motion addresses this issue very clearly: the problematic role of certain parties who have interests in the natural resources - we have seen this in the Caucasus and in Congo too - and who are abusing ethnic conflicts to brutally increase their own profits.
That is why as Europeans we are not only under a particular obligation to influence the people in Sudan, to work with them on a peace solution and to exert pressure on all of the parties in the conflict, but we also have a duty to hold serious talks with our European oil companies operating out there and to make it clear to them how great their responsibility is for this strategically important region and for the people who live there.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that the war in Sudan is the result of certain interests and ethnic tensions, but, in my opinion, the religious nature of the current conflict should be highlighted.
We cannot accept the application of Islamic law in the institutions, which is why we have to step up pressure on the Sudanese Government to annul it, nor can we accept the severe violations of the fundamental rights of non-Muslims, forced conversions, forced marriages and enslavement.
We cannot support a political solution which would mean turning back the clock and applying the principle: 'cuius regio, eius religio'.
The path we choose should be to support the cause of the forces in the south and the north that are calling for a secular state and democratic institutions.
The solution cannot and must not be that of world division on the basis of religious beliefs.
Mr President, I may not look like Mr Schulz but I am deputising for him.
The Socialist Group is deeply concerned by the continuing civil war that has claimed around two million casualties over the last 19 years.
Of course we welcome the signing on 15 October of the peace agreement between the government in Sudan and the SPLA.
We will be looking very closely at whether the government's pledge to respect human rights and the rule of law is met and whether there are moves towards democratisation that will result in the establishment of a democratically elected executive and legislature.
We ask the Commission to provide us with a report on the possible involvement of European oil companies in abuses committed against local communities in the oil- producing areas.
We certainly do not support the idea that the ACP-EU Parliamentary assembly should meet in Sudan next year.
It may be possible in the future but we will have to see how things develop in Sudan.
We need a dialogue between Sudan and the European Union, but before we resume normal relations we would want to see progress towards ending terrorism and support for terrorist groups, religious tolerance, human rights and of course an end to the civil war.
Mr President, promotion of a peaceful solution and respect for human rights and humanitarian law remain at the heart of relations between the Commission and Sudan.
The current conflict and the ongoing violations of human rights are the main obstacle to the socio-economic development of the country, as several speakers have rightly pointed out.
The Commission firmly believes that respect for human rights would enable peace to return to Sudan.
In accordance with the conclusions adopted by the Council in June 2002, the Union intends to proceed step by step.
Until a peace agreement has been reached, the Union will continue political dialogue on the basis of the commitments made by the Sudanese Government for 2002 in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, with particular emphasis on reaching a peace agreement.
Should such an agreement be reached, the Union will begin to normalise its relations with Sudan, within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement, basing them on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. At the same time, it will encourage the peace process and resolution of the conflicts.
We plan to endorse a national strategy document and a national indicative programme following the conclusion of the peace agreement or whenever the Commission considers it politically appropriate, following consultation with the Member States.
I would add, also in relation to specific points which have been raised, that the Commission is going to participate in the visit of the European Union Troika to Sudan, scheduled for December, during which we will assess EU/Sudan political dialogue over the course of 2002.
I would, however, like to emphasise that the implementation of the measures laid down in the national strategy document is subject to progress in political dialogue.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:
B5-0591/2002 by Mr Johan Van Hecke and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the torture and crimes committed by the military and on the human rights situation in Bangladesh;
B5-0596/2002 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Bangladesh;
B5-0602/2002 by Mr Thomas Mann and Mrs Martens, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on human rights in Bangladesh;
B5-0606/2002 by Mrs Carrilho and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human rights situation in Bangladesh;
B5-0609/2002 by Mrs Lambert and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Bangladesh.
Acts of violence have afflicted Bangladesh ever since that country was founded.
From the beginning, the political system has been undermined by murder, revenge and rivalry between the most important families.
The spiral of ceaseless revenge has not been broken.
On the contrary, the situation is going from bad to worse, in particular through the alarming growth of radical Islamic groups.
The government's approach is, unfortunately, not aimed at reducing the tension and solving the problems.
Members of Parliament are put in prison.
Large-scale indiscriminate arrests take place, and people are tortured and even murdered in prisons.
The European Union must actively concern itself with the situation in Bangladesh on the basis of the cooperation agreement we have with that country.
Cooperation cannot continue unconditionally if human rights are being violated on a huge scale.
We must insist that a national human rights commission be set up to carry out independent examinations, and immunity from punishment must be brought to an end.
The police and military must prevent and combat violence instead of fuelling it.
What is crucial to a solution is to restore a minimum basis of trust between government and opposition.
The future must not forever remain the hostage of the past.
Nothing will come of the development of this impoverished country if it is possible for the acts of violence to continue unabated.
Mr President, in the past few weeks the escalating violence in Bangladesh has reached new heights.
In October alone, around 40 000 soldiers were deployed in 'Operation Clean Heart' on the pretext of fighting rising levels of crime and private gun ownership.
Several thousand people were arrested.
We know from reliable, independent sources that this military operation, ordered by the Islamist Government in Bangladesh, was directed primarily at the regime's critics.
Among those arrested were opposition members of the Bangladeshi Parliament, including the former minister, Mr Chowdhury. Leaders of unpopular NGOs were also arrested.
The army units carried them off without any legal authority.
Most of the suspects are either Hindus themselves or Hindu sympathisers.
This minority has however lived peacefully alongside the Muslim majority for decades.
The growing, and radical, Islamicisation of society and its political leaders is making everyday life increasingly difficult.
Those in custody are cut off from the outside world. Many are being tortured.
Hundreds of injured detainees had to receive hospital treatment.
In the last month alone there were 25 deaths.
The army's claim that they had all died of heart attacks is cynical.
This action is contemptuous of humankind and in violation of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The PPE-DE Group's position is clear: we call on the Bangladeshi Government to return to the rule of law, pluralism and parliamentary democracy.
The imprisoned members of parliament and other innocent detainees must be released.
I agree with Mr van den Bos: an independent body needs to be set up to investigate the arrests, ill-treatment and killings.
Only then will Bangladesh be able to recover the necessary internal stability.
The European Union must also make its contribution, Commissioner Monti.
In our motion, we have cross-party support for calling on the Commission to send observers to Bangladesh, and this should be done before there is further discrimination and persecution.
The agreement between the European Union and Bangladesh is based on consistent respect for human rights and on democratic principles.
Should these continue to be violated to the same degree then we will have to bring political pressure to bear and that means suspending our Cooperation Agreement.
Such important signals are easily understood throughout Asia as well as in other countries.
We in the SAARC Delegation can give many examples to confirm this.
We therefore hope that those responsible in Bangladesh will see reason and that they will do so because of the severe pressure that can be put on them within the SAARC.
Only then will our respectable counterparts in Bangladesh be taken seriously at international level.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Italian Radical Members fully support the resolution that has been tabled.
At a meeting with the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Mrs Sheikh Hasina, attended by myself and a number of my fellow Members a few days ago in Brussels, we were told of the situation of ongoing violations, tyranny and improper use of the - de facto - army to repress civil rights, not to mention the political rights, of thousands of this country's nationals.
The Commission should take steps to demand the withdrawal of the army, which is being used without a proper legal basis as a means of policing the public and of political repression.
Last January, when answering a parliamentary question, Commissioner Patten said that the situation in Bangladesh was improving and that the Commission would undertake to monitor it.
All the news, both direct and indirect, which comes out of the country shows that, in actual fact, the situation has taken a very dangerous and worrying turn, which is why we are calling on the Commission to take action.
Mr President, while politically motivated violence and confrontation, as well as the prevailing law and order situation, have been a major concern for the Bangladeshi population for years, the European Union and the international donor community in general are fully aware that the law and order situation has worsened during the last year.
The EU has underlined its concern at the deterioration of law and order and the increase in violence against minorities in its 'Human rights in the world' speech at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
The European Union is very concerned about the general human rights situation and the continued reports of torture and deaths in custody, following the launch of Operation Clean Heart, aimed at halting the decline in law and order in Bangladesh, to which several Members referred to a few minutes ago.
We are also very concerned about the possible bias in the implementation of this operation and about the delays in implementing or failure to implement reforms such as the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the ombudsman and the creation of an independent human rights commission.
The EU consequently welcomes the European Parliament's resolution on Operation Clean Heart and the general human rights situation in Bangladesh.
However, there are a couple of points in the resolution which we believe no longer reflect the current situation or are not substantiated by evidence on the ground.
If one compares the situation of politically-motivated violence against the Hindu community before and after the national elections, we can see that reported violence and intimidation of minorities has significantly decreased.
We should send a clear message calling on the government to ensure that the rights and security of all minority communities are fully respected.
As regards Operation Clean Heart, it must be noted that donor communities, as well as civil society, have frequently voiced their concern over the deteriorating law and order situation during this government's first year in office.
The government launched the operation as a result of this pressure and the failure to deal with the situation by introducing new laws and tightening up on the existing ones.
While we acknowledge the need to improve the law and order situation - and we are ready to support the government of Bangladesh in its attempt to restore law and order - we firmly believe that this must be done under the rule of law and with full respect for human rights.
Under no circumstances can exceptions to these principles be allowed.
That is why the European Commission, through its delegation in Dhaka, will continue to monitor the situation and the political developments very closely.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions:
B5-0592/2002 by Mr van den Bos and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Iran;
B5-0595/2002 by Mrs Boudjenah and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the case of Hashem Aghajari in Iran;
B5-0603/2002 by Mr Gahler and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the case of Hashem Aghajari in Iran;
B5-0607/2002 by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the death sentence against Hashem Aghajari in Iran;
B5-0608/2002 by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Iran.
Mr President, even if Doctor Hachem Aghajari does not receive the death penalty, Iran nonetheless remains condemned to domination by its ultra-conservative religious leaders.
The success of the student demonstrations cannot conceal the fact that the human rights situation has not improved but has, in fact, deteriorated.
The stoning of women, public hanging, torture and other barbaric practices mean that Iran still does not fulfil the elementary demands of civilisation.
It is therefore astonishing that the European Union has not tabled a resolution concerning the situation in Iran in the UN General Assembly Third Committee.
Many Member States say that they have high expectations of the human rights dialogue but, in reality, instead have high expectations of their lucrative business interests.
The European Union must not let itself be taken for a ride.
On the day before the European delegation of negotiators arrived in Teheran, five people were publicly hanged.
The dialogue must not be a reason for failing to put the human rights situation in Iran on the agenda in international fora.
That is why, in the spring, the European Union must submit a resolution to the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
Naturally, it is important not to isolate Iran.
Contacts must be established, but good use must be made of these, and the reformers must be given as much support as possible.
A political dialogue clause in a future agreement is not enough.
In my group's judgment, no cooperation agreement can be concluded as long as there is still gross and systematic abuse of human rights.
Aid to terrorist organisations is also an obstacle to such cooperation.
The situation in the country is becoming more explosive by the day, and it is therefore also high time that there were genuine reforms in Iran.
There can only be constructive dealings with Iran if the truth is allowed to prevail and if supreme authority lies with the people.
Mr President, it was on 23 October, not even a month ago, that we discussed, here in this Parliament, the human rights situation.
We all condemned the death sentences and stonings and the general way in which this inhumane Iranian regime treats its people.
At that time we also expressed regret - at least my group did - that the Council had decided not to table a human rights motion on Iran at the next meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
Now, only a short time later, someone is sentenced to death when all he has done is to urge people to think things over, not to let their opinions be decided for them and not to blindly follow religious dogmatism.
In this situation the European Union is continuing to negotiate a cooperation agreement involving economic cooperation.
One of the statements in the motion is inadequate in my view.
It is obviously good if future cooperation agreements contain a human rights clause.
But I think it would be better - and I am saying this on behalf of my group - if there were no cooperation agreements at all and if they were not even concluded while human rights are not respected.
It is schizophrenic.
We only have a limited number of options when it actually comes to bringing pressure to bear.
We should not give up the possibility of exerting economic pressure on Iran.
Of course it is positive that the students are going out onto the streets.
Of course it is positive that President Khatami is saying that this verdict is unacceptable.
Of course it is positive that the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament is taking the same line.
But this has not come anywhere near to forcing a restructuring of Iranian society.
It is no accident either, in my view, that the Iranian religious leaders and the Iranian Government intend to remove the legitimate opposition in Iran by trying to make them out to be terrorist organisations and having them all put on the corresponding list so that they will have eliminated this opposition once and for all.
I think that we too have a great responsibility here.
We need to take more notice of who is put on these lists and why.
We should ask more questions; the European Union should not always stand to one side like a junior prison warder.
That is why we are calling on the Commission to make it quite clear at the next negotiations that there will not be any cooperation with Iran, economic or otherwise, for as long as this inhumane system remains as contemptuous of human rights as it is at present.
Mr President, the case of Dr Aghajari has rightly aroused huge interest and concern in Iran and abroad.
I share the view expressed by the Speaker, the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament, Mehdi Karroubi, who called the death sentence a disgrace to the country's judicial system.
However, I am not entirely convinced that it is as a matter of conviction that the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has ordered the judiciary to review the verdict.
Khamenei's previous record suggests rather that he is playing for time.
The student demonstrations should slowly die down, as should the interest shown in the case by the public both nationally and internationally.
It has, however, become clear in the demonstrations that the demonstrators are not only concerned about Dr Aghajari, but that they want more democracy altogether.
In fact this verdict, like many others, is not motivated by religious concerns, but by political ones.
We are familiar with this from European history, when the State and the church were not yet separate.
The rulers of the time used Christianity, too, as a means of realising their own claims to power until it could no longer be recognised as such.
Iranian society is, however, one step ahead of the conservative judiciary and clerics.
This is clear, amongst other things, from the most recent proposals for reform put forward by the Iranian Parliament, which seek to restrict the absolute power of the Council of Guardians.
I call on the Council and the Commission to pursue the dialogue on human rights in all their contacts with Iran and to be clear that without the European Parliament there will be no agreement on cooperation and trade.
The opposition in the Iranian Parliament, both in Iran and abroad, is also very hopeful that economic interests will not be our only reason to hold contacts with this country.
I think that we will also be able to make our views and basic position known when we welcome members of the Iranian Parliament on the occasion of their return visit to this House.
For our part, it will always be clear that we are on the side of more democracy and not on the side of those who want to turn the clock back several hundred years.
Mr President, I disagree with Mr Markov.
Iran is a complex society.
There is evidence of some progress towards an Islamic society that is in tune with the modern world.
President Khatami and his reformist allies are a symbol of that modernisation.
However, President Khatami is being constantly frustrated by the more fundamentalist elements of Iranian society.
That is why the EU is currently engaged in negotiating a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran.
This is not currently in doubt, though it must be clear to the Iranian authorities that at the same time we will expect and require an agreement on human rights.
The death sentence on Dr Hashem Aghajari for apostasy on the basis of some obscure theological dispute is incomprehensible to the West.
We welcome President Khatami's intervention, the action of lecturers and students in protesting and Dr Aghajari's own appeal for calm.
We welcome the threat of resignation by President Khatami, the cabinet and dozens of MPs, should the Council of Guardians veto legislation that is being proposed to limit its current absolute power.
However, we have to make it clear to the government of Iran that we will be watching the outcome of this and similar cases with close interest, in terms of our future relations with that country.
Mr President, we are greatly concerned about the new series of arrests and sentences which reformists and those who exercise their fundamental right to freedom of expression in Iran have been subject to.
Following his speech last June on religious reform, given in western Iran, the university professor, Hashem Aghajari, was arrested and, this month, was sentenced to 74 lashes, followed by eight years' imprisonment and the death penalty.
Professor Aghajari, who lost his right leg during the Iran-Iraq War, needs medical attention.
He was expected to appeal to a higher court, but Professor Aghajari had the courage to defy the legal system by refusing to go to appeal.
For several days, Teheran has been the scene of heated student protests and, I am glad to say, President Khatami has announced that he does not support the sentence, which was ordered to be reviewed on 17 November by Supreme Leader Khamenei.
In the past, we have called repeatedly on Iran to apply the death penalty only to people who have committed the most serious crimes, in observance of the commitments assumed in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
In its Conclusions on 21 October, the Council agreed to initiate a dialogue with Iran on human rights, thereby confirming its concern over this area, including violations of civil and political rights and, especially, freedom of expression.
The Council also mentioned its traditional, resolute opposition to the death penalty.
On 18 and 19 November in Brussels, President Prodi and Commissioner Patten met Iran's Foreign Minister, Mr Kharrazi, who undertook to participate in future dialogue between the European Union and Iran on human rights, and challenged, together with other leading Iranian figures, Professor Aghajari's unjustified sentence.
The dialogue on human rights is, in effect, an appropriate forum for the consideration of individual cases.
The Commission will monitor developments extremely closely and remain in contact with Parliament and the Member States.
I would like to add that the Commission feels that initiating the talks, which will also include a political dialogue, is in the interests of Iran and the European Union - see the Conclusions of 17 June 2002 - and, furthermore, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will contain a clause on human rights.
In addition, the negotiation process will allow us to exert pressure while, at the same time, supporting President Khatami and the reformists.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately after this debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, as a point of order I would like to request the floor before the vote on the two amendments, because I would like to propose an oral amendment to each of them.
I would also like to table a point of order, before moving on to the vote, which will be a joint one concerning the whole text, because there are some linguistic corrections which I would like to point out to the services, since we have worked very quickly and some errors have slipped in which I will now mention, Mr President.
We negotiators agreed that, by means of oral amendments and corrections, we could adapt the text if the circumstances had changed.
Recital A mentions 'recent hours', and much has happened since the hull was ruptured; it should say 'recent days', because some days have passed rather than hours.
In Recital B, where it talks about oil, it should say 'fuel', because we have agreed that 'fuel' should always be included.
In the Spanish version of Recital F the text 'especially birds' appears and we had agreed that the word 'especially' would not appear.
I therefore request that the word 'especially' be removed.
The Spanish version of Recital G says 'sea craftsmen such as oyster farmers and seafood breeders'.
I would ask that the Spanish version be corrected by saying 'sea workers such as mussel farmers, oyster farmers and other shellfishermen'.
In point 3, the Italian version does not match the other versions; it is the only one in which, in line 7, seven words have been included which must be removed since they do not appear in any of the other versions.
And finally, in point 11, it says 'maritime and/or fishing areas ' and, in Spanish, it should say 'maritime-fishing areas '.
That is all, Mr President.
Mr Varela, I will see to it that all of the language versions are cross-checked once more.
(The President established that there were no objections to the oral amendments)
Before the vote on Amendment No 1:
Mr President, I would like to present an oral amendment, because the amendment by the UEN Group includes Portugal.
We are not against this, but Spain and France do not appear, but rather Galicia and Brittany, and we believe - and we have discussed this with the Portuguese Members - that it should say: 'Galicia, Brittany and Northern Portugal'.
Mr President, I should like to do something that I have never done before, namely congratulate the Conference of Presidents in the plenary and thank them for including so many interesting debates on this afternoon's agenda.
This has set the standard for future plenary sittings!
Mr Balfe, neither of the diplomats will be allowed to enter the House.
Mr President, like many of the Members, I voted for the extension of Regulation 1408 because it is only right that all the citizens of the European Union who, during their working lives, have worked in various states in the Union, should receive a pension, a good pension.
I would like to take the opportunity to add that Regulation 1408 would be even better if it made it possible for workers to transfer their contributions, paid in each state where they have worked, to the state from which they would like to receive their pension.
This is already provided for in many bilateral agreements; we could also implement it in the European Union so that, as the years go by, we can have pensions that are increasingly better, more acceptable, larger and more substantial.
Mr President, I raise to table a point of order about the Minutes.
I am now receiving the Minutes later than I did previously and I have still not received the Minutes from Wednesday.
I have, on the other hand, received the Minutes from Tuesday, on which my name does not appear in the attendance register.
I should like this to be corrected because I was indeed present.
Resumption of the session
Mr President, I should like to make a brief statement on an incident which occurred this morning at our group meeting.
This particular group invited Mrs Andreassen to come and give evidence to us on a matter of technical information about the accounting systems.
We found much to our surprise that when we arrived, she had been gagged by the Commission and was not allowed to give any information to either the assembled parliamentarians or the press present.
What a clear majority of our political group would like to ask is whether the Commission can justify under what grounds Mrs Andreassen was gagged from giving us technical information about a substantive item which we need to know about.
Perhaps more importantly, how is it that the framework agreement between the Commission and the Parliament does not now allow us as parliamentarians to talk to people about technical matters and how far, therefore, does the Commission reach into our institution?
That is for our Bureau to decide and we would like to have clarity on that issue.
It is a matter for the Conference of Presidents and not the Bureau.
But Mrs Schreyer is speaking later, if you wish her to deal with this matter then she may - it will be entirely up to her.
You have the honour of sitting on the Conference of Presidents and that is a matter for the Conference of Presidents.
You can write to the President.
I am sure you can pick up the telephone and speak to him.
The next item is the debate on the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors for 2001.
Mr President, Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be able to present to you today the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors for 2001.
I have organised my comments into four main sections: firstly, the analysis of budgetary management; secondly, the follow-up given to the Court's previous observations; thirdly, the Statement of Assurance (DAS); and fourthly, the reform of the Commission.
Let us begin with the analysis of the implementation of the budget.
For the second consecutive year there has been a high budgetary surplus, greater than EUR 15 000 million (16% of the final budget).
The surplus is due to the cancellation of appropriations caused mainly by the delay in the implementation of structural measures.
It would have been appropriate to modify the budget to maintain the balance between the forecast expenditure and revenue.
Another crucial feature of the budgetary management was the low rate of use of payment appropriations in certain areas.
In the case of the Structural Funds, percentage of use was less then 70%, the lowest level since 1999.
Delays were also a feature of the implementation of pre-accession aid, especially in the case of the SAPARD programme, where only 9.2% of the appropriations were disbursed.
What is more, only EUR 1 million were received by the final beneficiaries of this programme. If the pace of implementation does not pick up, appropriations will have to be cancelled in 2003.
The Commission must continue its effort to clear the accounts by cancelling those commitments which can no longer be implemented.
Outstanding commitments amount to EUR 12 000 million in the case of external aid and to nearly 3 000 million in the case of the new pre-accession instruments.
The rate of implementation of the European Development Funds is just as sluggish.
After four years, only 30% of appropriations under the 8th EDF have been disbursed.
To conclude, the estimates made for these programmes in terms of implementation and payments need to be more realistic and take account of each country's capacity to absorb aid.
This would result in a more accurately calculated and balanced budget.
The Court has analysed the follow-up given to its previous observations.
Generally speaking, the Commission has taken appropriate steps to remedy the shortcomings highlighted.
For example, outward processing customs arrangements have been simplified, the legislation promoting joint enterprises in the fisheries sector has been improved and tendering procedures under the TACIS programme have been revised.
In other sectors developments have been less satisfactory. This is the case of the system of aid for durum wheat, where deficiencies that the Court pointed out in 1998 are still in evidence and some EUR 450 million are spent unnecessarily every year.
This is also true of the Common Market Organisation for sugar, where, despite the 2001 reform, problems of overproduction and high prices persist.
When the Audit Progress Committee starts work, I am certain that the Commission will be able to be more diligent in following up the Court's reports.
Let us now move on to the Statement of Assurance.
It is the opinion of the Court that the accounts for 2001 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation of the Communities.
However, the Report does express some reservations and observations which for the most part concern defects in the accounting system on which the Court has previously remarked.
In its reply to our Report, the Commission acknowledges these shortcomings and undertakes to present a plan to modernise the accounting system before the end of 2002.
The Court will examine the conception and implementation of this plan and will keep Parliament informed of its progress.
As in previous years, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure are legal and regular.
Nonetheless, because of the errors that we have highlighted we are unable to provide this assurance in respect of the other payments.
Most errors were detected in payments relating to agricultural policy and structural measures - in other words, in those management areas which the Commission shares with the Member States, and which account for some 80% of the budget.
Reducing the frequency of errors will be contingent on significant improvements in the administration and control systems of both the Commission and the Member States.
Take the common agricultural policy, where the declarations submitted by the beneficiaries of subsidies have not improved compared with previous years.
The launch of the Integrated Management and Control System has not been completed, and almost half of the Member States have not introduced the bovine identification system, which has been compulsory since 2000.
Other errors are linked to deficiencies in the controls carried out by the Member States (in the case, for example, of olive oil and cotton).
The Court's recommendations obviously include the full implementation of the control mechanisms provided for in the Regulations.
As regards structural measures, further erroneous payments were discovered, caused by deficiencies in the control systems and in the Member States' declarations of expenditure.
The Court is concerned about national governments' delay in applying the management and control instruments for the new programming period; the inspection units are not operational and there is no independent control of transactions.
It recommends that the Commission intensify its checks and systematically turn the findings obtained to account.
In the context of internal policies, which are directly managed by the Commission, examination of the fifth framework programme for research revealed incorrect payments due to the failure of beneficiaries to comply with contract provisions.
The Court recommends simplifying the systems for reimbursing expenditure and introducing more effective sanction mechanisms.
The national authorities in the beneficiary countries and non-governmental organisations play a decisive role in the management system for external aid programmes.
Examination of the supporting documentation that is available centrally (in Brussels) leads to the conclusion that the Commission has legally and regularly met its commitments and payments.
Nonetheless, the Court has no assurance that these operations were carried out correctly in the beneficiary countries, where the control systems are inadequate and errors have often been detected on the spot.
The Commission must work more intensively to transform external aid - where progress has already been made.
To conclude this theme, I should like to open a short parenthesis.
In recent months there has been lively debate concerning the Commission's accounting system.
This is a good thing, and I hope that the interest thus aroused will help to push through the reforms that the Court has long been advocating.
However, in some respects the debate has suffered from a lack of precision and balance.
The time has come to introduce some order and draw up an objective map of the situation.
To this end, it should be stressed that, despite certain reservations, the Commission's accounts are reliable.
Accordingly, save perhaps in a few specific areas, the figures provided by the budgetary accounts correspond to the actual use made of appropriations.
This view is borne out by a rigorous professional auditing effort, in which the Court has invested considerable resources.
Yet this effort has also led the Court to criticise the accounting system.
The shortcomings that have been highlighted make it difficult to obtain the better-quality information that is necessary to improve management.
I refer, for example, to the deficiencies in the system of accruals accounting when it comes to presenting the state of the Commission's assets and liabilities.
For years the Court has been drawing attention to these defects, and at last its observations appear to have elicited some response.
Today we are determinedly pressing the Commission to take remedial action.
When we meet here again next year we will just as determinedly demand results, which I am confident will be positive.
In the meantime, I would ask that the Commission be allowed to concentrate on this task, which is not at all easy.
Let us now deal with what I believe to be a crucial issue in the Report: the reform of the Commission.
2001 was a year of transition which was marked by significant progress, especially in the fields of financial management and internal control.
Let us see what the Court's main observations in this respect are.
Firstly, I would like to point out that certain measures are not being introduced within the time limits stipulated.
This delay is above all due to an overly ambitious initial timetable, as the Court has already complained.
Secondly, the Council has adopted a new Financial Regulation which the Court considers generally appropriate.
Despite some remaining unsatisfactory elements, this is a good instrument which will help to improve the administration of Community funds.
For the first time, the Directors-General have drafted activity reports and prepared declarations on the quality of information and internal control.
Increasing top managers' accountability in this way is one of the keys to the reform's success.
This is a genuine revolution in the Commission's management culture.
We recommend improving the approach to drawing up reports and declarations: presentation dates must be brought forward and guidelines must be issued in more precise terms, avoiding ambiguity, specifying possible observations and reservations and more clearly outlining plans of action.
The Commission has summarised the reports and declarations by the Directors-General in a single document which it has submitted to Parliament and the Council.
This summary includes a plan of action which aims to remedy the problems that have been identified.
The plan should provide more detail on issues such as the monitoring of internal control standards and the reform of SINCOM.
Finally, one aspect of the reform deserves greater attention.
I refer to the Member States' management of programmes under what is known as 'shared management'.
The Commission is having problems with incorporating concrete measures aimed at checking and improving the effectiveness of these management systems, which account for more than 80% of the budget, into its overall strategy.
Solutions urgently need to be found, but the Commission on its own is powerless: it needs the active collaboration of national governments.
I believe that this message provides an appropriate conclusion to my speech.
The reform is progressing positively.
The Commission has met its commitment to work hard on improving its administrative and control practices.
However, it will take more time to achieve the excellent and exemplary administration we all want to see.
It is a laborious process to which all the institutions must contribute their experience.
Each year the Court will analyse the progress made, report on the deficiencies and recommend any measures it considers necessary.
I thank you very much for your attention.
Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, honourable Members of this Parliament and of the Court of Auditors, I wish to extend very warm thanks to Mr Fabra VallÃ©s for his speech and for his firm support for Commission reform.
I wish to thank all the members and staff of the Court of Auditors for their good cooperation throughout the year and for the Court's recommendations, which are indispensable if the European Budget is to be put to good use and properly administered.
With the Statement of Assurance specifically in mind, I am also grateful for their frankness about the methodology applied.
I will follow Mr Fabra VallÃ©s in concentrating on three points, specifically the surplus from 2001, accounting, and Commission reform.
The Court is critical of the EUR 15 billion surplus for that year on the grounds that it is not the result of savings - which would have been a good thing - but has come about because the Budget provision on which Parliament had decided had not been fully used, and because programmes, especially in structural policy, had simply got going more slowly than had been planned.
