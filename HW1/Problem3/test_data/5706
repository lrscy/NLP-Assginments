We can also reflect on the various possible approaches to be adopted according to whether the patient concerned is a man or a woman.
Nor let us forget the crucial role played by the doctor in monitoring the patient.
Doctors sometimes feel very alone and ponder the whys and wherefores of forcing patients to take drugs or of locking them away.
Together with my fellow Members, I hope that the Commission will take this approach further and that it will return to us with proposals based on those for which we shall vote tomorrow.
It is crucial that full importance be given to mental health in European health policy and that a different view be taken of mental illnesses, with people being accorded the respect and due dignity that any human being should inspire.
Â Â  â Commissioner, the promotion of mental health is an issue that concerns not only mental patients and their families; it basically concerns society because we all at some point face some form of mental illness which may cause significant economic and social problems.
Today's debate on the report by my honourable friend MrÂ Bowis, whom I should like to congratulate, if I may, on his exceptional work, is extremely important.
Thus public consultation is being set in motion in the Union about the introduction of a strategy for mental health.
Action needs to be taken for the prevention, timely diagnosis and treatment of the mental illnesses which strike part of the population, in order to limit the personal financial and social consequences.
At the same time, the action in question must target better information and the development of appropriate attitudes and skills, in order to protect mental health and combat the stigma which attaches to mental illness.
At the same time, I should like to highlight the need for continual education of primary health care professionals in mental health issues, as this ensures the best possible response to them.
I also consider it necessary to apply individualised methods for promoting mental health, taking account of the particular needs of target groups, such as people with disabilities.
Given the fact that the results are better when people with mental health problems are treated in society, while long-term institutionalisation in mental health hospitals may exacerbate their condition, we need to support their deinstitutionalisation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this Green Paper sends out a signal, at long last, in favour of improving mental health in the EU.
Increased political awareness of the mental wellbeing of European citizens is long overdue.
In my view, however, it is a serious omission that neither the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety nor the Commission proposal contains a comprehensive causal analysis.
We know that environmental pollution, poor diet and food allergies have an effect on both physical and mental wellbeing.
The effects of toxic chemicals on hormonal balance are evident.
There is a pressing need for an analysis to be carried out at long last of neurological disturbances resulting from environmental toxins and pesticides, and of the connection between attention deficit disorder and food intolerances.
We also know that highly gifted children and young people, for example, often wrongly end up receiving psychiatric treatment owing to a failure to recognise them as such.
There must be greater readiness to deal with this issue, too.
This is also the reason for my concern about the risk of the pharmaceutical industry jumping on the bandwagon and promoting medicines as the only solution.
We need to tackle the issue of the need to perform a comprehensive approach involving analysis and treatment instead of further medicalising and pathologising life cycles.
After all, it is unacceptable that healthy, lively children, children who had previously been considered perfectly healthy, should now be diagnosed with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and be prescribed medication, and it is also unacceptable that young people should be exposed to high levels of violence in the media and then labelled as psychologically ill and prescribed medication.
We must also ask ourselves whether there can ever be a guarantee of happiness in our consumer society, and therefore whether it sends out the wrong signal to automatically treat people with antidepressants every time they are grieving or in a bad mood â things that we all have to go through.
My concern, therefore, is that we may be setting the wrong course with this Green Paper, and also with a White Paper.
We should carry out a causal analysis and should not rely solely on prescribing medication.
Parliamentâs call for medicines to be used as a last resort, once the causes of the psychological illness have been sufficiently explained, should be central, and we cannot let ourselves become the lackeys of the pharmaceutical industry and dedicate ourselves to further pathologising and medicalising life cycles and processes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, for which I sincerely thank MrÂ Bowis, can make a significant contribution to a better Europe, one that respects the dignity of psychiatric patients, assists them and helps them back into society, while putting an end to unacceptable practices such as segregation in mental institutions.
In short it will be a better Europe, since a civilisation is judged very much on how it behaves in these situations in relation to the weakest individuals and those most at risk.
A year ago, a group of people who are commonly termed âmadâ came here to Strasbourg from Rome in a coach, together with mental health workers and family members.
They had come to talk to us about the situation in Italy: a law named after a psychiatrist, Franco Basaglia, who is unfortunately no longer among us, who fought with them â âmadâ men and women â for patient dignity, shut down mental institutions and set up an alternative, local assistance and rehabilitation scheme, because of which people in Italy are now in a better position.
These âmadâ men and women came to ask us to roll out the scheme in Europe, because they would thus feel more like citizens of this Europe, in which all too often they have been, and still are, discriminated against and deprived of their rights.
With this report today, we are beginning to respond to that demand, and we can tell them, âYou are citizens like everyone elseâ.
But for that to happen completely, this work, which we have done with all our hearts, and the work contained in the Green Paper through positive collaboration between Parliament and the Commission, needs to be turned into something significant that will also provide the various countries with guidance: in other words, a genuine directive for a Europe without mental institutions that restores dignity to all psychiatric patients.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is rare for the issue of rights and ethical standards to be brought up in a debate on mental health.
Some people even view immoral behaviour as a symptom of modernity.
However, that kind of lifestyle leads to disorders and inhibits personal development.
A person is then driven by biological stimuli from the subcortex region of the brain that are not checked or controlled by the cortex, where the higher emotions are based.
In these individuals, the thought process and intelligence are governed by instincts which correspond to underdeveloped higher moral and aesthetic emotions and an inability to share social or patriotic bonds.
In this way, disturbed personal and emotional development may affect not only individuals, but whole groups and communities.
This goes hand in hand with a rise in psychopathic tendencies in society which further corrupt it, leading to an increase in mental disorders and a deterioration of the personality.
Another problem facing modern medicine, in relation to the treatment of mental disorders, is that symptomatic treatment merely eliminates the symptoms but fails to provide an effective cure.
Â Â  The issue of mental health is not a new phenomenon, but it has been discussed a lot lately in Europe and the United States.
I would like to examine this issue from the perspective of the work environment, which is one of the contributing factors in the worsening of mental health.
The effort to improve the economy and prosperity of our regions has brought about a change in working conditions.
Teleworking, the more intensive use of communications technologies, changes in working habits, increased mobility â all these have had an effect on the mental health of workers.
Job requirements related to flexibility, education and skills have been getting tougher, with the result that middle-aged and older employees are unable to adapt to the changing conditions.
The constant stress may lead to mental problems.
In addition to the medical dimension of the issue, it is necessary to recognise the economic consequences of the populationâs deteriorating mental health.
Stress triggers poorer work attendance, inferior work performance or commitment, and problems among colleagues at work.
Since public health is on the national agendas of the Member States, and since the European Union has limited powers in this area, we must turn our attention to those countries that encounter greater problems and have less funds available for their remedy.
In spite of the large number of suicides in Northern Europe and the United Kingdom, I believe that we should draw our attention primarily to the new Member States, five of which rank among the countries with the highest suicide rates in the EU.
Countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Slovakia, have undergone significant changes, and their citizens have had to adapt to a changing working environment, acquiring new skills and habits in line with those of Western Europe.
They have had to re-qualify and manage new, more sophisticated procedures very rapidly, which has had a negative impact mainly on middle-aged and older employees.
In addition to that, the above-mentioned countries suffer from high unemployment, which also contributes to the worsening of mental health.
It has been suggested that a new agency should be set up to tackle this problem.
I do not agree with this point of view.
I believe that it would be far more efficient to restructure the existing agencies, including those agencies that deal directly with issues related to mental health.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank both the Commissioner, for an excellent Green Paper, and Mr Bowis for his report, which has added even more to what was an excellent standing start.
Thank you, John.
Your particular interest and feeling for this subject is inspirational to many of us here.
Health services and healthcare are individual Member State competences, but under Article 152, we in Europe have a mandate as regards promotion, prevention and the dissemination of information.
That is exactly what this debate on the Green Paper can do: ensure that we open up this whole area, focus on the major problems of stigma and discrimination and exchange best practice and epidemiological figures on this area.
Commissioner, you mentioned that the figures do not show the real burden of the disease of mental health.
Because of the stigma and discrimination, many do not access treatment and help.
I would fully agree with you.
In fact, I would seriously question our data.
I would say that they reflect probably half â being generous â of what the real burden of the disease could actually be.
Most employees with acute or chronic depression, for example, hide it from their employers for fear of the adverse impact on their careers.
Therefore, raising awareness, changing attitudes and, above all, exchanging best practice is an enormous contribution we can make here to this most important area.
The figures are startling: 18 million people across the EU suffer from severe depression; 58Â 000 of our citizens commit suicide every year â roughly equivalent to two or three small towns in any rural area being obliterated every year.
Ten times that number attempt suicide.
One in four of us is likely to experience mental health problems at some point in our lives and over 27% of adults in Europe are affected by mental health problems every year.
Depression and anxiety disorders, including stress and eating disorders, are the most common mental health problems experienced.
Studies estimate, frighteningly, that by 2020 neuro-psychiatric disorders, with depression at the top of the list, will be the highest-ranking cause of illness in the developed world.
A major portion of that will be caused by the ageing of Europe, which will pose a particular challenge.
Mental ill health is preventable and treatable.
We need to encourage early intervention and ensure that, if possible, as was suggested by my colleague Mr Bowis, we look again at legislation on discrimination to see if we can include discrimination against those with mental health problems as part of that package.
We need to do all we can with the competence we have.
Unfortunately, with the European Constitutional Treaty not moving as some of us would have hoped, our competence is fairly limited.
However, that does not stop us joining up the dots in the relevant areas of European law that exist at the moment.
Above all we must open up this subject and be inclusive to those who are suffering in this particular area.
Ignoring this problem and not providing the facilities and treatment that are needed costs Europe three to four per cent of our GDP per year.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your work and, above all, thanks to my colleague MrÂ Bowis for his excellent report.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has few powers in the field of public health, and that is how it should stay, for health is primarily a responsibility of the Member States.
Europe does have a very important complementary role to play: common research policy where health occupies an important place and a public health action programme that aims to improve the quality of care and treatment methods by exchanging data, by bundling expertise and by allowing countries to learn from one another.
Since this approach is particularly promising in the area of mental health, Commissioner, I welcome the Green Paper.
I am also indebted to MrÂ Bowis for his commitment and involvement in this.
He has written an excellent report.
It has been said several times this evening that one in four Europeans, or one hundred million of us, experience a bout of serious illness at least once in their lives.
That is tragic and also accounts for 3 to 4% of the Gross Domestic Product.
Mental health problems cover a multitude of things and can range from eating disorders in girls or young women, alcoholism, drug addiction, through to behavioural problems, depression, as well as other psychiatric illnesses.
It is difficult to develop successful treatment methods for those illnesses.
Take drug addiction.
What is the best way of overcoming addiction?
Is it medicines, methadone, talking therapy, or a Narconon programme that involves saunas and vitamins?
A serious comparison of the success of the different recovery methods would be useful.
Or take eating disorders and depression: there are success stories, but just as many failures.
What matters is that expertise is combined, that practitioners learn from one another, that patients or addicts gain awareness of successful treatment methods.
In this sense, it is also useful to set up a European coordination-expertise group, in which patients, addicts and care institutions should all be involved.
This should be turned into a kind of help desk with a website where one in four Europeans and their families can seek help when they suffer from mental health problems.
That is when European cooperation comes into its own.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Mr Bowis has thoroughly and successfully addressed all the important issues concerning a strategy for mental health in the EU and my group fully endorses his report.
As regards the amendments tabled, the ALDE Group will support the two PSE Amendments 11 and 12, but with the following proposed oral amendment to each. In both amendments, the words âsome ofâ should be inserted after the word âinâ so that the text reads: âin some of the new Member Statesâ.
This is necessary because what is referred to in the amendments does not apply to all new Member States and it would be inappropriate and erroneous not to make this clear.
I am sure this small alteration will be agreed by all concerned.
On the main substance of the report, I only wish to re-emphasise a couple of points.
Firstly, the fact that mental ill health is extremely common.
It is estimated that approximately 100 million EU citizens will be affected by it during their lifetime.
It does not appear to be so common in everyday life, because most people choose to hide it away.
The time has now come to bring the issue of mental illness out of the closet of denial and shame and deal with it openly, rationally and effectively.
Secondly, there is the fact that mental illness is unfortunately subject to stigmatisation in our societies.
In my view, this stems from our limited comprehension of the function of one of our most important vital organs, the brain.
The brain, like other vital organs such as the heart and the lungs, is susceptible to disease, which results in malfunction.
A malfunctioning heart will give rise to cardiac disease.
In the same way a malfunctioning brain will give rise to mental disease.
The main difference in my view is that we may not yet be able to identify the exact anatomical and/or histological and/or biochemical anomaly giving rise to the particular brain malfunction.
I am sure we will be able to do this in the future, as our scientific knowledge of neurology and neuroscience progresses.
So mental illness should be nothing to be ashamed of.
The mentally-ill patient is no different to a cardiac patient or any other patient.
In conclusion, I very much wish and hope that this report will mark the end of the dark ages approach to mental disorders and the beginning of a new era of understanding in dealing with both the treatment and prevention of mental ill health.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to congratulate MrÂ Bowis on his excellent report. I should also like to say that it is not just a gender issue: there is certainly a very strong racial perspective as well that is attached to mental health and mental illness.
At least we are past the age where sexual orientation was seen as a mental disorder, but there is still, as others have said, a tremendous amount of work to be done.
As Mr Bowis himself pointed out, we have only just begun to scratch the surface in terms of what we would call promoting mental wellbeing.
The World Health Organisation describes mental health as a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.
That has enormous implications for the social inclusion policies that we pursue and, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I want to pick up â as others have done â on the world of work, focusing in particular on paragraph 27 of the report.
It is not just about the influence of mental health on employment, but the effect of employment on mental health.
As others have said, stress is potentially the largest cause of time off work.
The Bilbao Agency has done a lot of work on that.
Self-reported work-related stress, depression or anxiety accounted in the UK recently for nearly 13 million lost working days in one year.
If that had been the result of physical injury at the workplace there would have been an enormous outcry.
Many companies do not have a policy for dealing with stress.
Many managers cannot recognise it in themselves and cannot manage it in others.
So we need to develop training there, and we need to have a culture at work where you can admit to stress, have it dealt with seriously and work with working practices that promote mental wellbeing.
Â Â  â We all naturally agree that mental health is a prerequisite for intellectual and emotional fulfilment and for integrating people into society.
In recent years, however, mental health has not received sufficient attention compared to other areas.
The Commissionâs Green Paper, and in particular the outstanding report by MrÂ Bowis, plug that gap, putting forwards a great many proposals, not only for the Commission, but also for doctors and the general public.
The report before us identifies the main problems in the area of mental health which form part of the broader context, offering food for thought on such hotly debated issues as the stigmatisation of the mentally ill, methods of treating patients and the gender differences which are so prevalent in mental health.
First, I should like to highlight the call from MrÂ Bowis and the Commissionâs Green Paper for prevention as the most effective way of combating the growing incidence of mental illness.
This ought to be one of the priorities in our proactive approach.
It is precisely the influence of environment, employment and the family that should form the focus of our attention and our action plans, as these are the areas affecting mental health where prevention can work.
I also very much welcome the important reference to gender difference in the area of mental health, which was not sufficiently addressed in the Commission's Green Paper.
Women are more likely to seek healthcare, and to take more pharmaceutical products, which they are less able to tolerate.
They are also often subject to undesirable pressure from their peers, which may lead to mental breakdown.
One area that certainly deserves attention in the future, not only from doctors and politicians, but also from the general public, is the stigmatisation of the mentally ill.
The emphasis attached to this issue in the report is an indication of the seriousness of the situation.
I welcome all of the comments and proposals made by the rapporteur.
Although I consider the proposals for best practice to be very positive, and believe that they will lead to higher standards â speaking as a doctor I very much support these proposals â it is unfortunately the fact that in my country the programmes in question are extremely expensive and thus far sadly not priority areas.
The possibility of joint EU programmes in this area could help resolve this dilemma.
Â Â  â Mr President, according to the World Health Organisation, mental health is necessary to the wellbeing of individuals, societies and countries and must be addressed globally on a new basis, from a new point of view which creates new hope.
In this report, we are guided by the data of the World Health Organisation and are, for the first time, inaugurating a systematic effort to promote mental health.
The families of sufferers, which provide material and moral support to their members suffering from mental health problems, fall victim, together with the persons in question, to the negative consequences of the stigma and of the discrimination which accompanies these illnesses.
Consequently, support for them by professionals in order to meet their obvious needs, together with information and a systematic fight against the stigma are necessary components when addressing mental illnesses.
I consider it equally necessary to investigate the mechanisms and causes of these illnesses and to improve the corresponding treatment, including the development of new treatment methods.
Here I should like to emphasise that the most important difference between these patients and most other serious conditions which may even lead to death is that they upset the functioning of the brain, such as for example memory functions, cognitive functions and the conscience, in other words the functions which are inextricably bound up with the personality of the human being.
This personality is eroded and may ultimately be destroyed by many of these conditions.
Consequently, if the objective of prevention and cure of human illness is a very serious priority, then the corresponding objective relating to neuro-psychological illnesses is the top priority if we wish to prevent the quintessence of European society from being eroded and breaking up, especially as this society includes in its composition many elderly people who, as we know, are vulnerable to neuro-degenerative illnesses.
To close, I wish to say that, bearing firmly in mind that prevention, timely recognition and correct treatment significantly limit the personal, economic and social consequences, I believe that, in voting for the excellent report by my honourable friend, MrÂ Bowis, we are inaugurating a course that will give mental illnesses the serious priority they warrant and result in more effective action against this modern scourge.
Â Â  MrÂ President, please accept my cordial welcome for such an unusually sincere and personal presentation of the draft report.
This report and the debates that followed are an important step by the European Parliament in support of the development of the new mental health policy by the Commission, which is especially important to the new EU Member States.
Poor mental health indicators, such as high suicide rates and numerous cases of violence and abuse, especially alcohol abuse, are not unusual in such countries.
The new Member States have inherited inefficient mental healthcare systems based on large psychiatric institutions that just serve to perpetuate social exclusion and stigma.
Presently, even these institutions are poorly financed, and thus, floundering and failing to perform their already limited functions.
There is obviously a lack in the community-based services that should be a part of healthcare and social infrastructure.
We can usually only report isolated cases of success in care homes for mental health patients, while home healthcare and community-based services are actually much more humanistic, better compatible with human rights and more cost-effective.
We have no tradition of home healthcare that would be supported by society; therefore, the old system is resisting giving up its positions.
The increasing number of children, who are growing up in state institutions, is particularly disturbing.
This is further proof of the lack of an alternative system that would help parents in high-risk groups to properly raise and educate their children.
Some new Member States have already taken the first steps towards implementing provisions that are compliant with EU principles.
Lithuania has drafted a mental health policy that will be presented to Parliament for approval this year.
Lithuania has also initiated the project 'Child and adolescent mental health in an enlarged European Union: development of effective policies and practices'.
This project was supported by the Commission and has attracted 18 participant countries and 34 associate partners.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this timely and well-considered report and I congratulate the rapporteur.
Firstly, I agree that the added value of a Community strategy on mental health is primarily in the field of prevention and awareness-raising and that any proposals from the Commission should involve partnership and consultation with all relevant parties.
An essential element of any strategy will be to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness and this will require a multifaceted approach, including information, education, anti-discrimination legislation, community-based approaches and responsible reporting by the media.
I fully support the proposal in the report that Member States should work together to implement effective strategies to reduce suicide, because this is not only a national or European issue but also a global one.
In Ireland, suicide is the most common cause of death in 18-24 year olds.
Unfortunately, it is the highest within this age group in the EU.
Such deaths devastate families and tear the heart out of communities.
A recent survey conducted in my own area of North Leitrim and West Cavan entitled âMen on the Borderâ, painted a distressing picture of the reality of life for many single, older men, with 56% or respondents saying that they knew somebody who had committed suicide.
Given that I always like to link what we do here with what is happening in our constituencies, I am pleased to say that this survey was partly funded by the EU and I hope that its recommendations will help to improve the situation.
Finally, while expenditure on mental health is a national competence, I believe that we need to highlight the sizable differences in mental health expenditure in individual Member States and I am not proud to say that our own levels in Ireland are inadequate.
I agree with the rapporteur that public pressure is needed to ensure adequate expenditure to promote mental health and to prevent mental illness.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a tsunami is sweeping the European economy and European societies, a giant wave that is known as mental illness but that I prefer to call neurological illness to prevent its being stigmatised.
The number of patients is continuously increasing, the wave replenished by the obvious ageing of the population and by the sacred cow of ultraliberal economics, which is itself a form of neurosis.
No doubt the European Commission has something to say about this, as does the rapporteur, in paragraphÂ 24, who talks of rural isolation, working conditions, job insecurity and unemployment.
What, however, has led to rural isolation if not the destruction of the common agricultural policy, and that in the name of free trade?
What has led to unemployment if not the political choice in favour of free trade?
What causes stress in the working environment, if not the ideology of competitiveness or competition?
What are needed in order to treat these neurological illnesses are what MrÂ Bowis calls for: hospitals, individual care, specialised services and a variety of health care personnel â in other words, investment, which is something prohibited by the budgetary austerity pact in the name, of course, of the ideology of competitiveness and free trade.
That is the point at which we go round in circles because what brings on illness is a mistaken philosophy of economic competition and what is required to treat it is investment, which is something prevented by this same philosophy.
Although it may well require an agency responsible for exploring the continent of the mind, the solution probably consists mainly in curing our leaders.
I have just one more thing to say. Of Don Quixote of la Mancha it was said that he had read so many books on chivalry that his brain had dried up.
In the case of our leaders, they have read so much AdamÂ Smith and DavidÂ Ricardo that they have gone mad.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our greatest asset is indisputably our health â physical, but also mental.
All too often, health policy in the past and present has focused exclusively on considerations of physical health.
This is tangible, often even visible, and is often easier to treat.
In addition, even maintaining physical health is very cost intensive and, unfortunately, it is often the case that not all the available possibilities are still affordable today.
Our healthcare network, from prevention to aftercare, is bankrupting the public coffers.
It is not the intention of this report, on which I should like to congratulate MrÂ Bowis, that the EU play an active part in the health field.
That is the responsibility of the Member States and should remain so.
Nevertheless, we are in favour of the issuing of this Commission Green Paper to stimulate discussion of the importance of mental health in the EU, of the necessity of having a strategy, and of any priorities.
We now know that good mental health is also a precondition for good economic performance.
We need to ask ourselves questions and seek answers, however.
To begin with: who are we referring to when we speak of those with âmental ill healthâ?
Why are 13% of Europeans seeking professional help in this field?
Why do so many people in the EU commit suicide?
We have heard the figures; at the hearing a figure of 58Â 000 each year was mentioned.
Why is society so ill?
What are the causes?
Are the demands of our society perhaps too great in general?
Then there is the big question: what happens to these disadvantaged members of society?
These issues need to be discussed in order to raise awareness.
One thing is certain: social changes are also needed in order to prevent these illnesses.
As we know, it is difficult to tackle the harshness and competitiveness of peopleâs working lives.
Many things are easier to bear, however, if people have a haven, or a chance to withdraw.
I am thinking here mainly of the family, which gives people the opportunity to rest and recharge their batteries.
Nevertheless, families need help and support in order to fulfil all their important social functions.
One thing is certain: it is not possible to control human beings by law, but it is possible and indeed necessary to create the conditions in which they and their health can grow â mind, body and soul.
Let us support the family, therefore, and if that is one of the intentions of the report, that is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  Mr President, for many years the issue of mental health has been an embarrassing topic and is still overshadowed by other diseases affecting our society.
However, the scale of the phenomenon today means we cannot ignore the dangers associated with mental disorders.
We cannot discuss health in the European Union without taking these dangers into account.
The statistics reflect the cruel truth.
On average, 58Â 000 people commit suicide each year.
This figure is higher than the number of those who die in car accidents, are murdered or die of AIDS.
Depression is currently the most serious problem affecting our society.
It is a problem that affects a growing number of people, particularly the young and, to an increasing extent, ethnic minorities.
Economic analysts estimate that poor mental health costs the citizens of the European Union around three to four per cent of GDP, mainly as a result of falling productivity and early retirement.
That is why it is vital to draw up and adopt, as a matter of urgency, a directive on mental health and the protection of the civil and fundamental rights of people suffering from mental health problems.
Implementing the principles of the directive will establish the practical framework for implementing the Community programme.
Preventative healthcare which takes into account different age groups should play an important role in the mental health strategy, according to the motto âprevention is better than cureâ.
The pilot programme of the European Association against Depression has already achieved a 25% decrease in the number of suicides and suicide attempts by young people.
That is why we need to think about the matter seriously and to take appropriate action to prevent dependence on modern technologies.
Today, we revel in the fact that we have access to all kinds of technology, that everything is possible, that we have thousands of gadgets at our disposal.
But at what price?
The price is that young people in particular are addicted to their screens and refuse to accept any reasons for turning away from them.
This is the challenge of our age and we have to meet this challenge.
Adopting a single, coordinated European Union policy in the field of mental health will allow us to create the appropriate conditions for the harmonious development of public mental health.
It will help people to learn to cope with difficult situations, conflict or stressful conditions and to form better interpersonal relations.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I have nothing but gratitude for the Commissioner for the Green Paper, and even more so for MrÂ Bowis for the important work he has done.
It has indeed turned out to be a very balanced report.
After all, not for nothing was it almost unanimously supported in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and we are therefore hopeful that this report will be carried by an overwhelming majority in this House tomorrow, and will bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Commission so that it can take the necessary initiatives in line with its competences, because, clearly, much can be improved in the area of metal health care in the European Union.
Patients still have no say.
Cooperation between the different care institutions is still lacking, and the sector is facing a serious lack of funding.
The added value of policy at EU level which we need to pursue is mainly in the area of promoting exchange and cooperation between Member States.
We must, above all, be able to improve the connection between the various and different measures at Member State level, both nationally and regionally.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissionâs Green Paper has not only cranked up a debate here in Parliament, national and regional governments have also been encouraged to make more funds available.
When in my country, in Flanders, the national health survey showed that as many as one in five Flemings experience psychological problems and one in eight even serious problems, the Flemish Welfare Minister promptly decided to considerably reinforce the mental health centres, particularly those for the target groups that suffer the most, namely children and young people.
Patient organisations followed suit.
They asked representatives of ADHD Europe, for example, to home in on the living conditions of ADHD patients, since originally, the Green Paper did not even make a mention of this developmental illness in children, which, if left untreated, can do so much damage and cause so much distress, not only to the patient, but also in the form of costs to the health care system, the school system and the economic system.
I am therefore delighted that our rapporteur was prepared to approve a few important additions in this respect.
I would also thank the fellow Members for their support.
I am now hopeful that the Commission, on the basis of the above, will be able to present a proposal for an EU mental health strategy by the end of this year.
I wish the Commissioner every success in this.
Â Â  First of all I, too, would like to thank MrÂ Bowis for the opportunity to speak on this very important topic.
Everyone is afraid of illness, and the most terrifying illnesses are undoubtedly those which threaten mental health.
For a long time, medical science and society were equally helpless in the face of these problems, and reacted by sweeping the subject under the carpet or by isolating the victims.
Fortunately, today we know that children who have learning difficulties are not bad kids, that those suffering from depression cannot be expected simply to pull themselves together, but that with adequate care even individuals with mental disabilities are capable of significant development.
At the same time, we must face the fact that just as desk jobs are bad for the back, or the use of chemicals increases the incidence of allergies, so stress, the information overload and the lack of stable reference points in our society make it more difficult to preserve mental health.
While most people today consciously strive to maintain the health of their bodies, the protection of our mental health receives considerably less attention.
For this reason I welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the first steps towards a Community strategy for improving mental health.
This is particularly important from the perspective of the new Member States, including Hungary, since the shock provoked by sudden economic and social transformations has given rise to problems that our outmoded institutional systems, serious underfunding and fossilised attitudes are unable adequately to address.
To these must be added the problems traditionally characteristic of the region, such as the high suicide rate.
In my country, Hungary, at the peak of the suicide wave twenty years ago more than 45 out of every 100Â 000 people died by their own hand, a statistic with which we shocked the world.
According to the figures of the World Health Organisation, in 2000 the worldwide suicide rate was 16 out of 100Â 000, which represented a rising trend over the last half-century.
There were years, not that long ago, when there were fewer fatalities in Europe caused by road traffic accidents than by suicide, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned.
But we should not think that this is true only of Europe.
In the United States as well, suicide is often ahead of homicide among the causes of death â in 1997, for instance, there were one and a half times as many suicides registered as murders.
The long period of neglect of our region has meant that in our country, consulting a psychologist is still considered something to be kept secret, and it is not unusual for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to be considered mentally disabled.
Many families are left to their own devices, without effective outside help, when one of their members faces serious problems.
This situation must be changed, and it is for this reason that I am in support of all those amendments which explicitly state that specific attention needs to be paid to the mental health-related problems in the new Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I should thank my colleague, MrÂ Bowis, for the work he has done.
Furthermore, I am not just referring to this report, but to all his input and the vigour with which he has spoken on behalf of mental health work in Europe.
I have been a Member of Parliament for seven years, and in all this time John Bowis has consistently kept this subject on the agenda.
For me he is a heartening example of a politician who realises his vision of a better world with determination and steadfastness.
It is only in this way that things change: when one does not yield to arbitrary political whims and trends but knows oneself what one is striving for and does it.
Mental health problems are something which it is easy to keep quiet about.
There is a strong stigma attached to such types of disorder, and there may even be discrimination, which in the worst case scenario might prevent someone from seeking care.
Proper information, openness and the sort of mental health campaigns proposed in the report will help to dispel this pointless stigma.
The path to maturity is stonier than ever.
Growth seems hampered by societyâs increased uncertainty.
It is good that the report should demonstrate awareness of the need for early intervention and the importance of prevention.
To prevent mental health problems in children and young people in particular, we need to invest more time and money in preventive measures in day-care centres, schools, childrenâs clinics and school healthcare.
A young person in need of help might be inclined to let things continue as they are simply because he or she does not know where to turn to for help.
The role of the childâs background, and above all the family, is therefore of major importance.
With the right resources, school healthcare units and childrenâs clinics are in an excellent position to identify problems in children and young people and provide help at an early stage.
While, for example, in my country mental health problems have become more common in young people, statistics show that the parents of one in five children work untypical hours.
Schoolchildren suffering from anxiety can be given significant help at school in the shape of group-based support, but it is absolutely essential to provide families with support on weekdays.
Support for a child from parents and the family creates a basis for good mental health.
Treating the problems of the young with drugs should be the last resort.
The main focus should be on identifying and eliminating the social and environmental factors that are causing the harm.
The problems will not go away by keeping silent about them.
Depression has been called the new European disease.
Very few people under the age of 30 took antidepressants 20 years ago, but now they take them as much as the older generations do.
If there is no intervention in young peopleâs mental health problems immediately, and if no attention is paid to easing the situation regarding access to help, the price paid will be just too high.
The fine words and good intentions in the Commissionâs Green Paper must be turned into effective legislation as soon as possible, and we in Parliament expect to receive a proposal for a directive to debate on soon.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, allow me too to congratulate the rapporteur, John Bowis, because with his systematic work and the results of it, as contained in this report, he has highlighted the importance of mental health and the policies which we must apply.
Clearly the public health strategy must also include mental health, both for reasons of personal wellbeing and for reasons of social cohesion and social peace and progress.
'A healthy mind in a healthy body' was what the ancient Greeks said in order to demonstrate that both mental and physical health are an integral component of human health.
This saying is just as topical and important in modern times.
Numerous Members have already referred to various forms of modern mental illnesses.
Within this framework, I should like to emphasise that particular account must be taken of the gender dimension, both in research and in preventing and addressing psychoses.
Research has even shown that various particular biological conditions and, more importantly, social circumstances affect women.
The gender dimension must be also taken into account in the education of and information for nursing staff.
Generally speaking, society and the families of people suffering from mental illnesses suffer because, in many cases, women with psychological problems are dealt with as people who are over-sensitive and not as sufferers needing special care and attention.
In other words, we must also protect sufferers and their environment, because that will also make the environment more suitable and more trustworthy in the role that it is called on to play in addressing the problems of the people within it.
To close, allow me to mention war victims.
The serious psychological problems they face must qualify for both our development and our humanitarian aid and, in general terms, aid to reconstruct areas, because the reconstruction of areas requires above all reconstruction of the human psyche.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members for the very interesting and useful debate.
I shall be brief.
The best conclusion one could draw from the debate today is that here, as well as in the rest of the consultation process, there is broad support for the establishment of a new strategy on mental health.
This is a very positive signal for the Commission going forward, because throughout the general consultation process, the parliamentary process and the process of consulting the Member States, similar levels of support have been expressed for these efforts.
The truth is that there is added value for an initiative and strategy at European level and that is why we intend to come forward with a strategy very soon.
Amongst other things, it is very important that we promote cooperation on mental health between Member States, between stakeholders and between different sectors.
Involving all relevant sectors in the effort to provide better public health is an important aspect of the new strategy.
As I said at the beginning, we intend to place mental health at the core of our health strategy and the public health initiatives.
Schools and workplaces have a greater influence on mental well-being than the actual health sector.
Teaching parenting skills is also important.
Older people must have opportunities to participate actively in social life.
Many very interesting issues have been raised and we will take them into account when we draft the strategy.
We will look into prevention and, as you know from previous debates, it is my basic important commitment and the basis of my strategy for this term to promote prevention and not just treatment.
Gender aspects will be taken into account.
When we had a similar debate here on the gender aspects of health, I said that our policies from then on would take into account the gender aspects in all our health initiatives and in the various areas of research, promotion, prevention, care, treatment and rehabilitation.
They will all take gender into account.
It be reflected in the strategy document that the Commission will prepare.
As I said, we will be looking into prevention and some of the causes, not all of which are avoidable, of course â such as ageing, for example.
Ageing is a reality and a fact.
We have an ageing population. The point is to make ageing healthy.
We are living longer and we need to be healthy in our old age, and mental health is a very important aspect of that.
I should like to finish by saying, in the light of all the numbers and statistics that have been mentioned here, that this is just the tip of the iceberg.
It is not only those who suffer from mental health who are affected: there are also the families, friends, employers, employees and colleagues.
The truth is that the whole of society suffers as a result of mental health problems.
That is why perhaps the best achievement of this whole process, including the strategy, would be to make mental health a priority, not only for the European Union â I believe we in the Commission and in the European Parliament have already done that â but also for each Member State separately and the Community as a whole.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank John Bowis for his very comprehensive and detailed report on improving the mental health of our citizens, that is, the European Unionâs mental health strategy.
Mental health problems know no national boundaries, which is why we can speak of a mental health strategy for the whole Union.
In any case, establishing a common strategy, creating a framework for cooperation between different institutions and monitoring its implementation could facilitate the introduction and provision of services for people with intellectual disabilities and those affected by mental disorders at the national level,
Throughout the ages, many measures of humanity have been developed.
One of these is our attitude to people affected by mental disorders.
In my view the demands for de-stigmatising the problem, eliminating prejudice, and changing attitutdes and stereotypes relating to psychological disorders are very important.
Meanwhile, whenever a politician in Poland wants to insult another politician, he says, or implies, that the other is mentally ill or psychologically disturbed.
Unfortunately, even some Members of the European Parliament indulge in this kind of behaviour.
However, we should all remember that people who suffer from mental disorders deserve to be cared for and treated in a dignified and humane manner.
In countries with a high unemployment rate, this problem particularly affects disabled people.
That is why I strongly support initiatives to ensure non-discrimination in the treatment of those affected by mental illness and the social integration of people with mental disorders.
These actions are particularly important because good working conditions have a positive influence on mental health.
Â Â  Europe is facing major threats to public health: cancer, heart and vascular diseases, diabetes, asthmaÂ ... Mental illness also belongs to this list, though.
After all, why do people suffering from a mental illness get treated differently from people with a heart disease, AIDS or cancer?
At a time when patients are increasingly seen as consumers, are better informed and are more involved in decision-making, the attitude towards mental health should change to match this trend.
At the moment, the EU shares the responsibility for public health and health care with the Member States.
The Member States are responsible for national health services and systems.
The EU only has a secondary role in this.
I would argue in favour of the EU being given a bigger role in public health matters, precisely because these are so important to the public.
In order to promote and support cooperation between the Member States in the area of mental health, and to remove inequalities between Member States, it is a good thing for the Union to be taking action in this area by, for example, joining forces, promoting coherence and creating a platform.
In that way, the EU can mean something to the citizen and change the negative image of bureaucracy and unnecessary red-tape which many citizens have.
Â Â  â The next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission, on European contract law (O-0074/2006 â B6-0326/2006).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today is one of the most important â I believe most important â pre-legislative proposals on the EU agenda for this parliamentary term.
It is all the more regrettable, then, that this issue, too, is being discussed just before midnight once again, whilst other supposedly âimportantâ issues receive prime-time slots in this House.
Incidentally, this is further proof of the urgent need for parliamentary reform.
Nevertheless, I should like to turn to the oral questions.
I can count a total of six resolutions to date that Parliament has issued since the early 1990s, repeatedly and emphatically supporting the project to create a common frame of reference.
Parliament has done this for the simple reason that, together with legal practitioners â EU lawyers and judges â we are of the opinion that further steps towards common principles of civil law are needed in order to render many European legislative provisions such as the -Commerce Directive feasible.
In legal disputes, particularly those between consumers and traders concerning small amounts, it is practically impossible for lawyers and judges to apply 25 â or 26 if we include Scotland â different legal systems in the EU in parallel, especially given the strange juxtaposition of the country of origin and country of destination principles, as is the case with the -Commerce Directive, for example.
That is why we need a higher common standard â I am quite happy to use a harmonised one.
There is actually no disagreement about this â there is a broad consensus about it in this House.
This is also the opinion of leading legal practitioners, and is one of the reasons the CCBE â Council of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community â is planning to hold a conference in Rome this autumn, which offers its belated support to the project.
It is therefore vital to us that we obtain not only the bare bones of a frame of reference, applying exclusively to issues of consumer contract law, but a framework including, in principle, all aspects of civil law.
That is a crucial point as regards later decisions on all the options for what becomes of this frame of reference.
This will, of course, depend primarily on the quality of this frame of reference.
We should like all options to be kept open until the Commission presents the final consultation document, however, and to be able to take a decision on it afterwards, along with others.
It is also important that we depart from the sectoral approach to civil legislation and seek a holistic approach.
After all, the many inconsistencies currently existing in EU civil law can be attributed to the failure to follow this holistic approach, to see things as a whole; instead always considering only individual problems.
Another prerequisite for a frame of reference is that, in principle, the network continues to function and is still operated, as the Commission has done up to now.
As rapporteur on this issue for the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can say that all the political groups agree in principle on this subject, and that an overwhelming majority of this House is in favour â something I have seldom experienced elsewhere.
MrsÂ Wallis of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who cannot be here this evening, has explicitly asked me to reaffirm this on her behalf, too.
As we know, the three Commissioners dealing with this issue â Commissioners Kyprianou, Frattini and McCreevy â are currently considering, or have recently been considering, how the work should be taken forward.
The reason we have deliberately put this oral question â together with the corresponding resolution, which you may have been able to read already in draft form, and which will undoubtedly be adopted by a large majority in this House on Thursday â on todayâs agenda is to emphasise clearly once more the strength of Parliamentâs support for this project.
We want this Houseâs resolutions to serve as a guideline for the Commission, too, in further developing and dealing with this issue.
There has always been very close cooperation and mutual support between the Commission and Parliament on this issue up to now.
We ask that it stays that way â in the interest of the development of the EU and in the interest of legislation in the EU, which must also be manageable and practicable for the man in the street.
That is why this project must continue.
We ask the Commission to maintain the strength of its support, and also to take the opportunity of its answer to this question to make that clear publicly here in plenary.
Â Â  . The Commission has said from the beginning that it welcomes the interest Parliament is taking in the common frame of referenceâ the CFR â and the support which has been expressed for this project.
The Commission is currently considering the possibility of including contract law issues other than consumer issues in the CFR on contract law.
I should like to explain that even though we are now proceeding with the consumer aspect, that does not mean that we have reached any final conclusion on whether to include any other aspects of contract law.
I am working very closely with my colleagues Mr Frattini and Mr McCreevy on this issue.
These other contract law issues could be related to the other EU contract law or general contract law topics which are directly relevant to the EU .
The truth is that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on this matter, but it will take a final decision soon.
We have taken due note of the European Parliamentâs opinion on this issue, especially that expressed in the recent resolution.
I have also had an opportunity to discuss the issue in the various committees.
The Commission also intends to seek the Councilâs position on the remainder of the work on the CFR.
The Commission intends to use the CFR as a âbetter lawmakingâ tool for achieving clarity when legislating.
Exactly what legal form to choose in order to best achieve that aim is a key issue, which will need careful consideration.
It will be easier to make a decision once there is more certainty over the content of the CFR.
Then we can examine how best to ensure that the CFR is used as effectively as possible.
We have to realise that CFR is work in progress and will take some years to complete.
While the Commission can take into account the CFR work when drawing up new legislative proposals relating to contract law issues, it would not be useful or necessary to delay future contract law related legislation until all discussions on the CFR have been finalised.
Meanwhile, the Commission has already indicated that it plans to use relevant CFR results in the review of the consumer contract law .
As clearly indicated in its communication of October 2004, the CFR as such is not primarily meant to be a legislative instrument applicable directly to legal transactions, but a toolbox to facilitate better lawmaking for legislators.
The Commission fully understands that Parliament wants to be kept informed of and involved in the ongoing work on the CFR and would therefore welcome Parliamentâs involvement in the CFR process, in particular the creation of the Parliament working group.
The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way, in particular through the Parliament working group.
I would like to conclude by thanking you for Parliamentâs encouragement and support for our work on this important issue.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, European contract law is certainly such as to favour regulation of the internal market.
A legal construction of this kind must, however, be prepared through a transparent and democratic process.
The advantages that economic agents are expected to gain in terms of legal certainty and a reduction in the cost of transactions very much depends on the clarity, predictability and stability of the rules.
European contract law must be based on the demands of the economic world and on an assessment of its needs.
It must do away with those instances in the where there is a lack of coherence when it comes, for example, to consumer rights regarding retraction periods or information provided to the consumer.
The draft texts being prepared are, it seems, ambiguous and too detailed and do not really fall in with these objectives.
Rather than embark on the utopian road of preparing, at present, a European civil code â a legal 26th regime - would it not be more realistic to prepare model contracts or sector-specific rules?
That being the case, the responses to the issues raised by this oral question must permit greater familiarity with the content of the common reference code.
Selection of the legal base for an instrument dedicated to contract law must proceed from a political choice regarding the objectives concerned, rather than precede such a choice.
It is therefore vital that the Commission clarify the objectives of the work funded since 2003 by the European budget and place the European Parliament in a position to give an opinion on practical proposals.
It would be unthinkable to give companies the ability to apply European contract law, as devised by a working party, in place of directives and national rights without Parliament and the Council having approved its content on the basis of a very thorough legal and economic impact assessment.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree that point six is very important, partly because there are six Members here at the moment.
It is the first time that I have taken part in a debate that could be said to resemble the film âThe Magnificent Sevenâ, the seventh hero being the President of the European Parliament.
It seems to be a happy coincidence.
I agree with the previous speakers that holding this debate so late, just before midnight, is not a good idea.
I remember Polish parliamentary debates that ended at three oâclock in the morning and I never imagined this to be possible in Strasbourg.
However, it would appear that I lacked imagination.
We are awaiting the European Commissionâs decision on the Common Frame of Reference.
We hope that the Commissioners from Cyprus, Italy and Ireland will be able to state the Commissionâs final position.
The point of this legislation is to enable ordinary Polish, Czech, French, Danish and other citizens of the European Union to make use of this right.
It is also a matter of agreeing on and standardising consumer rights and other legislation making up the It is a very important matter and, once again, I would like to express my regret that we are discussing it so late.
However, I do think that the Commissionerâs words today reflect the importance the European Commission attaches to this problem.
Â Â  . Mr President, the fact that this is a late night debate does not mean that we do not place great importance on this issue.
The lateness of the hour is of no relevance here.
We take note of, and indeed, we take into serious consideration Parliamentâs position on this issue.
I regret that we still cannot give a more definite position as to how we will proceed or be more specific, but we are now in the process of clarifying and determining what is to be done next and the Commissionâs position on this.
As I said earlier, we have Parliamentâs position.
My two colleagues and I will hold a debate on a joint paper within the Commission over the next few weeks and then we will consult with the Council.
So, to take an optimistic view, I expect we will have a clearer picture by the end of this year.
We will not be wasting any time, because we will know how to proceed by the time we finish the first part, which is the consumer , so there will be no gap there.
Once again, I can assure you that we will keep you informed of developments and discuss our future approach with you, once we have formulated it.
Â Â  â I have received a motion for a resolution(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the oral question by Joost Lagendijk and Gisela Kallenbach, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Hannes Swoboda and Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, Doris Pack, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and Elizabeth Lynne, Sarah Ludford and Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to the Council, on the EU's preparedness for its future role in Kosovo (O-0082/2006 â B6-0426/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, may I put a point of order?
Is it not the Councilâs, the Ministerâs, intention to respond first to the question that has been raised?
The question that has already been put to the Council is clear.
Members will be given the opportunity to react to the Councilâs response in due course.
Â Â  â I must point out that the services have confirmed that in all cases, before the Council replies, the authors of the question shall present the substance of their query in order to move the question itself.
Â Â  . Mr President, most of these questions have been raised following a visit by a Parliamentary delegation in June.
During that visit, we got the impression that whilst the European Union is present and is getting geared up for the task which, as we all know, will be vital to Kosovo's future, the energy that is being invested in it and the attention given to it leave a great deal to be desired in a number of areas.
This covers a number of issues.
First of all, whilst the European Union is clearly making thorough preparations in the areas of security and justice, with a view to taking over the tasks of the UN, UNMIC, we are of the opinion that it is not in the areas of security and justice, however important that they may be, that the EU will be playing an important role.
What is equally important, for example, is coordinating all the efforts of the international community, continuing to help in the construction of a civil administration and, crucially, monitoring compliance with human rights.
Those are crucial tasks which soon, when the UN has left, and preparations for their departure are in full swing, will be the responsibility of the EU.
Our question to the Council and the European Union is the following: Are people really prepared, and able, to make thorough preparations â that is to say, in all those areas, and not just in the first two of them?
This preparation should, in our view, be made with the full consent and in good cooperation with the Commission.
I wonder, more out of interest than out of criticism, whether the Member States and Commission are able to get a fully-equipped Commission delegation up and running in time.
Finally, it is, in our view, crucial in terms of the symbolism involved that the EU should do everything in its power to keep its administration separate from that of the UN, UNMIC.
We cannot afford the EU coming across as a sort of EU-MIC, which is how it is sometimes perceived over there.
The symbols, the buildings, the manner of presentation must demonstrate that a new start has been made with the EU, in a Kosovo that is different from what it was when the UN were there after 1999.
Those are the questions we would like answered by the Commission and, above all, by the Council.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when we look back at the history of this region, some catastrophic events can be recorded in Yugoslavia, including MiloÅ¡eviÄâs activities in Kosovo, which have now resulted in us having to resolve this complex and important issue as far as Europe is concerned.
The West, and the European Union in particular, has not tolerated MiloÅ¡eviÄâs oppression, displacement and killing of some ofÂ the Albanian speaking population in particular.
This also means, however, that we have fought for values in this region which we now have to uphold as well.
I hope that the Council remains resolute in adhering to these values and urges that these values are observed.
What are these values?
Do they cover human rights?
The rights of minorities?
It is, first and foremost, if I may say so, the right to a homeland, which all individuals who have their homeland in Kosovo also have to be able to perceive in every aspect, not just in terms of everyday life and getting by, but also, and more importantly, as far as cultural and religious life is concerned which, in this region, for the Serbian population in particular, is very deep-rooted.
Is an independent Kosovo needed to live like this?
Yes or no?
I do not believe that there is a perfect solution.
Perhaps it would be perfect were we all able to live together in Europe without state borders and authorities.
I doubt this is a realistic prospect.
This is therefore a genuinely serious consideration which we have to face up to here.
What I am saying is that even for Serbia and the Serbian population as a whole, the fact that there was national unity in Kosovo which, as has already been mentioned, fully guarantees human rights and the rights of minorities, would not present a solution or amount to anything.
Independence, something which is looming on the horizon as far as Kosovo is concerned, must therefore be very clearly associated with conditions and European standards.
I hope that, in future, the Council will insist on this unequivocally in all deliberations.
It would have been better for us if, over past months, the Albanian majority had already demonstrated that it fully respected the rights of minorities, and here, above all, we are talking about the rights of the Serbian population.
This has only been the case in part.
We must therefore insist on the fact that this is fulfilled in full during the independence process.
In this regard, an appeal is made, first and foremost, to the European Union.
For those of us who were in Kosovo not so long ago, it was actually very encouraging that many representatives of the Albanian majority spoke of limited sovereignty which, in the first phase in particular, must also be accepted by the Albanian majority.
Which party can limit this sovereignty?
Certainly not Serbia, perhaps in the interests of Serbia and its people as well but, first and foremost, the European Union.
Now I come to the point already made by my fellow Member, MrÂ Lagendijk.
The European Union will have to play a major role in the legal system, in the sphere of security, especially that of the police, but naturally also as far as military security is concerned.
Responsibility for organising how the European Union plays out this role rests with the Council and naturally, with our colleagues at the Commission, because it would be terrible if Europe was again to speak with two contrasting voices in this region.
No, we just need a single voice in this region which stands up for human rights, for the rights of minorities in a future, independent Kosovo, which means that a limit on sovereignty can be lifted if Kosovo and the majority there also behave accordingly.
Now to my final point.
It is certainly difficult for Serbia to first have to cope with Montenegroâs independence and now that of Kosovo.
If Serbia receives the support of the European Union, however, a new Serbia can emerge which will prove a valuable partner for all members of the European Union.
I would therefore like to call on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to really make every effort, with the assistance of the Commission and the European Parliament, to help Serbia overcome this difficult phase.
It cannot be surmounted by giving Kosovo a formal structure in Serbia itself. It will be surmounted by two independent states being able to live together in peace and friendship.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commission President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to underline what my fellow Members, MrÂ Swoboda and MrÂ Lagendijk, have said.
They have actually covered all the issues already but I would like to go into certain points in further detail.
There are four different representations in Kosovo.
Firstly, the European Agency for Reconstruction which has done sterling work.
We have the so-called fourth pillar within the UN framework where we are essentially responsible for economic matters as well as privatisation.
The European Parliament has a delegation there and finally, we also have Council representation.
All this in the small region that is Kosovo.
The question must already be asked how all this is organised, how all these bodies are able to communicate with one another at all.
We now have this EU planning team, something we were able to establish when we were over there, which is responsible for ensuring the rule of law, but I find this all very restrictive.
The tasks facing us are much more extensive.
It will not do justice to the scale and importance of what we have planned for next year if we approach all of this in such a restricted manner.
We must endeavour to create capacities.
We must help build up the civil administration.
We must ensure that human rights and the rights of minorities are observed.
How do we manage this when there are so many players of our calibre, including the OSCE, the European Ombudsman and others?
The UN, which is also represented there in all of our names, has certainly done a lot of good through UNMIK over recent years, although it has also made a lot of mistakes.
It is probable that no other course of action was possible in rebuilding the civil and local administrations.
Would we do any better?
Do we have any men and women at all who want, and are able, to commit to working there, who are able to establish trust, who bring with them an adequate level of commitment to actually accomplish what we need on site?
To what extent can we, as the European Union, influence the police forces in Kosovo?
We know that it is their intention to create a military organisation.
To what extent are we maintaining more than just superficial contact with government bodies?
What role may European troops soon play in Kosovo?
I am aware that these are all questions to which we are awaiting a reply and which you are not yet in a position to answer, but I would like to say to you that I am personally afraid that we are not adequately prepared.
When we shift our attention to the neighbouring state of Bosnia Herzegovina, we see the difficulties facing us there and the multitude of problems that we still have to deal with.
We have a single representative there who was, and actually still is, all-powerful, and who could do anything which can actually only be achieved in a democracy using democratic legislation as a basis.
The problem is that we now have a situation there which is not up to the new challenges because people were not accustomed to taking responsibility themselves.
What we need in Kosovo is assistance to allow the Kosovars to help themselves.
By âKosovarsâ, I do not just mean Albanians, but also Serbs who live there and who we should actually expect to engage in the institutions.
The only thing lacking as far as I am concerned is pressure on the Serbian Government in Belgrade to allow Serbs in Kosovo to participate.
This is the real problem.
If we listen to Mr Oliver Ivanovic in Serbia, we know what he would like to do were he allowed to.
I believe that all that is lacking is pressure on the Serbian Government to give Serbs there the opportunity to build towards their future.
This must certainly happen at some point or other because Serbia is no longer responsible for them.
I am underlining what my fellow Member, MrÂ Swoboda, said.
With its neighbours, this region will become part of the European Union.
We must therefore see to it that it is in a position to resolve these tasks, that it heeds human rights and the rights of minorities, that, with our help, it develops all the administrative capabilities required to also adopt and transpose our legislation, and to then find a seamless path into the European Union in conjunction with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro.
I very much hope that we are able to offer this assistance.
I venture, however, to express a degree of doubt on this issue.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Lagendijk, our rapporteur, for raising this very timely question.
It is true that we came away from Pristina in June pretty concerned about the EUâs capacity to take on its future enhanced role in Kosovo and to see it through, because if we look at another territory where the international community took on state-building and reconstruction responsibilities â i.e. Afghanistan â we see incipient failure.
We need to learn from this experience that the commitment needs to be full, well-planned and consistent and not half-hearted and under-funded.
Even more so in the future, Kosovo will be an expensive commitment for the EU, but the alternative of chaos, ethnic conflict and crime is even more expensive.
We must treat Kosovo as the future EU member that it is.
The second lesson â and we hardly need to learn it from Afghanistan or Iraq, because it is so obvious â is: âitâs the economy, stupid!â
The most important challenge in Kosovo is the massive unemployment.
Obviously, status, constitutional issues and administrative capacity have to be sorted out and the security and policing challenges are acute. However, social and economic development is the vital key to peace and coexistence.
In this context, education, agricultural development, visa facilitation or, ideally, liberalisation, must be at the top of the agenda.
It is important to show Serbs and other minorities, as well as Kosovar Albanians, that they will be better off in the future.
In that connection, I should like to mention an idea.
It is not an original idea, but one borrowed from others, who have suggested creating an international university in Mitrovica along the lines of the South-East European University in Tetovo.
This is an excellent idea and I hope that we can find some rich donor who might be able to take it forward in what are likely to be the two municipalities of the town.
That could instigate economic development in the north of Kosovo.
My final point, very briefly, is that there have been concerns in the context of extraordinary rendition.
The former Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Gil-Robles, said that some time in around 2002 or 2003 he saw detainees â prisoners â in GuantÃ¡namo-type orange jumpsuits, apparently detained by KFOR, but was not able to pursue the matter.
Indeed, the Council of Europe Committee on Torture has not been allowed access to prisoners in Kosovo.
This is unacceptable when a territory is under the stewardship of an international community that purports to uphold human rights.
I hope that in future the EU will ensure that there is no doubt about Kosovoâs compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is well aware that the status process for Kosovo is a major challenge for the international community.
A positive, lasting solution is in the European Unionâs own interests.
The status process for Kosovo is led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
The EU is fully involved in the work via its special representative.
Likewise, the Union, and the Finnish Presidency in particular, are in regular direct contact with Special Envoy Ahtisaari, who recently gave an account of the situation at the meeting of the EUâs General Affairs and External Relations Council on 17Â July.
The UN Special Envoy is still trying to persuade both Belgrade and Pristina to take an active part in negotiations on key themes, such as decentralisation of government, religious and cultural heritage, economic issues and the rights of minorities.
Direct discussions and consultations with experts are continuing.
The parties continue to hold different views, but the process has been useful inasmuch as it has clarified positions and has helped to explore common ground for a future solution.
The European Union fully supports these objectives.
It has a leading role in matters relating to economic aspects of the process via its representative and the Commission.
The EU is pleased with the decision by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to move on to political discussions on Kosovoâs status and urge both parties to take part in a new round of talks in a constructive way.
The European Union fully supports the combined efforts of the UN Secretary-Generalâs special representative for Kosovo and Kosovoâs temporary self-governing bodies to implement standards.
There is also a need to prepare for a progressive move from the reform process according to these standards to one that is consistent with European integration.
Following status determination, the Unionâs involvement in Kosovo will cover three areas.
These are the Unionâs participation in any future civil presence, any possible civil crisis management operation concerning the rule of law, especially with regard to the police and the judicial system, and an EU presence with the purpose of lending support to Kosovoâs European perspective.
Preparations are under way in all three areas.
An EU Planning Team has been established by an EU Joint Action and has already been sent to Kosovo to prepare for a possible civil crisis management operation relating to the aspect of the rule of law which I have referred to.
The Unionâs future role in Kosovo is being planned in conjunction with the European Commission.
In this way we will use all the means at our disposal to try and ensure that there is consistency in the way the European Union acts.
A future international presence in Kosovo will not take the form of a European Union Mission in Kosovo (EUMIK).
After a solution has been found and when the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been gradually disbanded, Kosovoâs own institutions should themselves be responsible for dealing with their affairs.
Kosovo itself should assume local ownership and take responsibility.
International action should help Kosovoâs own institutions to take full responsibility for Kosovoâs affairs.
The European Union is very centrally involved in the implementation of a solution to Kosovoâs status.
It will be part of a future international presence and involved in any civil crisis management operation, and it will support efforts to strengthen stability and socio-economic development in Kosovo.
The EUâs future role there will also of course require a considerable amount of financing.
The Union is presently looking into ways of guaranteeing its involvement, as appropriate.
It is the common objective of the EU and Kosovo to ensure that Kosovo becomes a dependable partner, developing closer relations with the European Union together with our other neighbouring regions.
A key factor here will be the establishment of a democratic, multinational Kosovo, with a good basis for economic development and greater integration.
Â Â  . Mr President, Kosovo is indeed a part of Europe.
It is not our back yard, but our front yard, and in the long term, a future EU territory.
The European Union has a major responsibility for the future of Kosovo.
In our joint paper on the EUâs future role in Kosovo, presented in July this year, Javier Solana and I made it clear that the EU will have to take the lead in international presence after the status process has been concluded.
Our paper analysed the nature, size and responsibilities of a future international engagement; it also set out the EUâs role after the status settlement and practical means to realise Kosovoâs future European perspective.
I fully agree with Minister LehtomÃ€ki and those MEPs who said that UNMIK will not be replaced by any kind of EUMIK, but rather a leaner, more streamlined international presence or international civilian mission.
The joint paper, which was endorsed by the Council, supports the work of President Martti Ahtisaari.
Achieving a negotiated solution on the Kosovo status issue cannot be taken for granted.
The United Nations Status Envoy needs our full support to put forward a comprehensive package that will allow the UN Security Council to decide on the way ahead.
The key issue at stake is the protection of minorities, in particular of the Kosovo Serb minority.
The success of the status process will depend to a considerable degree on the ability and willingness of the EU to respond rapidly and concretely in support of an overall solution.
The EU needs to give a clear signal that it will stay in Kosovo to play a key role in the implementation of the status settlement and to support its long-term EU perspective through the stabilisation and association process.
The powers of the future international presence in Kosovo should be limited to overseeing the implementation of the status settlement.
All other powers currently exercised by UNMIK should, as a rule, be handed over to Kosovoâs authorities, so that they can govern with full responsibility and full accountability.
After the status settlement, our objective is to ensure that Kosovo becomes a reliable partner, progressing towards the EU together with the rest of the region.
The EU will need to continue supporting Kosovoâs Government in setting up a modern, open, market-oriented and business-friendly environment, based on EU-compatible structural reforms.
Finally, as members of the budgetary authority, you know that stabilising Kosovo will come at a cost.
I fully agree with Minister LehtomÃ€ki that we will have to make appropriate provisions in the future to be able to cover this cost.
The Commission is working with the World Bank and the local authorities to prepare a âKosovo Development Plan and Strategyâ for the medium term.
After the status settlement, we will organise a donorsâ conference to mobilise the international communityâs support for the people of Kosovo.
Let us remember that it is better to cover the costs of economic and social development than to send more soldiers to the Balkans.
Dear friends, in that respect, the keys are in your hands, and in those of the Council.
As Mr Poettering and other eminent MEPs are present here this morning, I would like to make an important point: the cuts to the Commissionâs staff budget proposed by the Council would make this task in Kosovo and the Western Balkans simply impossible.
The Councilâs plan would lead to the disappearance of 1700 posts at the Commission, starting with 170 posts in 2007.
Please do not ask the EU and the Commission to do more in ensuring external and internal security â be it in Kosovo, Lebanon or the Canary Islands.
If our hands are tied we cannot do as you ask.
EU policy and aid does not come from heaven: it needs competent staff to carry it out.
It also has a cost.
I have a special plea for the Finnish Presidency.
The current United Nations Status Envoy comes from Finland, and I have special responsibility on behalf of the Commission concerning the Western Balkans and Kosovo.
I hope the Council and the Presidency do not make our task of working for peace and stability in the Western Balkans and Kosovo impossible.
I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary dead-end.
I also call on the Presidency to solve this dilemma soon, without unnecessary delay, using the famous Finnish common sense, and not stubbornness this time.
Â Â  . â Mr President, over a twelve year period, through the use of terror, mass expulsions and attempted ethnocide, the MiloÅ¡eviÄ regime has created a situation in Kosovo which today means that over 90% of the population can no longer imagine being associated with Serbia in some institutional form or other.
This is the reality we must start out from, and this was also the reality when NATO intervened there.
This means that we cannot shirk the fact that we are at the threshold of clarifying the status question and that this clarification will comprise Kosovoâs national independence.
On the other hand, we are currently witnessing a policy in Belgrade which must be a cause for alarm.
Serbian politicians know precisely where the status question stands in reality, only they dare not risk admitting this to their own people.
In other words, they are attempting to make themselves out to be the victims.
They want the international community to basically strip Kosovo bare so as to then be able to make this out to be an act against the Serbian people.
If one reads the information service of the Serbian Church, it can be established that the relevant bishops there are quite openly writing about the fact that the Serbian Government does not wish to participate in any clarification of the status question, as this would ruin any chance of getting the country back at a favourable moment viewed from the point of view of world history.
It is there in writing.
This demonstrates the still explosive nature of the whole issue.
On the other hand, it demonstrates the pressurised situation in which the minorities in Kosovo find themselves.
All this serves to show that a massive presence on the part of the European Union and the international community will be required for a long time yet.
Two elements are therefore required.
On the one hand, speedy clarification of the status question.
I certainly agree with Sarah Ludford that the most important element is combating unemployment as far as this fledgling people is concerned, but nobody is willing to invest in Kosovo before the question of status is clarified.
We have therefore lost too much time on this issue already.
I believe speedy clarification of the status question is a prerequisite for an economic upturn and for eliminating unemployment and, hence, the most serious danger posed by radicalism.
On the other hand, however, we need this independence to be conditioned over the medium- and long-term, first and foremost, also as far as minority issues are concerned, and I believe that for our part, our presence must be anticipated for many years to come.
Given that, unfortunately, and this must be said unequivocally, UNMIK has failed to carry out its duties in many areas, a great many expectations in Kosovo rest on a European administration.
I agree with the Commissioner that we should give people there as much autonomy as possible.
We talk far too little of, and with, the government and the elected parties there, who often disappear behind the international appointees.
On the other hand, however, our presence will be required to safeguard democracy, the rule of law and peace in a strategically important part of Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my agreement with what my fellow Members had to say during the first round of this debate.
I too was a member of the delegation that visited Kosovo and Belgrade in Serbia.
It is clear that that part of Serbia, which Kosovo formally still is, is heading for independence in some form or other.
When you talk to the local people, particularly the Kosovar Albanians, it is impossible to draw any other conclusion, and I would add to express my agreement with what Mr Swoboda said on this subject: a form of independence, as they call it themselves, or limited sovereignty is inevitable, whether we like it or not.
I think that the facts are plain for everyone to see, so we should get used to the idea, and the Security Council will probably issue a ruling to that effect at the end of the year.
Everyone you talk to in Kosovo is convinced that the international community, NATO in the first instance, of course, will need to remain present for a good number of years.
NATO is responsible for military security.
It is also expected that the European Union will play an important role, and in that regard a number of key issues present themselves.
First of all, as others have already mentioned, there is the protection and the rights of the Serbian minority in Kosovo.
An important point in this connection, and I confirm in that respect what has already been said, is that we can expect cooperation and openness from both the Kosovar-Albanians and the Serbians who live in Kosovo, and Belgrade, too, of course has an important role to play.
That is also obvious from talking to people.
We must also ensure that we continue to bring pressure to bear on Serbia in that respect.
I should like to add that if we assume that independence as I described it is probably inevitable for Kosovo, we will still need to take the sensitivities of the Serbs and Serbia into consideration in one way or another, and we will also need to see what we can offer Serbia during the course of the year.
A more flexible way of awarding visas may play a role there as well, as a token from the European Union to demonstrate that we take that countryâs future in Europe seriously.
Needless to say, the international mission will also play an important role in the further economic development and in creating political stability in a possibly independent Kosovo.
Economic development, as is also apparent when visiting the area, is, of course, an important priority.
I think that all of this should be seen in the light of the European prospect that is actually, when one considers the statements, including those at the Thessaloniki summit a number of years ago, also being offered to Kosovo.
Everyone knows that the EU will, in future, be playing a bigger role in Kosovo.
Once its status has been established, everyone expects us to take over what the UN has been doing, but I agree with what everyone has said in this connection: our role will be different and some tasks will need to be redefined.
After all, it is apparent from discussions with people in Kosovo that many are critical of the UNâs role.
What they no longer want in any event is an international organisation dictating how they should run their own country.
They finally want to be in charge of their region, their country, and we should be prepared for this.
A great deal has been said about this, because the UN has made clear its intention of leaving next year.
That is a weighty responsibility for the European Union.
The European Union will need to play a role in the development of the police system, but will also need to supervise the development of the judiciary, and what is more, I think it is important to invest heavily in the administrative structures as well as in the economic development to which reference has already been made.
The European Union may well want to take over NATO's military role in due course, as it did in Bosnia.
I should like to address my last words to the Commissioner.
What struck us and what we wondered about is whether the EU is sufficiently prepared and whether we have enough human resources over there who can shoulder this important and heavy responsibility next year.
I should like to add to your appeal to the Finnish Presidency and express the hope that in its pursuit to deploy as many people in a positive way, it will demonstrate Finnish obstinacy.
Â Â  . â Today everyone knows that the international community made a big mistake by continually postponing the settlement of the status of Kosovo.
Time has not provided any solutions, but further complicated the situation instead.
The status of Kosovo must be resolved as soon as possible, and within this year.
If the talks do not produce results, then the international community must take responsibility for a decision.
We can see clearly the contours of the solution.
We know what we do not want and what we do want.
We do not want â because we cannot want â a restoration of the pre-1999 situation.
This would simply further escalate the crisis.
We do not want Kosovo to be split up, because this could launch a dangerous chain reaction in the region.
We do not want Kosovo eventually to join one of the neighbouring countries, because this would not serve the interests of stability either.
Kosovo can gradually regain its independence, its full statehood, depending on the degree to which it becomes viable and is able to guarantee human rights, minority rights, and the basic principles of the rule of law.
We must help Kosovo in achieving these, and in creating the necessary conditions.
I agree with the Commissioner that the key question is the guarantee of minority rights, especially those of the Serb but also of the Roma minorities.
This is of crucial importance for the entire region.
One of the starting points for the Balkan crisis was the denial of and disregard for minority rights.
We have to find a solution that can ensure broad-ranging autonomy for the Kosovo Serbs and the Roma as well, a solution that is guaranteed by the constitution, and for which the international community takes responsibility and offers guarantees.
But Serbia, too, must understand that its concerns about the rights of the Kosovo Serb minority are justified, but that morally they can only be accepted if Serbia in turn guarantees the same rights to minorities living within Serbia, for instance Hungarians and Slovaks living in Voivodina, and Albanians living elsewhere in Serbia.
In conclusion, the Commissioner has spoken of a very important matter: the role to be played by the international community, and more specifically by the European Union.
It is impossible to imagine creating a viable Kosovo without the active cooperation of the European Union.
We must help shape the organs of state government and help develop the economy.
Unfortunately, the 2007 budget does not make any provision for this.
Once again, words and deeds point in different directions.
We talk about wanting to take action, but at the same time the budgetary basis for our actions is lacking.
I ask Parliament to support in the current budget debates those proposals â some of which I myself have made â which serve the purpose of providing the necessary resources for bringing about a settlement for Kosovo.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I get the impression that this was exactly the right time to put this parliamentary question in relation to what emerged from the delegationâs visit, for the fact is that there really is much more left to be done if we are actually to be prepared for the tasks we shall have to carry out.
I am particularly disappointed by the proposals put to us today by the Council, which are not particularly practical.
The litmus test for us has to do with how the European Union manages to cope with the situation in what Commissioner Rehn so aptly called âour front gardenâ.
I think it would be true to say that we do not need UNMIK to be replaced by EUMIK, but I do know from personal experience that we do, in very many areas, still need a long process of monitoring by our partners; it is needed at every level of civil administration; it is needed in the police; it is needed in the performance of the justice systemâs functions and not least in the building of a democratic civil society, of which hitherto, alas, only the first budding shoots have been visible.
I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner Rehnâs view that we are not â in financial and personnel terms â prepared for the challenge that will face us from next year onwards, and that is why I beg the Council, as a matter of urgency, to listen to us and to appeal to the Member States to make it, perhaps, possible for us to remedy the situation to some degree through bilateral treaties and the supply of specialised personnel.
We have to adjust to the fact that the countries of Western Europe will, in the near future, be returning to Kosovo a very large number of people currently living within their borders; are we at all prepared for this?
Â Â  . Mr President, everyone expects that within a year, the independence the overwhelming majority of the people of Kosovo have longed for will be recognised by many states.
What matters in the discussions surrounding this topic is the question as to the conditions which independence must meet and how the Serb, Roma and other minorities will be protected.
It is still, in particular, uncertain what is to happen as regards North Point, which wants to return to Serbia, and the new municipalities that may have to be created especially for Serbs.
My group has bad recollections of the attitude which the European Union adopted between 1989 and 1999.
Nobody seemed interested in the peaceful mass opposition under the of the later President Ibrahim Rugova, during which all Serb state institutions were boycotted and the Albanian-speaking population set up its own government and school system.
The objective of the war in 1999 was not to liberate Kosovo, but to dominate Serbia in compliance with other European and American demands.
Unfortunately, Kosovo's independence, which is now inevitable, is not a choice motivated by the pursuit of democracy and equal rights, but the result of an industrial accident.
After seven years, it is plain for nearly everyone to see that continued occupation does not solve anything, while handing it back to Serbia would unleash a guerrilla war and enormous floods of refugees.
I agree with the questioners from four other groups that the European Union is now obliged to play a positive role in a peaceful and correct division of Serbia and the construction of democracy and economy in Kosovo.
Â Â  âMr President, the nineteen-nineties have become etched in our memory due to the monstrous crimes that were committed by our southern neighbours.
The world was shocked by how brutal and inhuman former neighbours and relatives could be in their behaviour towards one another.
The Muslim Albanians, who constituted 90% of the population and had been decimated by the police and the Orthodox Serb minority, were ârescuedâ by the military intervention of NATO forces in 1999.
Since then, the ethnic cleansing started by the bloody regime of the Serbian president Milosevic has ceased, but countless acts of aggression against the Serbian minority have continued.
Today, the Albanians are still living under international protection in areas reminiscent of ghettoes, where they are trying to rebuild their lives.
The Council has concentrated its efforts on the issue of legitimate government.
However, it lacks a comprehensive approach to this complex problem, particularly concerning the failure to uphold human rights, protect national minorities and take into consideration peopleâs right to a homeland.
Â Â  â Mr President, three minutes is a wonderfully long time.
I would like to make three points.
My first is that prolonging the negotiations will not bring any change to the fundamental differences between Serbia and Kosovo.
One of them is in favour of autonomy, the other is in favour of independence.
Therefore I feel very strongly that we should stick to the timetable and time limits envisaged by the contact group and have the issue settled by the end of the Finnish Presidency at the end of 2006.
We must stay firm on this.
The second point I wanted to make is that, much like MrÂ Posselt, I see no option other than independence, with some limitations on Kosovoâs sovereignty, of course.
It is important, in order to maintain stability in the region, that there is an international presence and most certainly that the European Union is ready to maintain a significant presence for some time.
The third point I wanted to make is that I think the Western Balkans by and large are a painful reminder of the weaknesses of our common foreign and security policy.
I do not think we should repeat the mistakes of the past, and in that sense we must stand very firm in supporting the UN Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, whom I feel is doing an excellent job.
I think that the EUâs best foreign policy is usually enlargement policy, and that is why it is very important to keep the prospect of enlargement alive for Kosovo and in the Western Balkans in general.
As a final point, I would like to make the observation that in 1999 the Finnish Presidency interestingly started with the then President, Martti Ahtisaari, negotiating peace in Kosovo and the Western Balkans.
I certainly hope that the Finnish Presidency in 2006 will end with a final settlement on the Kosovo issue and with independence for Kosovo.
Â Â  â Mr President, first I should like to welcome both the honesty and courage of Commissioner Rehn on the Council's stand on the 2007 budget.
Ladies and gentlemen, to be honest, the European Union cannot be efficient and reliable without Community resources in the Balkans and the Council's proposal to reduce Community resources in the 2007 budget is, in my view, an unacceptable proposal which cannot be accepted.
That being so, we surely all know that the European Union has an important role on the 'day after', in the period following the definition of the final regime in Kosovo.
However, the European Union also has a very serious role to play today and it has a role in the definition of the final regime.
We all believe in and support a peaceful, democratic, multiethnic and European Kosovo.
However, we must show equal support for Serbia within the framework of the European strategy, as defined at the Thessaloniki Council.
However, we believe that we should not get carried away by restricting timetables for defining the final regime.
Any thoughts of unilaterally imposing a solution on Kosovo may prove to be counter-productive.
The European Union should not repeat the mistakes it made in the 1990s.
It must formulate a common stand.
To close, I would like to refer to the question of Serbia, which particularly concerns me, because we have heard here from honourable Members with different views.
There can be no peaceful solution for Kosovo, there can be no peace, stability and security in the Balkans unless there is democracy in Serbia within the European Union.
From this point of view, the Council's decision to suspend negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is, I think, an important political mistake for the European Union.
Negotiations must start at once and, of course, we must see as they progress the implementation of the preconditions to cooperation with the International Criminal Court.
The Serbian people must not be punished for the traumatic past under the autocratic Milosevic regime.
Today we must see some sort of prospects for Serbia because, otherwise, we shall strengthen extreme nationalistic groups.
I close with the situation regarding minority rights in Kosovo.
All the recent reports by the UN Secretary General, the UN Human Rights Committee and non-governmental organisations describe a drastic situation for minorities, especially the Serbian minority in Kosovo.
We are talking about respecting ResolutionÂ 1244 passed in 1999.
We are talking about applying standards.
We must, at long last, move in this direction.
Â Â  The European Parliament has played a leading role in sending signals as to the future status of Kosovo.
The appointment of the Special Envoy for Kosovo is the signal Belgrade and the international public need to help them recognise the only possible future for Kosovo.
I am delighted to see that MrÂ Poettering is also with us today, as a difficult task will face us during his presidency of the European Parliament.
For this reason, it seems to me that our discussion should focus on what our Parliament can do to facilitate the future path of Kosovo.
Our first task should be to ensure clearer communication with the Serbian Parliament and to help Serbian politicians understand that Kosovo has already been independent for a considerable period of time.
Secondly, we must have direct cooperation with the body which will build democracy in Kosovo, the Kosovo Assembly.
The Serbian minority has a weak presence in the Assembly and is still manipulated to a great degree by politicians in Belgrade.
In addition, there are divisions in the Roma minority â it is divided into Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians and they have dissonant voices.
Here in Parliament, we can make a great contribution in this respect, and the Council can make an even greater contribution.
I should like to remind you that at present many Member States of the European Union do not recognise UNMIK passports.
The citizens of Kosovo arrive in the European Union holding UNMIK passports and we turn them away because we do not respect their documents.
Commissioner Frattini and the Council should do more to minimise the number of such incidents in the future.
The third difficulty we are facing is the disrespect shown to the different cultures in Kosovo and in this context the Serbian Orthodox Church is playing a very negative role.
As long as the Serbian Orthodox Church refuses to look to the future, we will have great difficulty convincing the Serbian community in Kosovo to integrate itself into the democratic institutions of Kosovo.
The key question, however, is that of status.
We have offered the Western Balkans a European future.
But we are well aware that only states can accede to the European Union.
A Kosovo that is not a state cannot take part in that process.
While we fail to resolve the status of Kosovo and ensure that it becomes a state in its own right, we will be lying to ourselves and to the public as a whole.
This is why, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude my speech by calling on us all, as Members of the European Parliament, to make our voices heard and ensure that the question of status is resolved now and not delayed until next year.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the discharge for the 2004 Budget in April, Parliament, on two occasions, made very explicit statements with regard to the European Agency for the Reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo.
This House explicitly stated, and I quote: âthat this Agency should not be phased out according to a previously determined schedule, but that its dismantlement should depend on economic and political pre-conditions and developments.
That, however, is precisely how the Commission is now choosing to phase out the Agency in question, and to hand over its tasks to the delegations.
Five months after Parliamentâs resolution, five months after Parliamentâs explicit statements, the Commission is taking no notice of what we said.
I should like to ask Commissioner Rehn why he ignores this statement by Parliament.
Why does he choose to let the expertise that is present in the Agency melt away like snow in the sun?
Why does he not choose to use the people who are currently working for the Agency in Pristina as a first core of EU people who will soon be able to guide Kosovo's independence from very close range and with much expertise and know-how?
That is what I want him to tell us.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it is not irrelevant to say that one cause of the present state of affairs in Kosovo is NATOâs war of aggression against Yugoslavia, in which many EU Member States participated, and in which it was their bombs that killed civilians.
Why, then, is the Serb minority in Kosovo under threat today?
That, too, has to do with this situation, and with the one-sided approach that the EU Member States took back then.
A second consideration is that people are being deported to Kosovo, even though many people find the situation there utterly intolerable.
It is intended that there should be more deportations, and the Commission needs to make it quite clear that this is not acceptable.
Joachim RÃŒcker has been put in charge of UNMIK.
I do not know whether that is a good idea in view of the fact that he was, formerly, primarily responsible for privatisations there, which did the people of Kosovo no good at all.
What I would like to know is how, in practical terms, the Commission envisages the future status of Kosovo.
What I have heard so far I have found highly unsatisfactory.
Commissioner Rehn was right to say that funds should be devoted to social and economic development rather than to military matters, and I am all in favour of that.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution of the status issue is not only in the interests of Kosovo itself, but also in those of the European Union.
It is, however, conditional on our finding ways of protecting the minorities â and by that I mean all of them â in a credible manner, for it has become apparent during our numerous visits there that people are still afraid, and events over recent years have shown that those fears are still justified.
That is something we have to take into account, and that is why the European Union still needs to be involved there, firstly in building up the police force â something that is very important indeed â and, secondly, in building up the legal system and the administration, for I share Commissioner Rehnâs view that this is where resources need to be made available, but Kosovoâs economic development will be dependent most of all on peace, stability and functioning institutions, and it is to these that our efforts must be particularly devoted.
This will also involve resolving the issue of which military forces are to perform the function of keeping Kosovo secure once it is independent, and I could well imagine a similar solution being arrived at to that found for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the KFOR being replaced by European armed services.
When we visited the country, I put this question to the Prime Minister, and it was evident from the answer he gave that nobody had given the matter any thought until then.
Greater involvement by the European Union in this area would also be in line with our security policy â or with the security policy of which I am an advocate.
What is important is that we, at this stage in the development of our security policy, should prioritise our efforts in our geographical neighbourhood, and the stabilisation of the Balkans continues to be our most important task.
Â Â  Madam President, integrating the Western Balkans into the European Union is one of the most significant challenges facing European policy over the coming years.
The issue relates to an area of Europe inhabited by numerous nationalities and ethnic groups, communities divided by country, religion, history and the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia in the nineteen-nineties.
Kosovo is the Gordian knot of European policy in this region.
The United Nations mission is now preparing for withdrawal from Kosovo.
This means that the European Union must be prepared to assume its role there in 2007.
The first challenge for the European Union in this new situation will be the as yet undefined status of Kosovo.
The recent UN-hosted talks in Vienna on 24 July did not lead to any breakthrough.
Serbia, which formally owns Kosovo, did not agree to independence for the province.
The Albanian authorities of Kosovo are not prepared to accept even the broadest autonomy.
In a peculiar form of psychological war, the Serbian authorities have, in recent days, accused the UN special envoy on the future status of Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari of lacking impartiality in the negotiations.
On the other hand, the political advisor to the Albanian premier KoÃ§o Danaj stated that by 2013, all Albanians living in the Balkans should unite and integrate within a natural Albania.
These events of this summer, which overshadow the Middle East conflict, constitute a major problem which the institutions of the European Union need to tackle over the coming months.
Another challenge is organising the future EU mission in Kosovo.
This problem relates to funding, structure, staffing and above all the EUâs political strategy in the Western Balkans.
No other country or international organisation will replace the European Union in its historic role of guaranteeing democracy, peace and social welfare, based on respect for diversity, in this part of the continent.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, reports about Kosovo describe the province as having become ghettoised.
A multiethnic community has not been established.
During seven years of international administration, the different ethnic groups have concentrated themselves in their own areas.
One main reason for why standards have not been achieved, despite the massive input that there has been, is that Kosovo is one of the main havens for organised crime in Europe.
International human trafficking and the trade in territory and weapons are rampant in Kosovo.
Nothing was done about this back in 1999, when the problem was noticed: we had to wait until 2005.
Now the global actors involved in the programme, however, have much too little time and too few staff for their many areas of responsibility.
We therefore need to make a greater effort to address this problem of crime.
Finally, I would like to say that now that the EU is also focusing its attention on Lebanon, we should think about just how aware we are of what has happened in Kosovo and whether there might be something to learn from it for the operation in Lebanon.
Â Â  â Madam President, the ugly situation and impoverishment of the peoples of the Former Yugoslavia are the result of foreign intervention, the unfair and dirty war unleashed by ÎÎÎ€Î with the participation of numerous countries of the European Union.
Your pronouncements on the protection of human rights are full of hypocrisy.
The objectives of this war are visible today.
It was to break up Yugoslavia and share it out and you succeeded in doing this by imposing foreign occupation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo and by creating protectorates.
Today you are not even abiding by the pronouncements and the commitments you made not to proceed to an independent Kosovo.
The creation of a protectorate, of an independent state is being promoted in Kosovo with the presence of a huge military force and a huge American base, so that you can control the area and change the borders.
We consider that the only solution which there can be is for all the foreign troops to leave the Balkans and for the people in the area to find a solution to their problems.
To close, I would advise you to look to history: just as the peoples of the Balkans expelled foreign conquerors, they will expel the new conquerors as well.
Â Â  It is obvious that the independence of Kosovo is inevitable, but the kind of independence this is to be will have a long-term effect on the stability of all of South Eastern Europe.
The European Union does not have a conception in this matter, but in reality, it is simply stumbling along led by the events.
It would be very important to adopt, at last, a consistent concept with regard to a solution for Kosovo.
The solution should be a dignified one, one that does not punish the Serbs while openly rewarding the Albanians.
Such a solution would lack dignity and would destabilise the region, that is to say South Eastern Europe, which includes Greece, Hungary, and the candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania.
We cannot stabilise Kosovo at the expense of destabilising the region.
At the moment everyone is talking about the minority question, but there is no encouraging conception on offer.
This is all the more interesting because MrÂ Ahtisaari and MrÂ OlliÂ Rehn are both Finns â and Finland has an exemplary minority system.
I cannot imagine a situation that would reassure the Kosovo Serbs as long as the northern part does not have territorial autonomy and the south does not enjoy a system of personal autonomy.
The whole process of decentralisation has not been thought through; self-government gives no guarantees in this regard.
As regards compensation for Serbia, membership in the EU, as we know very well, is not a particularly attractive prospect given the current EU fatigue.
We must take this into account as well, just as we must reflect on the fact that Milosevic had stripped Kosovo as well as Voivodina of their autonomy.
Everyone is talking about Kosovoâs independence, but no one mentions the minorities in Voivodina or the situation of the Muslims of Sandjak.
I fear that we are moving towards a bad settlement if we fail to work out a sound, dignified concept on behalf of the minorities.
I share all the concerns of my fellow Member MrÂ vonÂ Wogau.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, but above all, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, perhaps I might be permitted, at the end of the debate, to try to sum up the key points.
I think that you, and I am addressing the Minister when saying this, noticed that most of the questions raised, and remarks made, on this platform spring from genuine concern about the fact that the EU ... I am not doubting your sincerity or your awareness of what needs to be done, but I am nevertheless concerned â will be unable to complete all the difficult tasks it will be given within the time available, which is three to six months, not years.
I think, as many Members have said, that failure on the part of the EU is not an option, for that would be detrimental to both the region and the EU, and that is something we cannot afford.
If you say, and the Commissioner confirms, that the EUâs task is to monitor and transfer competences, then I â together, I believe, with most Members of this House â will sanction this, but it is more difficult than it looks.
It is a sort of new role, where we, on the one hand, need to let go of some things and, on the other hand, need to keep control in a divided society, where not all problems will turn out to have been resolved following independence.
At the moment, everyone in Kosovo still thinks that independence will solve everything.
That will not be case for economic problems, for example.
As regards a military presence, I hope with all my heart that all due attention for Lebanon and Congo will not result in people thinking that things will work out in Kosovo and that we can handle things here with fewer troops.
That will not be the case in the first few years.
I can do no other than support the Commissioner in his request to the Council not to ask the Commission for any more and at the same time, to make fewer funds and people available.
It cannot be that you and we ask the Commission to play a crucial role in Kosovo with fewer people.
I really do hope that the Finnish President, the Finnish Commissioner and the Finnish negotiator reach this conclusion, and in order to promote this, I, on behalf of the whole of Parliament, am quite willing to visit, at my own expense, a place where most Fins get their valuable insights, namely the sauna.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a status solution is the best option for Kosovo and for that reason we should support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari to find one, using all possible means.
As has been mentioned so many times in this debate, an unconditional pre-requirement for a lasting solution is to be able to resolve the issue regarding minorities, and that is something of a multigenerational problem.
The presence of NATOâs KFOR troops is important for the time being, but now and in the future we will need to pay special heed to the importance of the close relationship between military and civil action.
Apart from anything else, the European Union is preparing for a huge civil crisis management operation in Kosovo.
It will be on a scale never seen before and its main focus will be on the police and the rule of law.
We will need a good number of experts from the Member States of the European Union in order to carry out this operation, and it will be our challenge to find such a large number of experts.
The work of the Planning Team is as yet unfinished, but the intention is for their report to be in the hands of the Councilâs working group at the end of the month.
Preparations are thus making headway in many different ways and in many different sectors, but we can surely improve their steady flow.
Several times here there have also been references to the Councilâs draft budget for next year, especially with respect to how it will make the use of staff resources more effective.
The Presidency is very committed to finding a solution that will satisfy all parties, but it will also naturally have to listen to the views of the other Member States.
Besides, my opinion is that the situation is not as gloomy as we have been given to believe, especially in the Commissionerâs very emotive speech.
In the Councilâs view, enlargement is clearly a priority area and, accordingly, we are not proposing staff cuts there.
In fact, this maligned budget for next year increases administrative expenditure by 3.4%.
Admittedly, the cuts sought for the period 2007-2013 are very ambitious, but as the Commission is at the same time planning increases for enlargement, there will in any case be more staff in the Commission in 2013 than in 2007, even though we will be monitoring this ambitious trend.
So there will be more staff in 2013 than next year anyway.
We are trying to find, and we are committed to finding, solutions which will ensure that there are adequate numbers of staff to deal with important matters.
This is obvious, of course.
Finally, for some light relief and as the Finnish sauna was mentioned here, I will say that, however well the internal coordination of the Finnish Presidency proceeds, I shall not be joining MrÂ Ahtisaari or MrÂ Rehn in the sauna.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am a bit disappointed with the conservative approach of Ms LehtomÃ€ki in her interpretation of the sauna culture.
I should like to thank you all for a very substantive and responsible debate, which clearly shows that this House fully supports the prospects for European integration of the Western Balkans and Kosovo.
It is very important now â as was underlined by several speakers â to firmly support the efforts to conclude the status process within the envisaged timetable.
We will not gain anything from prolonging the process.
It is also true that peace and appropriate institutions lay the foundation for better economic conditions and job creation, which Kosovo desperately needs.
An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% unfortunately produces a very fertile breeding ground for crime and corruption.
We need to give the Kosovars the tools to help themselves.
Legal certainty and a well-functioning business environment are necessary preconditions for making economic progress in Kosovo.
At the same time, there is another precondition: whatever the precise outcome of the status settlement, it must include treaty-making powers for Kosovo.
As MrÂ Kacin said, treaty-making powers are needed so that we can negotiate with Kosovo and make it part of the stabilisation and association process.
Likewise, Kosovo needs treaty-making powers in order to make deals and contracts with the international financial institutions, which is another precondition for making economic progress and improving the employment situation there.
As to Serbia, it is certainly a â if not â key country for the stability of the Western Balkans.
The best service that Serbia can render the Kosovo Serbs is to participate very constructively in the talks to ensure that minorities are truly protected, once the outcome of the Kosovo status settlement emerges.
Serbia has firm and tangible prospects of joining Europe.
For our part, we are willing to resume the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement even on the very same day as Serbia achieves full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which should lead to the arrest and transfer of Radko Mladic.
It is in Serbiaâs hands and Serbia can make this European aspiration a reality and release the tremendous economic, cultural and intellectual potential that exists in the country.
I should like to correct one misunderstanding, which has not occurred here but often arises, namely the belief that the Council and Commission are competing in the Western Balkans.
That is not the case at all.
The Council and Commission are not competing, but cooperating fully and deeply for stability and democracy in the Western Balkans.
We work very well in tandem with MrÂ Solana, as do our services.
For instance, in relation to the rule of law, we need that cooperation because the rule of law â that is, the provisional training of judges and police â is a joint competence of the Council, the Member States and the Commission.
Therefore, in order to use that joint competence sensibly, we need cooperation.
That is what we have with Mr Solana and his people.
As to Mr Wiersmaâs question on resources, apart from Kosovo there are other burning issues, such as Lebanon.
How successfully the resource question is resolved will now be up to you, as the budgetary authority.
I am very grateful to the Finnish Presidency for its readiness to play a very constructive role in this very difficult matter.
I fully agree that the stabilisation of the Western Balkans is the first and foremost priority of the evolving European security and defence policy.
Indeed, as MrÂ Lagendijk said, we cannot afford to fail in this test case.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the Council statement on Albania and
- the recommendation by Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves (A6-0246/2006) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the proposal for a Council and Commission decision concerning the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part
(8161/2006 â C6-0197/2006 â 2006/0044(AVC).
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed on 12Â June was an important step on Albaniaâs path towards its future with the European Union.
We are satisfied that Albania has made progress in its reforms so that the talks on the agreement, which had been going on for so long, could be brought to a conclusion.
Together with the other mechanisms covered by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the pact will create a comprehensive framework for the further development of relations between the EU and Albania.
The Interim Agreement, which was signed at the same time, is intended to enter into force from the start of November.
It covers trade under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and related matters which will apply up until the Member States have ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement proper.
It is important that we start to make effective use of the Interim Agreement once it has entered into force.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is of major importance for Albaniaâs future.
It will enhance economic and political relations between the EU and Albania and make it easier for Albania to have closer ties with the European Union.
Albania is the third country in the Western Balkans (after Macedonia and Croatia in the former Republic of Yugoslavia) with which the EU has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
Signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement does not mean that the work has ended.
On the contrary, the real work is only really just beginning now.
We now expect Albania to demonstrate continued and effective progress in the implementation of the agreements.
It must work hard to take forward the reforms necessary for closer ties with the EU.
It is important that progress should be made in particular in such areas as freedom of the media, the return of property and compensation being paid, more efficient public administration and a respect for the principles of the rule of law.
We will continually stress the importance for Albania, as for the other countries in the Western Balkans, of stepping up measures to prevent corruption and organised crime.
There may be local elections in Albania in six monthsâ time, and Albania should ensure that it can see them through in accordance with international norms.
For the reforms necessary for closer ties with the EU to be taken forward, all the political powers will need to pull together.
The current political climate in Albania is worrying and is a serious threat to the progress of reform.
We are urging the parties concerned to take part in constructive dialogue and we are pleased that some initial first results were achieved just last week.
Finally, I would like to remind everyone that at the European Council in June the European Union once again endorsed the EU perspective in respect of the countries in the Western Balkans.
That means that Albania too has a future place in the Europe Union.
We must nevertheless remember that each countryâs progress towards EU accession stands or falls on its own merits in its attempts to meet EU requirements.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement provide Albania with the best possible framework for its own attempts.
The Union must of course continue to help, but most of the work still to do can only be done by Albania itself.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is a great pleasure to speak about the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania at the European Parliament today.
The SAA is an important milestone on Albaniaâs path towards the European Union and a major step for the EU itself in the Western Balkans.
It marks the beginning of a new phase in the EUâs relations with Albania and creates a new framework for partnership in a wide range of fields.
The SAA represents an important economic and political opportunity.
Increased trade liberalisation will bring significant economic benefits to both Albania and the EU.
Aligning Albanian laws with those of the EU will bring Albania closer to European standards and help further strengthen the ties between us.
Successfully implementing the SAA will be Albaniaâs next major challenge.
The SAA creates significant obligations in terms of trade, rule of law, democratic standards and fundamental rights, regional cooperation and new legislation.
The SAA sets up joint structures to foster dialogue and monitor progress, including a parliamentary committee.
This committee will be able to take forward the good work of the current Joint Parliamentary Committee and will provide an important opportunity to guide Albania in the best traditions of European parliamentary democracy.
I am sure it will also help to achieve a minimal degree of consensual political culture and underline the fact that a successful country in the European Union, or in the accession or pre-accession process, needs a broad political consensus on the question of European aspirations, as well as a basic consensus on a democratic culture in the country.
It is important to take this into account as Albania pursues its European route.
The Commission warmly welcomes the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for assent to the conclusion of the SAA.
In our political dialogue we share the committeeâs emphasis on encouraging Albania to build on progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and to address areas such as electoral reform, media freedom and human and minority rights with greater determination.
We welcome the recommendations of the Committee on International Trade on improving Albaniaâs business environment, which is vital to enable Albania to make full use of the agreement.
I want to conclude by assuring you that, from the EU side, the European Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the full benefit of the SAA is truly achieved.
I have made it clear to our Albanian partners that I expect no less from them.
Â Â  â Madam President, first of all my honourable friend, MrÂ Ilves, deserves fulsome congratulations on the very important work he has carried out on this important motion, which reflects the current state of relations between the European Union and Albania and highlights all the major problems and challenges facing the Albanian Government and the Albanian political forces.
It is a fact that the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement opens a new path for Albania towards Europe, towards the European institutions, with the ultimate objective of integration into the European family.
We must always remember this; it is what the European strategy decided in Thessaloniki says and I believe that the European Union has every strategic interest, despite enlargement fatigue, to strengthen these European prospects of the countries of the Balkans.
Clearly a great deal still needs to be done in Albania, as MrÂ Ilves has pointed out.
I should like to touch in particular on two or three points.
On the question of combating corruption, we are of course all agreed.
However, under no circumstances should the present Albanian Government use combating corruption as a pretext to settle political accounts with the opposition forces.
This is a serious issue which we have experienced in Albania in the past.
The second issue is the need to proceed immediately to reform the electoral system and update electoral rolls.
This is very important, because it will help to smooth out political life and consolidate a democratic political system.
The third issue is respect for the freedom of the media and, of course, the prevention of government interference in its operation.
I should like to point out here â and my comments are addressed to MrÂ Rehn â that there has been increased government interference over recent days in the operation of media of the Albanian democratic opposition, to be specific the socialist party.
I refer, MrÂ Rehn, to the Top Channel television network, which is being hampered in its operation by the Albanian authorities.
This too is an issue which we need to highlight.
Finally, respect for minorities.
Albania really does need to take important steps here.
There is a Greek minority which is playing an important role and is an asset to the democratisation of Albania and, of course, the functioning of the Orthodox Church and the spiritual role of Archbishop Anastasios must be facilitated.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Ilves, your report, Mr Ilves, shows a very great deal of empathy with, and understanding of, the young democracy of Albania, but also the rigorous approach that is required when considering it; it is a very good report, and I am grateful to you for it.
Many of you will be aware that I have, for fourteen years, been observing Albania as it has emerged from a long period of dictatorship and moved closer to the European Community.
It is for that reason that I am particularly pleased that we are able, today, to vote to approve this stabilisation and association agreement, something I welcome as an important step towards a relationship of trust between Albania and the EU, which will help Albania and its politicians to give the country the political, economic and institutional stability that it needs.
It will be very difficult to make progress down this road; to do so, it will be necessary to achieve the standards required, as laid down in the agreement, and for this Parliament, and our committee on relations with it in particular, to monitor this progress continuously and with the utmost precision.
We too, as good friends, will do as we have done for many years and highlight any deficiencies, including those yet to be discovered.
Although I think it much to be welcomed that war has been declared on corruption in Albania, I do also think that all the political forces must treat this campaign with the same seriousness, for it will not meet with real and lasting success unless they do.
Over recent months, a number of criminal gangs have been unmasked and arrested; this is a very good result and an incentive to further action of the same kind aimed at taking passport-forgers, drug-dealers and the like out of circulation and bringing them to justice.
The government is doing a splendid job in the educational field and thereby giving the many young Albanians a bit more of a future; I very much hope that it will do everything necessary to enable them to participate in the European Unionâs new educational programmes after 2007.
It is also a good thing that the government is making the effort to attract the investment that the country needs, although that will of course be conditional on the reforms in administration and the justice system that are so urgently needed.
Our resolution also highlights the need for the practice of the bloodfeud, still prevalent in many parts of Albania, to be stamped out; our call for this is founded on our European values, which, we hope, will soon guide the thoughts and actions of all Albanians.
I have no wish to conceal the fact that I found much of what happened over the summer months highly disagreeable, but, without going into unpleasant details, I would like to stress that what is urgently needed is political dialogue, and that political maturity is demonstrated by democratic behaviour and nothing else.
The political forces on all sides should also, and once and for all, stop constantly crying out for an international mediator to sort their problems out.
Albanian politicians are elected to resolve problems in a democratic manner and to perform in a constructive manner the role allotted to them, whether it involves exercising governmental responsibility or serving in the opposition.
Recent years have shown the futility of boycotts, and they would not be worth the effort now either; the Albanian people have had enough of that sort of stunt, and what they want is serious politicians with a serious interest in sorting problems out.
It is for this reason that it is so heartening that the political forces have come to an agreement on the tiresome subject of electoral rolls.
The European Union has for years been paying a great deal of money to get these lists at last drawn up properly, and it is still proving extremely difficult.
Local elections are due to be held shortly, and if the results are to be acceptable, they must be based on largely secure data.
The ongoing dispute between the government and a private television station can, I believe, be properly resolved only by full compliance with the law.
I would like, by way of conclusion, to remind the House that we have for a long time been arguing the case for easier visa arrangements for Albania and for the other countries of South-Eastern Europe, and so we very much welcome the return agreements reached by Albania and the EU.
Albania is among the few countries that have done this, and one of the things we are calling for by means of our resolution is prompt action on the part of European governments to make it easier for students, academics and businessmen to get visas, with, of course, a more relaxed visa regime for all citizens following on as soon as possible.
Criminals either acquire visas by dubious means or have no need of them, being, as they are, familiar with other ways of getting across borders, but the success of efforts in Albania to combat crime may perhaps make it possible for European governments to at last work miracles where the allocation of visas is concerned.
Â Â  . Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank our rapporteur, MrÂ Ilves, for the work he has done.
Albania is a difficult, complicated country, and I think that he is correct in his analysis of it and the conclusions he has drawn.
We too welcome the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and will vote in favour of it here today.
The agreement reflects how much has been achieved with sheer perseverance, and opens the way to EU candidate membership on the basis of the agreements that were made in Thessaloniki.
Our group will continue to support Albania in the steps it will have to take as it moves towards European integration.
Until the early 1990s, Albania was the most isolationist country of the European continent.
By signing this agreement, it joins with various other Balkan countries that have made courageous strides over the past year.
Croatia is now negotiating with the EU about membership; Macedonia has received candidate-member status and clear progress has also been made with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
We, as a group, did briefly consider asking for deferral of vote on this agreement, as a means of bringing some pressure to bear on the authorities in Albania and getting them to ensure that the forthcoming local elections run smoothly, but we think you can also turn the argument around, by saying that signing this agreement, Parliament's approval of it, spurs all parties in Albania on to behave properly and to continue on the road towards political and economic reforms, in respect of which we can work with the criteria we used in other countries that worked on a future within the European Union, particularly, of course, the first Copenhagen criterion.
We should, however, not lose sight of the fact that there is still a long way to go.
This signing does not mean that the Albanian Government, which has presented the concluding of this agreement as an important victory, can rest on its laurels, and I hope that people in Albania are aware of this.
If we consider the Copenhagen criteria, the ultimate benchmark for EU membership, the Albanian Government should be alerted to a number of things.
I have already mentioned the local elections, which, we assume, everyone will keep free and fair.
We will ensure that they are, while also hoping that the Commission and the Council will keep an eye on things.
Secondly, I should like to comment on the situation in the media.
Free and independent media are indispensable for a transparent and robust democracy.
It is clearly up to a countryâs government to make sure that those are in place, but we have to establish that the media are under pressure to some extent, partly due to the proposed change to the Act on electronic media.
There are also some question marks surrounding the judiciaryâs independence.
Those are all issues which the European Union will need to monitor closely, even after the ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
Finally, we have perceived a degree of political polarisation in that country that concerns us.
That is not new, but we still cannot see any closure in that respect.
We would therefore like to urge the government and opposition to adopt a mainly pragmatic and constructive approach, for only then can Albania fully utilise the scope which this agreement offers.
