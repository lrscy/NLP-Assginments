Turning to state aid issues, in particular in reply to Sophia in 't Veld, state aid is in principle, as we are all aware, banned by the Treaty to avoid distortions of competition in our single market.
State aid can indeed be a legitimate tool to deliver outcomes which are in the general interest, for example regional cohesion, research and development, as well as innovation and high-quality public services which markets themselves will not deliver.
That is why our approach is to design a new set of state aid rules, which we did with the review.
It uses a more economic approach to assess where market failures exist and to target appropriate aid measures on them.
That is a balanced and a realistic view.
It reflects the need to help Member States get the best out of taxpayers' money - state aid is, at the end of the day, taxpayers' money.
The Commission publishes its state aid scoreboards twice a year.
As you are aware, this presents data and analyses of Member States' expenditure on state aid measures.
It includes a focus on Member States' progress towards the Lisbon goals of less and better aid.
The next edition will pay close attention to the question of recovery.
In addition, a series of indicators and statistical tables on our Europa website gives scope for further discussion.
But Sophia in 't Veld is right: we need to do more to evaluate the effects of state aid, whether it makes sense and how.
That is how the new more economic approach could help us.
I can be brief in response to Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil: we have discussed this before and we know exactly what the dossier is about.
We have taken the Member State concerned to Court for not respecting our two Article 21 decisions under the Merger Regulation.
My colleague, Charlie McCreevy, is taking parallel action under the internal market rules.
I am always open to your suggestions for further improving the way in which competition policy makes markets function better.
I badly need your ideas and your creativity.
We are doing our utmost to complete this process, and I am grateful for your continued support and valuable contribution.
We are not there yet but are on the right track.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 19 June 2007.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Parliament's report on Competition Policy 2005, we acknowledge the efforts made by the Commission to modernise competition policy.
I should like to highlight the main recommendations of the report.
In the crucial area of energy, we support the Commission's action on ownership unbundling.
We reiterate the call on the Commission to clarify at Community level the public service obligations to which operators of services of general economic interest should be bound, with regard to strategic security and universal coverage.
We also believe it is important to ensure that the EU's external dimension is consistent with competition policy when it comes to negotiating bilateral trade agreements.
In spite of the Commission's efforts at harmonising practices and guaranteeing transparency, it is a fact that there is competition in terms of incentives between EU regions and Member States, which, along with the absence of tax harmonisation, foments the artificial relocation of companies.
These and other challenges illustrate the need to strengthen the EU's ability to deliver effective competition rules and to improve flexibility of response to new challenges.
Hence the importance of continuing to give the European Competition Authority the resources it needs.
Cat and dog fur (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council banning the placing on the market and the import of, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur - C6-0428/2006 -.
Madam President, we have had the opportunity in the past to discuss this proposal in committees and intergroups.
I am sure you will understand that I am very happy to be having this debate with you tonight.
First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the work of all Members of the European Parliament, especially that of the rapporteur, who has done a very good job.
I would also like to thank the draftswoman and draftsman of the other committees, Mrs Lucas and Mr Stevenson.
It was a real challenge for me when I was first confronted with this issue after taking up my post.
For me, the most frustrating part was that we had an issue which was very close to the heart of European citizens and which had the support of the Council and, clearly, of the European Parliament but also of the Commission, yet we still had problems in proceeding with this proposal.
The problems were, of course, legal and not the result of a lack of political will.
I am happy that we have now reached a point where, using some imaginative and constructive approaches, we have managed to find solutions, and that we are now able to have a first reading agreement, which is very important to me.
We are all familiar with the issue and know that the disturbing evidence of barbaric treatment of cats and dogs, which are bred and killed mainly for their fur, especially in Asia, has provoked a strong call for the Commission to take action.
As I have said, we had to find ways not only to express tangibly the political will of all the institutions involved and the citizens, but also to do so in a legally sound way that would ensure that this will could face and withstand any challenges arising in the future.
I am very happy that, through the proposal and, in particular, the various trialogues, we have managed to reach a compromise.
This compromise is legally sound and will ensure that the ban will be effective in practice.
For us, it is important to have results, not just to issue a political statement or express political will, which would eventually become ineffective.
It would be correct politically, but it would not produce the results that we want: the protection of cats and dogs and, even more importantly, of European consumers who do not want to be offered the fur of cats and dogs, which they consider their pets.
I would like to mention two of my colleagues by name, Mr Mandelson and Mr McCreevy.
Both were very supportive of our work in this area.
As you know, the legal basis we have been using relates to the internal market and trade.
This was necessary, because, unfortunately, there is no legal basis in the Treaty that would allow the EU to adopt a legislative initiative to ban a particular trade based on animal welfare or ethical concerns.
Furthermore, there is no legal basis for animal protection as such in the Treaty, so we had to use these two legal bases, and my colleagues have been very supportive of this work.
We also had another legal challenge: the issue of proportionality.
For reasons of proportionality it was necessary to consider including a provision that would allow for possible derogations to the ban.
None of us was happy with this idea and, as I said, the only reason was to make this proposal more legally sound.
I believe that we have managed to reach a proper compromise.
As you know, this approach was also clearly supported by the legal services of all three institutions, the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
But the compromise we have today is the right one.
It contains the possibility - and I emphasise the word 'possibility' - to derogate exceptionally from the trade ban for taxidermy or educational purposes.
We have used the legal bases described and we know that this approach will benefit not only European consumers but also animal welfare, especially since we cannot introduce our animal welfare rules outside the European Union.
We cannot promote them internationally, but, by closing the market to the unscrupulous people who practise this trade, we are not only sending a clear message but also helping to stop this practice.
Finally, Parliament, the Council and Commission have worked very hard to get the legislative proposal to the present stage and to reach an acceptable compromise.
I very much hope that the vote tomorrow will reflect this positive and constructive attitude, so we can put this legislation in place as soon as possible.
rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow when we vote on this report, we shall have the opportunity to make great efforts to put a stop to the dreadful cruelty sometimes suffered by dogs and cats - animals of which we often make pets.
As the rapporteur responsible for this matter, I am both pleased and satisfied with the report on which we - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have now agreed.
I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation. I also wish to thank the Chairwoman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs McCarthy, together with my fellow Members.
I wish to thank Mr Stevenson who, I know, has worked for many years in order to achieve progress on this matter.
Everyone has shown a lot of commitment and a desire to obtain an outcome that is good for dogs and cats.
The work has been extremely interesting, particularly in view of the interest shown by the public in this issue.
I am completely convinced that the opinions widely held among the public and among animal rights organisations have contributed very significantly to our reaching this agreement.
I want to say a big thank you to all those committed people who have added names to petitions and participated in a variety of campaigns.
They have shown that we no longer accept such cruelty to animals.
Thank you, everyone.
Your protests have borne fruit.
Many of us have seen documentaries, films and pictures showing dogs and cats having their fur removed even when they were still alive.
It is enough to see just one picture or documentary showing such cruelty to animals to realise that everything must be done to put a stop to it.
The Humane Society estimates that more than two million cats and dogs are kept prisoner under disgusting conditions before being killed for the sake of their fur.
The fur and skins are then sold under false designations such as 'China wolf' or 'Asian wolf' and used, for example, for cuddly toys for children, decorative objects, clothes and handbags.
We must now put a stop to this trade, above all because of the extreme cruelty involved in fur production.
That reason is enough, but nor - I might add - is there any need for cat or dog fur in any product at all, because synthetic materials can be substituted for it.
False descriptions extensively deceive consumers.
Unsuspecting consumers can buy toys for their children in good faith and without having the slightest idea that a cat may have been skinned alive in order to be used for that very toy.
It has been maintained in the debate that we need the skins in question in order, for example, to relieve joint pain, in other words for medical reasons.
My answer to that is that, in 2007, no patient is prescribed cat skin to combat rheumatic pain when he or she visits the doctor.
We have progressed beyond that.
I, as rapporteur, together with everyone committed to this cause, had great hopes, then, when the Commission's proposal was accepted.
We believed that we needed a total ban, but the Commission's original proposal made certain exemptions possible, for example when the label stated that the fur came from cats or dogs that had not been bred or slaughtered for manufacturing purposes or when the skins concerned were personal belongings or household objects.
My view throughout has been that the regulation would be an empty gesture if scope were allowed for such exemptions, as the situation would be quite impossible to monitor and the exemptions would pave the way for continued trade and for the dreadful practices described.
It was not a regulation of that kind that people were requesting or demanding of the EU.
I am therefore now pleased to be able to say that we have a proposal for a total ban following discussions with the Commission and the Council.
I hope that Parliament will support the proposal tomorrow by voting in favour of the amendments to which the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has unanimously agreed.
We also have proposals concerning the way in which the rules would be applied in the Member States, and we propose that the Member States should also have to report to the Commission on the way in which compliance with the rules is monitored.
I am convinced that the public will be watching us carefully when we vote tomorrow, as there is a real demand for measures to be taken on this issue.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Madam President, I should like to really warmly welcome Mrs Svensson's report and to congratulate her on her excellent work.
She has been a brilliant rapporteur and we have got a very positive result.
It is very clear that Parliament is united in saying that there should be no derogations that would compromise the integrity and the effectiveness of a ban.
However, I must say that, in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission, we have had to wait quite a long time.
I remember writing to Commissioner Byrne back in 2002 calling for a ban on cat and dog fur.
We were told simply that it was a very complex issue and the Commission was reflecting.
What worries me about that is that in a sense this slowness is being repeated on another issue that I want to turn your minds to, which is the issue of banning imports of seal products.
Again, Parliament is being told that it is a complex issue.
Exactly the same language is being used again now, when it comes to seal products, as was used back in 2002 about cat and dog fur.
As the draftsperson in the Committee on International Trade, I tabled amendments to the cat and dog proposal, not suggesting that we try to include seals - that would be too much - but at least asking the Commission to bring forward similar legislation to deal with imports of seal products.
This was agreed by the Committee on International Trade.
The Commissioner said earlier that there was no lack of political will when it came to dealing with the cat and dog issue, what was lacking was an imaginative legal base.
I urge the Commissioner and his services to be extraordinarily imaginative and to recognise that Europe's citizens feel the same revulsion about cat and dog fur as they feel about imports of seal products.
We must have legislation coming forward very urgently on that issue as well.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Madam President, I wish to begin by expressing my very warm thanks to Mrs Svensson for a brilliant piece of work and a brilliant report.
I also wish to thank Mrs McCarthy for her dedication and commitment to steering this very important report through Parliament.
However, most of all, I am grateful for the great courage of Commissioner Kyprianou, because, as Mrs Lucas has just said, the previous Commissioner told us that it was impossible and there would never be a legal basis.
I remember Commissioner Kyprianou saying to me, 'As a lawyer, if I went round telling clients that things were impossible, I would never make a living!'.
He has fulfilled his pledge.
It is music to my ears to hear this debate this evening, because it has taken eight years to get this far, with the help of Humane Society International.
Betsy Dribben, who used to work for Humane Society International, has flown over from Washington and is in the public gallery tonight, and many thanks are due to her for her dogged campaigning.
Humane Society International estimates that, every year, about two million cats and dogs are killed in China alone to supply the fashion market in Europe with items like this little toy, which the rapporteur mentioned - little cats, which mums and dads buy for their kids because they are cat and dog lovers, not realising that they have been made out of real cat and dog skin from animals that have been brutally killed.
The trade buys these cat skins to make collars for trim for parka hoods and ski boot and ski glove linings and all sorts of fashion items.
This has been a fraud perpetrated on the public.
The public are never told that they are buying items made of real cat and dog fur.
Sometimes it is even dyed to look like fake fur and given false labels to fool the public.
I am glad that, at long last, there will very soon be a regulation on the statute books in all 27 Member States banning this evil trade.
I thank the Commissioner and everyone else who has been involved in achieving that.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, in fact Mr Stevenson is right: eight years ago Labour MEPs were calling for an end to the cruel trade in cat and dog fur.
Commissioner, you will probably remember that the late Phillip Whitehead, the former chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, asked you as a Commission to take action.
On 30 December last year, I received a petition on behalf of concerned citizens signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban.
We have acted, but I believe that it is the citizens, in their determination, and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade you, Commissioner, to give us the legal power to ban it.
There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur.
Animal welfare organisations have been contacting my office and welcoming the law.
Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long.
But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes, toys and household products made from cat and dog fur.
I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and legal barriers.
I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee's negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog fur products do not end up in the shops by the back door.
So can I just be very clear: we insist no loopholes are created by not possible derogations, exceptional derogations.
That is the language of the agreement we made with the Commission and the Member States.
We insist on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working.
We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban.
There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders.
In short, a ban must mean a ban in principle and in practice - not a restriction enabling continuation of the trade by the back door.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I fully support the ban on imports of cat and dog fur.
At the moment, it is the least that we can do to combat cruelty to animals.
Dogs and cats have a particularly close bond to humans.
They serve us and are devoted to us.
Cruelty to these animals is particularly hurtful.
We know that killing dogs and cats for fur is cruel and European Union Member States should not be indifferent to this practice.
We cannot influence how animals are treated in other cultures, but we can at least say 'no' to goods bought at the price of unimaginable suffering caused to animals.
We should say 'no' to any kind of cruelty, irrespective of the victim involved.
Sensitivity is universal.
A sensitive person would never condone the suffering of another being, whether it is another human or an animal.
The Union will have a purpose when it becomes a community of people who are sensitive to all pain, to all suffering.
I wholeheartedly support the rapporteur's position.
At the same time, I would like to express my appreciation for her report and the work of the rapporteurs from the expert committees, Mr Stevenson and Mrs Lucas.
Parliament is taking a significant step towards changing the way in which we treat animals.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Kyprianou, ladies and gentlemen. I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur.
It is thanks to Mrs Svensson's persistence that Parliament will be able to adopt, as early as tomorrow, at first reading, a Regulation banning the trade in and processing of dog and cat fur.
In the trialogue with the Council and the Commission, Mrs Svensson successfully fought for a complete ban on the trade in and processing of this fur and thus said a clear 'no' to the derogations originally proposed by the Commission.
We must now ensure that the Member States implement this Regulation properly.
This represents a great success for animal protection.
This Regulation will eliminate once and for all the situation in which millions of cats and dogs have been kept and killed, sometimes in atrocious conditions, so that their fur can be processed and exported to Europe.
This is also a triumph for democracy in Europe, as numerous citizens have called for this ban in the form of signature campaigns and petitions.
This Regulation is also in the interests of consumers, as many citizens were completely unaware when purchasing products such as soft toys, clothing or keyrings that these contained dog or cat fur.
All too often, traders have circumvented the existing voluntary code of conduct and placed dog or cat fur on the market mislabelled or with no labelling.
It is high time Europe took this important step for international animal protection, and thus followed the example of other countries, such as the USA and Australia, who introduced a similar ban years ago.
Now, by means of tighter customs controls, new methods of analysis and criminal measures, we must ensure that the provisions adopted today are enforced effectively throughout Europe and all legal loopholes eliminated.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the choice has been put before us of whether to ban outright or restrict the trade in the furs of cats and dogs in the EU, and I congratulate and want to thank not only the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, but also the Committee on Legal Affairs, which, having been asked for its opinion on this matter, has plumped for the first solution.
It was in fact high time that the Member States were reminded that dogs and cats are companion animals and that the trade in their furs and in products derived from them must not be accepted or even tolerated.
Imposing, by law, such a ban in Europe, and making provision for effective and deterrent sanctions in the event of its being infringed, is the very least one can do today.
There is no end to the fraudulent and deceitful practices that one finds going on, particularly in Asia, with the labels of most clothes made there - be they coats, hats, handbags, gloves, and shoes, not to mention toys, decorations and small leather goods - bearing the deceptive description of 'leather' or 'real fur'.
If a stop is to be put to this ignoble trade, each and every European citizen must adopt a responsible and ethical attitude by demanding, specifically, the labelling of all leather, skin and fur goods and of all food and pharmaceutical products whose origins might be a matter of doubt.
Let us unite in refusing to encourage those countries in which human rights and dignity are disregarded and which, moreover, have no sense of having a duty of care for animals.
(SK) I would like to begin by observing that the fur industry has always been important in Slovakia, but it did not really start to expand until after 1990.
Following Slovakia's EU accession, Slovak furriers have been exclusively importing fur materials from buyers in EU Member States.
Being direct importers, these buyers can ensure the full legality and legitimacy of the imports, including the relevant certificates.
I understand the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, and share her opinion that the large number of petitions and concerns expressed by consumers and citizens throughout the EU means that the Commission cannot remain inactive over the matter of banning the trade in cat and dog fur.
It is indeed necessary to clarify existing legal requirements in all Member States.
We must respond to the ethical concerns expressed by citizens over the possible presence of cat and dog fur in the Community, particularly in view of the indications that these animals may be being raised and killed in an inhumane manner.
Consumers are concerned that cat and dog fur cannot be readily distinguished from other furs or synthetic materials imitating fur, and this may give rise to unfair and fraudulent practices involving fur products, including fraudulent or misleading designations.
There is no tradition in the Community of breeding cats and dogs for the purpose of manufacturing fur, and in fact the vast majority of products from cat and dog fur present in the Community come from third countries.
In order to protect the internal market, customs supervision over the movement of goods from third countries to the European Union should be tightened.
Illegal imports could be addressed by stricter penalties against perpetrators, including heavy fines or the withdrawal of licences.
I firmly believe that it is necessary to adopt European legislation that would unify market rules in the EU Member States At the same time, however, EU initiatives must not become a brake and cause the fur industry problems by disrupting legitimate fur trading.
We must avoid putting up obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and ensure the free movement of legally traded fur and fur products in general.
(DA) Madam President, like my fellow Members, I wish to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, for an outstanding piece of work and for her excellent cooperation on this matter.
The regulation we are debating today is a good, important and very necessary piece of legislation.
It is good legislation because it enables us to send a clear signal to the many EU citizens who have asked us to do something to prevent dogs and cats from being used for fur production.
In this way, we are showing them that we are in actual fact listening to their concerns and making an active attempt to put a stop to cruelty to animals.
It is also an important piece of legislation because it has emerged that we cannot stop the sale of dog and cat fur solely by means of bans in the individual Member States.
During the committee reading of the regulation, Mr Stevenson of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection showed us many dog and cat skins bought in Europe, including a skin made from four golden retrievers and bought in my own home city of Copenhagen.
In Denmark we already have a ban, but it is clearly not good enough.
We therefore need an effective ban at EU level.
The proposed legislation is also necessary because huge numbers of dogs and cats lead wretched lives that end in the most terrible suffering imaginable, and all because they have to provide fur for clothes and toys.
By devising a common EU ban, we reduce the market for the sale of dog and cat fur and, at the same time, send a powerful signal concerning the repugnance we feel towards cruelty to animals.
I am therefore delighted that we have managed to devise as strict and sound a ban as this.
The exemptions provided for will be so rare that they will each have to be justified and approved individually.
We are as close to a total ban as is legally possible at the present time, and that is to be welcomed.
However, the legislative text is not enough in itself.
It is crucial that we continue to work on developing methods to enable us more effectively to identify where fur originates and to stop the traffic in illegal fur, which shady and unscrupulous characters will otherwise not hesitate to sell.
(FR) Madam President, our further discussion of the importation of the skins of two million slaughtered Chinese dogs and cats is comparable to that which we had in the 1990s, when we returned on three occasions to discussing the importation from the Arctic regions of the furs of animals killed in leghold traps.
On each occasion, whether we were talking about seals, dogs, cats or foxes, I am sorry to have to say that the Commission played for time and allowed the trade to continue to the greater glory of the Market Almighty.
Let us never forget that, in March 1996, despite proof that mad cow disease was capable of being transmitted to humans, the Commission threatened four German LÃ€nder with sanctions for their refusal to allow the importation of suspect cattle.
The lesson one can learn from all that is that the logic of the market demands that everything be capable of being bought or sold or used as a means to making a profit, whether it be dogs, cats, kidneys, eyes, women, children, slaves, or workers.
That is why the economy must be subject to political constraints, in order that those great values that are beyond price may be re-established.
Madam President, over one million Europeans have lobbied in favour of banning the import of cat and dog fur into the EU.
The Commission listened to the European Parliament and reacted by taking legislative action to ban the import of cat and dog fur.
I welcome this and hope that we will see an end to the barbaric trade which accounts for the slaughter of over two million cats and dogs each year.
However, we do not just want warm words.
Some constituents have raised concerns that loopholes in the Commission's proposal may allow imports via the back door.
I recently tabled a written question asking the Commission about derogations that might allow the trade to continue.
The reply that I received gave information on two derogations, one relating to fur that was part of personal or household effects being brought into the EU, and the other relating to fur or products containing fur that have not been bred or killed for fur production.
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament report deletes these derogations and I urge colleagues to fully support this report.
We want to be sure that cat and dog fur will not be imported into the EU.
Madam President, I welcome the fact that several EU countries - France, Italy, Denmark, Greece and Belgium - moved unilaterally to ban the trade.
However, there are differences in the approaches of other Member States, ranging from bans on rearing and slaughter to labelling requirements.
These differences can cause problems for consumers, retailers and traders alike.
That is why, as we all know, an EU-wide ban is so important if we want an end to this vile trade.
We have already heard that 2 million dogs and cats are slaughtered each year for their fur and that it takes at least 10 dogs and up to 24 cats to make a single coat.
These animals live in horrific conditions and many are skinned alive.
Since the US brought in a ban, more cat and dog fur is coming into the EU.
The problem is that many customers do not know what they are buying, as cat and dog fur is quite often labelled as fake fur.
It is also included in a variety of products other than clothing, such as some homeopathic medicines, children's toys and accessories.
I welcome the debate tonight and the vote tomorrow and I congratulate the Commissioner on his commitment.
Madam President, before making a few points, I should first like to briefly mention two practical issues.
Firstly, I appreciate the need for monitoring and reporting, and that is why we are in agreement with Parliament on this.
Effective and analytical methods are in place, which will be very helpful in implementing this legislation.
Secondly, on labelling, it was always debatable whether labelling would be enough.
We decided - and I think Parliament was in agreement - that labelling was not enough and therefore we proposed legislation.
However, on the general issue of labelling, we are following very closely voluntary initiatives, programmes and schemes that already exist to cover other fur products and ensure that consumers are properly informed.
On the issue of seals, I have to say at the outset that it is not my responsibility.
My colleague, Mr Dimas, has already made a statement to Parliament on this issue.
I was expecting this question, so I can tell you that EFSA has already been asked by the European Commission to provide a full objective assessment on the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals, which was what Commissioner Dimas promised you.
We expect to have this report in November, and based on that the Commission will assess in the shortest possible time the options to respond to this issue.
I am sure my colleague will be very happy to discuss this issue with you once he has received the EFSA report.
Allow me to make two or three points.
I understand the frustration of many of you who were here before I was.
You have talked about 'a long time'.
I have been in office for only two and a half years and I have already produced a proposal.
I do not know what happened in the past, but I think we would all appreciate that this Commission would not only make a commitment but also deliver this proposal within a reasonable time.
I would just like to mention that.
Secondly, I appreciate that the support of the European citizens has made a great impact; it was a great issue for us and it helped me convince those who needed convincing.
However, you have all had a chance to talk with me privately on this issue and you know that I personally did not need to be persuaded or convinced about this.
As soon as I was informed about this practice, I immediately gave instructions for my departments to start working on it.
Therefore, credit me with the fact that I did not need any convincing as soon as I saw the films and knew what the practice was.
Thirdly, let me mention the derogations.
I know your views.
From the very beginning I said that I was not happy with them either.
However, you must realise that we started with a completely negative approach and then we managed to present a proposal.
If the Commission wanted to allow loopholes, we would never have brought the proposal in the first place.
We are just trying to find the best possible way to make it legally sound to be able to withstand any challenges before the court.
That was our approach.
We proposed several derogations; these were not agreed upon.
We have found a very positive outcome with a compromise.
Trust me, we never intended to allow any loopholes.
What we were trying to do, based on legal advice, was to make this as effective and as solid as possible.
The principle was upheld by the other two legal services.
Therefore, I am very happy that we are having this debate and that we are competing with each other as regards who wants more - what more could one ask?
This is the right approach and your support gave me enough strength to convince whoever needed convincing.
Therefore, I am looking forward to working with you on many other issues that touch upon animal welfare.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 19 June 2007.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Eva-Britt Svensson, for having done a splendid job, and for having added certain elements to the Commission initiative, in particular that violation of the ban will result in prosecution and that derogations to the ban are unacceptable.
She has been able to see through the entire process diplomatically, so that now we only need to adopt the long-awaited ban in plenary without further ado.
The whole process has also been an exemplary indication of how decisions and legislation at EU level can be influenced by citizen action.
There would hardly have been an initiative for legislation on the matter but for the petitions by citizens and active lobbying.
I do hope that this example will encourage the citizens of the Union to take a more active part in EU decision-making.
I welcome the Union's proposal on a complete ban on the trade in cat and dog fur because I believe that it is unacceptable that around two million dogs and cats are butchered every year for this purpose.
12-15 dogs need to be killed to produce one dog fur coat and 24 cats for one cat fur coat.
The vast majority of European consumers condemn the barbaric slaughter of our favourite domestic animals and do not wish to buy these products.
This is why importers often give cat fur products various invented names to mislead the well-meaning customer.
We need to have a comprehensive EU ban and put an end to this barbaric practice permanently.
As so often happens, company self-regulation has proved to be ineffective in this case too.
Retailers do not even label which animal the furs originate from.
At the moment, fifteen Member States ban the trade in dog and cat fur, but there has been no general ban in the other countries until now.
A comprehensive ban is an important step towards a more humane, animal-friendly society in Europe.
Multiple sclerosis (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to the Commission, on the Multiple Sclerosis Code of Best Practice - B6-0124/2007).
author. - (PL) Madam President, the European Parliament has dealt with health issues on a number of occasions.
However, the view is often expressed that Parliament should focus on general health issues, such as medical treatment, insurance and appropriate care for those both ill and healthy.
People sometimes say that it should not concern itself with specific diseases.
However, I think that the disease being discussed today, namely multiple sclerosis, is a problem on such a dramatic scale that Parliament's involvement is justified.
Neither is it the first time that the European Parliament is taking action in this field.
A few weeks ago, on 29 May of this year, a conference was organised in Brussels by the European MS Platform. This conference was held under the auspices of the President of the European Parliament, Mr Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, for which we thank him, and was organised by Mrs Uma Aaltonen.
I would like to remind you that Mrs Uma Aaltonen was once one of our colleagues.
She was a Member of the European Parliament and a member of the Committee on Petitions, of which I am the chairman.
Mrs Uma Aaltonen suffers from multiple sclerosis herself.
She is a writer, a journalist and a teacher, and particularly supports this cause.
I would like to remind you that the Committee on Petitions dealt with the issue of multiple sclerosis in petition 842/2001.
As a result of this petition, the Committee on Petitions produced a report which was discussed in Parliament during the December plenary session in 2003.
Thanks to our cooperation with multiple sclerosis associations in all the Member States and the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, a code of best practice was drawn up on the basis of this report and the resolution which accompanied it.
The matter is really extremely important as the tragic situation facing multiple sclerosis sufferers is not reflected in statistics.
As the participants at this conference pointed out, and as we heard during our previous debate on the subject, mortality statistics often state as the cause of death the failure of the pulmonary or the cardiovascular system, but do not mention that the primary cause of the pulmonary failure was simply muscular paralysis and that the patient suffocated, or that the cause of the cardiovascular failure was multiple sclerosis.
Therefore, the statistics often do not provide us with the relevant information about how many people are seriously ill, how many suffer and how many die as a result of this illness.
Multiple sclerosis sufferers are ill for many years.
In the end, the cause of their death, statistically speaking, it pains me to say, is an entirely different disease.
The Committee on Petitions met multiple sclerosis sufferers, we participated in these conferences and, during our mission to Berlin, we met the Minister of State of the German Government, GÃŒnter Gloser, with whom we discussed the matter, as the petitions committee of the German parliament is also dealing with the issue.
Today, I would like to put a question to the Commission and to ask it to state the means, methods and efforts that it has undertaken to implement the European Parliament's resolution and the code of good practice that was drawn up on the basis of the resolution.
I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could answer this question.
Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that we acknowledge, understand and appreciate the seriousness of this disease.
Not only is it a serious disease, but it also affects young men and women in Europe and all over the world in the most productive period of their lives; people who have usually already formed their own families, have young children, have all their life ahead of them and then have to go through these difficulties.
Also, we appreciate the importance not only of the European Parliament's resolution but also of the code of best practice, which was drafted by the Platform.
As I have already said, the Commission also participated in the first European conference on multiple sclerosis last month, and that conference was organised in the context of our public health programme.
It was a project funded by the programme 'Multiple Sclerosis - the Information Dividend' and led by the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform.
Of course, many of the aspects relating to this disease have to be dealt with by the Member States, so it is a gradual process that will take some time, but the Commission is there to help, support and encourage.
At the conference, many essential points were presented concerning the follow-up to Parliament's resolution of 2003, especially regarding the discriminatory treatment afforded to people with multiple sclerosis.
The Commission is taking action in the main fields covered by the proposal regarding a code of good practice on the right of people affected by multiple sclerosis to quality of life.
Some actions target multiple sclerosis directly; others are of a more general or, let us say, horizontal or generic nature but, again, they are of benefit to the issue of multiple sclerosis as well, for example, the issue of equal rights and access to treatment and therapies for multiple sclerosis.
The Commission, within its more general framework of safe, high-quality and efficient health services, is reinforcing cooperation between Member States.
It is helping create reference networks for diseases, exchange of best practice and centres of reference, and the objective of these will be to ensure equal rights to patients and equal level of treatment all over the European Union.
So, once these networks are established, they can cover multiple sclerosis as well, especially with centres of reference and exchange of best practices.
On research, on the other hand, we have a more directly targeted agenda and initiatives.
The seventh Framework Programme includes collaborative activities on research into brain-related diseases, human development and ageing, with particular emphasis on how to turn basic discoveries into clinical applications.
One first call proposal for this topic was neuro-glia interaction in health and disease, which is of direct interest to the multiple sclerosis research community.
Also, under the preceding programmes (the fifth and the sixth), the Commission funded 18 projects on multiple sclerosis, the largest of which, in the sixth programme, totalled EUR 11.4 million and related to neuro-protective strategies for multiple sclerosis.
On the issue of employment and discrimination, which is important for us, Directive 2000/78/EC already prohibits discrimination based on disability in employment, occupation and vocational training, and requires employers to put in place reasonable accommodation tailored to the individual case to enable a person with a disability to work or undertake training.
The Commission is committed to encouraging actions and promoting strategies for the adaptation, and reintegration into working life, of affected persons.
On the issue of participation and empowerment, the project I mentioned earlier, 'Mutliple Sclerosis - the Information Dividend', will facilitate consensus on agreed European quality standards on information about multiple sclerosis, which has to be accessible, delivered in a timely manner by appropriately skilled and experienced professionals and provided in an equitable and efficient way.
Finally, I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission intends to discuss with Member States a proposal for a large European consensus conference on neuro-degenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, to be held in 2009 or 2010, and the Commission will be able (on the basis of conclusions endorsed both by public and private stakeholders at that conference) to propose a communication or other relevant policy initiative, including specific actions in all the fields of disease prevention, research and management of this group of diseases.
We will, of course, keep Parliament informed of all the next steps.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed three and a half years ago that Parliament, in a resolution to both the Council and the Commission, asked for important measures to support European citizens suffering from MS. As the Commissioner already pointed out, much progress has indeed been made.
Whilst on behalf of Parliament, I expressed our support at this conference on 29 May, I would still like to put three specific questions to the Commission.
The code of good practice should indeed be circulated and adopted in all Member States as quickly as possible.
Is the Commission prepared to make information on MS available in a similar form on the EU's health portal for all patients?
My second question is about the MS concept project that was launched recently within the framework of the health programme and funded by the Commission.
This project must lead to an MS register that can be used by everybody.
Will the Commission be supporting this financially?
Finally, I should like to ask you whether the Commission will be taking any further initiatives in terms of framework legislation, in which priority is given to safeguarding MS patients' jobs?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Libicki for taking the initiative of bringing this matter before the House tonight.
I welcome also my own opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.
As regards the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis, and indeed the prevention of their marginalisation from society, there is a huge disparity in the way in which people affected by multiple sclerosis are treated across the European Union.
Consequently, many thousands of people and their families suffer unnecessarily a poor quality of life.
Access to essential drugs, therapies and services, are too often not driven by need, but by where a person happens to reside and whether their government invests sufficiently in those needs.
It is a sad fact that it is not always the case of Member States not having the resources to provide such care and services.
My own country, Ireland, is a prime example.
We have had 10 years of enormous economic growth and wealth, and yet we still have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients among the EU's wealthy nations.
We need more research to advance our understanding of the illness and how best to treat it.
Regrettably, in this House we constantly face opposition to such research, particularly embryo stem cell research, which offers the best hope for making advances.
Finally, it is not appropriate to allow a situation to continue in which citizens of the European Union are treated unequally.
While I acknowledge that it is primarily a responsibility of the Member States to deliver health care, it is also a responsibility of the European Commission to ensure that equality is applied across the board.
I would like to see them sponsoring a 'race to the top' in terms of services for people with disabilities generally, but certainly people with multiple sclerosis.
I believe publication of the progress being made by Member States signing up to this code of conduct would help drive that race to the top.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, there are approximately 400 000 people with multiple sclerosis within the EU.
Louise McVay's petition brought our attention to MS in 2003 and it is only right that, three and a half years on, the Commission reports on the progress it has made in ensuring that the code of best practice, in particular, is implemented.
The 2003 resolution called for equal access to health care for people with MS, but some drugs, like beta interferon, are still not uniformly available.
In the UK we have a postcode lottery for this drug, with availability depending on where someone lives.
In Poland only 1% of people with MS are treated with disease-modifying drugs, compared to 50% in Sweden.
People with MS should be cared for in the best way possible, as called for by the code of best practice.
It also calls for people with MS to be able to retain their jobs and obtain sufficient help and support to remain in mainstream society.
That is why, as the Commissioner said, it is so important for the Employment Directive 2000 to be implemented equally across the EU.
This year is the Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
Let us hope that it is also the year that we get a firm timetable for specific directives to outlaw discrimination in access to goods and services as well.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, people who live with MS came to us in the Committee on Petitions to alert us to the discrepancies in treatment and opportunities for people with MS across the EU.
Geography should not determine whether your disease goes into remission or progresses.
In my own country of Ireland, we have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients: 17, where we should have a minimum of 39, a fact that negatively affects the outcome for Irish patients.
I would like to correct Mr De Rossa: stem cells obtained from the destruction of embryos have, to date, produced no treatments, whereas stem cells from cord blood have produced over 70 treatments, and it is to be hoped that, some day, there will be a treatment for MS.
Finally, I would like to point out that, in spite of modern medicine and the abundance of food and water, the burden of disease in the EU is increasing.
Why?
Because instances of MS and every other autoimmune condition, of which there are many, are on the increase.
There is a widespread breakdown in the functioning of the human immune system.
This is a crisis that we should not ignore.
It is time to take an honest look at the unnatural and constant way in which modern life bombards the human immune system from its earliest stages, resulting in problems like poor immune development and immune collapse...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Madam President, in 2003, the European Parliament adopted, by a decisive majority, a resolution on the unequal treatment of multiple sclerosis sufferers in the European Union.
At the time, the blatant discrimination affecting many multiple sclerosis sufferers in Europe resulted in Parliament asking the Commission to draw up a code of best practice to which all Member States should adhere.
Four years have passed and the problem of MS has returned with double the impact as a result of the appalling situation facing sufferers in the new Member States.
In terms of the number of MS sufferers living there, Poland ranks third in Europe.
However, in contrast to the first and second place countries where 30% of sufferers have access to standard treatment only 2% of MS suffers in Poland have access to standard care.
The situation is similar in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary.
If we also consider the fact that MS is an illness that affects young people and is the second most frequent cause of disability in Europe, the conclusions are obvious.
I would therefore like to ask you to compare Parliament's common position on MS with the results of the Commission's work, particularly taking into account the situation faced by MS sufferers in the twelve new Member States.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, multiple sclerosis should - and must - be recognised through better support for sufferers and by finding practical solutions.
This can be achieved through equitable access for citizens to health services and through the equitable provision of all effective means.
There are broad differences between the Member States in the quality of care.
The adoption of the Code of Best Practice proposed by the European Parliament is an expression of our political will to determine uniform methods of care and rehabilitation activities. This will support the right to an independent life, which depends on the provision of prompt and suitable health and social care for dignity and independence.
At the same time, the aim is to have more, better coordinated research.
The McBay case illustrated how even one citizen fighting alone is enough to turn the attention of the decision-makers to cases which may be unheard of sometimes or overlooked.
The emphasis must be on joint efforts by the Member States and their experts to remove the obstacles, Commissioner.
What role will the Commission play?
Madam President, almost everybody knows that true equality in the 27 Member States is but an elusive dream.
This is particularly so in the field of health care, and it is most obvious when dealing with complex neurodegenerative disorders such as MS, which require highly specialised diagnosis and treatment centres.
Yet, in this most important area for citizens' wellbeing, namely their health, our Treaties let us down disappointingly, as they place this area under the sole competence of Member States.
Strangely enough, those responsible for making and maintaining the EU Treaties seem to care more about equality in business and marketing matters than about our health.
Perhaps this debate on MS will lead to some wiser thinking and be the catalyst for changing this unsatisfactory and, in many respects, shameful state of affairs for the benefit of our citizens.
Madam President, I would like very briefly to thank the Members for this interesting and very useful debate.
It will give us ideas and inspirations on how we can proceed with this important issue in the future.
I should like to give some information on the questions that have been posed.
First of all, creating the link to the health portal is already under way; as we speak, it may have been done already.
So, access to this information through the health portal will be made available to all citizens very soon, if it is not already available.
The Commission will support the creation of a European register on multiple sclerosis, which will mostly be based on the existing registers in some Member States and expanded to include the other Member States.
More importantly - because we have to be practical as well -funds to support this initiative will be provided under the seventh Framework Programme.
On other issues, of course, many pieces of legislation are already in place, such as the issue of discrimination and access to work.
However, based on the outcome of the conference which will take place in the future, which I mentioned in my opening speech, and on the discussion with the stakeholders, we will see if there is also a need for new legislative initiatives and consider what steps have to be taken.
We will then, of course, be ready to proceed with new initiatives.
Overall, as you know, we are dealing with inequality; it is a difficult issue.
It was a priority of the UK Presidency and has been taken over by the Commission and the other Presidencies as well.
But we have to live within the realities - the existing legal and Treaty realities of the European Union, the issue of competences, how much the Commission can oblige Member States in certain areas of health.
Most is done through guidelines and recommendations.
Even under the proposed Constitution as it stands, provision of health care remains the sole competence of the Member States.
So, we try to encourage, coordinate with and support the Member States, and we will raise this issue with them whenever possible but, at the end of the day, this specific area of health care provision is the responsibility of the Member States.
That does not mean that we will not continue encouraging them to proceed, to follow the code that has been mentioned and to take other steps, but I believe that, through our health service initiatives (we will be presenting a proposal before the end of the year), we will be able to tackle some of these aspects and, of course, I will be happy to continue discussing these with you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
It is not easy to take part in a debate on a disease that affects over 400 000 people in Europe, with a new case every four hours.
It is not easy because multiple sclerosis, the causes of which remain largely unknown, affects young people in particular, people of my own age who see their ambitions and dreams for the future crushed without warning, not to mention the impact on their daily lives.
Today, however, there is tangible, genuine hope thanks to the important and encouraging progress made through scientific research, with determined work day after day taking new steps towards identifying causes, mechanisms and cures for the neurological collapse brought on by multiple sclerosis.
At this stage our chief duty is to promote, support and encourage this research, including financially; it must be free from conditions and from limitations and fears, which are often bigoted and promote other agendas.
At the same time, all the commitments made by the European Commission in its 2003 resolution must be honoured, in particular with regard to drawing up a code of best practice.
I also believe that it is the specific duty of the Community institutions to promote and support the work of all associations, such as the AISM [Italian Multiple Sclerosis Association] in my country, which, with dedication and professionalism, do commendable work and provide targeted help for those affected by multiple sclerosis and their families.

The situation in Palestine (debate)
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all been deeply moved and disturbed by the terrible events and tragic occurrences in the Gaza Strip over the last few days.
As you know, I chose to make the Middle East the destination for my first official trip outside the European Union and visited the region.
My meeting with Mr Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, was originally scheduled to take place in Ramallah, but, because of increasing hostilities between Fatah and Hamas, he asked me to visit him at his official residence in Gaza, where he was trying to mediate between the opposing factions, and that is what I did.
It was exactly three weeks ago that I was having talks with President Abbas in Gaza, when I was impressed by the calm determination with which he explained his convictions to me, yet, once outside his official apartments, I could feel the tension in the air.
My recommendation to you, Members of this House, is that you condemn the Hamas militias' violent attacks on the legitimate security forces and the institutions of the Palestinian Authority in the strongest terms, and it is out of the deepest conviction that I recommend that you express our support for President Abbas and our solidarity with him.
We support the Palestinian President's decision to announce a state of emergency and appoint an emergency government in order to be able to resolve as soon as possible the political crisis in the Palestinian territories.
The new prime minister, Mr Salam Fayyad, recently visited me in Brussels; we have great confidence in him and in his leadership qualities, and, should you mandate me to do so, I shall say so to him today.
The new government has a difficult task; it will need active assistance from the European Union and from the international community, and I should like to say, following on from the conclusions adopted at yesterday's Council of Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, that we in this House should act on our deepest convictions in supporting, in word and in deed, those who seek peace in the Middle East and are continuing to work for it.
Yesterday, at the opening of our plenary session, this House decided to defer voting on a resolution on the European Union's Middle East policy until the July plenary sitting, and, given the continuing instability and the constantly changing situation in the region, I do believe that was the right decision to take.
That does not mean, however, that we have any intention of being passive observers of what is happening.
The European Union - and that means this House too - must be in the advance guard of those working for a renewed relationship with the Palestinian people and those responsible for representing it.
We must shoulder our responsibility and act accordingly, doing everything in our power to get conditions throughout the Palestinian territories restored to those worthy of human beings; while we must support those who live there in meeting their most pressing human needs, we must also help to give them a real and long-term political perspective.
Yesterday's Council of Foreign Ministers resolved to restore normal relations with the Palestinian Authority, and this is something we should welcome, together with the related decision to create the conditions needed in order to facilitate the resumption of efficient and transparent direct financial assistance and help with the development of functioning institutions.
The mission under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, together with the police cooperation mission, are remaining in place, and, as a decision-making part of the EU's budgetary authority, this House should firmly support that decision.
As well as taking these steps, though, we in this House should call on the Palestinians to return to the path of dialogue in order to achieve the reconciliation that is needed before there can be a Palestinian state covering the Palestinian territories as a whole.
It cannot be in anyone's interest that the civil war should become more widespread or go on for any longer.
It has to be said, though, that there can be no peace without Israel, which bears a great responsibility.
When I paid a visit there - and especially when I addressed the Knesset - I made it quite clear that the European Parliament was and is calling on those in positions of political power in Israel to express their firm support for President Abbas.
With that in mind, I would like, now, to reiterate my call for Israel to release to President Abbas the Palestinian customs duties and taxes - amounting to some USD 800 million - that it has been withholding for several months now.
The Israeli Government has declared itself willing to do that, and should now actually do so with the minimum possible delay.
The European Union must be an honest broker, and I see the European Parliament's role as being to play a responsible part in this.
The peoples of Israel and Palestine are equal in dignity; they are entitled to live within secure borders.
May the day come when Palestinians can live at peace with Palestinians and Palestinians with Israelis; a policy of reconciliation and mutual understanding along these lines may, today, appear to be a long way in the distance, but we in this House, being the representatives of the people of Europe, must support it as a matter of conviction and out of a sense of our own responsibility.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that our Parliament was right to alter the agenda in order to deal with the Middle East situation.
Unfortunately, I am very doubtful as to whether our debate will help in the quest for a solution to the conflict, but we clearly had to hold it all the same.
Just a few days ago in Brussels we held a debate on the situation in the Middle East with the High representative and Commissioner Ferrero in which we recognised the fortieth anniversary of the Six Day War, during which Israel invaded Gaza, the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
Today, 40 years later, we must accept that the situation is still in deadlock - as the French press reminded us yesterday - that it has not been possible to create a Palestinian State and that, unfortunately, there are effectively two governments in conflict with each other.
Furthermore, there is an extremely serious political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis.
You were asking, Mr President, what the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, can do, and what we clearly have to do, firstly, is support Mahmoud Abbas and the moderate government of Salam Fayas, the destiny of which is not just to be the government of the West Bank, but also of Gaza.
We must also lift the international blockade - as you also pointed out, Mr President - imposed on Palestine since Hamas won the elections.
We must therefore welcome the decision taken yesterday by the General Affairs Council to restore direct aid to the Palestinian National Authority, and we hope that the meeting that is to be held today in Washington between the President of the United States and the Israeli Prime Minister will take us in the same direction.
It is also time, Mr President, for Israel to transfer the sums owed to Palestine in customs duties.
While these are all necessary conditions, however, Mr President, they are clearly not sufficient, since we all know that the situation in Gaza is still one of violence and that, in reality, in the difficult equation of war and peace, progress can only be made in the Middle East through the renunciation of violence as a means of political action, through the recognition of the State of Israel and through any actions, such as the release of the British journalist Alan Johnston, that may contribute to the objective of peace.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all political men and women in this House, and we are perfectly aware that the highest of the political values is unity and that, without unity, it will not be possible to realise the dream of a viable Palestinian State living in peace with its neighbours.
Mr President, as you have pointed out quite rightly, it is time for the guns to fall silent so that dialogue can prevail and peace can be consolidated, and it falls to the European Union, together with other players such as the United Nations or the Arab League or other members of the Quartet, to mobilise all of its efforts in order to contribute, intelligently and generously, in a manner that is consistent with its tradition and it values and, from the point of view of humanitarian aid, naturally, to a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we have to regard the events of the past few days as representing a nadir in the development of the region, I would see it also as representing a nadir in our own - the European Union's - role in its dealings with the Middle East.
Yesterday, the Council of Foreign Ministers decided to resume sending aid.
Why, though, did they wait to do that until after civil order had broken down?
(Applause)
You, Mr President, have just called for the payment of direct aid to Mahmud Abbas.
I would ask whether it might be the case that it is too late for that.
Is it not perhaps possible that the disintegration of civil order in the Gaza Strip - which is what is happening now - might have been prevented if the aid had been sent earlier on, and if we had not imposed on ourselves, as a matter of strategy, the rule that there were to be no talks with Hamas?
(Applause)
I do not myself know the answer to that question, and we are certainly not in a position to say that things would have worked out better if we had acted differently, but it is a question that we must at least be allowed to ask.
Is it not also the case that we - that is to say, the European Union and the community of Western states - are now, once again, seeing that there is a process at work, whereby a people elects a government that we do not like the look of; we are happy with the elections - which our electoral observers confirm were unobjectionably conducted - but not with the result that emerged from them, and so we come to the conclusion that what is needed is a blockade, and a complete one at that.
Why was it that we did not actually talk to those members of the government of national unity who are not members of Hamas?
There were many members of the government who were not members of Hamas, or of Fatah either.
The forces with whom we find ourselves talking may not, for the moment, be to our liking, but dialogue is nevertheless the only way to reach peaceful solutions.
I can remember - as you all can - how, when I was a young man, Yasser Arafat was seen as the world's number one terrorist; the man was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
I was in favour of engaging in dialogue with him.
History has shown that it was dialogue that provided a way out of violence.
Today, Fatah is regarded as one of our partners; it was once seen as the terrorist organisation par excellence.
That is why we have to learn from our own mistakes.
If we consider things as they actually stand, then there is only one way we can go - that is what I still believe, that is what my group still believes, that is what the social democratic family of parties still believes - and it is that we have to try to get all the stakeholding forces and all the interested parties around one table.
Anyone who talks to Syria is treated as an outcast, yet we ourselves know that the time will come and is not far off when there will be negotiations between it and Israel.
Preparations for them are already in hand.
We know that the Israeli Government, over the past year, has tried to establish contact with Syria.
Let us be a bit more honest and say, yes, it goes without saying that Syria should have a place at the conference table, particularly if you want to have some influence over Hamas.
There is surely no point in only looking back at the past.
We have to provide whatever direct aid we now can.
I do not know whether there is any chance of exerting some influence in the Gaza Strip, but, if there is, what this aid needs to be used for above all else is the creation of a state infrastructure, with support for the security forces who are actually making things safe rather than bringing insecurity, but most of all - and this is something about which not enough has been said in the debates over recent days - we in the European Union have to ensure that humanitarian aid is provided, for what we are now seeing happening is, among other things, a people who are already in need having - and not for the first time - yet more misery inflicted on them by radicalised armed forces on the fringes of society.
The people who really suffer are the ordinary people who have no water supply, no electricity, no medical care, and cannot send their children to school, and it is only as and when we are able to deal with those things that we will get people to want Israel to have the security that it needs in order to be able to live in peace, for one thing that is plain to see is that it will not be able to live in greater security if people become even more radicalised and civil war breaks out.
That will make only for even more instability.
The fundamental precondition for social security is always that we can extend it and thereby create in a given region greater willingness to make peace.
That is what the European Union's main task must be, rather than the sending of European troops, which is what I have heard advocated by not a few representatives of this Union of ours over the past few days.
It is not conceivable that, for political reasons, there should be no money available to send humanitarian aid, but that the funds are there when it comes to sending troops.
That it is, in any case, not our way of doing things.
I hope that it will prove possible to resume the dialogue in the Middle East.
(Applause from the left)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as Mr Schulz said, there can be no justification for the actions of Hamas militants, however badly the Palestinians have been treated.
And yet, if one year ago the international community had not reneged on its commitment to democracy in Palestine, if we had not refused dialogue with Hamas moderates and suspended direct aid payments to a freely elected government, the situation would not be as bad as it is today.
Financial sanctions designed to force recognition of Israel or to push Hamas out of power altogether have simply made the Palestinians more desperate and prospects for peace more precarious.
A two-state Palestine is emerging, riddled by violence, sectarianism and fear, while a two-state solution to the conflict is moving further away.
Liberals and Democrats are disappointed - though not surprised - by what has come to pass.
A year ago, we warned that Palestinian suffering would lead to greater extremism, particularly in Gaza's prison conditions, where 1.4 million citizens have been systematically sealed-off and starved of their basic necessities.
Last week's violent takeover of Gaza bespoke a lack of respect for the rule of law, which is a de minimis requirement for any legitimate government.
If Hamas is not careful, it will have betrayed its cause and, in the words of Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, 'put the last nail in the coffin' of the dream of a Palestinian state.
Unless we want civil war to triumph over unity, all sides must face the facts: their refusal of dialogue has got them nowhere.
A heavy dose of pragmatism is now required - not condemnation, not sanctions, and certainly not a refusal to negotiate. That is the coward's option and one which will backfire.
To that end, my Group welcomes Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's determination to restore security and President Abbas's commitment to dialogue.
We welcome resumption of direct aid to the Palestinian Authority and the prospective release of up to USD 800 million in Palestinian tax revenues by the Israeli Administration.
However, we caution against supporting the West Bank administration at the expense of Gaza.
If you consider the strip a 'terrorist entity' - as Israeli officials have called it - you will not bring the region any closer to peace, you simply create more insecurity as a desperate people, deprived of food and other essentials, decides it has nothing left to lose.
Hamas control of Gaza was the nightmare that became reality.
However, the European Union must not be prepared to take a back seat and watch as Iran becomes a player in the contest.
If this year has taught us nothing else, it is that politics - and politics alone - can create prospects for peace in the Middle East.
While Parliament, at least, kept talking, the Council and the Member States took to the sidelines.
It is now up to the Council and our Member States to put democracy, human dignity and the rule of law back at the centre of proceedings and work to foster peace in the region.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, the most important thing we have to remember here today is the people's lives that are affected by the new wave of violence in the Palestinian Territories.
In particular, we must think of the women and children, whose suffering is not something that has occurred just because of the Hamas takeover in Gaza, or just because of a lack of negotiation between the Palestinian and the Israeli authorities, or just because of the cancellation of aid from the European Union and the US; their suffering goes back 30 years.
Anybody you speak to from the Palestinian area will tell you that it has always been the women and the children who have suffered most, but they have also been the most resilient in trying to find a way forward to challenge the failure to negotiate, the failure to respect and the failure to find a solution; indeed, the failure of both Israel and Palestine to live up to their commitments, to agreements that they voluntarily signed up to, the failure of the United States of America and the European Union to live up to their commitments with regard to clear and open negotiations, the failure of other states bordering Israel and Palestine to take a more proactive and positive role with regard to, ultimately, achieving a two-state solution, which must be based on viability and equality.
Colleagues will remember that, some weeks ago in the European Parliament building in Brussels, the President of Parliament invited a number of Nobel Prize winners to speak on the future of Europe and on areas and issues that they are concerned with.
It is quite ironic that, when you read through the speeches of the people who were there that day, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, all of them said that the peace efforts they were involved in only came about through dialogue, respect for diversity, tolerance and equality.
What we have seen in Palestine over the last 30 years has been a failure to meet any one of those four criteria.
When Yasser Arafat was the leader of the Palestinian people, Israel said it could not deal with him, it could not negotiate with him.
When a new President was brought in, Israel said it could not deal with him, it could not negotiate with him and they were backed up all the time by the Americans and by certain Member States of the European Union.
To think that what happened in Gaza with Hamas was an accident is to misread, even with the gift of hindsight, our own failures in the European Union and in the US to deal properly with the solutions that may be required.
Now we have been given a new opportunity to do something.
Now we have been given a new opportunity to show courage in the face of death and disaster, to show humanity in the face of oppression and injustice, and to stand up and say what is right and what is correct: that we should give aid to the Palestinian people, we should insist that Israel negotiate with the democratically-elected representatives of the Palestinian people and we should back up the Palestinian Authorities to ensure that the rule of law applies throughout the Palestinian Territories.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we can all agree that what we have heard today is an analysis.
Mistakes have, without a doubt, been made by interested parties on every side, and when I say that we are paying bitterly for them now, by 'we' I mean above all else the Palestinians, but also - or so I believe - the Israelis and all those with an interest in this region having, for once, something to look forward to - not just a peaceful future, but any kind of future at all.
What can be done?
That is the question I would like to focus on.
For a start, the European Union must at last wake up and do something about the mistakes that have been made here, and the reason why it is the European Union that must act is that it is the only political entity in a position to act as a mediator; the Americans cannot do it - the war in Iraq makes that impossible - and nor can the Russians or any of the others.
Someone has to take the initiative in saying 'yes' - 'yes' to direct aid payments, 'yes' of course to support, 'yes' to contacts with Gaza and with Hamas in order to address the humanitarian problems in the Gaza Strip.
That means not waiting for a declaration, but rather taking action and then getting a declaration - that is what is called for; it means going straight to the heart of the nation in the name of the European Union and carrying on straightaway with a European quintet - which is, in essence, what is being attempted even if it is not being called that - with a great big conference held in the region.
Mr Schulz is right to say that we have to talk to Syria and with everyone we want to - and, in any case, must - negotiate with about the Golan Heights and the borders of Lebanon, and that has to be done now.
Why?
Because that is the only chance that the region will have of renewed hope.
It is renewed hope that makes political dialogue possible and not the other way round.
We are always being warned against giving any one side preferential treatment; nobody in this region is going to be given any.
That is what we have to learn from all this.
That means without a doubt that humanitarian aid for Gaza must be forthcoming; it is in nobody's interest that the only humanitarian aid it gets should come from Iran, and if that happens, we will again shed tears and say that we did not want that.
Well, if that is not what we want, let us prevent it, and if we want to prevent that from happening, we have to take action; that is what is needed, and right now.
What Israel has to come to understand is that a policy of occupation founded upon a wall that is perceived as an injustice will not bring peace, and it will not bring hope either; they have to get that into their heads once and for all.
For them, getting out of a worst-case scenario must mean doing what they have not done before, that is to say negotiating with the new government in Palestine the demolition of the wall and the establishment of a secure boundary on the other side of it.
That means that financial assistance, humanitarian aid and political initiative are called for, and if those things are not forthcoming, then, month after month, there will be weepings and lamentations when we meet here.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in the Palestinian territories, appeals for the violence to cease are completely ineffective if we refuse to see how this predictable catastrophe came into being.
This unprecedented explosion of violence is, firstly and above all, the product of those other acts of violence arising from 40 years of military occupation.
It is the fruit of the impunity granted by the entire international community to the Israeli leaders, whoever they are and whatever they do, in utter disregard of international law.
This violence is the price to be paid for the loss of all hope of a Palestinian State worthy of the name.
What a heavy responsibility that is, then, for European leaders!
Europe, it is said, is the chief donor.
All very well, but what is the point of giving aid if we allow the deadly poison of permanent humiliation to spread? The situation in Gaza grotesquely illustrates this, and the continuing isolation of Gaza could only push it to the extreme.
What a responsibility to have ruined historic opportunities such as the Arab League peace plan since 2002, the success of the first democratic process in Palestine in 2006 or, more recently, the establishment of a last-chance national unity government, all by aligning ourselves with the deadly strategy of the White House!
There are a certain number of us here, who raised cries of alarm time after time.
The most recent being an appeal by more than 100 Members of the European Parliament to put an end to a policy that, through government boycotts and the withdrawal of direct aid, nurtures the despair of a nation on the point of imploding.
We were answered with reassuring words about the intentions of the Quartet, that illusion manipulated by the Bush administration to cover up its non-intervention.
Here, however, we have the UN special envoy to the Middle East delivering, in person, a clear indictment of all those, Europeans included, who practise what he calls 'self-censorship' with regard to the occupier and whose recent decisions to boycott and to freeze aid have had, he insists, devastating consequences.
This historic failure and this repudiation on the part of the chief UN representative in the region call for a special debate at the highest level.
From now on, if we no longer wish to make ourselves party to a new Iraq, we must demand, as a matter of utmost urgency, fundamental strategic revisions underpinned by the international law that should have been imposed on everyone for the last 40 years.
History will be our judge.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, last week, the so-called Palestinian Fatah-Hamas unity government came to a violent end.
As a result, this House is facing two Palestinian cabinets that deny each other's right to exist.
Meanwhile, the Council and Commission have clearly opted in favour of the Salam Fayyad crisis cabinet on the West Bank.
I should like to back this position all the way, because unlike the Fatah movement under the aegis of Mahmoud Abbas, the Hamas leaders persist in the denial of Israel's right to exist within and outside the Gaza Strip.
On purely religious grounds, Hamas has turned against a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
This is an issue, the religious foundations of Hamas, which Mr Schulz ought to read up on some time.
Given the permanent policy of regional destabilisation pursued by Damascus and Tehran, I can see how this destructive position adopted by Hamas is actively being fuelled by the Islamic republic and Syria.
The fact, however, that certain MEPs and even groups in our House wish to trust as an equal interlocutor and pander to Hamas, which is after all Israel's arch enemy, totally baffles me. Even to this day.
Does this mean that the two-state political solution has become nothing but absurd hypocrisy in this House?
Meanwhile, I warmly wish the Palestinian people a selfless leadership that, internally, shows evidence of a powerful government and externally, genuinely seeks the modus vivendi with Israel.
The newly appointed Fayyad emergency cabinet offers this opportunity.
In order to put this into practice, I am counting on the helping, motivating and controlling hands of all the European institutions.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Gaza Strip is not a new Palestinian state; far from it, it is a prison, a prison in which people - Palestinians, the Palestinian people, and women, children and old people in particular - are obliged to live in barracks, shut away from the world.
The latest outbreak of violence, with the Hamas militias seizing power in the Gaza Strip, was of course made possible by wrongdoing on the part of European policymakers, American policymakers, Israeli policymakers and Fatah too.
For it was Israeli politicians who refused the Palestinian Government its tax revenues and built a wall to keep the Palestinian people in their place; the Americans allowed that to happen and showed themselves incapable of forcing all the warring factions to sit down at a table together; and, finally, it was the Europeans, including us in this House, who were unable to give support to a democratically elected government, some of the elements in which we found uncongenial or disagreeable - and hence found ourselves denying support to the moderates and failing to encourage the growth, within Hamas and elsewhere, of those forces who could have been amenable to reason.
It is they who are to blame for this state of affairs.
We know that, now Hamas has seized power, it is one of the four radical elements in the Middle East, together with Iran, Syria and Hizbollah.
We also know that radical Islamism of the kind preached by Hamas is very dangerous, that the elements associated with it are the forces behind global Islamist terrorism, and - of course - that we Europeans must defend ourselves against it.
On the other hand, though, we have to stand up for the Palestinians' right to self-determination, which means that they should elect as their government the people they want rather than the ones we want, because we are not in a position to pick and choose them.
It follows, then, that we must not repeat our former mistakes; we have to talk to, and support, those Palestinian forces that enjoy majority popular support.
Important though the security of Israel is to Europe, the future prospects for the Palestinian people are no less so, and if we manage to give them hope for the future, we stand a chance of establishing peace in the Middle East in the longer term.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (SK) I have serious concerns over the current situation in the Palestinian territories.
The Palestinian authority is split.
Notwithstanding the outcome of the elections, the joint government of the Fatah and Hamas movements was doomed to struggle, and it was only a matter of time until the tensions erupted into a bloody conflict.
Hamas takes pride in the fact that, in their founding documents, the movement set for itself the goal of destroying Israel.
Judging by the current behaviour of Hamas, we can conclude they have never given up their terrorist actions and way of thinking.
How are we supposed to work on helping Palestinian citizens who live in refugee camps, have no jobs and live in wretched living conditions, if the same Palestinians elect a movement which subscribes to terrorism and aims to destroy their neighbour, Israel?
How are we supposed to work on implementing the Oslo accords and the establishment of two equal states, Palestine and Israel, when one of the participants dreams of wiping out, through war and terrorism, the very existence of its neighbour with whom it should peacefully coexist?
As a member of the political section of Euromed, I call on Parliament to condemn all forms of terrorism in Palestine and any alliances with Hezbollah terrorists.
The European Union must support the peace process in both Palestine and Israel.
Last but not least, the EU humanitarian assistance there should not, via non-transparent means, end up in the hands of terrorist organisations.

rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the successor to Mrs Wallis as rapporteur for codification, I should like to draw attention to a problem that Mrs Wallis also had.
The codification procedure is a simple, quick procedure.
It is based on agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and enables legal acts that have been amended several times to be consolidated into a single legal act.
Substantive changes are explicitly exempted from the codification, which is why I broadly welcome the agreement on a fast procedure.
Scrutiny is carried out by the legal services of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which compare the revised legal acts carefully.
The result is then presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur.
I am an advocate of simplification and of better lawmaking, but with one reservation.
As rapporteur, I receive the codified legal acts together with the result of the scrutiny by the legal services between one and three weeks before the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It is impossible to scrutinise so many legal acts carefully in such a short space of time.
There should be the option of careful scrutiny, however, when one is to subsequently vote on the legal acts in one's own name.
I should like to request, therefore, that in future the codified version be sent to the legal services and the EP rapporteur at the same time.
The simplicity of the procedure would not be affected, and the position of the rapporteur would be greatly strengthened.
I think that this would be in the interests of the entire Parliament as well as the rapporteur for codification.

Competition Policy 2005 (vote)
- Ferreira report
-Before the vote
rapporteur. - (PT) Ladies and gentlemen, given that unforeseen transport difficulties prevented me and other MEPs from taking part in yesterday's debate, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the atmosphere of cooperation and compromise that enabled us to reach a broad consensus.
I should also like to thank the Commission services and, in particular, Mrs Kroes for her openness, the personal interest she has taken in this matter and her readiness to engage in dialogue.
It has become particularly important today for there to be cooperation between the European institutions and for Parliament to be strongly involved, at a time when European competition policy covers strategic sectors such as energy and services of general economic interest, when it encompasses new areas such as the environment and when much competition has acquired a global dimension.
Consequently, we must go on updating competition policy and must keep up the spirit of cooperation evident during the process of drafting this report, for the benefit of Europe's citizens.

rapporteur. - Mr President, this is a real report this time.
It is a report that represents 18 months of work of a committee of inquiry of this House.
This morning whilst we were having the debate, colleagues from various different groups approached me and said that they would like a roll-call vote.
We should have requested it yesterday, but in view of the number of colleagues who have come to me, I wonder if we could now do that.

Explanations of vote
in writing. - (FR) Changing patterns in the world of work, the fragility of certain sectors such as industry, the explosion in the services sector and increased mobility of the work force are all phenomena making it necessary for the European Parliament to work towards greater protection for workers.
As long ago as December, Mrs Bachelot's report set out to establish a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and it is this same concern to take account of the rights of workers that lies behind the Directive on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.
Every year, thousands of employees are deprived of income, sometimes for months, as a result of their firms becoming bankrupt, thereby resulting in hardship.
This directive will allow codification of all the rules relating to the protection of the employee in the event of the insolvency of the employer, and it will apply to any employment relationship, whatever the type of contract.
The completion of the internal market, which is sometimes wrongly accused of increasing insecurity on the labour market, may, on the contrary, give rise to genuine legislation and the creation of a system of protection for employees.
This report, which I support, is evidence of this.
in writing. (SK) I am very pleased that we have adopted the EP Directive on minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment.
The codified version was drafted using a data processing system on the basis of the consolidated wording of Directive 89/655/EEC.
It is very important that employers should always take necessary measures to ensure the safety and health protection of their employees by means of suitable equipment and conditions for their work.
New employers in particular are sometimes prone to focus more on net profit, rather than spending on various safety equipment or creating work conditions; as a result, the health and occasionally the lives of employees may be jeopardised.
Employers now face a clear framework of standards they must comply with; therefore I welcome the adoption of this text, which unequivocally strengthens health and safety protection at work.
in writing. (SK) We have adopted a codified proposal based on the preliminary consolidated wording of Directive 83/477/EEC as amended.
I am aware of the fact that improved safety, hygiene and health protection of employees envisages the elimination of asbestos and all asbestos-containing materials from the work environment, as these materials are extremely dangerous to human health, since they are associated with carcinogenicity.
The consolidation of this directive produces a binding text which prohibits the use of asbestos and materials derived from asbestos for construction, demolition and remediation works, and will improve in all respects the situation of workers exposed to asbestos.
I also welcome the preventive measures designed to protect health at work.
This report concerns the fisheries agreement with SÃ£o TomÃ© and Principe on Community fishing opportunities for four years, beginning in June 2006.
Under this agreement, Portugal has five licences for tuna surface longliners.
In this new agreement, there has been a 32% overall reduction in fishing opportunities.
At the same time, the financial burden for shipowners - from EUR 25 to 35 per tonne of fish caught - has increased, while the financial burden for the Community has been reduced by the same amount.
These are measures that, in view of their impact on the sector, give us grave cause for concern.
At Community level, these conditions mean agreements with ever smaller fishing opportunities and with ever greater burdens and responsibilities for shipowners.
The question is therefore that of how they actually contribute towards improving the economic situation for the fisheries sector in the various EU Member States.
Lastly, we have our biggest reservations about Amendment 2 of this report, adopted by Parliament, which confers discretionary power on the Commission to withdraw licences in the event of non-compliance with obligations.
In our opinion, the procedure in force for this type of situation must remain in place.
The agreement before us lays down Community fishing opportunities for the next six years in the waters of Kiribati, by and large maintaining the conditions of the May 2003 Fisheries Agreement.
The agreement, which is solely for tuna, retains the number of available licences for the Portuguese fleet, that is to say six licences for surface longliners, together with the distribution of financing, with shipowners contributing 35%.
It is important to mention, however, the change in the sphere of reference: the old fisheries agreements with third countries, which were commercial in nature, has been replaced by the new Partnership Agreements, with fisheries protocols, which will effectively work more and more as development aid.
I wish to point out, in this context, that fishing opportunities are diminishing all the time, while the financial burdens for vessels are increasing and the fishing rules are becoming increasingly tough, which means that most fleets will not be able to take full advantage of these opportunities.
Furthermore, companies from EU countries in this sector sometimes relocate production.
This is a series of issues that cause us to have reservations and concerns, and when these agreements are put into practice, these issues should be studied and evaluated in greater depth.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking once more the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt for negotiating an excellent compromise; one that, thank goodness, has also obtained the necessary majority in plenary.
We Austrians were particularly interested in the issue of 'Jagatee'.
Together with Ministers PrÃ¶ll and Seehofer in the Council, we succeeded in reaching a compromise that we see as perfectly workable.
Our German friends, too, now have a drink that they are allowed to produce exclusively under the name 'HÃŒttentee'.
I believe that this issue has been resolved as well as possible and also amicably.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the fact that here in Parliament we are striving to safeguard Europe's cultural heritage.
Across the political divide, we share the goal of ensuring that the traditional technical or geographical designations of spirituous liquors are accurate, and that no other products can use the same designations.
Not only are we safeguarding cultural diversity but we are also protecting consumers' rights.
I have voted the way I did so that all consumers, wherever they order a glass of vodka, whiskey, rum or Czech slivovice, can be sure that they are getting exactly what they want in their drink.
I have voted, therefore, in favour of being able to distinguish from the wording on the label whether something is other than a traditional form of liquor.
Spirits made from bananas, for example, rather than from potatoes, cereals or molasses, should not be called banana vodka, but banana drink or banana spirit.
Perhaps it would not be so difficult to defend European vodka in the WTO.
European consumers must be sure that what they are buying is what they asked for and not a fake.
It is similarly important for the Czech Republic that the labelling of Czech slivovice, which is traditionally distilled from plums, cannot be used also for, say, European distilled spirits that are plum-flavoured because plum juice has been added to the spirit.
Trust me, that cannot be compared to plums distilled in slivovice, and if anyone is unsure about that, I would ask them to come to my country and try some.
I would ask my vote in favour in the last nominal vote to be recorded because my equipment was unfortunately not working.
(PL) Mr President, unfortunately, the majority of Members supported a broader definition of vodka.
This was a defeat for many centuries of tradition.
The rapporteur, and the Members who supported the broader definition supported principles which will lead to the production of vodka that is of a poorer quality and tastes worse.
This could, in turn, result in a vodka made from various agricultural products, including those of animal origin and post-production waste, which is dangerous to consumer health.
Products such as vodka are associated with certain regions of the world, which often boast many years of vodka-making tradition.
These are national products and we cannot tinker with them by introducing ambiguous definitions, which is exactly what we have done today.
This decision is wrong.
(SK) When Slovakia acceded the EU, local producers were required to make changes to the designation of alcohol and spirits.
The producers were not overly enthusiastic, but they complied with the need for change in a disciplined manner.
The 'rum' they had produced became 'um'; to have retained the designation 'rum' it would have had to be produced from sugar cane alcohol.
For economic reasons, producers preferred to stick with alcohol produced from grain or sugar beet molasses.
This is one of the reasons why in Slovakia we have 'um' instead of 'rum', the former being a spirit with a specific rum flavouring people consume because of its taste, which has evolved over generations and has not changed since EU accession.
This is why I sympathise with my fellow Members from Poland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; this is why I have signed and voted in favour of the amendment demanding that there be a strict definition of vodka, which would regard grain, potatoes and, potentially, sugar beet molasses as the only acceptable raw materials.
I do not consider the Schnellhardt compromise acceptable, since, although it would not change the labelling on vodkas made from grain, potatoes or molasses, it would involve products made from other raw materials being designated 'vodka made from ...' followed by the name of the original ingredient.
This is such a simple matter, and EU definitions should be just as simple.
Since the amendment was not adopted, I have abstained from voting on the report by my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt.
(LT) Mr President, I would like to speak about the Schnellhardt document.
I am not an admirer of vodka, and I have no desire to advertise the product; however, I believe that the compromise solution we have adopted today, likewise the one regarding the definition of vodka, is a step forward.
I voted for it, although the country I represent - Lithuania - wanted a much more specific definition.
I think the solutions we have adopted today do not fully satisfy the hopes of consumers and European Community vodka manufacturers, especially from our region.
However, I voted in favour of the proposal on the understanding that it was a compromise solution.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report, as all countries - including my own, Austria - have developed their own, often regional, specialities and spirit drinks.
The issue of 'Jagatee' has already been mentioned.
It was a very important one as far as we were concerned, as I believe that such traditions, including in the field of spirit drinks, are virtually part of a country's national identity.
Protecting production methods also guarantees high quality and, of course, guarantees that established producers and production methods are protected.
The fact that the 'vodka war', too, has now been ended was a further reason for my voting in favour of this report.
The new regulation on spirit drinks will bring greater clarity to the definition of this kind of drink and to the methods used to produce it.
The Schnellhardt report improves on the Commission's proposal by making it clearer and by including some spirit drinks that are difficult to define and others that were omitted from the original proposal.
The report has our backing because it is a complete document that includes two unique Portuguese drinks initially overlooked by the Commission, namely Madeira rum and poncha da Madeira.
As regards vodka, the decision was taken to vote for an amendment calling for clear reference to the raw materials from which it is made when it is not produced from the traditional raw materials of potatoes, cereals and molasses.
This strikes us as an appropriate position because it promotes the traditional, original production values of vodka and because it is in the consumers' interest to be given clarification of the products they consume.
On the other hand, this is also a precautionary position aimed at preventing the situation from recurring in the future whereby the production and placing on the market of, say, a traditional Portuguese drink is undermined.
Although this amendment was not adopted, we supported the report.
Reference was made, albeit less clearly, to the raw material used in vodka production.
I voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report on the proposal for a regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, because I consider it vital that consumers should not be misled.
I consider it important that producers should pass on clear information on the nature of the product in order to ensure greater transparency in the market.
The purpose of adopting a single regulation bringing together the two existing regulations is to pursue a well-defined policy for spirit drinks, adapting the current law to the new technical requirements also defined by the World Trade Organisation.
The Commission has adopted this proposal for a regulation aimed at updating the Community law applicable to spirit drinks, which includes the definition of criteria for recognising new geographical indications.
The proposal is also aimed at providing clear information to the consumer on the nature of the product and forces producers to pass on all necessary information in order to ensure that the consumer is not misled.
This was one of the texts that needed a number of last-minute compromises between the various political groups in order to reach an acceptable proposal for a regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks.
At the heart of the dispute was what is meant by the term 'vodka'.
Some said it should only be made from cereals, potatoes and/or sugar beet molasses, whereas others argued that the labelling should enable consumers to distinguish the raw material used in its manufacture.
As regards Portugal, I feel that there are no problems with the proposals contained in the regulation as regards geographical indications, which include the various forms of wine, grape marc and pear spirits, Madeira rum, fruit spirit from the Algarve and BuÃ§aco, ginjinha portuguesa, licor de Singeverga, Portuguese anis and poncha da Madeira.
I will be voting for this report.
I accept the need to bring the rules respecting vodka more closely in line with those of whisky.
Yet at the same time I hope we will continue to pay attention to the plight of those small producers of 'apple and pear spirit' within the United Kingdom who in the past have suffered from unfair discrimination.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report that is designed to improve the applicability, readability and clarity of the labelling of spirit drinks.
Spirits will, therefore, be in keeping with the new technical requirements, and particularly with the rules and standards of the World Trade Organisation.
The aim is to allow European producers of spirits to retain their indications of geographical origin on the world market.
It was possible to retain the definition of 'agricultural rum' during the negotiations.
Producers and consumers approved the compromise reached concerning, in particular, the quality criteria.
In the French Overseas Departments, the definition of 'agricultural rum' makes it possible for producers to set themselves apart from competitors from third countries.
Produced exclusively from sugar-cane juice, the designation 'agricultural rum' is a guarantee of quality recognised by consumers.
The solution that has been found with regard to the question of vodka makes it possible also to retain the designation 'traditional vodka', produced from cereals, potatoes or molasses, without preventing production using other agricultural products.
In the latter case, the label must bear the indication 'Vodka produced from...'.
in writing. (SV) I voted today against the report by Mr Schnellhardt in the final vote.
The point of departure is the social situation in Europe, where alcohol consumption needs to be cut back on.
Work on better public health needs to be given the highest priority.
In this situation it is preposterous for the European Parliament to define vodka and thus to support the use of an alcoholic drink that is harmful to people when consumed in substantial quantities.
in writing. - (FR) The battle over vodka really took place at midday in the Chamber during the vote on the revision of the legislation on spirit drinks, a vote during which the European Parliament certainly displayed fairness, but not firmness, in defence of culinary and wine-growing traditions.
It displayed fairness inasmuch as it rightly considered that vodka, an alcoholic beverage traditionally produced in Poland, Sweden, Finland and in the Baltic States, deserves legal protection in the same way as other spirits with protected designation of origin such as gin, whisky or brandy.
Then there was confusion as producers who distil vodka other than from potatoes or cereals (apparently there are producers in Italy, the United Kingdom and even in Belgium) will be able to retain the designation 'vodka' for their spirit products in return for a simple statement on the label.
When all is said and done, it is not consumers who will be the losers in this affair but, rather, a certain conception of cultural heritage and of food or wine-growing traditions that are strongly rooted in our regions and territories.
Europe must, however, encourage people to devote themselves to these traditional industries and not cause local producers to despair.
in writing. (SV) Today, the European Parliament has voted on the definition of vodka.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, including myself, chose in the first place to vote in favour of a narrow definition of vodka which, from the perspective of the vodka-producing countries, should contain only grain and potatoes.
Unfortunately, this narrow approach did not win through.
In the future, it will be possible for other raw materials, such as grapes, to be put into vodka.
It is a wording that I accepted in the end, even though it was not my first choice.
in writing. - (PL) On 19 June 2007, the European Parliament voted on Horst Schnellhardt's (PPE) report which included, among other measures, the proposal to update the rather vague definition of vodka that has been in force since 1989.
The latest definition of vodka, which appears in the report before us, and which was drawn up by the European Parliament in collaboration with the Council (on the basis of a proposal made by the German presidency), is not favourable from the point of view of countries who are seen as traditional, European vodka producers, especially Poland.
This proposal allows vodka to be produced from any agricultural materials, which is contrary to the tradition and history of vodka production, or the requests tabled by Poland and the Scandinavian countries.
That is why I have voted against the compromise drawn up by the Council and Parliament.
At the same time, I would like to express my support for narrowing the list of raw ingredients used to produce this beverage to include only grain, potatoes and sugar beet.
in writing. I have been reassured that the compromise reached will not be detrimental to Scottish whisky.
I therefore support this report.
in writing. (PL) I am voting against Mr Schnellhardt's report on the 'definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks'.
A broad definition of vodka undoubtedly devalues its reputation as it poses a real risk to its quality.
Introducing vodkas onto the market which are not made from the usual ingredients and will benefit from the reputation of vodkas made from grain and potatoes, will also mislead consumers.
As far as they are concerned, the use of the label 'vodka' will imply that that this is a reputable, high quality product made from grain and potatoes.
The Polish PSE delegation have made every effort to ensure that the definition of vodka remains in line with Polish interests and have called for traditional recipes and regional methods be respected in the production of spirit drinks.
Our position has not, however, gain the support of the parliamentary majority.
An instrument must be created to standardise the rules applicable to the trade in cat and dog fur, and products containing such fur, on the Community market and to place a complete ban on its use, import or export in the Community area.
This is based not only on the ethical consideration that these animals can be pets but also on the need to ensure a level of protection and respect for the animals' well-being, which the cruel method of rearing and slaughtering these animals ignores.
The confidence of consumers and European fur traders must be restored, an objective that can only be fulfilled by means of a common body of law banning this trade, whereby the legal requirements in all Member States as regards the banning of the sale and distribution of cat and dog fur are clarified, and the barriers to the smooth running of the internal market in the fur industry as a whole are removed.
Mindful of the fact that European citizens are concerned about this illicit, immoral trade, I feel that the adoption of a range of practical measures by the Union in this area will help bring the citizens closer to the European institutions.
I voted in favour of the Svensson report because I feel that by creating a range of measures banning the use of cat and dog fur, we will be helping to put an end to this deeply inhumane trade.
I also feel it is vital to create Community-level methods of analysis whereby the origin of cat and dog fur can effectively be monitored and to ban the import of, and export from, the European market of cat and dog fur.
It therefore makes no sense for there to be any kind of derogation aimed at creating exemptions when it comes to the placing on the market of such fur.
In response to a large number of petitions and to concerns that have been expressed, this regulation proposes banning the placing on the market and the import of, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur.
The ban would replace the different existing measures implemented by several Member States and aimed at prohibiting the production and/or marketing of furs from cats and dogs.
The proposal also aims at ensuring that information on new methods able to detect cat and dog fur and to distinguish it from other types of fur is made available to the Commission and exchanged between Member States.
The rapporteur strongly endorses this proposal, highlighting however the need to clearly eliminate any legal loopholes that would undermine the import and trade ban as such and emphasising the need to tighten customs checks as well as administrative - and, where possible, also criminal - sanctions applied by Member States in order to create a truly dissuasive framework that would enable this shameful and illegal trade to be brought to an end.
I voted in favour of banning the import into, and export from, the EU of cat and dog fur (and of products containing such fur) from 31 December 2008.
It is particularly important in this regard that no derogations be allowed and that the Regulation not contribute towards the promotion of the fur trade.
I reject the idea of a labelling requirement as insufficient and too costly.
I also voted in favour of specific criminal measures, such as confiscation or revocation of licences, and I hope that the Member States will lay down and ensure the implementation of such penalties.
There should be a regular exchange of views on the implementation of the Regulation.
A ban on the import of cat and dog fur into the EU must be fully implemented.
That is why I cannot support the derogations suggested by the Commission, but fully support the report.
We welcome the HÃ¶kmark report on 'Broadband'.
We supported amendments which point out that public authorities should make every effort to ensure that all citizens have access to broadband.
The benefits of broadband need to be extended to every section of the population of Europe, including Ireland.
We believe that public authorities play a crucial role in ensuring and speeding up the deployment of, and access to, broadband in less economically developed regions where it would be more difficult to create ICT infrastructure available at affordable cost and of sufficient standard to provide the necessary services, particularly in rural districts.
General access to broadband is an essential prerequisite for social and economic development and cohesion, and improved public services.
The benefits of broadband should not be reserved for the few, and 'Info-exclusion' should be avoided at all costs.
in writing. - (FR) I regret that the HÃ¶kmark report did not take up the many suggestions from the Committee on Regional Development, for which I was the rapporteur.
Consequently, it sidelines the European Commission's initial concern, namely that 'despite the general increase in broadband connectivity, access in more remote and rural regions is limited because of high costs due to low density of population and remoteness', and hence the search for solutions.
We must recognise that in certain areas of the European Union - isolated and rural areas and new Member States - there is a market failure that justifies intervention by public authorities and particularly by local and regional authorities thanks to the Structural Funds.
I had experience of this in the Limousin with the DORSAL project.
I am, therefore, pleased by the adoption of the two Socialist amendments that bring matters down to earth because it is in fact in these remote areas that information and communication technologies are most necessary and useful as they make it possible to overcome distances by facilitating relations between users and services - clients and providers - and between the public and public institutions, and to reduce the costs and timescales for the provision of services.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the HÃ¶kmark report on Building a European Policy on Broadband, because it is very important to encourage initiatives facilitating access for all to the Internet and, in general, to knowledge.
In accordance with the Lisbon objectives, it is essential to develop information technologies and, among those, broadband.
Even if access to new technologies in the most remote regions is an objective that the European Union has to pursue, account must also be taken of the persistent discrepancies within single regions where new technologies are concerned.
There are still many villages which, being too far from urban centres, still do not have access to the Internet or which have access to it but unduly slow access that does not allow satisfactory connections, while the region as a whole to which these villages belong is, overall, well served.
For the sake of cohesion, these intra-regional disparities should also be better addressed with a view to combating the digital divide.
in writing. (SV) In his explanatory statement for the report, the rapporteur pushes two contradictory arguments.
On the one hand, he points out that it is not the EU's task to finance broadband development.
On the other hand, he maintains that EU policy needs to support a more rapid pace of innovation in order to make Europe into the world's most dynamic market.
To conduct a broadband policy at EU level with general resources is in itself indefensible.
What would happen if this policy were to fail, as the Lisbon Strategy has?
Firstly, the June List believes that the development of broadband is a task for the market.
It is the market's actors who, through technological development in the framework of free competition, must ensure that demand for their services is created.
Secondly, the June List believes that political objectives in this area need to be formulated and implemented at national level in the framework of institutional competition in order to devise constructive solutions for encouraging the development of broadband.
The June List is therefore voting against the report as a whole.
We welcome the adoption of our amendment aimed at considering that 'general access to broadband is an essential prerequisite for social development and improved public services and that public authorities should make every effort to ensure that all citizens have access to broadband, thereby enabling its benefits to extend to every section of the population, particularly in the less-developed areas of the Union'.
We are very disappointed, however, by the rejection of our amendments, which included the following:
'whereas some parts of geographically highly fragmented outermost regions still have no access to essential ICT infrastructure such as broadband Internet; whereas this applies to, for example, the Western Azores group (Flores and Corvo), which thus has to suffer greater constraints on account of its remoteness and is therefore being penalised twice over';
and 'considers it necessary to allow for the differences between individual outermost regions, one example being the constraint imposed by geographical fragmentation of the kind that exists in the Azores and the Canary Islands, which implies a need to guarantee the right of access to essential ICT infrastructure such as broadband Internet in all parts of the outermost regions to their inhabitants as a whole'.
I am voting in favour of Gunnar HÃ¶kmark's report on a European policy on broadband.
The rapporteur rightly stresses that the development of broadband Internet connections will contribute to the creation of advanced, global healthcare systems, as well as facilitating better access to professional training and government administrative services.
The 500 million European citizens who have broadband access will also provide Europe with the opportunity to become the leading, knowledge-based economy in the world.
I fully support the appeal, addressed to Member States, for broadband access in all schools, universities and educational establishments.
I think that improving the broadband infrastructure should be a priority and that significant funds should be earmarked for this purpose.
I am also sure that European Union funds should be used to modernise or replace broadband networks that do not provide access with a sufficient traffic volume.
in writing. - (FR) The dynamism of regional economies is strongly dependent on the level of development of information and communication technologies, among which is access to the Internet via high speed broadband connections.
The European Union must indisputably play a major role in promoting, among its Member States and its regions, the fight against the 'digital divide', in order to reduce the gap separating individuals, businesses and territories in terms of access to the knowledge society.
Government support, channelled within the framework of public-private partnerships, must, as a priority, target the areas that are ill served.
Wireless connections and mobile and satellite communications can deliver broadband to areas traditionally excluded from fixed-line networks, thus offering interesting and inexpensive solutions for people living in remote or relatively inaccessible areas, such as the island or mountain regions and, of course, the outermost regions.
In the outermost regions, these technologies are even more useful than elsewhere, as they make it possible to overcome distances and reduce costs and timescales by facilitating relations between users and their service providers, between clients and their suppliers or even between the public and the public authorities.
(DE) Mr President, we abstained from voting on the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report, despite welcoming, of course, the fact that there was a 20% growth in mutual trade between Russia and the European Union last year and individual Member States have closer cooperation with Russia, for example in the field of oil and gas.
Better cooperation should be sought in general terms, although the main focus on both sides must be on the resolution of the issue of the meat embargo.
The most important thing is to refute the Russian accusations of poor quality and meat smuggling without delay in order to prepare the ground for negotiations on the strategic partnership agreement due to expire at the end of the year.
Energy supplies are being used as a strategic, political weapon - a fact that should have been clear to us since the Russian-Ukrainian conflict if it was not clear already.
In this regard, we Europeans will have to start considering a single line and policy strategy already, so that we have a clear position with which to defy Russia in the foreseeable event that such things recur.
We should not forget, however, that our dependence is reciprocal, and that our objective must be to form a viable axis between Europe and Russia, which - in my opinion - should not apply only to trade relations.
I believe that there should be a public service obligation imposed on service providers of broadband technology.
As someone who lives in a village in Gloucestershire, that only within the last 12 months or so has had access to broadband, I know the economic consequences of exclusion.
I accept that the installation of broadband will start with the more populous and accessible regions, but it should not be allowed to stop until over 99% of the population is covered.
Service providers cannot be allowed to cherry-pick without adverse consequences for peripheral regions and economies.
I will vote in favour of this report as it is going a long way in the right direction, if not quite reaching my final destination.
This report reflects the current climate of inter-capitalist contradictions between the major powers of the EU and Russia.
The report sets out its approach to intervention in Russia - which goes to show that it is nothing but a guide to neoliberal policy - designed to induce Russia to pander to the interests and ambitions of the major economic and financial groups in the EU.
Take, for example, the significant criticism of 'the bill recently introduced in the Russian Federation, which allows the government to reject foreign bids for majority stakes in Russian companies, thus prohibiting foreign ownership of more than 49% in companies active in 39 strategic industries'.
The majority in Parliament 'questions the bill itself as well as the choice and the growing number of industries that have been classified as strategic and essential to national security' in Russia.
Furthermore, and perhaps because it reveals too much of the real intentions of this report, the following paragraph was removed: 'considers that this does not represent a move towards improving the investment climate and that this raises fundamental questions regarding the role of the State in a market economy and competition in key sectors of the economy; considers that the ownership situation of companies, in Russia as in other countries, is a matter which can best be determined by the market'.
Need one say more?
Russia's importance to the EU is based on a combination of factors such as its geography, its scale, its strategic position, its importance in terms of energy supply - specifically as an alternative to energy sources located in the Middle East - the memories that are particularly fresh in most of the Member States that joined the EU in the last two rounds of enlargement, trade and, of course, Russia's role in international relations.
With regard to all of these factors, realism is needed.
Realism must not, however, be confused with ignorance of the difficulties nor with the absence of a framework of values.
Although improvements have been made in some areas, today's Russia is far from being a free and open democracy that upholds human rights in full.
I therefore applaud the way in which the EU succeeded in speaking with one voice at the recent EU-Russia summit and the fact that it managed to raise a number of the Member States' concerns and interests.
Although the results achieved are not ideal, an approach such as this is preferable; an approach that recognises the multiplicity of European interests, that represents those interests and that remains faithful to its framework of values.
Mr President, the votes today on the Ferreira report demonstrate once again the relentless attack on countries in Europe that operate low corporation tax regimes.
The putting in place of a common consolidated corporation tax base means that there will be greater distribution of corporation tax receipts to the exchequers of the larger EU Member States at the expense of others.
Even if eight or more countries agreed to a common consolidated corporate tax base, this would in turn have the effect of invalidating existing bilateral tax treaties with Member States that chose to participate in a CCCTB arrangement.
Efforts are already being made by some Member States whereby corporation tax receipts would be made in the country where is sold.
This would be very bad news from an Irish perspective because many of the large companies in Ireland only manufacture or produce new goods and services that are sold in the larger EU Member States.
Let nobody be in any doubt - and in particular after the very hostile and negative comments recently made by the German Finance Minister - that Ireland and other countries with low corporation tax regimes face a real battle to keep their low corporation tax structure in place, which has kept employment high, unemployment low and has been one of the main planks of a successful economy.
(SK) I have voted against the report by Mrs Ferreira because in section 13 the rapporteur proposes the introduction of a consolidated tax base throughout the EU.
In my opinion, tax base consolidation would be the first step towards consolidating the rates of corporate income tax.
This would have negative implications by diminishing the competitive pressures to which Member States are exposed.
In my opinion tax competition is necessary, since it prompts states to introduce necessary reforms.
My country, Slovakia, is experiencing an economic boom thanks to the numerous reforms implemented by the former prime minister, MikulÃ¡Å¡ Dzurinda.
Slovakia is an example of how simple, transparent, neutral rules generate more government revenue.
Tax revenue does not depend merely on the tax rate, but first and foremost on a broad tax base and the number of exemptions, allowances, special regimes, etc. For this reason, I am strongly opposed to any corporate income tax harmonisation.
Parliament tends to use annual sectoral reports - in this case on Competition Policy 2005 - to present its maximalist positions.
This time, it is doing so in relation to the idea of implementing the liberalisation of the entire energy sector by 1 July 2007, in relation to the harmonisation of business taxation (with a common consolidated corporate tax base) and in relation to the reduction and control of state aid, which is a distinctive characteristic of the EU's competition policy.
It also makes a point of amending competition rules when they block the concentration and centralisation of capital.
All of this is done in the name of the neoliberal Lisbon Agenda.
Hence our vote against.
There are two points in particular that deserve to be highlighted.
First, we wish to restate our opposition to changes of strategy in relation to mergers and the impact of competition.
These changes are aimed at encouraging even bigger European multinationals to compete globally, instead of at looking into the impact of the concentration of businesses in national markets, while 'monopolies' and public authorities continue to be criticised.
Mergers and acquisitions have trebled in value since 2003.
Secondly, there has been an attempt to apply competition rules to services of general interest by the back door.
I voted against paragraph 13 and the overall report on Competition Policy 2005.
I am opposed to the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base as I believe it would be a first step toward tax harmonisation.
The Union's competition policy is vitally important in an open market economy.
Measures in the area of fair trade in goods and services - for example, price reductions, increased quality, choice for consumers and the important development of technological innovation - are crucial prerequisites if we are to make the most of the openness of the markets.
We voted today for greater clarification of competition rules and greater legal certainty, in order that maximum benefit can be derived from all the measures that have been taken to improve the effectiveness, transparency and consistency of this policy.
The current approach seeks to go beyond a merely formal outlook with regard to competition rules, so that we can better assess the actual or potential effects of certain practices or structural changes in companies.
Decentralisation is a further positive trend in this regard.
I therefore voted in favour of the Ferreira report.
The EPLP believes that the general approach of the rapporteur was the right one.
However, on the issue of the common consolidated corporate tax base, the EPLP keeps its long established view that this is a case of national sovereignty.
As such, we voted against the second part of paragraph 13.
UKIP refuses to support the recommendation of the Equitable Life enquiry on a number of grounds. Principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have proved disastrous.
Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life Policy holders but not National Provident Institution policy holders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing.
The EPLP supported the setting up of this committee because it believed Parliament could use it as an opportunity to provide clarification and learn lessons from the Equitable Life crisis and give a voice to the victims.
Several of the facts of the crisis and its aftermath were not included in the report, so the final result is not balanced.
The report has also been used by the opposition parties to attack the Labour government, while misleading the policyholders by falsely raising their expectations.
This vote is on a recommendation to adopt the findings of the report and not the report itself, following the committee vote there were no further opportunities to amend or improve the text.
Therefore the EPLP abstains on this vote.
UKIP refuses to support the recommendation of the Equitable Life inquiry on a number of grounds, principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have proved disastrous.
Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life policyholders but not National Provident Institution policyholders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing.
in writing. - (NL) As a member of the committee of inquiry, I have looked into the quality aspects of legislation.
The committee of inquiry has concluded that whilst the Commission monitors the formal transposition, it does not sufficiently monitor the application.
Is legislation transposed correctly and is it transposed in such a way as to ensure that its application complies with the objectives of European legislation?
We as MEPs should also monitor to a far greater extent what happens with legislation in the Member States once we have approved it.
As I see it, the responsible rapporteur should monitor what is subsequently done in the Member States.
The rapporteur needs to sound the alarm bell when things go wrong and if necessary, get the Commission to take action.
I would also counsel in favour of including the national parliaments.
Structured cooperation between the Member States in the area of national supervisors leaves a great deal to be desired.
This is not only affecting supervision in the area of financial markets, but also in all kinds of other areas.
In the Member States, the number of independent supervisors is increasing.
The big question is: who supervises these supervisors? And who supervises the quality of cross-border cooperation between supervisors?
Is this not where the European Commission could play a substantial role?
I will be abstaining on this report.
When the committee of inquiry was established, I thought it would be an important opportunity to learn important lessons from the near-collapse of Equitable Life and provide some explanations to those who were the victims.
The problem is that the report disappoints with sins of both omission and commission.
It falsely raises the hopes and expectations of policyholders and has been used in a blatant political way to attack the Government.
In the circumstances of a committee of inquiry report where there is no possibility, in line with our Rules, to table amendments, I cannot in all conscience vote in favour of the report.
UKIP refuses to support the recommendation of the Equitable Life enquiry on a number of grounds. Principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have proved disastrous.
Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life policy holders but not National Provident Institution policy holders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing.
Mr President, I should like to emphasise my opposition to Amendments 7 and 8.
The vote was not controlled and I wish to express my opposition, because their content is beside the point.
It touches on the principle of subsidiarity and I personally believe that the reference to exceptions weakens the principle of equal treatment.
I hope that the report will have a good result and will help everyone, without exceptions.
(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Members from the German Free Democratic Party, I should like to say that Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report deals with a very important issue, namely measures enabling the combination of family life with a period of studies.
We have cast our vote to show our solidarity with those of our fellow Members who worked on it.
Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise on behalf of my colleagues that, in our opinion, this issue is one that should be dealt with exclusively at national level rather than by the European Union.
Accordingly, this Parliament should take the opportunity presented by this report to conduct a more careful examination of which issues fall within our competence and which would be better left to the nation-states.
in writing. (SV) People's level of education is crucial to their personal development and to European growth and innovation.
The opportunity for students to have families is also very significant from an equality perspective.
It is therefore important for the EU Member States to invest more in creating good conditions for enabling people to study and have families at the same time.
In the light of this, we chose to vote in favour of the report in spite of the fact that most of the topics it addresses are national, regional and local, rather than European, responsibilities.
This report underlines the importance to all young people, men and women, of the benefits of high quality education and training that is adapted to the new demands of the market, and of constantly updating their knowledge in order to be able to enter the labour market and make lasting progress.
The level of education is an essential factor in the growth and innovation capacity of a society.
The OECD considers that adding an additional year to the average time spent in education increases the rate of growth by about 5% immediately and by about 2.5% in the long term.
In countries with a higher level of studies, there is less inequality between people, which is a major challenge for Portugal, a country with the highest inequality and the lowest educational training in the EU.
In general, the higher the level of studies reached, the higher the level of employment.
