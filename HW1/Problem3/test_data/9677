I should like to further clarify â and I am sure Riis-JÃžrgensen will appreciated this â that in spite of other views, no extension of the scope of application to other market segments has been introduced.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1)

Â Â  MrÂ President, I see we have two clocks in this Chamber, and they seem to be completely out of sync.
When I look at the clock over there, the impression is of Parliamentâs having ground to a halt and of its no longer moving.
That is how it has been for quite a long time, and I think we should do something about it.
Â Â  MrÂ Rovsing, I have been informed that the wall clock that you mentioned is indeed broken, and perhaps has been for a few months.
We do, though, have another clock that works but which is located behind you.
You will therefore have to turn around to check the exact time.
We will, however, have the technicians carry out the necessary repairs and so prevent you from having to speak again on the same subject.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0053/2004) by MrÂ Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the intent of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations is clear â a partnership that is truly worthy of the name.
Accordingly, a strengthening of these mutual relations rather than growing mutual separation is what is required.
Looked at in a matter-of-fact way, that is also what our many common interests require.
In all fairness, however, relations between the EU and the Russian Federation are anything but ideal, and for this both parties are to blame.
That is, therefore, the angle of this proposal for a recommendation: European self-criticism and criticism levelled at Moscow.
In the autumn of last year, that is the very course on which this Houseâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy embarked.
To our satisfaction, we can conclude today that the Commission, according to its communication of 10 February, is more or less on the same wavelength, and so, apparently, is the Council.
Incidentally, the Council should, in the view of this House, aspire to achieve more transparency in such an important and comprehensive area of policy as relations with Russia.
This current European consensus with regard to Russia is undisputed, but what matters is its concrete implementation, and that is where Europe's self-criticism comes in.
Differing positions have been adopted on Kaliningrad, Chechnya and the Yukos affair.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is why I cannot wait to hear about new agreements for new consistent policy.
Yesterday, the press once again confronted me with confusing accounts from a prominent European statesman.
A second point of important self-criticism is broached in Recital S and paragraph 2 of the proposal for a recommendation.
The EU-Russia partnership is based on common values of respect for democratic principles and human rights.
Parliament has expressly advised the Council and the Commission to apply this guiding principle consistently to all areas of cooperation with the Kremlin.
In any event, the situation in Chechnya is completely at odds with the principle of the EU-Russia partnership.
This is a wholly depressing situation of rampant violence and lawlessness at the expense of, in the main, a defenceless civilian population.
At the same time, the Chechen tragedy is a problem that is avoided in international politics, as the title of a thorough recent study aptly suggests.
In paragraph 13, this House recommends the Council in all seriousness to emphatically refute this shameful analysis.
In the final analysis, the internal and external effects of the Chechen impasse affect the European Union's values and interests just as much.
To start with, the Council should lodge a vigorous protest with President Putin against the disappearances, tortures or, worse, the killings of Chechen citizens who had the courage to lodge complaints with the European Court for Human Rights.
Talking of disappearances in the Chechen region, I would refer to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the fate of my compatriot Arjan Erkel.
I fully subscribe to the amendment tabled as No 25, which I will quote: âreiterates its deep concern once again about the fact that to date, no political solution has been found in the case of Arjan Erkel and regrets the fact that no progress whatsoever has been made in the direction of a solution, insists therefore on a determined political move on the part of the federal and local authorities in Russia, the Commission and the Council to ensure that Mr Erkel is released safe and wellâ.
Much more so than Chechnya, there is another obstacle to the EU-Russia partnership that is receiving political and public attention: the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreements to include all new EU Member States from 1 May 2004.
Parliament is supporting the Council unconditionally in its position, according to which it will not enter into any negotiations with the Russians in this respect.
Could the Council perhaps tell us whether a provisional solution to this difference is in the offing?
Good neighbourly relations and, above all, good partnership, should be accompanied by Russian foreign policy that reinforces stability on the continent.
If anything, though, the failure to sign or ratify the border agreements between Russia and its Baltic neighbours, Estonia and Latvia, has a destabilising effect, as do, and to an even greater degree, Russia's unfulfilled obligations to withdraw its troops from Transnistria and Georgia at long last.
The present proposal for a recommendation urges the Council to stand firm on these sensitive security issues.
I could mention many other areas of concern with regard to the development of the EU-Russia partnership, as is evident from a careful scrutiny of the proposal for a recommendation, but I would add that it was certainly not our intention to draft a catalogue of complaints.
The intention is quite simply to define the mutual frictions, to facilitate and maintain debate on them and join together in seeking a solution.
It is logical in this connection that the European Union should set out its priorities unambiguously and repeatedly and should indicate its so-called red lines during negotiations.
This practical approach is reflected in the Commission communication.
This gives me, as rapporteur, real satisfaction.
The relatively considerable attention received to date in the Russian media by the proposal for a recommendation gives ample reason to rejoice.
It appears that our message is well received by the Russian Federation, to whom it is also addressed.
I am indebted to you, the MEPs concerned, for this response.
I found your thoughts and contributions indispensable.
I would repeat this praise for the excellent assistance from the secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in the person of Mr Dag Sourander.
Together with him and my personal assistant, Henk-Jan van Schothorst, we have, over the past few months, poured over these complicated EU-Russia relations with much dedication, because this House sets great store by a partnership that functions right across the board.
Â Â  . Mr President, those Members of the House who read the or indeed the will recognise that EU-Russia cooperation is not always as straightforward as it could be.
I have to say that I regret that deeply.
Why?
Because a stable and constructive relationship with Russia is essential to the EU, and also because a stable and constructive relationship with the EU is essential to Russia.
It is clearly in our interest to try to promote close ties with an open, stable and democratic Russia, acting, we hope, as a reliable partner which can uphold European values, continue reforms, implement commitments and, in cooperation with the EU, play a constructive role in the newly independent states.
The communication which the Commission adopted on 9 February, a communication which heavily influenced the report discussed by foreign ministers on Monday of this week, took as its starting point the interdependence of the EU and Russia and our wish to build a genuine strategic partnership, based on shared values and driven by our evident common interests.
There are positive elements to the relationship, but, overall, we have to accept that the results of five years of increasingly intensive cooperation are not as positive as we expected.
We have to do something about that.
There were three important outcomes from the review of EU-Russia relations discussed on Monday.
First, a strong, clear and public message was passed to Russia that we expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to be extended to the ten acceding Member States without pre-condition or distinction by 1 May.
The Commission has held intensive discussions with Russia.
We hope that we have been able to convince our interlocutors that the question of extending the PCA must be rapidly settled.
The EU, for its part, is ready, in parallel to the extension of the PCA, to discuss any of Russia's legitimate concerns over the impact of enlargement.
I hope that our attempt to resolve this issue as rapidly as possible will not be affected by the formation of the new government of the Russian Federation, with which we will look forward to working in due course.
Second, the Ministers confirmed the importance of the EU's relations with Russia.
It was agreed that the EU should engage with Russia, that we should be ready to discuss all complex issues of mutual interest, and that as part of this approach, the EU should stress that its partnership with Russia is not only driven by common interests but also founded on shared values.
This implies discussing frankly Russian practices that run counter to European values, such as human rights in Chechnya, media freedom and cooperation on the environment.
It also involves not hesitating to defend EU interests vigorously.
Third, the ministers recognised the need for the EU to change the way in which it does business with Russia â to become more 'joined up', to use the bureaucratic terminology.
It was agreed that the EU should establish clear, agreed objectives and positions ahead of every meeting with Russia.
If we wish to build what can honestly be described as a strategic partnership, EU messages must be balanced and coherent, and our ambitious political declarations must be matched by progress on substance.
This requires better coordination between policies defined at EU level, and the approach of individual Member States to relations with Russia.
Why, for example, is it that the EU subscribes to joint statements with Russia, in which we agree to step up cooperation on crisis management, yet the EU is unable to convince Russia to work with it to resolve the very real problems in Moldova and the southern Caucasus?
Why, in addition, do we see individual Member States agree to facilitate visas for Russia, at the same time as Russia is blocking conclusion of a readmission agreement?
Many of these views are shared by the report which the honourable Member has presented so eloquently this morning; the report is a welcome contribution, in my judgement, to the debate on our relations with Russia.
Our task now is to translate words into action and to establish a more coherent, strategic approach to Russia, reflecting the views of the enlarged Union.
It is important that the EU can make real progress in its work with Russia.
This matters to business people wishing to gain access to the promising Russian market â we should remember, after all, that after enlargement, more than 50% of Russia's trade will be with the EU.
It also matters to importers of energy, given Russia's position as a major supplier of oil and gas.
And not least, it matters because, if we are to tackle cross-border problems such as environmental pollution, illegal migration and organised crime, Russia will have to shoulder more of the burden than it has previously.
Discussions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council reaffirmed the interest of the EU in promoting integration in the long term, through the creation of a series of common spaces within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
The Commission has advocated strongly that, once agreement is reached on PCA extension, the EU should be ready to present a draft joint action plan to Russia covering all these four spaces, consistent with our neighbourhood policy and incorporating relevant elements that are of common interest to both the EU and Russia.
This would help to establish an issues-based agenda, focused on substance, and be a further step towards the strategic partnership that we genuinely want with the Russian Federation.
I would like to thank the honourable Member once again for presenting such a thoughtful report and I am sure it will contribute to the outcome that we both wish to see.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a terrible war is going on in Europe.
The Second Chechen War is now into its fifth year.
It will soon have been going on for as long as the Second World War did.
Every day that the war continues, the leaders of the Russian State demonstrate their inability and unwillingness to bring the civil war to a peaceful end.
The war has become self-perpetuating.
European leaders and the EU must be more active in pursuing peace in Chechnya, and we must demand that the Russian army comply with the rules of war in their dealings with the civilian population.
There must be an end to so-called mopping-up operations, which amount to nothing other than robbery and kidnappings, and Russian soldiers who do violence to the civilian population must be brought before the courts.
With the collapse of totalitarian Soviet Communism, there were high hopes and expectations of the way in which Russia would develop and draw closer to the rest of Europe.
Now that we see how developments have taken another direction in certain parts of the country, we must make demands and not just express expectations.
State-controlled media and a so-called controlled democracy have no place in a modern, democratic constitutional state.
President Putin announced the departure of the Russian Government a few days ago.
He quoted as a reason for forming a new government the fact that it would work more intensively on developing democracy in the country.
That sounds all well and good. We must hope that it will also become a reality.
It is unacceptable to the EU that, prior to enlargement, Russia has not approved agreements drawn up with Estonia and Latvia on the delineation of borders.
It is also unacceptable for Russia to oppose an extension to the partnership agreements.
Russia has huge environmental problems.
This is in large part a legacy of the Communist era when the environment had very low priority.
The greatest risk of an environmental disaster that might also hit the EU area is presented by the outmoded and oldest nuclear power stations of what is termed the Chernobyl type.
They exist in Sosnovy Bor, not far from Estoniaâs border with Russia, and in Kursk, near Moscow.
We must clearly emphasise to the Russians that the continued operation of these first-generation RBMK reactors is unacceptable.
They should be phased out as quickly as possible, and other nuclear power stations in Russia must be upgraded from a safety point of view in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agencyâs (IAEAâs) safety standards.
EU cooperation with Russia on upgrading the safety of nuclear power must become more effective.
This report is no doubt of its time and has come in for a lot of attention.
I wish, in conclusion, to thank MrÂ Belder for his constructive cooperation.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia has to accept the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
The European Commission has decided to threaten Russia with a trade boycott if it does not agree to extending this agreement to the future Member States.
There will not be much cooperation left if we end up squabbling over the partnership in this manner!
Our policy on Russia has failed badly.
Nothing concrete has been achieved for several years, apart from the Kaliningrad question.
The eastward expansion of the EU and NATO will reduce Russiaâs sphere of influence and its trade by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Given this situation, Moscow has mentioned 14 areas of concern, such as transition periods for customs tariffs.
We, the old Member States, are now imposing transition periods with regard to the workforce in the new Member States.
The Union has not agreed to one of these.
To reciprocate, Russia will not sanction the Kyoto Agreement and is putting pressure on relations with the minority in the Baltic region.
A trade boycott would cause great harm to certain Member States as a result of an increase in the costs of raw materials.
Other countries would suffer less, some not at all, but my country, for example, would, as the share of trade with Russia is enormous there and we also have some experience in a history of dealing with difficult relations.
Now Russia is actually up against the wall as a result of this trade policy threat, while at the same time there are two kinds of expansion taking place.
We are pushing our way into Russiaâs trading zones.
The country has just voted in a more nationalistic parliament than ever and the current presidential election campaign smacks of the same.
The EU ministerial troika now has to take the initiative and make a suitable proposal to resolve this issue prior to the summit, because this is an area of cooperation where we have to find new approaches.
We cannot force democracy on Russia: it will come about through wider channels of cooperation.
The best and most effective approach of all is to try to have an influence directly on President Putin, who has a key role in everything that happens, as was said just now.
This again will require cooperation, not boycotts.
I understand the criticism regarding Chechnya and Sasnovibor, for example, but they are part of the very cooperation that we must now build and eventually obtain results from, so that the benefits are discernible on both sides and in order to end all these peculiar threats, which are inappropriate with regard to the sort of cooperation we need in this day and age.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very satisfied with Mr Belderâs report on Russia.
We are nevertheless prepared to accept some amendments.
On the other hand, we hope there is support by the other groups for our own amendment, which concerns the position of national minorities in Russia.
Recently we in the European Union have been pondering our relations with Russia.
The conclusion we have jointly come to is that the formally adopted strategy has not worked satisfactorily.
The main reason for this is that the Union has been incapable of showing any united front in its dealings with Russia, but instead some Member States, the bigger ones in particular, have been inclined to go their own way.
This situation has to be rectified.
There is, however, another key reason for our failings, something that has been given too little attention in our deliberations.
In the Union there is insufficient knowledge or understanding of the political situation in Russia.
Russia, at least up till now, has not complied with the diplomatic and political principles that we and other Western countries take for granted.
This has been evident, for example, in the fact that Russia has been adamant about not agreeing to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States of the EU.
Perhaps the threat of sanctions would not have the desired effect either, but might instead lead to a trade war in which the Member States of the EU might come off worse than Russia.
I have not noticed any such threat being made as yet, however, although it has perhaps been discussed at times.
Calm and patience are needed in relations with Russia.
To be able to realise our own objectives effectively and keep a watch over our own interests, we always have to consider the special political circumstances that obtain in Russia, hard and wearisome though that sometimes is.
Â Â  â Mr President, my group strongly endorses the critical positions set out in the Belder report.
There is an unacceptable situation in Chechnya, where the Russian army is engaged in gross violations of human rights.
There are disturbing internal political changes within Russia, with what is termed âmanaged democracyâ increasingly taking on authoritarian characteristics, and we also take a highly critical line on Russiaâs dealings with the new Member States of the European Union.
The European Union formerly adopted a two-track strategy in its dealings with Russia; underlying it was the fact that Russia is â and must be â one of our most important strategic partners.
A two-track strategy does not of course mean that we refrain from criticism â on the contrary; it is when strategic relationships are being developed that there has to be a central role for engagement with our canon of values, for the upholding of democracy, of the standards associated with the rule of law, and of human rights.
At the same time, though, it was also our concern to achieve the sustainable mutual interconnection of Russia and the European Union, and not only by means of the partnership and cooperation agreement.
I think this would not be the moment to put question marks against this strategy; in so doing, we would be letting go of the opportunities we have for really getting to grips with internal political developments or with the situation in Chechnya.
Moreover, I believe, we ought to be far more serious about concerning ourselves with social conditions in Russia.
The life expectancy of men in Russia has decreased by ten years over the past twelve years â a tragic development, and one that characterises the situation in many parts of that country.
Although I endorse Mr Belderâs criticisms of Russian policy, I would have liked the report to have made more explicit what he said in his speech just now, with his trenchant criticism of the Councilâs actions and of the European governments whose dealings with Russia are based on economic rather than strategic considerations.
Ever since 11 September, many governments â and not only Mr Berlusconiâs, but also the German Federal Government â have been allowing the war in Chechnya to be trivialised as part of the war on terrorism, and so we keep quiet about it.
I do not think it is enough to think of Russia as a strategic partner only in the economic sense or in terms of securing our borders and preventing trafficking in human beings.
Our relations with Russia have to be characterised by mutuality and interpenetration.
Â Â  â Mr President, I will continue what is very much a Finnish debate, although I am largely of the same opinion as MrÂ Brie, who has just spoken, although he is not my fellow countryman.
The fact that relations between the EU and Russia are now more unpredictable than for a time is the fault of both sides.
It would be worrying if Russia were to become our own Middle East, and, because of European dependence on energy, we were prepared to allow human rights violations such as those played out in the tragedy that is Chechnya to continue from one year to the next, and accept the increased risks attached to the transportation of oil, the collapse of nuclear safety, and the alarming restrictions on civil liberties.
The crucial issue here is freedom of speech, and one only has to go by Russiaâs track record on other political rights to reach a reliable conclusion on that.
An independent media and judiciary are vital to allow a robust civil society to develop in Russia, which has never yet been a true nation-state.
The EU does not seem to have any coherent or consistent policy with regard to Russia; neither are issues given any sort of priority.
That is also shown by the way the Unionâs Northern Dimension has been neglected, although it embraces regional cooperation, especially in Baltic and Arctic areas, which is vitally important for the stability of the EUâs neighbouring regions and the common stability that results from that, and although its importance will only increase as the Union is now expanding to include the Baltic countries.
The Northern Dimension is certainly different from Kaliningrad, which is symbolised, for example, by the Sami people who live in the Arctic region that stretches from Norway to Russia and who at the same time are the EUâs only indigenous people.
Ending on a positive note, let it be said that our land border with Russia has been remarkably peaceful and free of problems, and the EU does not really deserve the credit for that.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to emphasise what Mr Brie has already said to us.
We are discussing a recommendation to the Council in the Councilâs absence, which is itself not a good sign of the Councilâs potential interest in such an important question.
However, I think we are having a rich debate, certainly richer than what the press is reporting today, noting the remarks made by Mr Chirac, who seems to think Europe lacks respect for Russia.
But which Russia?
The Russia of the new parliamentary elections?
Elections where, as some of our fellow Members have pointed out, we have seen a virtual monopoly â even more so than in Serbia â of ânationalist partiesâ, as we say when we want to be tactful, although we know that, generally speaking, they are literally fascist parties.
But we cannot say that because we are talking about Russia.
I fully agree with what a number of other Members have said: Mr Arvidsson, Mr Brie, Mr Wuori and others, who listed a number of small things that are not going right, I do not think there is much that is going right.
The elections to the Russian Duma have shown that.
So far as the presidential elections are concerned, we cannot speak of an election campaign because no such campaign has taken place.
We all witnessed the scandal of the Rybkin affair, a candidate who was kidnapped, abducted to a foreign country, drugged and sent back.
There was the scandal surrounding the candidature of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is undeniably one of Russiaâs greatest entrepreneurs.
We would not have tolerated one tenth of one quarter of what was done to him.
I think the Strasbourg Court will be bound to agree, but sadly it will be three years before then, by which time the fate of Mr Khodorkovskyâs business and of MrÂ Khodorkovsky himself will have been sealed.
I have a question for Mr Patten. Mr Patten, at what point must we speak of a human rights violation?
When 20% of a population of a million people have been wiped out, is that a human rights violation, genocide or a disaster of biblical proportions?
I think we speak of human rights violations when we find a number of serious breaches of laws that are known and generally respected.
But when, as we have seen in Chechnya, we find that 200Â 000 people have been killed in nine years, with tens of thousands of cases of torture and rape, that is no longer a human rights violation, it is genocide.
I think a lot of honourable Members, myself included, are somewhat reluctant to use the word genocide.
We all know why.
What happened in Europe 60 years was genocide.
What happened in Rwanda was genocide.
And what is happening today in Chechnya is genocide, and, Commissioner Patten, has nothing to do with human rights violations.
I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, and many other fellow Members who, I think, in the end were forced to admit that what is happening in Chechnya and in Russia is no longer about human rights violations and a lack of democracy.
It is something far worse.
Â Â  â Mr President, Russia is a major and important partner for us, one with whom we are joined â or one could say, from whom we are separated â by two things: shared interests and common values.
As regards the values, today finds us criticising the way in which democracy and the rule of law are developing, as well as the situation in Chechnya, but, in so doing, we must not lose sight of our many shared interests.
Now that the European Union is enlarging, it is vital that the borders between the European Union and Russia should not become new barricades; instead, we should also use them as bridges and as a means whereby the partnership and cooperation agreement may be extended.
Our provision of aid is important, for it also helps to promote liberalisation within Russia.
It is important that Russia should be able to join the WTO â in the same way as everyone else rather than subject to special conditions â and, if the normal conditions apply, then we should also support it in doing so.
We have shared interests in energy, security and the combating of terrorism.
This, I think, is something we should make clear, and we should not allow the situation in Belarus to result in energy not being supplied to the European Union as contractually agreed.
In many areas, the enlargement of the EU does not create a new situation, and we should not confuse the issues.
The continuation of the partnership and cooperation agreement after the European Union is enlarged must not mean that we accept claims for compensation arising out of trade issues, for then the whole world could do likewise, and I do not believe that a precedent of this kind would be acceptable; the question also arises of whether the figures Russia has produced are correct.
We also have to make it clear, though, that the Baltic Statesâ negotiation of accession to the European Union has helped to put minorities there in a position not shared by minorities in many other parts of the world and perhaps not in certain parts of Russia.
The issue of the minorities cannot be an excuse for delaying the signature of the border treaties or, in any case, for delaying their ratification.
This has to be done now, and for that clarity is needed.
Both by means of technology and through cooperation, we should help Russia to establish exemption from visa requirements, but this must be done in such a way that the Schengen standards for the acceding countries can be maintained, in order to maintain internal security.
In doing this, we should work for good relations with Russia, and recognise that it can be a factor for stability only if we accept that it, too, possesses territorial stability.
This is something else we have to take on board.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the draft recommendation presented by our rapporteur after the draft was amended and supplemented by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is a document that I endorse and have no difficulty in voting for.
I will not reiterate here all of the many points raised in the text.
MrÂ Belderâs work was extremely thorough, in line with the Commission communications and Parliamentâs previous resolutions on Russia.
I will therefore limit myself to addressing two aspects contained in the report.
The first is the lack of consistency between the governments of the Member States on this matter â a lack of consistency and a lack of coordination.
When dealing with such a large and difficult partner as the Russian Federation, it is intolerable to hear EU ministers, even prime ministers or Council presidents, expressing differing opinions, for example on the painful war in Chechnya or on President Putin himself or on the elections.
Such differing opinions, sometimes expressed only a few hours apart, weaken the Union and damage the credibility of its efforts to have a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name.
The second aspect I wanted to mention is also a lack of consistency, but this time between the Unionâs different actions with regard to Russia.
Our partnership and our strategy have many facets, which are reviewed in the report, but it all needs to be put in perspective with priorities and much more consistency.
It is true that the EU and Russia have set themselves the long-term aim of creating a common economic space, a common space of freedom, security and justice, a common space of cooperation in the field of external security and a space of research and education, including cultural aspects.
That is all very well, but once again it needs to be done consistently, which will require a great deal of determination, organisation and know-how: in other words, we still have a long way to go.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the evermore authoritarian developments in Russia, linked to the person of President Putin.
The sudden dissolution of the government is further illustration of this.
Democracy appears to be in retreat, instead of the reverse being the case, and the presidential election resembles more and more a farcical one-man show.
The terrible acts of cruelty in Chechnya must cease, and the EU must act in such a way as to help bring about a solution as soon as possible.
There are huge needs in the environmental area, and we regret the fact that Russia is unwilling to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
The EU needs to have a strategic partnership with Russia.
We wish, are able and ought to play our part, but such a partnership is not unconditional and cannot be dictated by Moscow.
In this area, the ball now lies largely in Putinâs court.
I also wish to thank MrÂ Belder for a very constructive report, which we can without difficulty vote in favour of.
Â Â  MrÂ President, quite a few people, including MrÂ Patten, have said that EU-Russia relations have not always been ideal, and right now can probably be characterised as being quite strained.
As several people have said, there are good reasons for this.
Last Monday, we were able to âcommemorateâ the 60th anniversary of Stalinâs deportation of the Chechens and, thus, also the 60th anniversary of a genocide that has never been properly acknowledged.
We have also, in the last few days, been able to see how journalists of a critical disposition have been denied visas for Russia.
These are journalists who wish to cover the election and who are not therefore being given an opportunity to offer a critical analysis of what is happening.
We see other things.
MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m mentioned how, with a snap of his fingers, Putin dissolved the Russian Government.
All these things mean that the situation is extremely worrying.
There are good reasons for being very critical of what is happening in Russia.
I sincerely support MrÂ Belderâs report but, conversely, I have, in recent days, been astonished that we can talk so clearly about Russia but so unclearly about China.
I do not understand how, on the one hand, we can pursue a critical line â which I think is correct â on Russia and, on the other hand, consider lifting the arms embargo against China which, in my view, is more or less as difficult, troublesome and unreasonable as Russia in its behaviour.
I believe that genocide has taken place, and is continuing to take place, in Tibet.
I believe that the oppression of the Chinese people is without parallel.
I believe that we are here seeing problems similar to, and in reality still greater than, those in Russia.
Nonetheless, we are considering lifting the arms embargo.
In one way or another, the EU must ensure that its foreign policy is adjusted in such a way that the policy lines adopted are commensurate with the behaviour of the countries with which we work.
I do not, moreover, think that this is the situation at present.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I do not want to address the entire issue of relations between the Union and the Russian Federation, and so I will confine myself to the Chechen issue, by recalling that human rights, in the sense of the rights of individuals, have been discussed more than once in this Chamber.
This is entirely reasonable, but it seems that we have now forgotten another fundamental right, and that is every peopleâs right to self-determination.
Whilst this is still considered blasphemy, or something that should never be uttered, it will not be possible to resolve issues such as those of Chechnya or Tibet that we have just raised.
Â Â  Mr President, Russia is a vast country and its contribution -historically speaking â to European culture is immense.
It remains a major military power and deserves recognition on the global centre stage.
Although economically it has shrunk, it is a vital source of gas and oil to the EU and has a common enemy in international Islamist terrorism.
I believe that Mr Putin will win the presidential election, and that we must recognise his democratic mandate to rebuild a strong Russian state.
I do not accept calls to expel Russia from G8 because of its handling of the Yukos affair.
Only two weeks ago the Russian courts handed down a lenient sentence to one of its executives convicted of tax evasion: hardly the signs of judicial bias.
I sympathise at the loss Russia faces with the ending of the bilateral free trade agreements with the acceding EU states, but overall, the tariffs drop from 9% to 4% and Russia cannot fail to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements to the Baltic Republics because of disputes over ethnic Russian minority rights there.
The Kaliningrad question is settled now and work on visa-free or flexible travel to the EU should commence once a readmission agreement is struck.
Russia sees the EU as muscling in on its sphere of influence from Georgia to Ukraine, hence its attempts to reconstitute some of the binding elements of the former Soviet Union in the Yalta agreement with Ukraine, Belarus â a country where Russia could use its special influence to do more to encourage democracy â and Kazakhstan.
I also urge Russia to withdraw its troops from Transnistria, allow a peaceful reunification of Moldova and consign the Tiraspol gangster regime to the dustbins of history.
Lastly, I am concerned that there has been mass migration west of ethnic Russians away from the far eastern territories, where Russia is attempting now to forge close links with Japan and Korea on resource exploitation.
These ethnic Russians are being replaced by illegal Chinese migrants, a situation which may cause tensions in the future in that vast, under-populated but resource-rich territory.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is a positive move that the General Affairs Council signalled collectively that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia should automatically extend to cover the new Member States.
There is no reason to have separate negotiations on that.
If there are problems in economic and trade relations between the enlarged Union and Russia they can then be discussed separately between the Union and Russia.
Russia is the EUâs most important neighbour.
It is in the interests of both the Union and Russia that relations between them develop favourably in all areas of life.
Furthermore, we must be able to discuss sensitive issues such as human rights.
We must ensure that the Union is consistent in its policy on Russia and that in Russia they understand that the EU cannot be split politically.
From the beginning of May, the Baltic countries that join the EU will form just as solid a part of the Union as the old Member States.
Their condition for membership was fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria regarding such matters as human rights and the rights of minorities.
These conditions have been met.
Moreover, Russia is committed to compliance with human rights as a member of the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe and the Council of Europe.
It is very important that there are assurances that the work of the OCSE in Chechnya can proceed.
Strategic cooperation based on common values has been spoken of with regard to relations between the EU and Russia.
Perhaps such grand-sounding aims should move a step closer to something a bit more concrete.
There are good grounds for that, too, as the EU will account for 55% of Russiaâs foreign trade.
The EU needs oil and natural gas so there is a need for cooperation on energy to be developed.
The environment must play a part in that, whether it is a matter of energy production or its transportation.
One of the areas of cooperation mentioned at the StÂ Petersburg Summit was research, education and culture.
I am a firm supporter of more exchange programmes for researchers, teachers and students and cooperation between educational institutions.
If we are to build sustainable cooperation our citizens will need to network with one another.
Here too we will have to provide young people with the right facilities and opportunities.
They cannot bear the burden of a divided world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is a subject that raises concern when we talk about Russia.
It is the subject of freedom of the press, and I am pleased that Commissioner Patten mentioned this.
We know that, according to Russian law, there is freedom of the press in Russia, but there is a big gap between the law and everyday practice.
The organisation Journalists Without Frontiers has published a list in connection with press freedom on which, out of 158 countries, Russia is in 148th place.
Moreover, the situation is getting worse.
Journalists are being murdered in Russia.
According to the International Federation of Journalists, four journalists were killed in Russia last year alone and, since 1 January 2002, thirteen have been killed.
Obstacles are placed in the way of journalistsâ work.
I saw this for myself in St Petersburg in the run-up to the election for Governor when, for example, it was forbidden to show pictures, or quote the names of, candidates in the election.
Recently, a Danish journalist was denied entry to Russia.
Her crime was to have written critically of Russian conduct in Chechnya.
I would ask the Commission and the Council to take press freedom seriously when the negotiations with Russia are begun.
The attacks on freedom of expression that take place in Russia are unacceptable!
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Austria currently enjoys perfectly trouble-free relations with Russia, as demonstrated by the most recent state visits and President Putinâs fondness for skiing in our country.
It is for that reason that I find this picture of the European Unionâs relations with Russia all the more regrettable.
The EUâs relations with Russia are not a one-way street.
They need to be optimised if the interests of the enlarged EU are to be given the same weight as Russiaâs.
It is also an indispensable requirement â let me repeat, an indispensable requirement â that the partnership and cooperation agreement, which has been in force since 1998, should now be extended to cover the European Unionâs ten new Member States.
What formerly stood in the way of this was the objection that the enlargement of the EU would put Russia at a disadvantage on the market, so that it demanded that compensation be paid.
This line of argument really is questionable, as the enlargement of the European Union will automatically create, for Russia too, a market with a great deal of purchasing power, and that cannot fail to be good for its economy.
Cooperation in decommissioning nuclear power stations that are ready for scrapping, or in the disposal of nuclear waste off the Kola peninsula and in the North Sea leaves something to be desired, to say the least, and it is far from clear why Russia has so far turned a deaf ear to the demands for safe tankers in the Baltic.
What makes it astonishing that the alleged difficulties of the Russian minority in the Baltic states keep being brought up is the fact that both the OSCE and the Council of Europe believe that the problem is no longer there.
By way of contrast, the OSCE was barred from entering Chechnya.
The fact that most of the asylum seekers and refugees in Austria are Chechens can only be taken as an indication of how appalling the situation there is, although I do not want in any way to downplay the crimes committed by terrorists against the public in Russia.
And, even though the EU has been very accommodating with regard to Kaliningrad, there has not to date been any agreement to take back refugees or illegal migrants.
With presidential elections now in the offing, I deliberately do not now want to discuss Russiaâs internal politics â reference has already been made to âmanaged democracyâ â even though they must inevitably have an effect on relations between Russia and the EU.
Even so, it does not make sense to keep quiet about problems when dealing with them cannot fail to help promote good relations between Russia and the EU.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Belder, for a very well written and politically well balanced report.
The controlled democracy that characterises Russia is a source of great concern.
We are all aware that democracy has not secured a foothold in Russia and that a climate of fear has been created in which people who express independent political views in relation to President Putin are exposed to threats.
People with considerable financial power have, in particular, ended up in difficulties with the judicial system.
I wish to emphasise that the administrative resources and control of the media were such that the parliamentary elections for the Duma on 17 December 2003 can scarcely be said to have complied with international standards.
An independent judiciary is required if it is to be possible to refer to Russia as a fully-fledged democracy.
At present, the prosecuting authorities have no independence from the executive.
Russia must act internationally to close down its current military bases in Georgia and Moldova without delay.
Russia must act constructively in the conflict in the South Caucasus, and I wish to issue a special appeal to the Russian Government to solve the protracted conflict between Turkey and Armenia and to promote reconciliation between the peoples of these countries.
Turkey should also recognise the genocide to which the Armenian people was exposed between 1915 and 1918.
Russia has a special responsibility for developments in Belarus, a new neighbour of the enlarged EU, which can scarcely be described as a democracy but, rather, as a country under the authoritarian control of President Alexander Lukashenko.
Last of all, I want Russia to promote freedom of religion in a much more open and tolerant way.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the aftermath of the profound changes in Europe, relations with Russia have become very complex.
Dialogue and cooperation have been enshrined in a plethora of treaties and agreements in many international institutions, and partnership and cooperation agreements make meetings between the EU and Russia at the highest level a regular, and indeed fixed, occurrence.
I increasingly get the impression, though, that this comprehensive dialogue is becoming a fossilised and predictable ritual.
I think it was Commissioner Patten who, a few months ago, told the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that he had the impression that the speaking notes prepared for him on Russia had not substantially changed for some considerable time.
Politics is, of course, always the art of the possible, and that means that one will always have to take an approach to a large country like Russia that differs from the approach one would take if a small country were misbehaving itself.
In terms of proportion, one can certainly compare atrocities against civilians in Kosovo and in Chechnya, but it is obvious that our response to Russia will be different â as it indeed is.
I would, however, ask the Council, as a matter of urgency, to address the issues that have not been satisfactorily resolved and are still on the agenda rather than dodging them â which is what it is doing, in a sense, by the mere fact of being absent from this debate.
There can be no compromise where partnership and cooperation agreements are concerned, nor in relation to their adoption by, and extension to, all the new accession countries; Russia can, for example, take a good look at how customs tariffs change from what they were before, at a time when we had bilateral agreements with some of the candidate countries.
Once they are in the EU, customs tariffs will fall.
It follows that these countriesâ accession to the European Union does not have only detrimental effects.
Many references have been made to Chechnya.
There too, I believe, we should not merely allow ourselves the luxury of making appeals or of ignoring it outright.
I have always taken the view that we have to find different ways of targeting the funds that we appropriate for cooperation with Russia.
We must try to prop up the weak structures of civil society in Russia, in order that this society may undergo democratic change from the bottom up and not in the lamentable way we have seen in recent months.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Belderâs report makes a number of comments and proposals in line with the recommendations from the Council concerning relations between the Union and Russia.
I support the two main lines pursued in the report.
First, the reaffirmation of the desire to develop the vital partnership between the European Union and Russia.
Russia is a big country and it is essential to develop economic relations with her in the areas of industry, research, health and energy.
Common ambitions and objectives must be set, as the rapporteur proposes.
They are of strategic and political importance.
We must set priority objectives, such as cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, defence of human rights, democracy, independence of news media and the rule of law, cooperation to resolve conflicts in the region and disarmament; we must also promote improvements to public health and social development.
The second line pursued in the report seeks to be more critical, especially concerning basic freedoms and democratic rights in Russia.
I agree with the rapporteur when he deplores the weakness of the Unionâs role in the Chechen conflict, which has caused more than 200Â 000 deaths in ten years and is really genocide.
The report calls on the Russian authorities to investigate the disappearances, torture and all violations of human rights.
In November 2003, several of us intervened following President Berlusconiâs statements justifying the Russian militaryâs intervention policy.
Europe must indeed play a much greater role in strongly and clearly condemning Russia in its handling of the war in Chechnya.
There will not and cannot be a military solution in Chechnya.
The desire for a partnership between the European Union and Russia must follow a plan that includes peace and security for all peoples.
Europe can no longer be content with mere rhetoric.
It must act and, from that point of view, the report is a step in the right direction.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the problems of the South Caucasus are as easy to identify as they are difficult to solve.
In addition to significant aid, we need an extremely ambitious European strategy and perhaps a broader mandate for MrÂ Heikki Talvitie, the European Unionâs Special Representative for the South Caucasus. Commissioner Patten too has spoken about this, but I do not believe that the fight against corruption to reduce poverty and drug trafficking, or even the analysis of the elections can be enough to establish these measures as a strategy for the zone.
It is clearly difficult to operate in a fragile situation in which at least three endemic disputes are simmering.
Nevertheless, it is becoming more and more essential that a plan is presented.
The usual procedure sometimes calls for global objectives to be achieved with just one conference. I do, however, believe that, in the case of the South Caucasus, we need to proceed gradually, step by step, in the disputes and in cooperation; otherwise we risk obtaining a very poor result.
The report by MrÂ Gahrton gives a very detailed description of both the situation and the needs, and I agree with the rapporteur that the South Caucasus region needs to be given a well-defined status in the context of the policy we call âWider Europeâ

If stability is to be achieved, then it is essential that Russia is involved. President PutinÂ âÂ having the day before yesterday dissolved a government that has always maintained considerable ambiguity towards the countries of the former Soviet Union, and in particular, towards the South CaucasusÂ âÂ will also have to indicate some direction for the Caucasus.
The meeting between the European Union and Russia, which will take place next March, could be an opportunity for this to happen.
The interests and values that are all necessary for cooperation must be clarified in both form and substance. Furthermore, we must consider the fact that the opening, in two years, of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline will be of enormous strategic importance.
We do not know if the billionaire MrÂ Khodorkovsky, for example with his company , intends to conclude agreements with the US company and nor do we know to what extent the new President Putin would be in favour of such a development. Similarly, we do not know what the chain reaction would be in either case.
Discrediting the pipelines for environmental reasons is merely a rhetorical exercise.
The oil must, in any event, go from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea.
During the cold war, the planning of the pipelines sought to avoid Soviet territory, but the situation is now changing. I do, however, believe that the report by MrÂ Gahrton expresses appropriate concerns about this and other unknown factors in the region.
Thanks to oil resources, Azerbaijan will be rich and Georgia will have transit rights whilst Armenia will have nothing.
This is how the new sources of wealth can create new imbalances, which can be smoothed out only though political mediation.
One simply has to realise that the future situation will not allow a stalemate, or status quo, to continue for long in areas where conflicts rage.
Â Â  Mr President, I would advise Mrs Banotti to follow the advice once given to me by the Station Master at Crianlarich, when I pointed out to him that the two clocks, one on each platform, showed different times.
He replied, 'What good would it be having two clocks if they both told the same time?'
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, in the English version the word âregretsâ, the correct translation of which should have been â has been translated by I would like the services to note in the Minutes that the Italian translation of the phrase, as we believe it be in the report, was âand not
Â Â  The services will ensure that all language versions correspond.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the fact is that Russia has not signed the agreement made on the delineation of the border with Estonia and Latvia, and the agreement cannot thus be ratified. I therefore propose that paragraphÂ 6 be worded as follows:
'Recommends the Council to demand that Russia immediately sign and ratify the already negotiated border agreements with the accession states Estonia and Latvia.'
Â Â  . â Mr President, an irritating error has crept into Amendment No 26 under the second indent. In the original text, the following was written âsociological characteristics of Chechen societyâ.
This was erroneously changed to the âpeopleâ.
I would ask you to stand by the original, namely âsociological characteristics of Chechen societyâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if the Duma is to be able to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the matter must be put before the Duma, and that has to be done by the Russian President.
I therefore propose that recitalÂ F should be worded as follows:
'Whereas the delay in transmitting the Kyoto protocol for ratification to the Duma is preventing this treaty from entering into force.'
That concludes the vote.
- Report: Daul (A5-0082/2004)
Â Â  .
I support this report and agree entirely with its condemnation of the limitations on liability for nuclear accidents which create a privileged position for nuclear energy as against other energy sources. Ireland is not a party to the Paris Convention to which this report relates.
However everyone in Ireland is acutely aware of their vulnerability should there ever be a major incident at the nearby Sellafield plant, or should there ever be an incident involving the shipments of dangerous waste materials which are brought to that plant through Irish territorial waters.
In fact the single greatest threat to the Irish environment comes from Sellafield so it is absolutely outrageous that the European Union has so far failed to apply the 'polluter pays' principle to nuclear accidents.
It is high time the European Union adopted a more comprehensive stance in relation to the dangers of the nuclear industry. We certainly cannot afford to have any gaps in the application of international conventions and Community legislation to the area of liability for nuclear damage.
Â Â  This readmission agreement between the European Community and the Macao Special Administrative Region forms a part of the more wide-ranging strategy for fighting illegal immigration defined at the Tampere, Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki Summits, and is the second such agreement negotiated and concluded with a third country.
The signing of these agreements at EU level forms a specific part of the objectives of the overall plan for fighting illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings identified as a priority since the Laeken Summit.
With specific reference to the readmission agreement with Macao signed in Brussels on 18Â October 2002, that agreement forms part of the political agreement reached in December 2000 when Justice and Home Affairs Ministers decided to exempt Macao passport holders from the visa requirement. Alongside those agreements, standard readmission clauses were adopted for inclusion in association agreements or cooperation agreements concluded by the EU.
These clauses are designed solely to impose an obligation on the contracting parties to readmit their own citizens, third country nationals and stateless persons. Like the rapporteur, I believe that the Council should inform this House of decisions authorising the signing of such agreements.
I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  The purpose of this proposal is to update the implementing regulation for the EUâs own resources following the Council Decision of 29Â February 2000, which increased the contribution of the âGNP resourceâ to the financing of the Community budget and codified the so-called âBritish chequeâ with adjustments in its financing for the main net contributors â Germany, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands â with a consequent increase in the contributions from the remaining Member States, including Portugal, which is unacceptable.
We always advocate that imbalances in terms of net transfers cannot be resolved on the income side of the equation and that the principle of ââ should not be regarded as sacrosanct. National contributions to Community financing should, at the very least, be equivalent to the share of each country in the Community GNP, or else there should be a harmonisation of effort per inhabitant in the Member States for this financing.
The central issue in the report is the inclusion of a revision clause for a general review of the system, with a view to introducing European taxes to replace the present system of national contributions, before the approval of the Financial Perspectives.
Indeed, this idea is supported in the Commission proposal. This aim of gradually giving the EU fiscal sovereignty would not only reinforce, in a non-explicit way, the federal approach to European integration, it would also have an impact on national fiscal policies and on the tax burden of taxpayers, while not contributing to the equity of budget financing.

Â Â  .
I record my support for this motion calling on the Irish presidency and EU to clarify and strengthen their position on the non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Recent revelations about the murky black-market trade in nuclear know-how and weaponry emphasise the urgency of achieving the aims of the IAEA and UNMOVIC.

The Irish presidency should prioritise this call to encourage third states to accede to the IAEA protocols and liase with Member States to clarify how adequate financial resources can be released to support specific IAEA projects. We must push our demand for nuclear disarmament and make it a permanent item on the agenda of the Transatlantic Partnership Dialogue.
I welcome the support expressed for the international campaign for nuclear disarmament initiated by the Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Recent appalling experiences of the unjust and illegal acts perpetrated against the Iraqi people must at least teach us the urgency of achieving a peaceful world â where there can certainly be no place whatsoever for nuclear weapons.
Â Â  .
Nothing is more important than the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, because nothing is more apocalyptic than the threat of such weapons, nor more suicidal than their original design.
We call for a consensus of parties and nations to rally behind the EU objective of eliminating all such weapons; in particular, we call on the European Council to strengthen the declaration stipulating that the Non-Proliferation Treaty be maintained in its entirety.
Only by remaining constantly aware and vigilant will we be able to restore confidence in international security through salutary nuclear de-escalation. That will require sustained cooperation between the EU and its international partners to completely deny terrorist organisations access to weapons of mass destruction and other states access to nuclear weapons.
All the EUâs partners, even â especially â the USA, must sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the CTBT, which could then enter into force.
Constructive joint dialogue is required with the urban populations and their elected representatives who are potential targets for annihilation.
Let us here pay heed to the call by the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a timetable for eliminating nuclear weapons, bearing in mind the Prepcom 2004 meetings and the NPT Review Conference in 2005. The rejection of the Greensâ amendment, urging nuclear disarmament on the part of France and Great Britain, is regrettable, but we will certainly persevere with this aim.
Â Â  Regarding the 2004 Spring Summit, the Commission has missed a good opportunity to give its opinion by stressing real priorities that have been neglected for too long, the urgency of which should have been the basis of this resolution.
The decay of basic environmental featuresÂ caused by decades of the Westâs unsustainable obsession with productivity, ignoring a number of indicators, including environmental onesÂ âÂ is ever more obvious in terms of climate disruption, a fall in biodiversity and a marked increase in diseases linked to pollution.
These phenomena are all the more alarming in that they now appear to be irreversible. They are so globalised that it is imperative that, from now on, they be at the centre of an exhaustive management of Community policies, radically overhauling the specific economic, financial or social dimensions that are now obsolete.
The Spring Summit must set the seal on a change of era and recognise the need for energy restructuring where ârenewableâ, âsustainableâ and âeconomicalâ are the key words. Changing tack from the traditional, overused and toxic approach would open up a new generation of jobs: public service jobs and jobs in the tertiary and social economy, free from the pressures of working hours set in stone, increased job insecurity in certain sectors and outdated discrimination.
Symbolising the end of these obsolete patterns of thought and work, a reform of the eco-tax on the basis of an adjustment to tax practices makes a new common economic policy essential, breaking this collusion between economic growth and the use of resources.
Â Â  Four years ago the Fifteen promised in Lisbon to make the European economy the most dynamic and the most competitive in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth together with a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater cohesion.
European jargon can be used to paint a glowing picture of a brighter future but it cannot hide the hard truth. The Lisbon strategy was nothing but a barrage of attacks on employees.
The European Union has shown itself to be incapable of preventing stock market redundancies, social plans and the closure of undertakings.
It is even more scandalous that public money was used to inflate shareholdersâ dividends, for example at STMicroelectronics.
The European Union has never found ways of combating rogue managers, such as those at ParmalatOn the contrary, the EU continues to protect tax havens and banking secrecy.
Lisbon, though, is primarily about structural reforms of the labour market based on flexibility, precariousness and salary reduction. Finally, it is about the commercialisation of public services to the detriment of citizens.
This is why the 2004 Spring European Summit must make a radical break with the Lisbon process. Since the joint resolution refused to do this, I voted against it.
Â Â  In 2003, the Commission was forced, for the third year in succession, to revise its economic forecasts downwards.
The European economy is in poor shape, and three countries, including France and Germany which together account for half the eurozoneâs GDP, had budget deficits in excess of the limit of three per cent of GDP defined in the Stability and Growth Pact.
The rapporteur emphasises the importance of not bringing the Stability and Growth Pact into question at a time when the European economy is only just ticking over. The report expresses support for complying to the letter with the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is absolutely crucial to peopleâs confidence in the regulations that the criteria should be clear, measurable and objective.
I could not, however, support paragraphÂ 19, which ârequires an increase in budgetary allocations at European and national levelâ, that is to say further increased taxes.
That is hardly the right medicine in a situation of economic stagnation.
Â Â  This explanation of vote is intended solely to highlight what we see as a reversal of priorities as regards the budget, something that this report might be said to illustrate very fully indeed. First and foremost, it is only possible to discern the limits of budgetary restrictions once we look at how they operate and can be improved, and, almost importantly, how to deal with both existing and new requirements.
By way of illustration, we wish to underscore the fact that for us multilingualism issues are not technical ones but rather of vital political importance. Similarly, the creation of a parliamentary assembly for the WTO is one which we have great reservations about, and not just for budgetary reasons.
We will be referring on other occasions to the many other questions contained in this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the fact that we voted in favour of this report by MrÂ Belder does not imply any interference in Russia's internal power structure; the European Parliament must respect Russia's sovereignty.
It does, however, mean that we should grasp this opportunity to impart a new impetus to the debate on EU policy towards Russia at the very time when, by virtue of enlargement, we are gaining common borders because of the accession to the European Union of countries previously within the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union, and that we will inevitably have some important points to make in this area.

The European Union cannot choose its neighbours, but it can choose those countries with which it wishes to cooperate.
This report should be a wake-up call for us, reminding us about the lack of progress made in cooperation with Russia, about the difficult situation that persists in Chechnya, where it is almost impossible to reconcile respect for human rights and the fight against terrorism, and about the fragility of certain key aspects of constructing democracy in that country.
Are these adequate reasons for us to weaken our commitment towards our strategic relations with Russia?
No, quite the opposite! What is at stake here is the need to find ways of making the partnership between the European Union and Russia more effective, not only politically speaking, but also in terms of economics, security and European and world stability.
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.





Â Â  Colleagues, on your behalf I should like formally to thank President Mesic once again for his address to the House at a moment when we, together with the Commission, will enter a new period of reflection on our relations with the Republic of Croatia.



Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 26 February 2004.
Â Â  It is my sad duty today to express, on behalf of this House, our condemnation and our grief at the terrorist attacks in Baghdad and Karbala last Tuesday, 2 March 2004, aimed at the Shiite community as they celebrated the festival of Ashoura.
At least 170 innocent people were killed and almost 400 injured in those attacks.
As the European Parliament, we offer our sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the Iraqi authorities.
We condemn those behind indiscriminate and criminal terrorist attacks, which struck at a time of traditional, peaceful and religious celebration.
I ask you, colleagues, to join with me now in a minute of silence.
Â Â  Colleagues, today we mark and celebrate International Women's Day.
For almost 90 years, International Women's Day has been marked and celebrated.
In Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland the German feminist, Clara Zetkin, who wanted a single day to remember the 1857 strike of garment workers in the United States, took the initiative in March 1911 when more than a million men and women rallied to demand to right to work, to hold public office and to vote.
Much has changed since then and much remains to be achieved.
Women continue to experience discrimination and we know all too well â including in politics and in this institution â the glass ceiling which can operate in so many ways as regards possibilities of access, promotion and playing a full role.
We also know the extent to which we in this House have debated the victimisation of women through rape, domestic violence and trafficking.
Today in this Parliament we recognise and salute the leadership given by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities: it has played a major strategic role and I thank, through Mrs Karamanou, its chairman, all the members of that committee for the leadership which they give.
The concerns of the European Parliament are also reflected in today's agenda: we have three reports from the Women's Rights Committee: the report from our colleague Mrs GrÃ¶ner on the Daphne II Community programme â for the period 2004-2008 â to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women; the report from Mrs Bastos on the reconciliation of work, family life and privacy; and the report from Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco on the situation of women from minority groups in the European Union.
Moreover, we have two oral questions on the composition of the future European Commission and these are on the agenda for the Commission and the Council.
As today is International Women's Day, I remind the House of the resolution, adopted in 2003, in which Parliament committed itself to adopting and implementing a policy plan for gender mainstreaming with the overall objective of promoting equality of women and men through genuine and effective incorporation of the gender perspective in policies and activities, including decision-making structures and human and financial resources so that the different impact of measures on men and women is fully assessed and taken into account.
In line with this resolution, I announce with pleasure today that the Bureau has taken the decision to establish a high-level group on gender equality within this House, composed of the President of the House, two Vice-Presidents responsible for staff matters, the Chair of the Conference of Committee Chairpersons and the Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, assisted by the Secretary-General.
The creation of this group, which will start to work before the end of this legislative period, gives a very clear signal of political will and political commitment at the highest level of this House to succeed in this regard.
I am very pleased also that today we welcome as our guest the former chairperson of the Women's Rights Committee, Marlene Lenz.
I have also received messages of goodwill and support from previous chairs of that committee.
Â Â  â Mr President, your establishment of the high-level working group is a good sign that, by implementing gender mainstreaming, you are demonstrating what this House wants.
Rather than gender mainstreaming and the gender dimension to our policies being left to women alone, the gentlemen in this House must allow themselves to be judged by the degree to which they are willing to join in taking policy decisions that make equality and womenâs democratic rights real.
In the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, it is a cause of grave concern to us that the proportion of women in the next Parliament will be lower, and so every effort must be made to underline the political will from the top downwards.
I can only urge all the committees to adopt projects in their own areas of responsibility â in accordance with the resolution in our report, a year ago, on gender mainstreaming â and to make it clear that mainstreaming gender equality is not just to be left to the Committee on Womenâs Rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have a very simple suggestion to make to the other groups and that is to follow the example of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance by nominating two Vice-Chairmen, one man and one woman.
From experience I can say that this solution does not only provide advantages from a political point of view, but also in terms of quality of life.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wanted to thank you for what you said about the occasion of 8Â March and I believe thatÂ âÂ as MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner mentionedÂ âÂ we are all concerned about how important the presence of women will be in the next Parliament and about how difficult it will be to keep the presence of women at an acceptable level.
This is why I would like to suggest to you, MrÂ President, that the Parliament services carry out a very simple study into what women have achieved in parliamentary work during this term.
I am sure that, even though women are still a minority in this Parliament, they have given a much greater contribution to the work of Parliament than their percentage would suggest.
Therefore, persuading women to vote for women by starting with the work that women have carried out could be a very convincing argument.
I therefore urge you to make your services carry out a study that puts together attendance, the number of reports and what has been done in Parliament: it will become clear that women are doing much more work than their percentage of representation would suggest.
I believe that this argument is much more convincing than so many others in calling for a greater presence of women in the next Parliament.
Â Â  I am happy to ask the services to look into that matter and to report back to the House in due course.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank you on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, for the statement you made on the occasion of International Womenâs Day and for the emphasis which you and other honourable Members placed on the fact that there must be a balanced representation of women and men in the European Parliament to come out of the elections in June.
Nonetheless, I have already received a very serious complaint from the womenâs organisations in Malta, which inform us that the leaders of the political parties are already compiling their lists without including a single woman.
I wonder if the population of Malta consists only of men and not women.
I should like to ask you, in honour of todayâs International Womenâs Day, to intervene personally in this matter and to remind the political leaders of Malta that they must respect the principle of gender equality and the ; otherwise their position in the European Union looks set to be very problematic.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking you for having included this mini-debate on the agenda on International Womenâs Day.
It is traditional in all countries on this day to dedicate some kind of act or statement to the recognition of womenâs work, equality between men and women and the fact that there is still much to be done in order to make this equality a reality.
We are going to see this in the debates to follow.
I would therefore simply like to appeal for Parliamentâs approach to be maintained, as an example from an institution which is making progress on the road towards defending the rights of women.
We will see in the debates on the reports to follow that there is still much to be done in order to achieve equality between men and women and in order to achieve equal recognition of work.
MrsÂ Napoletano, we women do not always have to be demonstrating that we work better than men; we simply want men to recognise our work on an equal footing with that of their male colleagues.
Â Â  â Mr President, it would seem that some of the work done by this Parliament, and hence work also done by women, is at risk of going to waste as the plenary time we have left is simply not enough.
This I think would be a great pity and loss from the point of view of the rapporteurs and those who have tabled amendments, all of whom have done some very thorough work.
I would like to ask whether it is possible to hold an additional two-day mini-session at the end of April at which any of these reports that have not been dealt with could be voted on and adopted.
This plenary could even be held without a debate or by restricting the discussion to the two-minute speeches by the Commission and the person who drafted the report.
I would think it would be more important to deal with a report, even if it is not discussed, than let it come to nothing.
The other alternative would be to limit the amount of time allocated to speeches during the plenary in April as just described and extend voting time correspondingly.
I hope that you will think seriously about this, MrÂ President, and that you will seek solutions that are in keeping with Parliamentâs increased powers as a legislating body.
Â Â  â Mr President, the women here who are speaking on behalf of women are already in a special position.
Despite this, we complain too often about a lack of appreciation.
We have the opportunity of working here, but not always is our work appreciated.
Today, on International Women's Day, I should like to draw attention to the millions of women who are scarcely noticed.
On this International Women's Day, Amnesty International has asked that special attention be paid to violence against women, sexual violence against women, and the humiliations suffered on a daily basis.
I thank you for the efforts you are prepared to make within our Institution, and I should like to ask you that we, as an Institution, send the message to the Council and the Commission that actual guarantees should be made to improve the situation of these women and stop the humiliations and exploitations.
We, as development donors, carry a huge responsibility in the world, but the money invariably ends up in the pockets of the consultants rather than with the women who deserve it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to take the opportunity sincerely to congratulate the women on their international day of action.
I should also like, however, to sound a note of warning to the women here in Parliament: stop focusing so much upon whether there should be more men or women in Parliament, and try to consider the millions of women who are grossly underpaid for doing the same work or work of the same value.
That is something I think should be a key issue for us.
In 1976, we adopted a directive, but the equal pay there should be is still not forthcoming.
That is perhaps a more important perspective than that of whether there should be one or two more women.
I also think it is a good day that has been chosen for the international day of action, namely my birthday.
Â Â  Thank you for that contribution, Freddy, and happy birthday!
Â Â  Mr President, today, on International Womenâs Day, I wish not only to draw attention to the entire issue of discrimination against women, but also to raise the issue of women who are victims of war.
Today, we must remember the suffering of women who are victims of war, in Iraq, in Palestine, and in so many other countries.
I hope that we use this day to remind people of the need to eradicate war and to contribute to ending these conflicts, such as the illegal occupation of Iraq, the humiliation of the Palestinian people and of women who are suffering on a daily basis as a result of this unjust war.
I also wish to remind you that the World Social Forum has called on us all to take part, on 20 March, in the demonstrations against the war, to safeguard peace, on the first anniversary of the war waged against Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom and their allies and to call for an end of the occupation of Iraq, to call for peace.
Â Â  Mr President, today also â International Womenâs Day â I would like to make an appeal to this House.
I am not going to talk about discrimination â other Members have done that already â but I will say that I believe violence against women is a problem throughout the world, and particularly in my State, and that both the institutions and society must accept that it is necessary to resolve it.
I would ask this House for a minuteâs silence, both for the 13 women who have died already this year in Spain and for those who have been murdered elsewhere in the world.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is good that a new high-level group is being set up genuinely to tackle gender mainstreamingin the institutions of the EU.
It is, unfortunately, not the first time that we are being given such promises and are taking that responsibility upon ourselves.
It is what all the Member States, their governments and their politicians have done ever since the Beijing Conference of 1995.
Unfortunately, it seems that we have, at best, taught ourselves a new expression.
More often than not, everything continues, however, in the same old way.
I am going to be a bit naughty here.
We are to debate the privatisation of water.
I should like to know how much account has been taken of womenâs needs and womenâs rights in the debate on the proposal to privatise water in the European Union.
Of course, this will also be a signal beyond the borders of the EU.
Â Â  â Mr President, exactly 38 years ago, in this very House, which was then known as the Assembly, I delivered my first report on women â and men, of course.
It was report No 69, and it had to do with maternity protection.
At that time I was the youngest Member of Parliament and, including me, there were only two women Members.
Today I am, unfortunately, the oldest woman in the House, yet this does enable me to make a fair assessment of the progress we have made since then, and of the contribution of the policy of equal treatment and opportunity between men and women, particularly since 1975.
Instead of moaning incessantly, as though we were at the Wailing Wall, we would be better advised to enter headlong into the debate.
Over the course of the fifteen years that I have spent here, the Commission would have been better off submitting the legislative proposals that we have repeatedly called for.
As regards the 1986 Directive on equal treatment of self-employed workers, for example, including those working in agriculture, I draw your attention to our demands for a Directive on the status of spouses, which is so important to the millions of invisible workers, mostly self-employed women working in agriculture.
Nothing has been done.
I also draw your attention to the own-initiative report in which I called for a framework directive on the entitlement to share pension rights in the event of divorce, a major issue for all women.
Sadly, nothing has happened, which is something that I regret, because it is a waste of time to have mature debates and eloquent speeches on 8Â March if we do not submit legislative proposals that will genuinely advance the policy and the equal treatment of men and women.
Â Â  Mr President, apart from you, I think I am the only Liberal here, and that is why I want to intervene.
As one of the few men in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, I think it is only right to thank you, MrÂ President, for this initiative.
Unlike my fellow MEP, MrsÂ Eriksson, I have the greatest confidence that the work you are now getting under way will also lead to a result.
It is not necessarily the case that everyone in this Parliament is just talking for talkingâs sake.
Enlargement is constructive, necessary and incredibly important historically.
Naturally, we must not, however, turn away from the problem addressed by MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner.
There are, in actual fact, more grey suits in this House.
That is a concern, and it is something we must be able to acknowledge.
To MrÂ Blak, I should like to say: you are of course a Socialist and might reasonably be expected to be alert to structures.
That is what, as Socialists, you teach each other to be.
I am a Liberal, but even I am able to see structures, and there are structures in this House.
Clearly, it is significant if more women come into this House to take decisions.
That is something I believe MrÂ Blak can also appreciate.
Â Â  The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 26 February 2004 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  â Mr President, detailed examination of the Minutes reveals, to my regret, that I forgot to sign in at the previous part-session in Brussels.
I did attend and vote, so perhaps you would be so kind as to add my name to the attendance list.
Â Â  The Minutes will be amended accordingly.
(1)
Â Â  The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 4 March 2004 has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:
As regards the reports by Mr Obiols i GermÃ  and MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra respectively on political dialogue and cooperation agreements with Central America (A5-0120/2004) and the Andean Community (A5-0119/2004), I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group for these reports to be held over to a later part-session.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say that it would be desirable for these debates on agreements for political dialogue and cooperation with the countries of Central America and the Andean Community to take place in the presence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten, who has expressed his interest in being present.
Therefore, Mr President, on behalf of my group, and I hope with the agreement of Mr Obiols i GermÃ , I would request that these debates be postponed until one of Parliamentâs future sittings which Mr Patten can attend.
I should like to remind the House that 80 reports are expected to be on the agenda for the March II part-session and 85 reports for the April part-session.
As regards the report by Mr Kronberger (A5-0047/2004) on the quality of ambient air, I have received a request from the PSE Group to hold over the vote to a later part-session.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we would like, if at all possible to get this report dealt with before the end of this Parliamentary term by using a first reading agreement, which would mean that we would have to hold the debate this week but defer the vote until April, in order to be able to negotiate agreement with the Council.
When it comes to the vote, there will be, at most, a very narrow majority.
It may be that the decision, be it favourable or unfavourable, will be taken by a very small number of votes, and then, in any case, at least 50% of MEPs â to be fairly precise about it â will be less than happy.
I would ask that we should debate the report tomorrow but defer the vote to April, by which time we will have been able to discuss matters with the Council.
Preparations have, in essence, been made for this, so we may yet be able to conclude a first reading agreement.
Â Â  â Mr President, I do not believe there was any need for further deliberation.
There was in committee when we asked for an expert opinion, or rather, a cost-benefit analysis, on this report to be drawn up, something that you, Mr Kronberger, opposed.
Now that it has been produced, and makes perfectly clear in what direction policy must go, I cannot see any reason to hold over the vote rather than have it today or this week, quite simply because we already have far too many reports to deal with in the other Strasbourg sittings.
If Mr Kronberger joins us, he will be on the right side.
I do ask, though, that the vote should take place.
Â Â  â Thank you Mr President.
We do not want to discuss the substance of the report; we have already had a debate about it in committee.
Although we did indeed get the expert opinion to which Mr Florenz referred, it did not back up his arguments but those of my group and also MrÂ Kronbergerâs approach.
It makes sense to hold over the vote.
We are at the end of a parliamentary term and want, if possible, to come to an agreement at first reading, so that we will not have to start from the beginning again when the House reconvenes, going through first reading again and then debating the common position.
Having the vote itself at the next sitting will not take up much time, and so I ask you, Mr President, to put it to the vote.
This is what my group will be asking for and thereby supporting Mr Kronberger in having just the debate this week.
I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group for Council and Commission statements on the lessons to be learned and the prospects for the European Union one year after the war in Iraq.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is obvious to everybody; we must discuss not only the events in Iraq, but also the lessons that the EU can learn from them.
One year after the war, I feel that the time is right for us to investigate why these differences occurred and why the EU now needs a common position.
I feel it would be wrong to postpone such a debate until some future date.
You, Mr President, have yourself just reminded us of the large number of reports planned for the coming sessions.
Our group has, consequently, called for a debate on Iraq to be held during this session.
As regards the Commission statement on the effect on the marine environment of low frequency active sonar, I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group for motions for resolutions to be tabled to wind up the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the issue of low-level sonar and marine life is one that Parliament has debated in the past.
It has been discussed in the Committee on Petitions, all sorts of promises have been made and we are due to debate it again this week, but so far we have seen precious little action.
Therefore, our Group felt it would be useful for Parliament to take this opportunity to pass a resolution on this issue so that the Council and Commission are unable to forget what Parliament has asked for in the past.
We would therefore request that the debate be wound up with a resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw this Houseâs attention to the Commissionâs refusal to follow up, within the framework of interinstitutional accords, a request for information regarding the possible award of EUR 230Â million Euratom funding to the Cernavoda nuclear complex.
As a rapporteur on the liberalisation of the electricity market, I feel politically responsible for ensuring fair competition in this market.
I asked the Commission to provide us, as it is required to do by the Espoo convention, with the environmental impact study, along with the report on public participation.
The Commission has not submitted the documents concerned to our committee within the established time frame.
This is confirmation, if further confirmation were needed, of the Commissionâs blatant lack of transparency when it comes to the nuclear issue.
I should therefore like to request your support, Mr President, in compelling the Commission to comply with the right to information, as provided for in the interinstitutional accords.
Â Â  I will take up that matter and correspond with the Commission and with you in due course.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wanted to draw this Houseâs attention to an event that is stirring up feeling in the hearts and minds of Italians.
There is a terroristÂ âÂ called Cesare BattistiÂ âÂ condemned in Italy for four murders by a judgment that has the force of âresjudicataâ.
On 7Â April, the French judiciary will have to decide whether or not to grant extradition of this terrorist to Italy.
I have a great deal of respect for the judiciary but I believe that it would be a serious error not to grant extradition.
It would be an attack on Europe, it would show that Europe is not a reality.
It has been proven that terrorism has links in France, Italy and Spain.
Young terrorists in Italy have struck more than once in recent years and are trained by Italian terrorists that are in jail.
Not granting extradition would mean giving a negative signal to these people.
I hope that everyone in this Parliament supports this callÂ âÂ even the left, given that today an important representative from the Italian left has spoken in very strong terms to call for the extradition of this terrorist.
Â Â  Mr President, two weeks ago Mr Tannock asked you to rule on the status of the STOA report on inedibles in foodstuffs after the STOA Panel voted not to publish it.
Can I remind you that the STOA articles of association state that there should not be votes on research projects from that committee which have been commissioned by this Parliament.
'The results ... shall not be adopted, nor voted upon, nor be regarded as a STOA or Parliamentary report.'
What are we to tell our constituents who ask for research before reassurance, wherever it leads?
What steps will you take to ensure that this report, whether it is troubling or mundane, becomes the property of us all and cannot be expunged by a powerful lobby?
Â Â  Mr Whitehead, as you will know, the report was requested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The report was sent to that committee.
As regards its wider publication, I note the point you make.
This was not a decision of the Presidency of Parliament.
I note your concern regarding the procedures; I will seek advice as to whether they have been breached and will come back to you on the matter â and only on that matter.
I will check whether due process has been followed.
If it has, I will not try to interpose.
Â Â  Mr President, you will perhaps be aware of the serious allegation on the front page of today's newspaper that the British Government tried to muzzle its own top scientific adviser when he warned that global warming was a more serious threat than international terrorism.
This follows from the US Administration's failure earlier this year to continue policy drafting on the back of the Arctic Council's Arctic Climate Impact Assessment.
This is a huge scientific report and the US response is entirely untenable.
Last Friday I attended, on behalf of this Parliament, a meeting of Arctic parliamentarians.
We listened in shock to the various scientific presentations and the US reaction.
Can we please try to ensure that both Commission and Council take seriously their various involvements at all levels with the Arctic Council and support open dialogue and action on this important global issue.
It must not be hushed up, covered up, slowed down to please the US or anyone.
If self-interest serves, then perhaps we might note that the latest scientific evidence forecasts that Europe will get colder.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to draw your attention and that of the House to a serious problem that has arisen in Mozambique involving the alleged trafficking of human organs.
Unfortunately, we were not able to reach consensus in the Conference of Presidents on tabling an urgent debate on the issue for this sitting and this is why I ask you to ensure that, at the next sitting, provided no other urgent debates are tabled, the matter can be dealt with by a Communication from the Commission and the Council, to which I have been addressing questions since January.
This is an extremely serious matter.
In recent months, we have received reports that between fifty and one hundred children have disappeared, but the full extent of the phenomenon is not known.
Since the issue became a matter of public knowledge in January, the interest of the Portuguese public has grown, as has the interest in Spain, because some Spanish missionaries have been threatened.
In Brazil, a Brazilian Lutheran missionary who spoke out against this trafficking in Mozambique was murdered recently.
The newspaper and the BBC have both covered the issue and this House cannot continue to ignore the matter.
This holds all the more true because, unfortunately, the Council is dragging its feet on the Greek Presidencyâs proposal for a framework decision on the trafficking in organs, which we examined in this Chamber last October and, consequently, some information must be provided on this problem in general and more specifically on the tragedy unfolding in Mozambique.
Â Â  I take note of that and would ask the group leaders to do the same for the next Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am speaking for Maurizio Puddu, who is the President of the Italian Association for Victims of Terrorism and who signed a letter sent to some newspapers yesterday as âEuropean citizenâ.
The letter was addressed to MrsÂ Barbara Spinelli.
âCesare Battistiâs release by the French judicial authorities is baffling us, and I can assure you that it is also baffling the majority of Italian citizens, whatever their political stance.
For us, murder and violence can never be defended.
For us, the fact that terrorists maimed and murdered for ideological reasons, as they claim to do, does not make it any better, if anything it makes it worse.
They and their friends will always find a thousand and one words to evade and falsify the past and continue to insult the memory of the dead.
We call on the FrenchÂ âÂ those of the great historical tradition that we so lovedÂ âÂ to respect our law, which in this case has the natural right to respect human life on its side, which cannot be confused with any State reason.â
I also made this speech on behalf of MrsÂ Napoletano.
Â Â  Mr President, at Dundrennan, in my constituency in the south-west of Scotland, there is a firing range where depleted uranium shells are used for practice.
I receive many letters of complaint and concern about this.
One recently drew my attention to the fact that over the years nearly 29 tonnes of depleted uranium have been deposited in the waters off south-west Scotland, therefore also affecting the Irish Sea.
I have been asked to draw this to the attention of MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m and shall certainly be writing to her about it too.
I am glad she is here today and that the Irish presidency is also present.
It is a matter of serious concern that this dangerous substance is being fired in considerable quantities into waters which drain tidally into the Irish Sea, affecting at least two EU Member States, in probable violation of the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by the Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972, as extended by recent protocols.
Â Â  Mr President, the dramatic fall from power of President Aristide in Haiti and the undemocratic and increasingly repressive measures by President ChÃ¡vez of Venezuela to thwart the will of his people to hold a recall referendum represent a worrying trend in Latin America, as Aristide becomes the sixth democratically elected leader in that region to be ousted from power since 1999.
We cannot be complacent about Latin America and take the huge achievement of spreading democracy there for granted.
The EU must work closely with the US to stabilise this process.
Mr Aristide took refuge in Africa, another continent sadly ravaged by civil wars, dictatorships and failed states.
This House will welcome the announcement that the EU-inspired African Union, still in its infancy since being founded in 2002, will shortly have its first Pan-African Parliament meeting in Addis Ababa and plans somewhat ambitiously to set up a security council with a standing army to prevent future conflicts on that continent.
Will you, Mr President, send this Parliament's greetings and best wishes?
Â Â  I have taken a positive note of that request.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to inform the House of the appearance in the Spanish media last week of a document from the European Commissionâs Environment Directorate-General on the Spanish Governmentâs National Hydrological Plan and its funding by the European Union.
Specifically, this document states that the request presented by the Government overstates the demand for water and underestimates the cost of the work, that the alternatives to the diversion have not been properly analysed and that the protection of the Ebro Delta has not been properly provided for.
The possible alternatives must be analysed, Mr President, water is necessary, but it is also scarce.
The European Union must only fund projects which offer the necessary guarantees and which do not prejudice any of its inhabitants.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am sorry to trouble you and the Members of this House again with an issue with which they are all too familiar â that of Chechnya.
It would appear that there is no limit to the appalling nature of Russian policy in Chechnya. Seventeen members of the family of Umar Khanbiev, the Chechen Health Minister â who was received by our president, Mrs Fontaine, and by a number of group presidents and Members of this House â have been arrested, following speeches he had made, in this House and in various other forums, in favour of a political solution.
I feel that Mr Putin, the President of a so-called democracy, has reacted in an absolutely disgraceful manner.
I hope, Mr President, that you can meet Mr Khanbiev tomorrow, when he comes to Parliament.
I also hope that the numerous Members of this House who have already met him will wish to express their solidarity to him in person, tomorrow and on Wednesday.
I feel that Parliament must persevere with the brave and laudable positions that it has already adopted on Chechnya.
We cannot let Russia do what it is doing in Chechnya.
It is totally unacceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, next week Mr Theo van Boven, the special rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the question of torture, who is known for his great independence and integrity, will present his report to the United Nations in Geneva, fulfilling the mandate conferred on him.
In its conclusions the report states that action against torture in Spain is no less of a pressing need today than it used to be in the past.
One illustration of that was given last week when three indicted young Basques accused of transporting explosives complained of continuous torture and ill-treatment during their five days held incommunicado in the Guardia Civil headquarters.
Mr van Boven said at last week's press conference that incommunicado detention 'not only creates the conditions for torture to take place', the measure itself can constitute 'cruel, merciless treatment'.
Â Â  Mr President, although it appears that some people's shame and capacity to provoke knows no limits, I am always amazed that the only Member of this House who has not been able to condemn a single one of the attacks carried out by his friends, the cowardly murderers of the terrorist group ETA, should refer to an apparent defence of human rights.
While, moreover, it is grave and condemnable, Mr President, to violate the right to life, it is even more so to take advantage of the freedom that comes with being a Member of this House to justify the unjustifiable or defend the indefensible through words or through guilty silence.
Mr President, our only comfort is the knowledge that, for legal reasons, during the next legislature we will not have to listen to this type of comment so lacking in solidarity, which is contrary to Parliamentâs positions and which undervalues the rights of victims.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from Mr Ribeiro e Castroâs speech, I too wish to alert the House to the cruel, and brutal trade in human organs that is taking place in northern Mozambique, near the town of Nampula.
This cruel and brutal trade is unacceptable, must be condemned and must shock people into action.
Mr President, the European Parliament must do something; it must protest â it must take action to ensure that this trade ceases and that this brutality is ended.
I would ask you to write to the President of the Republic of Mozambique and to the President of that countryâs National Assembly to express the concern of Members of the European Parliament at a truly appalling situation.
Â Â  â Mr President, we will, this week, be meeting survivors of the war in Congo that has already claimed 3Â 500Â 000 victims.
While the international community remains completely indifferent, that country has for years endured a conflict that is still continuing.
I rejoice that peace is â apparently â underway, and hope that those involved will experience this in the same way, because at the moment, the conflict in Kivu is, to all intents and purposes, still very definitely ongoing.
For women, in particular, the situation remains bleak.
I have heard dreadful accounts of children as young as 10 and grandmothers aged 70, and of women whose ages range between the two, mothers and others, who have become the victims of systematic rape as some kind of weapon of war.
I think we should do more to prevent this kind of violence from being trivialised, to condemn it and help the victims.
After all, justice will never prevail if the source of life is killed.
Â Â  I apologise to those who did not get to speak in this item, but we must now begin the first debate.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- Oral question (O-0011/2004/rev 1 â B5-0065/2004) by Anna Karamanou to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on gender equality;
- Recommendation for second reading (A5-0083/2004) from the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a programme of Community action (2004-2008) to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk (the Daphne II programme) (Rapporteur: Lissy GrÃ¶ner);
- Report (A5-0092/2004) by Regina Bastos, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on reconciling professional, family and private lives;
and
- Report (A5-0102/2004) by Elena Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the situation of women from minority groups in the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I am particularly honoured on International Womenâs Day to intervene in plenary within the framework of the procedure for oral questions.
Mr President, today is International Womenâs Day, which coincides with the 20th anniversary of the existence and achievements of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities of our Parliament, which provides a very good opportunity to take stock of and evaluate our policy on gender equality.
Without doubt, important progress has been made over the last twenty years in all sectors, thanks to the political initiatives taken at parliamentary and national level and the initiatives taken by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities of the European Parliament, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Cox for his support.
The participation of women in the European Parliament rose from 6% of the appointed Parliament to 16% in 1979, when the first elections were held, and to 31% in 1999.
We are aiming for and hoping that this percentage will increase still further in the forthcoming elections in the enlarged Europe of the 25.
Gender equality and the full realisation of the productive potential of women are now recognised by all as the to achieving the Lisbon strategy and to strengthening our participative democracy.
Without doubt over the last 20 years, the greatest progress has been made in the participation and performances of women at all levels of education, given that today they account for 55% of graduates in the European Union.
Nonetheless, despite the undisputed achievements, significant differences and discrepancies continue to exist between the two sexes in all sectors, as stated in the Commissionâs first annual report, which will be discussed at the spring European Council in a few daysâ time.
Violence against women, trafficking in human beings, unemployment, incompatibility between professional and private life, inadequate care facilities for children and the elderly, inequalities in pay and promotion are burning issues which urgently need to be resolved, in that they relate directly both to the infringement of rights and to the sustainability and competitiveness of the economy.
Unfortunately, it is with concern and sadness that we note that numerous Member States, despite having incorporated all the Community directives into their national legislation, do not show willing to promote flanking measures which would result in the abolition of inequalities.
It is disappointing that numerous Member States hardly even follow the Councilâs recommendations.
Looking back over the last five years, the review of the directive on equal treatment in the workplace and the promotion of gender mainstreaming were an important milestone in promoting equal opportunities.
Nonetheless, because we cannot talk of equality of the sexes only in the workplace, we welcome the initiative by Mrs Diamantopoulou for a new directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty, which will ban any discrimination in access to goods and services.
It is a fact that, with our joint efforts and within the framework of the future European constitution, we can slowly but surely bridge the gender gap in the Union and act as a shining example to the rest of the world, to areas of the planet in which women are still fighting for their fundamental human rights.
As we approach the tenth anniversary of the UN World Conference in Beijing in 1995, where 180 governments agreed on a joint action platform in order to promote womenâs rights, we find that those commitments have not been honoured.
Women still account for 70% of the poor in the world, girls in sub-Saharan Africa are six times more at risk than boys of infection with the HIV virus, four million women and children are victims of violence and sexual exploitation; at the same time, women only hold 15.2% of parliamentary seats.
That is why, including within the framework of the new challenges being created by the development of technology and the globalisation of the economy, we need to renew and step up action on womenâs rights in the aim of achieving democratic and participative global intergovernmentalism which will safeguard the fair distribution of the resources of the planet, sexual equality and sustainable development for everyone.
We can discuss this at a new conference, which we shall call âBeijing +10â and for which we await the relevant initiative by the Commission.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you to reply to the topical questions which I shall put to you.
First, what are the specific results of the work by the team of Commissioners for the promotion of equality?
Secondly, does the Commission agree to the appointment of a Commissioner, the main item in whose portfolio will be gender equality?
Also, although the Council representatives are not here, we have asked the Council to request that the Member States submit a list of three candidate Commissioners who represent both sexes, in order to achieve a balanced composition of the new Commission from the gender point of view.
This proposal has already been submitted by the Convention.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it augurs well that we are holding this debate on International Womenâs Day, and thereby bringing our commitment to such things as the combating of violence to the attention of the countries from which we come.
Mrs Karamanou has alluded to the many things we have achieved since Finland, a century ago, became the first country in Europe to give women the vote; the results have been many, they alone count, and not one of them just happened; women always had to fight hard for them.
Speaking as the rapporteur on the Daphne programme, I would describe the situation facing us today as the tip of an iceberg; I refer to the trial of Marc Dutroux, a case that we can expect to disclose a veritable morass of violence against women and children.
One might say that we can see the initiative that led to the Daphne programme ten years ago, at a time when Dutrouxâ crimes came to light, now forming a direct link with the programmeâs second stage, aimed at preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women.
This second stage, running from 2004 to 2008, is accompanied by a substantial increase in resources, and I have to remind you that we now have EURÂ 10 million per annum as against EURÂ 5 million per annum in the first stage.
Although this is still a mere drop in the ocean, doubling the annual budget in this way is urgently necessary, as Daphne I was able to fund only 13% of the good projects.
Much of the knowledge gained from the first stage of Daphne was incorporated into the new programme.
We had a long battle with the Commission and the Council to get a helpdesk set up for NGOâs seeking help from the programme for the first time, especially those in the new Member States, where the structures of NGOs for women are still very weak.
What is now Amendment No 5 is a form of words to which the Council can agree, and I hope that we will soon have an agreement on this.
The draft report also includes a proposal to declare 2006 the European Year Against Violence, to inaugurate a wide-ranging public debate aimed at developing further initiatives to halt the advance of the deadly virus of violence.
I am able to mention only a few of them: there has been a dramatic increase in trafficking in women, and, according to the International Organisation for Migration, 500Â 000 women have been smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited and forced into prostitution.
That figure has now risen to 800Â 000, and the well-organised criminal slave trading rings â for that is what I call them â do not shrink from trafficking in children as well.
One of our amendments deflected a Council proposal to the effect that the Daphne II programme should concentrate more on offenders.
We did not see why resources that were in any case meagre should be taken away from the victims, and offenders identified as a target group.
More to the point, the preventive measures under Daphne I already facilitate work with offenders and victims and bring the two together.
Informal dialogue between the Council, the Commission and my committee made it possible for us to agree on proposals, which we put to the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities as amendments.
If we were to find a broad majority to support these amendments tomorrow, it would send a clear message to women â and not only to women, but also to organisations in Europe, that we are joining battle against violence, and that we will not stand idly by while gangs of criminals make billions.
My thanks go to the Commission, above all to Commissioner Vitorino, and to the Irish and Italian presidencies of the Council for their cooperation; I hope that we can expect broad support for these five amendments tomorrow, and that the Common Position, as thus amended, can then enter into force without delay, for the programme for the necessary task of combating violence is urgently needed.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reconciling professional, family and private lives is a crucial aspect of making gender equality a reality.
It is therefore a privilege today to be able to present and discuss my own report on this issue.
Today, 8 March, is most appropriate because it marks International Womenâs Day and because this year, 2004, has been designated International Year of the Family.
We are well aware that professional life, family life and private life are all aspects of our lives but at the same time, they form three complementary lives.
Promoting equality between men and women is a key Community task, which entails the need to compensate for the disadvantages faced by women as regards conditions of access to and participation in the labour market, and the disadvantages faced by men as regards conditions for participation in family life.
In the 1990s, this area received a substantial boost and a great deal of Community legislation was implemented in this field.
Member Statesâ policies, however, lack coherence.
Against this backdrop, two issues must be examined: firstly, the demographic challenge.
On the one hand, the ageing of the population requires a greater influx of human resources into the labour market and access to this market must be equal for both men and women.
On the other hand, there is a need for family policies that favour demographic growth.
The second issue is the challenge of economic growth, which requires measures that provide incentives for womenâs participation in the labour market.
Making policies coherent above all requires a balance to be struck between these two issues.
Without this balance, they will remain at odds with one another and reconciling professional, family and private lives will be seriously endangered.
I believe the key point in this issue is that women must always be free to choose between working when they have children or staying at home.
Measures must, therefore, be in place to enable women to make this choice without their careers or their family and private lives suffering as a result.
The diversity of situations must be emphasised and taken into account.
I wish to highlight the fact that in the EU, one woman in six between the ages of 25 and 54 is not in paid employment, in other words, is neither employed nor unemployed, because of family responsibilities or because she is not able to reconcile professional and family life.
Obstructing or hampering womenâs entry into the labour market is a factor for lower productivity in Europe.
The disparities between Member States from northern Europe and those from the south speak for themselves.
We must focus on the good practices employed by our partners in Denmark, Sweden and Finland, who have the highest rates of female employment.
In Sweden, women have a large choice of crÃšches.
Denmark devotes 3.8% of its national wealth to family policies, more than any other European country and its birth rate stands at 1.73%, also one of the highest in the EU.
All of the parties involved in this field, families, national, local and regional authorities and the social partners, must be involved.
The Lisbon conclusions state that the balanced participation of men and women in professional and family lives, which is in the interest of men as well as of women, is a key factor for progress in society, with maternity, paternity and childrenâs rights being extremely important social values that must be protected by society, by the Member States and by the European Community.
Genuine equality between women and men in both the public and private domains must be accepted by society as a prerequisite for democracy, a requirement for citizenship and as a guarantee for individual autonomy and freedom, which should be reflected in all EU policies.
The objectives of the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils throw down major challenges to the European Union and call for innovative measures.
I shall confine myself to suggesting a few: the current Member States and those about to join must monitor the impact of their policies on families.
The innovative concept of âfamily mainstreamingâ must be viewed as distinct from the concept of gender mainstreaming. Businesses must be made aware of reconciling professional and family lives as a right pertaining to their employees, as a social obligation and as an essential tool for promoting higher productivity.
In conjunction with the social partners, a guide to good practice must be drawn up for companies, which also publicises success stories.
The organisation of work, specifically promoting part-time work, reduced working hours and teleworking could be one solution.
Setting up Internet sites containing databases of services useful to workers and publicising existing support structures, informing employers and providing incentives for them to establish or maintain social support structures that facilitate the reconciliation of family and professional lives, granting firms tax exemptions or reductions, providing assistance, for example in the form of cash benefits or vouchers (childcare vouchers, vouchers for the recruitment of home helps, etc, special support for single-parent families and for single mothers, specifically in terms of taxation, family support and family credits.
These are all ambitious measures that are much needed, because we must make progress in this field.
As rapporteur, therefore, I should like to ask the Commission to put in place the necessary mechanisms for drafting a framework directive on reconciling professional, family and private lives, so as to ensure that all Member States, current and future, have the appropriate tools and responses with which to meet the challenges of equal opportunities, economic growth and the demographic challenge.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour for me to present the very important report on the situation of women from minority groups in the European Union on behalf of the rapporteur, Mrs Elena Valenciano, who is unable to be present at todayâs sitting.
The report refers to three minority groups: disabled women, migrant women and Roma women, and focuses on the problem of the cloak of silence which hides their situation.
These women remain in the shadows, in that they are hiding behind the men who belong to their groups.
In order to make a more accurate analysis, the rapporteur proposes different actions for the minority groups referred to in the report, such as, for example, the development of statistics and the carrying out of a specific study, the involvement of these women in decision-making procedures, the promotion of information technology, training and education and protection of their sexual and reproductive health.
The rapporteur thanks these organisations of the three minorities for their support to women and for the good cooperation which she had while drafting this report.
First, as far as disabled women are concerned, there are 44 600 000 people with disabilities in the European Union, which is 15.7% of European citizens, set to rise to 25% as the European Union enlarges.
It is estimated that women account for 51% of the overall disabled population.
However, there is a basis for thinking that this percentage could be higher: 53%, rising to 58% by 2015.
Compared to the 55% of able-bodied women in employment, only 25% of disabled women work.
It is usually a job of inferior status, low paid and with fewer advantages than are enjoyed by disabled men.
The problem is that there is no career guidance designed to meet the specific needs of disabled women.
Violence is not only a frequent occurrence in the lives of disabled women, but on many occasions the very cause of the disability.
It is estimated that violence is the main cause of death and disability worldwide, ahead of cancer, road accidents or even war, for women aged between 16 and 45.
Secondly, in relation to migrant women, according to UN overall figures from 1990 â unfortunately we do not have more recent data â there are 12 million migrant women in Europe.
This number is, of course, continuing to rise, even though no precise data are available.
Poverty and social instability are central factors in the lives of migrant women.
Difficulty in gaining access to the labour market as a result of cultural and linguistic barriers, the lack of recognition of their professional qualifications, stereotypes and prejudice, racism and the disregard for their rights keep female immigrants confined to the lower ranks of the labour market or to the black economy, or dependent on men for their survival.
Many of these women remain at home working as carers and cleaners, stuck in the traditional female role with the resulting social isolation and lack of access to basic social services, and marginalised in the process of upward social mobility, which creates a chain reaction of social exclusion.
The closing of borders and restrictions on immigration increase the role of unofficial networks and the profits made by mafia-style networks that traffic in human beings.
In the case of women who are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, the granting of temporary residence permits must be encouraged.
As far as Roma women are concerned, there are approximately 8 to 10 million Roma in Europe, although the still traditionally nomadic nature of this people means current figures are unreliable.
The figures in use should therefore be treated with caution.
The population census puts the percentage of Roma women at 51%, which is comparable to the figure for women in general.
There is a high birth rate among the Roma population as well as high rates of adult and infant mortality.
The women usually marry very young and bear their first child earlier than in other ethnic groups.
Life expectancy is 13 and 17 years shorter for Roma men and women respectively than for the rest of the population.
A high birth rate combined with a high mortality rate makes for a mostly young Roma population. 80% are younger than 34, whilst 43% are under 14 years.
Let us take advantage of todayâs International Womenâs Day to decide to turn our attention and thoughts to and take specific action in connection with these women from minority groups in the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome this joint debate on International Women's Day on the issues relevant to millions of women.
This is a day not only to celebrate but also to reflect.
What are we celebrating?
Certainly the progress we have made towards gender equality in the European Union and also our solidarity with women around the world in all countries, remembering in particular those living in conflict and poverty whose rights are violated daily.
We must also reflect on how far we have really progressed.
That may make us wonder whether we really have so much to celebrate.
The European Union is on the eve of an historic enlargement and we are about to become a Union of 450 million people, more than half of whom are women and girls.
Yet we still cannot say that women in general enjoy the same status as men in European societies.
Nor are they properly represented at national and international decision-making levels.
Violence and trafficking in women or, rather, sex slavery â which is the real word for it â remain scourges that we have not been able to tackle effectively enough.
On the other hand, it is true that we have made considerable progress in the last 50 years, with the European Parliament being a key player.
We have to build on those achievements and ensure that the recently proposed equal-treatment legislation outside the labour market will become European law.
We must do everything in our power to ensure a balanced representation of women in the next European Parliament.
Gender equality goes hand in hand with democracy at all levels.
Women's rights are human rights.
Freedom from discrimination embodied in the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the cornerstone of democracy.
But democracy requires more than an absence of discrimination: it needs governance.
Good governance means sharing the power to make decisions in politics, economic and social life, public administration and in the home.
We still have a long way to go.
I shall start by answering Mrs Karamanou.
The Commission discussed the results of its activities to promote gender equality at the meeting of the Group of Commissioners on Equal Opportunities last Wednesday.
We were both there.
This meeting is arranged every year, It is chaired by President Prodi and attended by Members of this Parliament, also the Council presidency, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, Commissioners responsible for the issues on the agenda, the chairpersons of the European Women's Lobby and the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men.
I would stress that the Group of Commissioners has an important role to play in raising the visibility of gender-equality policies and it has been actively promoting gender equality in several areas.
The Commission can claim several successes in this area.
One recent example is the adoption in November 2003 of the proposal for a new directive on discrimination based on sex in the area of access to and supply of goods and services.
Another example is the first report on equality between women and men, requested by Heads of State and Government for the Spring Council, which was adopted by the Commission on 19 February.
This report sets out the challenges ahead, as well as policy orientations for the future, in particular in relation to a new enlarged Europe.
Moreover, it should be noted that in its latest spring report the Commission calls on Heads of State and Government to commit themselves to adopting the new anti-discrimination directive before March 2005 and this proves clearly that gender equality remains a top priority on the agendas of the Council and Commission.
Apart from the modernisation and extension of legislation, the Commission has pursued the promotion of gender equality in the framework of the European employment strategy and of the social policy agenda.
Gender mainstreaming â incorporating gender equality in all policy fields and at all stages of policy-making â has started to be implemented, along with other measures, both in Member States and at EU level.
This is reflected not only in specific objectives and guidelines in the open method of coordination in the areas of employment, social inclusion and social protection, but also in efforts to close gender gaps in education, training and research.
This approach is included in the steering documents on the Structural Funds.
The Commission has also undertaken concrete initiatives to improve the implementation of gender mainstreaming in development and external relations policy.
Furthermore, it applies a proactive staff policy within its own services.
Apart from this, an intensive exchange of views between the European Parliament and the Commission concerning the implementation of gender budgeting has taken place.
Regarding Mrs Karamanou's second question, the current Commission cannot make any commitment on how the new Commission will organise its work and what the main issues of the portfolios will be.
However, the fundamental commitment to promote gender equality in European policies and measures will not change.
Nevertheless, a high-level mechanism dealing horizontally with equality is fundamental, as it ensures high-level leadership.
A top-down approach â which is also necessary â enhances visibility of equality issues and promotes networking.
Specific arrangements regarding the functioning of such a group will have to be decided by the next college.
I would like to warmly thank Mrs GrÃ¶ner, the rapporteur on the Daphne II programme, for her cooperation and the quality of her work on this proposal which is equally important for Parliament and the Commission.
The Commission attaches great importance to the renewal of the Daphne programme, which clearly meets a deeply felt need within the voluntary sector and the general public.
Our aim is to establish a second phase of the Daphne programme for the period 2004-2008, building on the four years' experience gained during the implementation of the current Daphne I programme.
All areas of violence, such as domestic violence, violence in schools and institutions, in the workplace, commercial sexual exploitation, genital mutilation, health impact, gender violence, trafficking â it is sad that there is such a long list of violence against women â remain important and should be the subject of actions.
Organisations responsible for assisting victims are still the best channels for reaching and helping the beneficiaries of these actions.
In addition, training bodies, universities, voluntary associations, research centres and local authorities are also eligible under the programme.
The programme will contribute to the general objective of providing citizens with a high level of protection from violence, including the protection of their physical and mental health within the framework of an area of freedom, security and justice.
It is intended to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, young people and women.
By so doing, the programme will contribute to health and social wellbeing.
The text represents a well-balanced compromise that will enable the Community to resume the combat against violence for another five years with reasonable financial resources.
I would also like to thank Parliament for that and for its swift treatment of this decision.
I am glad to confirm that the five amendments modifying the Council's common position are welcomed by the Commission.
The first four redefine some concepts and clarify the scope of the programme and the fifth amendment requests the establishment of a help-desk to assist organisations in submitting their projects and subsequently in implementing them.
The Commission welcomes this suggestion and is pleased to implement it.
This will certainly be a useful tool to help organisations and may, therefore, increase the quality of the proposals that we receive.
Finally, I turn to the Bastos report on reconciling professional, family and private lives.
I would like to congratulate the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and in particular Mrs Bastos for this comprehensive own-initiative report.
I also take note of the valuable contribution of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its draftsman, MrÂ Schmid.
May I sit down, Mr President?
Â Â  On International Womenâs Day the President cannot refuse any request.
So please take a seat, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Â Â  . I want to continue speaking, it is just that I am not feeling well.
I will try to continue sitting down.
Reconciliation is a key concern at European level in employment and social affairs policies and the issues at stake are the promotion of more and better jobs and ensuring equal rights for men and women.
The European Union tackles reconciliation from many different angles, using several instruments, such as legislation, the open method of coordination between Member States, and financing tools.
There are already a number of directives that facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life: the parental leave directive, the pregnant workers' directive and the directive on equal treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training and working conditions.
Considering that we are on the eve of the biggest enlargement we have ever had, it is essential to concentrate on the effective implementation of the existing directives.
In December 2003 the Commission launched a re-examination of the working-time directive.
The Commission invited comments on the current text of the directive and the need to introduce other initiatives in five areas, including measures to achieve a better reconciliation of work and family life.
The Commission thinks that greater compatibility between the private and professional spheres and equality of opportunity between men and women would improve the overall equality of employment.
Moreover, these measures would also improve productivity by increasing motivation and availability and by opening up greater opportunities for training.
The Commission takes the view that a revision of the working-time directive could encourage the Member States to further improve reconciliation of working and family life.
In addition to legislation, the open method of coordination at European level gives special attention to this issue, in the areas of employment and social inclusion.
The European employment strategy strongly encourages Member States and social partners to develop better means for reconciliation.
I agree with the opinion expressed in Mrs Bastos' report that better reconciliation not only helps women to access employment and remain at work, but also contributes to reducing the pay gap and gender segregation in the labour market.
In the 2003 national action plans, reconciliation is seen by Member States as the prime factor in decreasing gender gaps.
Six Member States set national targets to increase their childcare provisions.
Since 2002, six Member States have changed their leave provisions or have committed themselves to improving them, particularly with a view to increasing fathers' take-up.
In April the Commission will organise a peer review in Sweden, a country where opportunities to combine family and work underpin strong female participation in the labour market and a relatively high birth rate.
Parental benefit is payable for 480 days with 60 days reserved for the father and mother respectively.
Eight countries â five old Member States and two newcomers â will learn from each other about ways of implementing maternity, paternity and parental leave schemes, setting parental benefits and improving access to child care.
The social inclusion process also pays attention to promoting the reconciliation of work and family life in the light of particular problems faced by low-income families.
More recently the Commission published a communication on making work pay, which highlights the importance of appropriate reconciliation not only for women but also for men.
It analyses the limitations faced by women in accessing the labour market and remaining in employment and presents good practice developed in Member States.
The Structural Funds â in particular the Social Fund, which supports the implementation of the employment strategy in Member States, and the Regional Fund â finance measures aimed at reconciling work in family life.
For instance, in Ireland EUR 436 million will be spent over the period 2000-2006 to improve childcare facilities.
Reconciliation was also the priority theme of the gender equality programme in 2002.
Eighteen transnational projects were selected which focus on awareness-raising actions and exchanges of good practice.
Solutions for better reconciliation of work and family life do not lie in one specific measure.
They require the appropriate combination of several instruments and there is a role for everyone to play â the Commission, Member States, social partners, social services and men and women who want to improve the quality of their lives.
I very much welcome Parliament's support in strengthening our activities in this field and making full and better use of the existing instruments.
I now come to the last report, by Mrs MartÃ­nez-Orozco, on women from minority groups, which is of particular importance â as Mrs Karamanou has already mentioned.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, other Members who have contributed to the report, and Mrs Karamanou for her statement.
The European Union has already done a lot to address the problem of multiple discrimination, which is faced by many women living in the European Union, by developing an integrated approach.
This integrated approach is reflected in European anti-discrimination legislation and programmes.
The racial equality and employment framework directives were adopted in 2000 and have now entered into force.
They prohibit discrimination on a variety of grounds, including racial or ethnic origin and disability.
They specifically refer to the problem of multiple discrimination and provide protection for women within minorities, as well as women generally.
The Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member in her report with regard to the delays in implementing these important directives in several Member States.
The Commission has already begun to take action to ensure that all women and men living in the EU can benefit from effective protection against discrimination.
Member States are required by European legislation to establish bodies to tackle racial and sex discrimination and the Commission expects that the work of these bodies will help grassroots efforts to prevent discrimination against women from minority groups and to increase the opportunities open to them.
As honourable Members are aware, the anti-discrimination directives are supplemented by a 100-million-euro Community action programme to combat discrimination.
One of the important objectives of this programme is to tackle discrimination based on multiple factors.
On the issue of the Roma, I share many of the views expressed by the rapporteur.
The Commission has also emphasised on several occasions that the elimination of discrimination against the Roma people must go hand in hand with respect for the fundamental rights of Roma women and girls, including respect from within their own community.
Gender equality is a principle of Community law and a fundamental aspect of the European social model.
The full participation of women from all walks of life in society and the economy brings with it important economic and social benefits.
The Commission reaffirms its commitment to mainstreaming gender equality and disability issues in its programmes and policies.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in my opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I emphasised two factors as being of special importance.
Firstly, there are the wage differences between men and women.
As a result, families often choose, for purely financial reasons, to have the man work the maximum amount of time â that is to say eight hours and perhaps also overtime â and the woman work part-time.
These wage differences, which are not chosen but are, rather, dictated by the wage conditions in the market, must be eliminated if families are to be able freely to choose the pattern of family life that suits them.
The second factor is working hours.
It is becoming ever more usual for both men and women to work eight hours per day and, moreover, to have long commuting times to and from work.
Thus, both parties may, in practice, have working times of nine to ten hours per day.
This pattern entails an intolerable burden, especially for families with children.
It leads to stress, burn-out, people going off sick and problems with family life.
We must therefore â and I am almost the only person who dares say this nowadays â limit the amount of time spent working to, for example, twelve working hours per family per day.
It is therefore crucial that we distribute working time equally between men and women, that is to say six hours for the man and six hours for the woman.
Both where families and workplaces are concerned, that is much better than part-time for women and full-time for men.
The committeeâs proposal includes the demand for equal wages but not, unfortunately, the demand for reduced and equally distributed daily working time.
I therefore wish to repeat this important point: six plus six hours is much better than four plus eight hours.
This is a crucial issue to which attention must be drawn on, in particular, International Womenâs Day.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we must take pleasure in the fact that we have here today the Daphne II programme, which follows on from the previous Daphne I programme and takes up the recommendations made in the assessment report on Daphne I, for which I was rapporteur.
The Daphne programme is aimed at preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach and has contributed to creating greater awareness in the European Union of this extremely serious problem which regrettably affects the whole of society.
The success has been noted of the previous programme, which has allowed us to introduce certain innovations into Daphne II, of which I would emphasise, firstly, the significant budgetary increase: we have risen from EUR 20 million to EUR 50 million, which, although it still seems insufficient, represents considerable progress; secondly, the exchange of good practices and experiences, particularly of preventive measures and help for victims, as well as studies and research; thirdly, the creation of educational instruments in schools, where we must begin to prevent violence and promote equality; finally, the introduction of training programmes for the professionals in question, such as lawyers, police, doctors etc., and also the development and implementation of rehabilitation programmes for aggressors, since sometimes aggressors leave prison and go back to attacking the victim, causing them further harm.
This is an innovation which I believe to be very important for the future.
We must also pay particular attention to prevention for the groups at greatest risk, such as disabled women or women in a special situation because they have been victims of violence previously.
In other words, it is a programme which continues to insist on zero tolerance of violence against children, adolescents and women.
I would also like to refer very briefly to the report presented by Mrs Bastos on reconciling work and family life.
I must congratulate her on her very interesting and very in-depth work, which must form the basis of other work by the Commission, in order to be able to do something which really has an effect on the legislations of the Member States in terms of the reconciliation of work and family life.
We must create conditions which help women to develop their professional lives without creating problems for their families, by means of appropriate modifications in terms of new part-time working contracts, bearing in mind that this must not create problems with social security contributions which may prejudice future benefits, with the creation of nurseries and of day centres for dependent persons, who are also generally the responsibility of women, as well as tax assistance and assistance for families with larger numbers of children.
We must achieve better pay for women who, unfortunately, we know are still being paid less than men for the same work, and we must make progress on the Lisbon objectives so that a greater presence for women in the workplace becomes a reality.
Equal conditions must not mean that women give up on family life, as often happens, or on motherhood and many other responsibilities.
We must bring about a change which leads to greater reconciliation and shared responsibilities with men on an equal footing.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, there are â as you so rightly said earlier â a number of directives already, but their implementation leaves a very great deal to be desired, and I believe that this is where we ought to try harder.
We really cannot tolerate a situation in which we, in this House, work on bringing out new directives only for them to be ignored when transposed by the Member States, so that we end up wondering what we are actually doing all this work for.
Where equality is concerned, it is vital that these directives be implemented.
We are all glad to be able to observe International Womenâs Day today, and it is indeed a day of rejoicing.
In this plenary, we have now spent two hours dealing with the topic of equality policy and that must be of use, but what will tomorrow be like?
Tomorrow, Womenâs Day will be yesterday, and we will go back to what we experience day by day.
Although Mrs Karamanou pointed out earlier that we are this year celebrating 20 years of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, it must also be stressed that here, in this House too, women labour under a double burden.
We are actually represented on three committees because the Committee on Womenâs Rights is not considered important in this House, and it is there that we endeavour to muster all our strength, because it is there that we have to work for recognition and grapple with many difficult issues that are not always welcome in public debate.
The Bastos report on equality and the reconciliation of work and family life certainly presupposes, among other things, equal pay for equal work, which would make it easier to share out paternity and maternity leave, as one or other partner would have a free choice in choosing to spend some of his or her time with the children, while the other would remain at work.
The present situation is that the decision is always taken on the basis of the financial situation, and this generally works out better for men.
What this means is that one of the important principles for which we have been campaigning for a very long time, even though it has its defects, must now at last be put into practice.
If we want to achieve the Lisbon objective, this is another area where we need to devise a rigorous policy for women and families, as a developing economy needs women at work and women who are mobile; above all, it needs women who are willing to have more children if the conditions are right.
What I very much want to re-emphasise is the concept of the family.
What is a family?
That, too, has to be defined.
What counts is not only the traditional image of the family, with father, mother, and child; rather, the term âfamilyâ must include different types of living arrangement, different ways of living together, different concepts of living, and gender mainstreaming should not be confused with family mainstreaming.
There is justification for both of them.
Both are working on different levels towards the same end, that being that society should be served by women and men, and we should all benefit from that in the same way.
Â Â  MrÂ President, gender equality should not be something with which we concern ourselves on just one day per year.
In the twenty-first century, equality should, on the contrary, be a natural part of everyday life in a democracy.
There is a need for more women in leading positions generally, especially in politics.
Talk of genuine democracy is meaningless unless there is also genuine equality.
Our goal in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is to achieve a balanced representation of men and women.
We would therefore call upon our member parties to comply with that objective in connection with the elections to the European Parliament.
Enlargement to include the ten East and Central European countries on 1 May is of historic importance.
At the same time, it gives rise, however, to some concern.
The observers from these countries have done a fine piece of work in Parliament, but I hope that the new elections in June will ensure a more equal distribution of the sexes.
At present, approximately 30% of MEPs are women.
That figure should, as a minimum, be retained at the forthcoming election in June.
In that connection, I wish to send a powerful appeal to all women to use their right to vote on 13Â June.
Increased influence and equality for women will only come about if women themselves are also prepared to assume responsibility.
Of the ten shadow commissioners, as they are called, who have been appointed from 1 May, three are women.
They should be welcomed.
At the same time, I hope that, in connection with the appointment of the forthcoming Commission, the Member States will comply with the proposal from the Convention to the effect that all the Member States must nominate three candidates for the Commission, with representatives from both sexes.
Women play a crucial role in modern, developed democracies.
Gender equality and economic development go hand in hand.
It is worth noting that those societies that have the highest degree of real equality are often also those societies that are most successful in social and economic terms.
If we are to create a strong and competitive Europe, there is a need for women to participate as much as men in the labour market and, it should be noted, with equal wages and the same conditions of employment.
Finally, I wish to express solidarity with all those women around the world who do not enjoy basic human rights and who are victims of persecution, violence, trafficking in human beings and all other forms of threat, discrimination and assault.
We in the ELDR Group shall continue to work towards improving conditions for these women.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is no lack of good ideas, either new or old, when it comes to combating discrimination against women.
There are laws, but there are great deficiencies when it comes to applying them and establishing the priorities.
Earlier today, we had a press conference in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities.
I then heard that the number of people brought into the EU Member States for the purposes of sexual exploitation has now increased from 500Â 000 to 800Â 000.
I wish to express my pleasure at having a discussion of these matters in this House on 8Â March with a Swedish Commissioner.
In 1996, I had the same discussion with MrsÂ Gradin, who then mentioned the figure of 500Â 000.
Since then, we have adopted Community legislation, and the Member States have maintained that they are giving priority to the issue.
While we have been legislating and prioritising, the figure has, then, increased by 300Â 000.
This no doubt shows that it is now the demand side that must be focused upon.
Otherwise, we can increase the appropriations to the Daphne programme for ever and a day, and all to no lasting purpose.
I fully support MrsÂ GrÃ¶nerâs proposal for a European Year Against Violence Against Women in 2006.
I believe it is necessary.
I think that the joint 1999 campaign was a good starting point before the turn of the millennium.
The issue then genuinely came up for discussion in all the Member States.
What is also very commendable is what has been termed a help desk at the Commission.
Many different womenâs organisations have contacted me through the years and said that there is almost no point in applying for funds from the Daphne programme.
The application procedure demands so much work and so much expenditure that it is not even worth trying.
MrsÂ Bastos, I think very highly of your report.
At the same time, I am rather upset about the fact that the organisation of working life is becoming ever more hostile to children.
We say that too few children are being born in the EU and that the EU has an ageing population.
There should be more children, but it is no doubt entirely understandable that young people are not having children now, given the prevailing conditions governing the ability to look after children and bring them up.
We also see how wage differences are not decreasing but increasing, both within one and the same workplace and between the sexes.
Clearly, companies today require unfailing loyalty from their employees.
Obviously, there must be organised care of children and the elderly.
