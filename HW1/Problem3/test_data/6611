Many people spoke of the location.
This is an issue for the Council.
I think the Slovenian Presidency will try to manage the process leading towards a decision.
Names have been mentioned already - some at Member State level.
Some cities at regional level are also aspiring to this.
It is a good signal that there are many ambitious candidates for the seat of the EIT.
There are also many universities and businesses and research and technology organisations which are keen not only on the consultation process, but in participation in the selection of the governing board and then in the work of the EIT.
As Ms Hennicot-Schoepges said, we are not going to lose identity; we offer to share the identity between universities or existing centres and the EIT which is going to be established.
That is more or less all I wanted to add as a response to your points and support.
Once again I want to underline the importance of convergent, horizontal work.
As you did in this Parliament in your committees, we did the same in the Commission.
I was not isolated.
I am not alone.
It was achieved with the support of the President, the industry Commissioner, the research Commissioner, the budget Commissioner and many others.
I think this is a very important message for the future: Let us work together, be open-minded and promote creativity.
This month I want to propose that we declare 2009 the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.
It will link strongly with the proposals, ideas and policies we need to nurture and establish in Europe.
Once again, thank you very much.
It is not a fait accompli; it is, rather, the beginning of the phase which means establishment, and then the real work may start - and I hope it will start successfully.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should remember that when we started, a large majority were against this whole project.
Now we have developed it in collaboration with the Commission and the Council.
Now we have produced something so dynamic that it has progressed to the voting stage, and I hope that a large majority will vote in favour of the project.
This is the way we can work together.
As to location, I have no view except to say that this will be a modern networked system in which researchers and communities will be working independently.
They will not be concentrated in the capital city which is chosen as the Institute's headquarters.
Furthermore, its administrative staff will be relatively small, less than a hundred people, so there will be no need for large premises.
One thing is, however, important.
There need to be good transport links, preferably direct flights, as we know very well indeed how awkward it is to work somewhere where there are no direct flights, with meetings even having to be held at an airport.
Next we need to consider funding.
It is important, although for one proposed theme, communications technology, the funding has already been found.
In other words, if the theme can be made to look attractive, the money will surely be found.
We certainly do not lack the capital.
Many here have said that this is a new kind of collaboration.
The Institute will not be in competition with others, therefore, but will establish cooperation, as Mrs Ek remarked.
Mr Ransdorf and certain others stated that the European model, the high point of European science for centuries gone by, should become the high point of world science.
This is one way to give expression to the sort of quality standards we need.
I wish to thank you all very much for your cooperation.
This project has to succeed, because Europe needs it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) The information and technology revolution, the socio-economic transformation of post-industrial society, has shaken the government, the economy and politicians in most countries of the world from their Sleeping Beauty slumbers, and increasing attention is being given to understanding the reasons behind the success of particular communities, larger regions, or countries.
The things that secure success are creativity, creative energy, new ideas that can form the basis for all new development.
Creativity becomes innovation if it is transformed into reality.
Let us hope that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) will be just such an innovative brainchild of the European Parliament.
The primary objective of the EIT will be to develop the innovative capacity of the European Union by linking higher education, the research community and representatives of industry.
The EIT can play an enormous role in ensuring that European innovation is once again renowned throughout the world and that European industry and researchers are a force to be reckoned with.
Hungary's capital city has also thrown its hat into the ring to provide a home for the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
I am certain that my country would be a good host for the Institute because of the government's commitment to research and innovation/development, because of the country's research infrastructure, because of Hungary's early role in the advancement of science, and not least because of Hungary's hospitality.
Citing the words of Hungarian scholar and Nobel laureate Albert Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi, I call upon you to support our bid to host the EIT: 'Hungary is a small country in terms of its population, but a great power in terms of grey matter.'
Mr President, second reading in the European Parliament is another step that bring us closer to establishing a European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
Much time has passed since JosÃ© Barroso submitted the proposal to set up such an institution back in February 2005.
The idea was that this would be an institution that would support the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, which at that time was at the halfway stage and was not bringing the intended benefits.
I am aware that one of the cities that is hoping to host the headquarters of the EIT is the Polish city of WrocÅaw.
I am also aware that in Poland and in the other cities that would be pleased to welcome the Institute (Vienna, Munich, Sant Cugat-Barcelona, Paris, Oxford, Brussels, Budapest, Nuremberg, Aachen) exaggerated expectations persist because of the anticipated sum of EUR 2.4 billion that will be required to fund this Institute.
This is the total outlay on the Institute and the network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) that are expected to absorb most of the funds.
I am, moreover, convinced that the establishment of the Institute will not be able to assist in bringing about the structural reforms that are of crucial significance for innovation and competitiveness in the European Union.
Nevertheless, knowing WrocÅaw's ambitions and the quality of administration in that city, I am convinced that this is the right place for the EIT and I am satisfied with the progress that has been made towards establishing this institution.
in writing. - Education, research and innovation are windows to the future.
They are the building blocks of what is called the 'knowledge triangle'.
We need to be competitive.
The knowledge triangle is one of the keys.
I support the text, since the Commission proposal to create a European Institute of Technology (EIT) aims to tackle one of Europe's main weaknesses: the lack of innovation.
I see the EIT as an investment for the future.
Before there was some scepticism as to the added value EIT could offer.
The proposed network structure is a good solution.
The expertise lies in the participating universities and higher education institutions.
Remembering my academic years, I also support the idea of the EIT's 'Knowledge and Innovation Communities' (KICs) being autonomous.
Selection of such centres will be based on a criterion of excellence. I support this, because this way the EIT KICs will give the best kicks to European innovation.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.15 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
Verification of credentials
The next item is the verification of credentials of new Members of the European Parliament.
Mr Gargani will be presenting an oral report on the matter, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to the Rules of Procedure the European Parliament must verify the credentials and rule on the validity of the mandate of its newly elected Members.
During its meeting of 25 February, the committee verified the credentials of 35 Romanian MEPs designated by the competent authorities.
To these names should be added three more designated by their respective national authorities.
In view of the large number of verifications to be carried out and the constraints on time, it was considered appropriate for the Committee on Legal Affairs, and therefore its Chairman, to present an oral report to Parliament.
Since the Committee has recorded that everything is in order, Parliament may ratify all the mandates.
The mandates are hereby ratified.

Formal sitting - Estonia
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a wonderful day for the European Parliament, and that is because we are welcoming one of our former fellow Members here - one who is now President of the Republic of Estonia, our former fellow Member Mr Hendrik Ilves!
We would like to bid you a warm welcome to the European Parliament!
(Loud and sustained applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, when we experience an hour such as this, it is good not only to look to the present, but also to remember what a long, broad path it has been for us to acquire a fellow Member together with other fellow Members from Estonia - and from Latvia and Lithuania, if we are just confining it to the Baltic States in the first instance - who were elected Members of parliament and whose countries, free countries that were ruled for decades by totalitarian communism, have been represented here since freedom was gained in Estonia.
This fellow Member was elected by a democratic decision of the people to be President of his country.
He is a figure from Estonia who, more than most, is bound up with Europe's future and, of course, with her present.
Initially as his country's Foreign Minister, he led the negotiations on membership of the European Union and was subsequently an observer at the European Parliament for a year from 2003 until direct elections in 2004 and finally a Member of the European Parliament until his election as President of the Republic of Estonia in September 2006.
President Hendrik Ilves took office as President of Estonia on 9 October 2006.
President Ilves, it is a great joy to be able to welcome you here to the European Parliament, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary tomorrow.
Your visit is, as it were, the start of the celebrations and I should like to ask you now to address the European Parliament.
Once again, we bid you a very warm welcome!
(Applause)
President of the Republic of Estonia. - (ET) My friends, let me start by wishing you a happy birthday.
My dear friends and colleagues, colleagues in the most exact sense of the word, friends whom I have missed for the past year and a half.
As I look up and see you all here - from down here there seem to be so many more of you than looking from seat 131 where I used to sit.
You cannot imagine how formidable you are as the Parliament of Europe.
I know, I had to leave here before I realised it.
But allow me to continue now in my current role as President of my country.
Today, as Estonia is about to enter its fifth year as a member of the European Union, we are no longer 'new members', learning the ropes.
Indeed, I believe it is time now to put aside the term 'new Member State' as an anachronism devoid of meaning.
(Applause)
There are no new or old members today.
There are only members.
The term 'new Member State' does not even mean 'poorer Member State' these days, as several of us have caught up with the 'old members'.
Today, within the Union we have coalitions of interests, of party positions, and these form on any number of dimensions - small or large members, industrial or trading nations, and so on. But the basis is not the time or length of membership.
Here, today, I want to look ahead ten years into the future when all of us are old or older members.
To a time 100 years after the first horrible European civil war of the 20th century.
We talk about our Union as a response to the second European civil war, a way of organising our continent so that there will be no repeat of the horrors of the Second World War.
But we must not lose sight of the fact either that a third, and arguably even more, of the members of today's European Union came into their own as independent political entities out of the ruins of the First World War.
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland (after 140 years of non-existence), the former Czechoslovakia, along with the Hungary and Austria we know today, all emerged in the 20th century with the collapse of empires, those international superpowers, and new states based on self-determination emerged.
I raise this point because my country, like so many of our members today, started out by throwing off the yoke of forced membership of large, despotic or undemocratic supranational entities - otherwise known as empires.
Estonia, like many others, even managed to emerge no less than twice.
Yet today we all have come together to build our own new supranational entity - and a new identity, our European Union.
We have done so not because we have been conquered or occupied, but rather because we are free to do so.
And because we believe it is the right thing to do.
This too is exercising our right of self-determination.
I raise this point because in ten years Estonia will for the first time have the privilege and responsibility of holding the Presidency and I hope very much that, when that time comes, we will no longer be grappling with the issues we are wrestling with today.
It is precisely for this reason that today I want to speak of things that will be important at least ten years hence.
Finally, I am raising these points because our election cycles and the cycle of challenges we face are out of sync: we deal well with the problems that fit into four- or five-year cycles.
But the challenges and pressures facing the European Union today, from energy to the environment, from competitiveness to enlargement, from Common Foreign Policy to migration, are all strategic issues requiring courage and boldness of action over a far longer time-span than two or three sets of elections.
Ladies and gentlemen, while we cannot predict the future, certain trends and dangers can generally be discerned.
There has been no lack of discussion of two of them, twin threats that we face: global warming and declining reserves of fossil fuels.
Yet these two issues are global concerns and their resolution, while certainly impossible without the European Union, must be addressed by the entire globe.
And yet at the same time the Union faces different kinds of serious challenges.
Unless we can meet them, then perhaps in ten years, but certainly in a quarter of a century, we might lose some of the relative wealth and success we enjoy today.
These challenges and pressures are all bound up with the competitiveness of the European Union.
Where are our competitors?
Are they within the European Union or out in the wider world?
Clearly the answer is 'both': we compete on the market both within the European Union as well as worldwide.
But if we look at long-term trends in globalisation we need to be grateful to Jean Monnet and Jacques Delors for creating the internal market at a time when globalisation was not yet a discernible phenomenon.
For it is the internal market that allows individual European nations to maintain their competitiveness in the global arena.
Openness within Europe, opening up to competitive pressures within Europe has been the driver of our competitiveness worldwide.
Current thinking in the European Union does not always provide a reason to be optimistic, and for two reasons: firstly, the lack-lustre implementation of the Lisbon Agenda, our own well-intentioned programme for developing innovation and competitiveness.
(Applause)
And secondly, the European Union's growing protectionism, not only towards the outside world but within our own borders as well.
Allow me to address these two issues in turn.
During the period when my own country had just emerged from 50 years of Soviet-imposed backwardness, I despaired over how long it would take to build the infrastructure needed throughout Estonia.
Yet in some areas, such as information technology, Estonia could start on a level playing field.
Investment by both the public and private sectors in IT allowed the country to reach a level above the European Union average, and by the late 1990s the situation in electronic government services, and services in some sectors such as banking, had attained a level enjoyed only by a few countries in Europe.
The emphasis my country placed on developing IT paid off, allowing us to be more competitive.
But on its own this is not enough.
More generally, Estonia, like the rest of Europe, is leaving innovation in science and development to others.
Innovations come first and foremost, let's be frank, from the United States, which itself depends on draining brains, the brightest and best, from Europe as well as from India and China, to maintain its high level of competitiveness.
We need at long last to begin to tackle this issue seriously.
We are averse to immigration, our children increasingly choose not to study mathematics, science and engineering, and we are choosing to close ourselves off from competition within the European Union in one of the most competitive sectors of the world economy: services.
Competition or the lack of it within the European Union has security implications as well.
Given the importance of energy, it is understandable that many countries in the European Union want to shield their companies from competition and are opposed to the liberalisation of the energy market.
This is an understandable reaction.
But today, Europe's single largest source of energy is a country that has proclaimed itself an 'energy superpower', and states on its Foreign Ministry home page that energy is a tool of foreign policy.
Clearly in the future, if we are to avoid subjecting Europe's members to policies of divide and rule, or the jockeying for better gas deals we already see within the European Union, then we cannot avoid the need for a Common Energy Policy.
(Applause)
With an Energy Commissioner with the negotiating clout of the Trade Commissioner.
But for us to develop a common energy policy as we have a common trade regime, the sine qua non of external policy is also required, namely a liberalised internal market.
So, where are we as we look ahead to the future?
Koreans and Japanese enjoy rates of internet penetration far greater than most Europeans do, with far cheaper charges for broadband streaming; Asia and the US produce (or in the case of the US, also educate and hire from elsewhere) far more engineers and scientists.
This does not augur well.
It will lead to a gradual decline of Europe and European competitiveness in a globalised economy.
Unless, of course, we do something about it.
The first step, for Estonia, is the Reform Treaty and I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its superb work in resolving this issue.
Without expanding Qualified Majority Voting we will founder in paralysis, without a President and a Foreign Minister we will simply punch far below our weight.
An example of Europe punching way below its weight can be seen in our Neighbourhood Policy.
A paper by the European Council on Foreign Relations concludes that, and I quote: 'Contrary to what many in Europe think, Russia's neighbourhood policy is better developed, better coordinated and better implemented than the European Union's.
Russia devotes more political, economic and even military resources to influencing its neighbourhood than the European Union does.'
Unquote.
This does not speak well of our vaunted 'soft power'.
Yet, our neighbourhood policy is tied to a fundamental long-term question: what will we be in ten years' time?
There are two aspects to that question: how large will we be in ten years and what will our surrounding environment be like?
How large will the European Union be in 2018?
We do not know, but it is up to us to decide.
Clearly, we will not be as large as some of us would like, but we will certainly be larger than we are today.
To our East and our South lie countries that certainly will never join.
It seems to me that one of our fundamental concerns should be that differences between the European Union and its neighbours in terms of economic well-being and political freedom must not be so great that we will be faced with a great wave of illegal immigration or political refugees.
It would therefore appear that we have not learned even from our own excellent experience, that is from past enlargement.
We plan to increase assistance to the outside without conditionality on reforms.
Through our development banks we support the development of countries that exhibit thoroughly antagonistic trade policies toward the European Union.
What we also need to realise is that ours is not the only model today.
Francis Fukuyama himself now concedes that the Hegelian dream of the inexorable march of history toward liberal democracy does not hold water.
What good are anti-corruption requirements in World Bank loans to developing countries when sovereign wealth funds offer better deals with no strings attached?
We were wrong when we thought we lived in a de-ideologised world.
Instead, the rise of authoritarian capitalism as an alternative to democratic market economies is probably the latest ideological, intellectual and moral battle that we face.
(Applause)
Clearly we need to rethink our policies, but that will not be enough.
We need more courage; we need a vision and an understanding of where we and the world will be in 20 or 25 years, at a time when even the economic powerhouse that is Germany today will be dwarfed by India and China.
In order to prepare ourselves for a quarter of a century hence, we need to start planning today.
I hope very much that, in the forthcoming European Parliament elections, parties will compete not on the basis of maintaining today's status quo but on their visions for the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, democracy exists for its citizens, based on the will of its citizens and subject to their approval.
To that end we have created institutions, institutions which the new treaty should develop further when it comes into force.
But we should not delegate our responsibility to institutions; creating a foreign service or expanding the purview of qualified majority voting will do little if we do not develop a more fundamental understanding of European interests.
Having common consular officials is a streamlining bureaucratic reform.
Making it more difficult to use a veto is in itself a welcome step for Europe, but will remain a small step if Member States come to believe their interests are not being taken into account.
We need to return to the most fundamental understanding that has made the European Union successful. Namely that national interests are best served when we all give up a little so that the Union as a whole is successful.
I do not mean handing over money, or handing out sweeteners to recalcitrant members reluctant to go along with a policy.
I mean our place in the world separately, as nation states, and together, as the European Union.
When we talk of a strong Europe, we need to realise the same truth familiar to all of us from politics in our home countries: our country is strong in the world arena, or indeed in Europe, when we are strong at home.
Governments that enjoy strong support can afford to be decisive in the international arena.
I am sure this is a problem throughout the European Union.
In order to create a stronger sense of European-ness among our voters, we need to transcend even the Commission proposals which envisage university students spending one year in a university in another Member State.
We need to actively encourage this in our home countries, so that our citizens, not just our officials, can get to know one another.
This means of course that we need to upgrade the level of knowledge of languages.
In ten years' time we should be able to look upon a Union where every university student knows another Member State language, and by this I do not mean English because English has such global dominance in science and commerce, entertainment and the internet that it no longer counts as a foreign language.
I mean for example, Polish-speaking Portuguese, Spanish-speaking Estonians and Slovenian-speaking Swedes.
We also need to think more in terms of regions.
Here Parliament has shown that it can play a larger role than was ever imagined.
I am proud that an initiative I was associated with, the Baltic Sea Strategy, is one of the first European Union policies that was actually born here, right here in the European Parliament, not in the Council or the Commission, and today that initiative is becoming a European Union programme.
(Applause)
Parliament is the very link between the European Union's institutions and its citizens that makes the Union work.
For it is only here that you, my dear colleagues, can find the delicate balance between the interests of your electors and the interests of the Union.
That is something that no other institution can do, and none can do it as well as you.
Honourable Members of the European Parliament, no less important for the citizens of Europe, for a Europe of European citizens, is to know who we are, where we came from and how we got here.
It was within these chambers that a colleague once turned to me during a fellow MEP's speech about the mass deportations in that MEP's country and asked, 'Why can't you people forget about the past and think of the future?'.
We all think we know the history of Europe and so it is perhaps uncomfortable to hear that the Europe we know is actually only one part of Europe, as Norman Davies - that great historian of Europe - has so effectively shown.
Yet today's European Union embraces the history of all of Europe, with all its glory and woes.
We are today the inheritors of Bismarck's social reforms as well as of the Salazar regime.
Of the world's first constitutional democracy as well as repression by brutal internal security services.
That is our Europe.
But the fact that the first constitutional democracy was in Poland and that the repression by security police took place literally just over the wall from the Wirtschaftswunder are things we know far less about than we should.
Our task, ladies and gentlemen, is to know our Europe.
One of the greatest Europeans of the 20th century, Salvador de Madariaga, living in exile from the Franco regime, put it this way: 'This Europe must be born.
And she will be born when Spaniards say "our Chartresâ, when Englishmen say "our Cracowâ, when Italians speak of "our Copenhagenâ and Germans talk of "our Brugesâ....
Then Europe shall live.
For then it shall be that the spirit which leads Europe shall have uttered the words of creation: "Fiat Europaâ'.
So said Salazar de Madariaga.
But to get to Madariaga's future we must learn to know each other, each other's pasts, because only then can we build a future together.
This too is our task for the next ten years.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I have tried to outline some of the challenges we face in the future.
Europe is far from complete, we still have so much to do.
In my homeland, Estonia, when we have a great task to fulfil, a major undertaking to carry out, we say: may we have the strength to do it.
May we all have the strength!
Thank you.
(Standing ovation)
Ladies and gentlemen, by having risen from your seats, by having applauded so enthusiastically, you have thanked the President of Estonia for his highly congenial and, for us as a Parliament, friendly, but above all forward-looking speech.
President Ilves, you have been talking about something that lies at the heart of Europe, and that is an understanding of one another and that we know how we think.
When we know how we think, we know how we can also act together in the end.
When you spoke of the exchange of young people, I remembered - and I believe, ladies and gentlemen, we can be proud of this - that when the Financial Perspective was to be agreed and they wanted to slash the funds for the exchanges of young people, the Erasmus Programme and life-long learning, we raised our voices and said: the Financial Perspective will produce results only if we increase rather than reduce the funds for young people to meet in order to create understanding and a sense of community in the European Union.
(Applause)
Let me say in conclusion - and I do so with some stirring deep down: if the President of Estonia reminds us of history, we have to say that the history of Europe, of our continent, has been good at many points in time, but many periods have also been shaped by tragedy.
What we are doing here today, here in the European Parliament, too, is a response to the experience of history.
The fact that you are conveying this to us is turning today into a great day for the European Parliament.
We can follow the path into the future only if we look back on history, learn from its consequences and then act together on the basis of mutual understanding and community spirit, as you have said, President Ilves, for the sake of a shared Europe.
Many thanks, President Ilves!
(Applause)
Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
(DE) Mr President, I did not understand you at first.
I voted for this report because this new regulation creates a good balance between sensible anti-terrorism measures on the one hand and passenger rights on the other hand.
I should, however, like to focus on a point that has still not been satisfactorily resolved, and that is the rules on the carrying of liquids.
We know that the controls should be used for the prevention of terrorism, but these controls are causing a lot of anger among passengers owing to the individual airports' widely differing interpretations.
Whether or not this is an effective instrument is still unresolved.
I doubt it very much, because terrorists have long been developing other strategies and finding other ways.
I expect that the following assessment will be made: either the control procedures are standardised and improved, or else these measures are stopped, with the aim of not burdening passengers with measures that are in any case not at all effective.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Costa report.
Almost six years have elapsed since Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 was passed.
Two and a half years have elapsed since it entered into force.
Concern for passenger security at airports and on board aircraft continues to be very much a live issue.
Protection of civil aviation is causing a dramatic rise in the cost of flying and a decrease in travel comfort.
The cost of protection is another matter; these costs must be as transparent as possible, and consumers need to know what the money they pay for an air ticket is being spent on and how.
Payments collected for the purposes of protection should be utilised solely and exclusively to cover protection costs.
Money obtained for this purpose must not be used for any other purpose.
(CS) Mr President, I abstained from voting on the proposal for a regulation on common rules because I think it contains some weak points.
The most serious is the method for assessing the reliability of flight crews, which is not regulated in the regulation itself, but will be regulated separately afterwards.
It follows from the approved wording that once in force the implementing regulation will be a classified EU document and the information contained therein will not be publicly accessible.
It could therefore happen that even the people whose duties are covered by the document will not be able to access it.
This would violate the principle of legal certainty.
The same applies to the activity of the Advisory Group, which will be set up by the Commission alongside the Committee.
The Advisory Group will be composed of European organisations directly involved in aviation protection.
It is inappropriate for the Committee to merely inform those concerned without allowing them access to the classified information.
I therefore call for a solution that would respect the principles of openness and transparency.
(DE) The new institute to be set up here seems to me absolutely justified and reasonable as far as its goals are concerned and I therefore support the report and the establishment of this institute.
The European Union - and therefore we - must work very hard to be able to hold our own successfully in technological competition with the other economic areas, but - and I now come to the crucial point - I should like to ask the Commission once again to check the 32 agencies, and this again is one of them, as to their purpose and efficiency, to carry out a sort of health check for agencies and also to shut down agencies that are no longer expedient and not working efficiently in the taxpayers' interest.
I hope - and this is a request to the Commission, which is present this afternoon and has this subject on the agenda - that the Commission will today finally bring itself to have this health check carried out for agencies.
(CS) I welcome the fact that after three years we are launching the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
I am glad that the institute will not be a 'super-university', but will create innovation networks with a view to more extensive application of research in industry and healthcare.
Such connections should also substantially increase investment in science from the business sector.
We will know that we have succeeded once the number of European patents begins to grow and we start to catch up with the US and Japan.
The Institute should be located in a new Member State.
The Czech Republic is the best prepared candidate: it already has a sought-after conference centre for scientists and businessmen.
Charles University is, moreover, a symbol of the common educational roots of the old Europe and the new.
(CS) I voted for the establishment of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
I firmly believe that it will help to improve the Member States' competitive basis by involving partner organisations in integrated activities in the area of innovation, development and research at the highest international level.
I expect that the EIT will become a point of reference for innovation management in that it will promote new forms of collaboration among partner organisations involved in the knowledge triangle of research, universities and the private sector.
I imagine that the EIT will build a worldwide reputation and will offer an attractive environment for the most gifted people from all over the world.
(FI) Mr President, firstly I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, who has done a splendid job.
I voted in favour of this proposal.
Just as when this proposal was made the subject of debate and I had a few opportunities to discuss it with the President of the Commission, I still think it is important that the basic priority is to strengthen the position of existing universities and their opportunities for networking.
Institutes should not be established for their own sake.
It is fundamentally important to ensure that the Institute is a coordinating body and that the appropriations for research are not conducted away from existing universities and research institutes, which have done excellent work.
The new Institute could coordinate European innovation and technology and thereby generate new added value.
The Institute is needed, but as I said, its content must be the core issue, and not how it is organised.
I believe that suitable premises are available in Poland and elsewhere, but the content should not be forgotten.
Mr President, I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world.
In my city, we have a number of innovative universities, so you might think that I would be in favour of this report, but actually I voted against it.
I would just like to explain why.
Thomas Dolby, the lyricist, once sang, 'She blinded me with science'.
The band 2 Unlimited once said, 'Digital revolution, technical solution; for some it only brings more and more confusion'.
Now, whatever the merits of the lyrics, I think that this applies to the thinking behind the EIT.
The Commission is right that Europe is successful in research but lacks innovation.
But how do you get innovation?
You do not arrive at innovation through more structures, more bricks and mortar.
You do not arrive at innovation by duplicating existing effort.
What we see here is the EIT seeking to emulate the success of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States without learning the successful business model behind the MIT.
That is why I voted against.
Mr President, firstly I would just like to put the EIT in a historical context.
The first time I heard of the EIT, we were talking about what we could do with this particular building, as Parliament has two sites and if we were to vacate this site, what would this building in Strasbourg be used for?
The idea was to endow Strasbourg with a world-class university.
Unfortunately, Strasbourg already has a pretty good university, and they did not like that particular idea.
Strasbourg did not like losing this institution.
We have had many debates on this here, even though realistically Parliament should decide on its own seat.
But this idea was born, and we have gone into this massive budget of hundreds of millions of euros which we are now going to spend, duplicating work that already goes on; you do wonder what the point is.
Is Europe grasping for something that it does not need because it already has it?
Does it need this European brand over this expertise?
Are we just going to spend lots of money on bricks and mortar in a place where we could be doing much more coordinated stuff using the fantastic examples of Oxford, Cambridge and the other good universities across the European continent?
(CS) Thank you, Mr President.
Though I do not represent the UK, I supported the release of assistance totalling EUR 162 million following the flooding in the UK, where the damage amounted to EUR 4.6 billion.
I have, however, two reservations.
Firstly, we are making this decision after only nine months.
Secondly, in accordance with the relevant rules there are other European countries that are reaching out for help, such as Greece.
I think that two funds should be set up: one for the needs of the EU and one for other countries in order to avoid a situation where there are no funds left for assistance to poor countries.
Secondly, the rules for drawing on the funds give preference to large-scale disasters.
However, we should also be able to assist the smaller regions.
Solidarity does not differentiate when it comes to size.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to see a revision of the rules.
Mr President, I am delighted that Parliament is going to release EUR 162 million from the European solidarity fund for aid following the flooding disasters last summer in my own region and elsewhere.
Clearly, as we know, this money is for infrastructure projects, for repairing roads, bridges, railways, hospitals and other institutions, but at the same time it will enable the Government in the United Kingdom to release money it would have had to spend on this in other ways.
There are still thousands of people who are living in temporary accommodation and many shops and factories are closed.
So I am delighted that money from the European Union's solidarity fund has been released and hopefully that the people of Gloucestershire and elsewhere will benefit from this.
I intend to make an explanation of vote in writing, on behalf of the people of Yorkshire and the Humber, in the same vein as Mr Ford has just spoken.
(CS) I supported the creation of the budget item for the Galileo Programme - expenditure on administrative management, as provided for in the Commission's revised proposal.
I also supported the amendment which in the context of the Galileo budget reshuffles an amount of EUR 2 million from an operational line to a line of administrative nature.
This is to finance actions such as the definition and follow-up of risk management scheme, the definition of Intellectual Property Rights policy, but also innovative navigation markets. I strongly support this.
What concerns me, however, is that on 29 January the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted with a large majority eight amendments suppressing the Galileo Supervisory Authority from the legal basis of the amended proposal on the Galileo and EGNOS programmes.
I would like a serious debate to be held on this topic in plenary.
(PL) Mr President, I shall be very brief with regard to this report.
I voted in favour of it because, regardless of its size, every state is powerless in the face of vis maior.
Funding of extraordinary expenditure at a time when an extraordinary situation is announced helps a state to repair the damage brought about by atmospheric conditions or a natural disaster.
That is obvious.
Mr President, in this report we do have reference to the mobilisation of the EU solidarity fund, which we talked about slightly earlier.
And part of my region did benefit, or will benefit, from that money, especially in North Lincolnshire, where we suffered huge flooding.
But I do wonder whether the people of Lincolnshire would view this as a good use of money.
We now pay so much money to the European Union and we then have to beg for money back when we have a need ourselves.
For every GBP 2 we get back, we have put GBP 5 into this pot in the first place.
I do wonder whether we could spend that money better.
I also have some major concerns, as I have stated before in explanations of vote, about how we do these draft amending budgets.
Huge sums of money are transferred between different budget lines and very, very few people have oversight over this.
Today, we are just transferring a couple of million euros here for Galileo and a couple of million euros there, but in the past it has been hundreds of millions of euros.
I do wonder whether that is the right parliamentary process to give us oversight over European taxpayers' money.
Mr President, I constantly and always vote against fisheries agreements made by this House and the Commission for, I believe, a good reason.
I will quote a little from the reports.
The Commission's assessment for Guinea-Bissau found that it helped the viability of the Community's trawler and tuna industries in the Atlantic Ocean, and offered Community vessels and industries that depend upon them a stable legal environment and medium-term visibility, but actually just had, it says, 'a major impact' on Guinea-Bissau's budgetary and political stability.
It does not matter where we are conducting these fisheries agreements, we are, essentially, stealing fish from those who could catch them locally, sell them locally, make money locally and therefore raise themselves from poverty.
We create a solution where we actually pay for European fishermen to go and fish these waters mechanically, lift tons of fish and therefore ruin the fishing economies of these coastal countries.
The Ivory Coast document talks about the amount of money that we are spending on doing this.
We are talking about nearly EUR 600 000 which we give to EU vessels to catch more than 7 000 t of tuna.
If you speak to your average Spaniard and ask them how many people are entering their country from the Ivory Coast - because the fishing boats that used to land fish in Spain now actually transport hundreds, if not thousands, of illegal immigrants to the Canary Islands and elsewhere - you will see that we are actually making a bigger problem for ourselves and not creating a market-based solution, which we could do if we allowed those countries who have fishing rights to fish themselves and boost their own economies.
Mr President, nothing would bring me more joy than to speak on sustainable European transport.
The reason I abstained on this report is that, whilst it contains a decent amount of reasonable European policy, I do wonder if it is not best left to market solutions within individual Member States as to how we can sort out traffic problems in London.
I find it hard to believe that Europe-wide cooperation and a coordination strategy will solve the problems of parking in Nottingham or in Leicester.
Yes, swapping best practice might, but we are talking about putting lots of money into a pot where we are now going to have committees that meet at Commission and Council level to try and think of policy.
I think all these policies are best determined locally.
Therefore I abstained on the whole report.
(PPE-DE). - (DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report because I believe firstly that it is a good one and secondly that it points in the right direction.
The transport sector must acknowledge its overall responsibility, particularly with regard to environmental targets, but also with regard to reaching the Lisbon target.
I am particularly pleased that Amendment 5, which demands that the European Union finally ratify, and not merely sign, the Alpine Convention, has gone through.
It is also pleasing that Amendment 1 was rejected and the original text retained, i.e. that we should begin internalising the external costs for road traffic.
It is, however, a shame that Amendment 7 was rejected.
This would have meant that the Seventh Research Programme would have had to be better integrated and geared towards transport.
Finally, I should also like to advise my fellow Members from the United Kingdom who rail so much against the Union to read the texts, therefore, with a little more care, because a great deal therein is worded in the subjunctive.
These are discretionary clauses and whether or not such a large country as the United Kingdom introduces these measures is within that nation's discretion.
(CS) The debate last night did not reassure me that the European Commission and the Member States are prepared in the foreseeable future to allocate funds to improving the quality of transport infrastructure in the new Member States.
The Commissioner was quite right to refer to this need for modal changes at the end of yesterday's debate.
I would like to ask the Commission to present realistic plans for the development of the motorway and railway infrastructure in the new Member States.
Without that, we cannot realistically discuss the sustainable transport strategy, at least not from an environmentally-friendly perspective.
I also supported the 'Eurovignette' amendment; its review must not detract from the sustainable transport strategy.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the consultation procedure report by my German colleague Mr BÃ¶ge, which supports the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2003/77/EC laying down multiannual financial guidelines for managing the assets of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in liquidation since 2002 and, on completion of the liquidation, the Assets of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel.
It was right to take account of changing markets and financial products when bringing the possibility of managing this capital up to date, while maintaining a high degree of security and long-term stability.
in writing. - (DE) It may indeed be quite sensible to look for new technologies supported at Community level and financially, by which CO2 emissions from steel production can be reduced.
As a result of rising demand in emergent countries and several natural disasters that have made reduction impossible, there have been constant shortages of this raw material, reflected in record prices for coal and steel.
It is now high time we finally started looking for alternatives to coal resources, which are beginning to run out.
It is also highly debatable how former consortiums such as the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and Euratom, which were fully absorbed into the EU a long time ago, can still have their own funds, programmes, etc., particularly in the context of Member States opposed to nuclear power, for instance, still constantly having to finance their research etc. We should finally get around to giving this some thought.
in writing. - (PL) I agree with the proposal to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements.
Where fares and rates for air services are concerned, the rapporteur, Paolo Costa, is right to introduce a clause which prohibits third country carriers from being price leaders on air services for carriage wholly within the Community.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my British colleague Mr Parish on the amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products, which had been adopted on the basis of the situation at 31 December 2006.
Having brought the 21 regulations applicable to the common organisation of agricultural markets together in a single all-encompassing regulation in order to rationalise and simplify the legal framework of market policies such as intervention, private storage, import tariff quotas, export refunds, safeguard measures, state aid and competition rules, and the communication and reporting of data, it became necessary to update this text to take account of decisions taken since 2006 in the sugar, fruit and vegetables, processed fruit and vegetables, seeds, beef and milk and milk products sectors.
in writing. - (SV) We are opposed to the current common agricultural policy and object to changes of little fundamental significance to the existing system.
We demand a comprehensive review and reappraisal of the entire common agricultural policy.
These two reports maintain the existing structures of the common agricultural policy.
Hence we cannot support them.
The entire common agricultural policy is an absurd contrivance and must be abolished.
in writing. - I welcome Mr. Parish's report establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products.
The proposals to provide a set of harmonised rules in various areas of the industry, such as private storage, import tariff quotas and safeguard measures are a positive move to clarify European agricultural policy.
The increase in transparency and simplification of regulation within this sector is much needed and will directly benefit Scottish farmers.
I therefore voted in the favour of the report.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my British colleague Mr Parish on the amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for the flax and hemp sector.
The European Commission, which is to submit a report currently being written on prolonging aid for the production of short flax fibre and hemp fibre, set to end from the marketing year 2008/2009, is proposing to prolong this aid while awaiting the policy reviews to be undertaken in 2008 under the health check of the common agricultural policy.
I support this proposal, which is very sensible.
in writing. - The proposal to prolong the subsidy of flax and hemp is a procedural necessity to allow for adequate reflection and potential reform under the CAP Health Check.
It is for this reason that I support the report's recommendations and voted accordingly.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community.
I was particularly interested to read my colleague's report.
I am in favour of accepting of the report because I think that Community law should be clearer and more comprehensible, and thus more transparent and accessible to each citizen.
The aim of the application is to codify Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community.
As a lawyer I wish, in the explanation of my vote, to stress the value of codification, which is a very important process of singularly combining a large set of legal regulations in a single, systematised collection from which fundamental legal norms may be interpreted.
I attach considerable significance to the simplification and ordering of Community law.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member Mr Costa on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002, adopted the day after the attacks on 11 September 2001 in the United States of America, which had to be reviewed in the light of its application.
Fortunately a compromise has been found on the financing of the security measures, which will be shared between the Member States and airport authorities, airlines and passengers.
I am pleased that the European Parliament succeeded in convincing the Council and the Commission to use the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for a whole series of measures when defining the common basic standards for aviation security, such as the screening of passengers, and articles that may be prohibited, such as liquids.
This regulation provides for 'a greater degree of harmonisation' of common rules in the field of civil aviation security at EU level - such as, for example, on the screening of passengers and cabin baggage, access control and aircraft security checks - repealing the 2002 regulation adopted as a result of the events of 11 September 2001 in the USA.
Among the aspects we criticised was that there was no guarantee - quite the reverse - that the costs of providing security measures would not be passed on to the users of these services, which are clearly public services.
Nor is there even any guarantee that users will not be faced with a surcharge to cover those measures.
Moreover, there is no clarification about the removal of a whole set of security measures which have already been widely criticised, in particular as to whether they are actually effective.
It is also striking that, in relation to workers, limiting access to 'airside' for security reasons has been used to restrict workers' freedom to form a trade union.
The current text offers no guarantee that such abuse would be prevented or such rights protected.
Finally, the regulation clearly opens the door to the presence of armed personnel on flights, a measure which we consider to be mistaken, even for reasons of security.
in writing. - (PL) In spite of everything, I voted in favour of this report.
I would like to give a few words of explanation.
As they say, a makeshift solution lasts the longest.
We have had a year now to become convinced of the truth of this utterance.
When the ban on taking drinks and other liquid items on board aircraft was introduced, we were assured that it was only a transitory requirement.
There was shortly to be a review of procedures, and in fact special equipment was to be installed, in the form of detectors that would be able to discover hazardous substances.
None of this followed.
What of passengers, meanwhile?
Passengers just got used to these inconveniences... they treat them as if they have always existed and are essential.
Note that this is exactly how our freedoms and rights are gradually and almost imperceptibly restricted - in other areas, too; not only in civil aviation.
Praise is, however, due to Parliament, and especially to Parliament's representatives on the Conciliation Committee, who tenaciously defended these principles.
Admittedly, their success was not unalloyed, but it is worth emphasising what was achieved.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the new air safety regulation, which creates greater safety in air traffic.
I am strongly advocating a joint vote on the standards and regulations at European level, since only efficient, rapid adaptation of the new directives will protect the safety of air passengers as well as their rights.
I very much welcome the possible use of accompanying safety officials, the 'sky-marshals', particularly based on the current threat from international terrorism on potentially vulnerable flight paths.
Furthermore, I support the safety regulations that allow weapons to be carried only in the hold and only in exceptional cases with consent issued by the state at the time.
With regard to the contentious issue of funding, I support the compromise that every Member State should make its own decision on this, in which the costs of the security measures are to be borne by the airport facilities, airlines and the users themselves.
It has been clarified, however, that costs should apply directly to the provision of security and only the actual costs should be covered.
The Commission is also being urged to submit a report by the end of the year on the financing of costs, together with a legislative proposal, if appropriate.
in writing. - Speaking as a representative of a country that was a recent victim of terrorism, Mr Costa's report on common rules in the field of civil aviation security is one that I welcome.
Civil aviation security is something that concerns all Member States and therefore requires common basic standards across the EU.
Regarding the funding of improvements to security measures, I feel an adequate compromise has been reached that allows sufficient scope for Member States and users to share the cost.
Flexible financing rules will not only take account of the need to implement basic measures across Europe, but will allow those airports deemed to be at greatest risk from terrorist activity to take further steps to counter the threat.
I further welcome the proposal to reduce the frequency of re-screening for passengers arriving from third countries with equivalent safety standards to the EU.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (EL) I refused to vote in favour of the final conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council, because I oppose the measure of in-flight armed guards, given the high-level additional checks to which passengers are subjected on the ground before boarding.
I consider this measure excessive: it sacrifices passenger rights in the name of flight safety; it does not serve the principle of proportionality, and will ultimately place a financial burden on citizens - in other words, passengers.
We call upon the governments of the Member States, and especially the Greek Government, not to proceed with this measure, and to make use of the scope already available to them.
in writing. - (PT) Civil aviation security has faced real, deadly and unprecedented challenges in recent years.
Every effort has been made to provide an appropriate response to the threats made against the lives of passengers and flight crews and yet we find that the rules established still cannot keep pace with the creativity of criminals.
We cannot therefore delay further or spend any more time on debates based on taking a false sense of security for granted.
The legislation we are voting on today is merely part of the legislative action that the Union has been developing in order to ensure that its citizens have greater and more evident security.
In the field of aviation security it is therefore essential that we equip ourselves with flexible instruments that make it possible to create an atmosphere of maximum protection for citizens, and that can be easily and adequately evaluated.
I shall therefore vote in favour of the agreement which this Parliament reached in conciliation, which will guarantee protection for citizens, security in civil aviation and constant surveillance against those who threaten our security, democratic institutions and the rule of law.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Costa on the text on common rules in the field of civil aviation security, repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002.
In fact, I believe it is of prime importance to create a simpler and more flexible legislative framework that enhances freedom and decision-making power in the implementation phase of laws, compared with previous measures that were too detailed.
However, I believe it is right to make a few fine distinctions, in particular on linking airport charges to the cost of the services offered.
In this context, I would make a point of asking the Commission to take an initiative as soon as possible on the financing of security measures at European airports, and the transparency of security costs, in order to address possible distortion of competition in this field.
in writing. - I will be voting in favour of the compromise agreement reached in conciliation despite having reservations, not only about the financing of this legislation, but also at the attitude of the Council of Ministers during this whole procedure.
Firstly, the point has to be made that governments believe that they can introduce enhanced security measures in civil aviation and expect the industry and subsequently the passengers to pay for it.
My view, and indeed it was the view of Parliament, is that if Member States insist on enhanced security measures, they should at least contribute towards the costs.
Secondly, my understanding of conciliation is where two parties compromise their views in order to reach an agreement.
On this dossier the Council not only failed to even consider compromise or indeed conciliation, but arrogantly set about accusing Parliament of putting passenger security at risk.
This is frankly unacceptable and leaves a bitter legacy for us all to remember for future conciliations.
In the end I feel I am being blackmailed by the Council in voting for this agreement so we can at least have enhanced security measures in place to protect the public.
But my vote comes reluctantly and with anger.
in writing. - (FR) I am pleased about the adoption at second reading and on the basis of the report by my Finnish fellow Member Mr Paasilinna on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, the idea for which was launched by the President of the European Commission, JosÃ©-Manuel Barroso, in February 2005, and which has aroused a certain amount of scepticism as regards the added value such a facility can provide.
As much as I share the points of view and concerns over financing a project of this kind, I do consider it essential to develop a facility like this to put knowledge at the heart of the European ideal, because it is through the development of knowledge and not the culture of ignorance that our humanistic European civilisation will progress.
I should mention, in passing, the increasing inappropriateness of our budgetary structure within the European Union, particularly for financing large projects such as this (or Galileo, for example).
Finally, I cannot understand why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled an amendment, which my political group and I voted against, to reject and therefore delay the implementation of the common position.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and support the report by my colleague Mr Paasilinna, which aims to contribute to the EU's economic growth and competitiveness by developing new forms of innovation through the creation of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).
The objective of the EIT is to support the key element of competitive capability: 'Knowledge'.
Knowledge cannot, by definition, be a static concept, so it can only exist through a dynamic, structured process of research and new discoveries.
The real progress is made only through innovation.
Today, in a global market of old and new 'knowledge economies', competitors such as the United States, India and Japan are at work, countries that have always made innovation the cornerstone of their economic development, and have consequently enjoyed a strong competitive advantage over the EU.
The EIT will serve to strengthen the exchange of knowledge, to bring together, exchange and circulate ideas, and to collect together research from all over Europe in macro-areas that are essential for developing the future competitiveness of the EU.
The potential benefits for the competitive system of our market are almost unlimited.
It will be up to us to ensure the EUR 2.4 billion of funds committed are used properly and that the European Union can address future challenges arising from the global market more vigorously.
in writing. - (PT) As we already mentioned at first reading, we are very critical about establishing the European Institute of Technology especially because of the view taken by various research organisations.
In line with the positions held by scientific organisations that criticised this proposal on the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, we voted in favour of the proposal rejecting the Council common position, but unfortunately that proposal was rejected.
In the first place there is not sufficient funding.
One of the options for funding is the Community budget, including appropriations intended for research, which may end up being just another way of supporting the more developed countries, thus exacerbating inequalities.
Following pressure from various countries that wanted to host the Institute, this became virtual, a type of gateway for consulting scientific communities in different areas.
The European Parliament adopted several amendments to the Commission proposal, but in our opinion these are insufficient to straighten out something that was born crooked.
in writing. - (PL) I entirely support the report by my colleague Mr Paasilinna.
I am convinced that this institution is very much needed by the European Union and its Member States.
It is attracting interest not only from European researchers and groups of scientists in individual states, but also from practical people - chiefly business people.
I feel that the Institute should fulfil a mobilising function for the whole of the EU, and consequently its component parts should not leave out any Member State.
It has a particular role to play in levelling out opportunities and uniting EU economies in the new Member States.
Only by combining the research potential and efforts of scientists from the 'old' and the 'new' Europe will we find ourselves in a position to even out existing disproportions and move ahead while implementing the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
With this in mind, I would like to appeal most earnestly for the headquarters of the Institute (the Governing Board) to be located in my country, Poland - in WrocÅaw.
This is a city located where the cultures of the old and the new Europe meet, lying in close proximity to three other Member States: Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic; it has a fine scientific and research support platform, numerous higher education institutions and an enormous, nearly 200 000-strong, population of students.
I have no doubt that WrocÅaw is the best place to site the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
in writing. - Mr Paasilinna's report 'Establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology' is an important contribution to achieving the goals set out by the Lisbon Strategy.
The concept of bringing together expertise from the private sector, research organisations and higher education institutions is a good one and an interesting pilot project.
We must also ensure that the Governing board of the EIT is selected transparently to preserve the integrity of its work.
Parliament and the Council should play a role in ensuring that transparency is upheld as well as assuring that the EIT is accountable and that the autonomy of the Knowledge and Innovation Communities involved is respected.
I support this report.
in writing. - (PT) In view of the agreement reached between the Council and Parliament, to which the European Commission raised no objections, I think that the adoption today at second reading of the recommendation for adopting a regulation establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology marks a particularly important moment, since it effectively symbolises the birth of this important project.
It is some years since the European Union identified Innovation and Knowledge as central aspects for meeting the challenges of globalisation and the emergence of new major economic actors.
In that context, specific support for research and development as an economic weapon is an initiative which deserves the greatest possible backing - and this lies at the core of the project.
As to whether it would be better to have a real campus or the adopted solution of Communities, only time will tell which should have prevailed.
In any event it is important - essential even - to have flexibility and the permanent ability to adapt the model to the best solutions.
Otherwise the mentor of innovation would not have the capacity to innovate, which would be an unforgivable mistake when the intention is to build models of efficiency.
I initially wanted to support the proposal for a European Institute of Technology, as it fills the existing gap between higher education, research and innovation, which is important as regards the economy and the internal market.
The EIT would seem a splendid project, therefore - if it were not for the inadequate financial arrangements.
Consequently, I cannot support the current proposal or the Council common position, mainly because the budget is inadequate.
The Commission had proposed a reasonable sum capable of providing for the needs of the KICs (Knowledge and Innovation Communities) for six years.
The Council has reduced the budget to such an extent that this is no longer possible.
Yet an EIT impact assessment showed that sound basic financing was an essential factor for achieving success.
As the proposal stands, KICs are forced to seek external financing from other Community programmes, which are moreover not intended for this purpose.
Therefore, Member States will have to take responsibility for providing the financing themselves, as if we can simply rely on private sponsoring.
This proposal would mean that the project was doomed to failure.
Finally, the fact that climate change as the focus of the first KICs has been explicitly removed from the proposal means that I no longer wish to support the report.
in writing. - We are obviously in favour of Britain receiving money from the European Union as a contribution to the cost of floods last year.
We therefore support this motion.
However, we take this opportunity to place on record that we do not favour this arrangement under which Britain must apply to the European Union for assistance.
The UK is a large net contributor to the EU budget.
Rather than having to plead for a small amount to be returned to us, we should prefer to retain our funds and decide for ourselves how they are spent.
in writing. - I am delighted that the European Parliament has approved the award of EUR 170m of flood aid from the EU Solidarity Fund to help towards the clean-up operations after the floods in my country, and especially in my region, last summer.
The floods affected hundreds of homes and businesses and caused misery to thousands of people.
The fact that this is the second largest payment ever from the EU Solidarity Fund is indicative of the huge financial and personal cost paid by the victims.
This money will hopefully go some way towards covering those costs.
As MEP for one of the regions most affected, I can say that every contribution is welcome.
This gesture of solidarity from the rest of Europe will be most welcome in my constituency.
in writing. - (PT) The text adopted today approves the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in favour of the United Kingdom following the flooding there in the summer of 2007.
Since the damage declared was above the threshold for activating this mechanism with regard to the United Kingdom, approximately EUR 4 612 000 000, the consequences of the floods were classified as a 'major disaster' and the Commission proposed mobilising the Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 162 387 985.
The opinion of the EP's Committee on Regional Development presses the Council to reach agreement on the Commission's proposed revision of the regulation establishing this Fund, which it has failed to do since the EP adopted its position at first reading on 18 May 2006, with a critical vote from us, moreover.
In our opinion, among other things, the EP's position does not safeguard the eligibility of regional disasters nor does it even allow for recognition of the specific nature of Mediterranean natural disasters or the adaptation of this Fund - as regards time limits and eligible actions - to the specific nature of natural disasters, such as drought and fire.
These are aspects which should be safeguarded.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the Solidarity Fund is the quintessence of the principle of solidarity, which is one of the cornerstones of the European Community.
The criteria for its deployment have been refined through many years of practice, and this has done away with the discretionary nature of its management, which was apparent at least in the first attempts to get the Anti-Globalisation Fund up and running, this being a new European Union budget institution established under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
One major drawback, strongly emphasised in the case of the Solidarity Fund, was the long waiting time for this instrument to be brought into play, highlighted by applicant countries affected by a natural disaster.
Paradoxically, the EU was able to respond more quickly to third countries' requests for aid than to those lodged by its own Member States.
The proposal to mobilise the Fund to help Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which were afflicted by flooding in June and July 2007, meets all the formal requirements.
It is worth recognising the reaction of the Committee on Regional Development, which sped up Parliament's procedures.
Meanwhile, it is difficult to interpret the delay on the part of the European Commission.
Its conclusion of 18 January 2008 appeared six months after the natural disaster and the United Kingdom's prompt application.
This chimes with the bad tradition of delayed administration of the Solidarity Fund and demands an upgrade of the executive provisions, which Parliament has been calling for since 18 May 2006.
in writing. - Following the devastating floods experienced in Britain last year, I would like to salute Mr BÃ¶ge's work on the Mobilisation of the European Union's Solidarity Fund report.
The money proposed will benefit all those affected, including businesses.
I therefore welcomed the report's recommendations.
in writing. - (DE) In the wake of natural disasters and the like, temporary accommodation must be provided quickly and makeshift repairs made to essential infrastructure such as, for example, power supply lines, roads, bridges and so on, so that hospitals can start running again, and the Solidarity Fund can be a great help here.
What cannot be paid for, however, are the thousands of hours of unpaid work carried out by the relief units.
Nor can the suffering of those affected be compensated.
A sensible balance must be preserved in the Solidarity Fund between disbursing funds rapidly and unbureaucratically and ensuring that these are not used for purposes other than those intended.
Prevention and better intergovernmental cooperation are particularly important for preparing for future natural disasters.
Under no circumstances, therefore, should these events be used to construct an EU civil defence agency or an EU rapid reaction force for disasters, since the latter would not be in a position to provide effective protection against natural disasters, but would simply inflate costs and increase bureaucracy.
in writing. - (SV) I am voting against this report since it involves an increase in the EU budget.
Payments to Britain for the floods in 2007 should be found within the existing budget since there is scope for re-prioritisation, for example by not increasing the budget for Galileo.
in writing. - (SV) Past experience shows that the EU does not manage disaster assistance well.
Junilistan thinks that disbursement from the fund can often reduce incentives to Member States to remedy the problems which lie behind the need for aid.
As regards the introduction of a budget item for expenditure in exceptional circumstances, Junilistan considers that this paper contrivance reinforces the impression that the EU is seeking to become a superpower with influence over everything that happens in the world.
Junilistan objects to this.
Frontex takes a step too far when it comes to coordinating the border controls and immigration policies of the Member States.
Junilistan is opposed to any expansion in its activity at all.
As I cannot support the draft amending budget for the above reasons, I have decided to vote against the report in its entirety.
in writing. - (PT) The first amendment to the Community Budget for 2008 includes mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of approximately EUR 162.4 million in favour of the United Kingdom - having regard to the floods there in 2007 - as well as the introduction of new budget lines and transfers between budget lines, not affecting the total amounts of the overall budget.
The establishment plan of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) is increased by 25 posts, from 69 to 94, having regard to the budgetary increase already made for that Agency - approximately EUR 30 million - approved during the debate on the 2008 Community budget.
That Agency's action is gradually being consolidated and it is being given competences that lie at the heart of State sovereignty.
It is an Agency which, amongst other examples, lends support to 'Fortress Europe' and immigration policy with the accent on security promoted by the EU.
The creation of a new heading 'Exceptional crisis expenditure' also needs to be highlighted, although it is not clear what should be understood by 'crisis'.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the first amending budget during implementation of the budget plan for 2008 covers the items grouped under the common heading of adjustments for 'unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances'.
Point 1, to wit mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the benefit of Great Britain, which was affected by major storm and flood damage in the summer of last year, most definitely falls under this category.
The only comment to be made is that delays in mobilising funds arising from a belated application by the European Commission are becoming a dishonourable tradition.
Point 5, proposing the creation of the budget article 27 01 11: Exceptional crisis expenditure, to enable the financing of exceptional expenditure linked to a declared crisis, is of a similar nature.
The three remaining items, however, which have been dumped in the common bag of the amending budget, are of a different nature.
I share the rapporteur's doubts concerning the financing of the Research Executive Agency and the ERCEA, and also the not wholly coherent conclusion on the creation of budget item 06 01 04 12: Galileo Programme.
The Frontex modified establishment plan deserves to be accepted.
Analysis of the whole conclusion and relating to it in a suitable way are rendered problematic by the heterogeneous nature of the budget items contained in AM 1/2008.
in writing. - (SV) Past experience shows that the EU does not manage disaster assistance well.
Junilistan thinks that grants from the fund can often reduce incentives to Member States to remedy the problems which lie behind the need for aid.
As regards the introduction of a budget item for expenditure in exceptional circumstances, Junilistan considers that this paper contrivance increases the impression that the EU is seeking to become a superpower with influence over everything that happens in the world.
Junilistan objects to this.
Frontex takes a step too far when it comes to coordinating the border controls and immigration policies of the Member States.
Junilistan is opposed to any expansion in its activity at all.
However, the report also states that resources should not for the present be moved from the operational to the administrative line of the Galileo allocation.
Added to this, the report supports the creation of a budgetary structure for the Research Executive Agency and the European Research Council Executive Agency.
I think that these questions are of considerable importance and have therefore voted for the report in its entirety, despite objections in principle to the other amendments proposed by the report.
in writing. - In KyÃ¶sti Virrankoski's report 'Amending budget No1/2008' regarding the Solidarity Fund, we can see that the EU is prepared to put fresh money into the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in the UK.
I hope this is something that we will look to do for other Member States that are victims of natural disasters, such as Greece.
I voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - (RO) As a deputy elected in Romania, I praise the approval of the European Parliament's draft resolution on the European Union Draft Amending Budget no. 1/2008.
This budget amendment is relevant with respect to the amendment of the personnel chart of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX).
Romania represents the eastern outpost of the European Union and is the state in charge of the management of one of the widest external land borders of the Union.
In this capacity Romania must always support the enhancement of cooperation for better management of the borders and providing FRONTEX with sufficient means to carry out its activity, under the best conditions, be it financial means, personnel or equipment.
The drafting of the article "exceptional expenses in case of crisisâ is also much appreciated: we can never be too prepared for such undesired events.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote for the agreement because, unfortunately, the country is now so economically dependent on the fisheries agreement with the EU.
If the EU partnership agreement were to be terminated with immediate effect, that would have serious consequences for the country's economy.
We take scientific reports showing that the seas are being fished out very seriously indeed.
Hence we do not see EU fisheries agreements as a viable means, in the long term, of combating poverty and supporting development.
We want to change the EU's fisheries policy so that it leads to a recovery in fish stocks.
We also want to support sustainable development in those countries for which current fisheries agreements with the EU are a major source of income by making changes to the EU's trade and aid policy and through various forms of partnership.
The vessel owners should be accountable for the costs arising under the agreements from which they themselves draw benefit, and we want to see continued change in that direction.
Hence we voted in favour of Amendment 8, although that change should take place in a wider context.
Guinea-Bissau is one of Africa's poorest countries.
We want to stress how important it is that the EU find other, longer-term and more sustainable ways of supporting Guinea-Bissau, since the fisheries agreement with the EU currently accounts for 30% of the country's GNP.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Capoulas Santos on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau as I think it is a balanced agreement ensuring the sustainability of fisheries and also the protection of the interests of both parties: the European Union and Guinea-Bissau.
I regard the amendments tabled by the rapporteur as an important contribution to the strengthening of the EU's fisheries policy, insofar as they highlight the importance of enhancing Parliament's role and the information supplied to it.
The Agreement between the EC and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for the period from June 2007 to June 2011, provides for the granting of 37 fishing licences, four of them for Portugal.
A total of 35% of the EC financial contribution is allocated to the support of initiatives taken in the context of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by Guinea-Bissau.
The emphasis is placed upon improving the health and hygiene conditions of fishery products and the monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing activities.
That is a particularly important area for action, bearing in mind that, according to international bodies, fishery resources in that country have been noticeably affected due, amongst other things, to illegal, unregulated fishing.
The agreement also provides for the compulsory employment of local seamen, that is from Guinea-Bissau, in accordance with the vessel's gross tonnage.
As in other agreements, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration will apply to those seamen.
Article 10 of the agreement also provides for the setting up of joint ventures between Community operators and Guinea-Bissau operators with a view to the joint exploitation of the resources.
That possibility is advantageous for Community vessels insofar as they will thus be exempt from the payment of licence fees.
in writing. - (SV) If the EU partnership agreement were to be terminated with immediate effect, that would have serious consequences for several developing countries and for the many people affected.
We cannot therefore simply say 'no' to the agreements which the EU has with other countries on fishing.
However, we take scientific reports showing that the seas are being fished out very seriously indeed.
We therefore want to change the EU's fisheries policy so that it will lead to a recovery in fishing stocks.
This must form part of a major review.
We do not see EU fisheries agreements as a viable means, in the long term, of combating poverty and supporting development.
We therefore want to support sustainable development in those countries for which current fisheries agreements with the EU are a major source of income by making changes to the EU's trade and aid policy and through various forms of partnership.
The vessel owners should be accountable for the costs arising under the agreements from which they themselves draw benefit, and we want to see continued change in that direction.
We therefore voted for Amendment 8, although that change should take place in a wider context.
in writing. - (PT) The main objective of the new partnership agreement between the EC and CÃŽte d'Ivoire is to strengthen cooperation between the two parties so as to create a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and the sound exploitation of living marine resources in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, special attention being given to supporting the fisheries policy of that state.
The two parties will agree on the priorities to be decided upon for such support and will identify the objectives, the annual and multiannual programming and the criteria to assess the results to be obtained, with a view to ensuring sustainable and responsible management of the sector.
The agreement respects the fundamental principles of the common fisheries policy and guarantees Portugal a fishing licence for five surface longliners.
Members of the Portuguese PSD (Social Democratic Party) therefore voted in favour of this report.
in writing. - (PT) This agreement provides for a total of 40 fishing licences to be allocated to EU Member State vessels - five of them to Portugal - for a period of six years from July 2007.
Compared to the previous agreement, it represents a considerable reduction in fishing opportunities, but the agreement does provide for the possibility of increasing the catch.
The parties agreed that the EC financial contribution will be allocated in full to the support of initiatives taken in the context of the sectoral fisheries policy drawn up by CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Shipowners benefiting from the agreement must employ at least 20% ACP nationals among the seamen signed on.
The agreement provides for those seamen to be covered by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work.
That declaration provides for mandatory freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
The wages of the seamen will be fixed by mutual agreement between the shipowners and the seamen or their representatives, but may not be lower than the standards applied in their countries of origin, which might lead to a breach of the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'.
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote against the two partnership agreements on fishing between the EU and Guinea-Bissau and CÃŽte d'Ivoire, respectively.
The reason is that experience of this type of agreement is highly dubious.
Low-income countries are offered a lump sum payment and, in return, they open up their waters to commercial fishing by EU Member States, mainly in Southern Europe.
The resources transferred are ridiculously small in relation to the catches taken; in addition, there is a clear risk of unsustainable fishing.
A further argument is that local inshore fishing is usually adversely affected.
We hope that it will be possible, within the context of the EU's sustainable development strategy (SDS), to assess these fishing agreements without delay and to replace them with schemes which are sustainable.
in writing. - (SV) We think that the proposal for a common speed limit on EU motorways may have a positive environmental effect in the sense that speed can be reduced in those Member States which do not have mandatory speed limits on their motorways.
However, it is important that no Member State be compelled to disregard subsidiarity by raising the speed limit on its roads.
It must always be possible for Member States to impose lower speed limits than the European standard.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my excellent Italian colleague Mr Albertini, which makes a number of recommendations to the players in this sector to improve a situation that is deteriorating because of growing demand for oil and diminishing oil reserves, increasingly congested towns and cities, and a negative impact on human health and climate change.
I support the three chosen areas for combining public policy: encouraging technological developments (cars with emissions of 125 g CO2/km maximum), developing market-based instruments (Emissions Trading Scheme, tax incentives, charges/fares based on environmental impact, etc.) and using flanking measures to enable means of transport and infrastructure to be used as efficiently as possible.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, transport undoubtedly has an impact on society's socio-economic condition and, at the same time, it has direct implications for the environment.
Urban transport, in fact, generates 40% of CO2 emissions and keeps Europe dependent on and 'hostage' to the market in fossil fuels such as oil, which accounts for approximately 70% of total demand.
These alarming data are enough to explain the urgency and necessity of shaping a new comprehensive strategy for transport in Europe that could actually be developed from this report.
Pollution caused by transport must be considerably reduced very quickly by placing restrictions on emissions of pollutants, altering the composition of fuel mixtures, and continuing to provide incentives for the purchase and use of environmentally-friendly and non-polluting forms of transport.
The EU will therefore have responsibility for implementing an integrated plan to achieve this important objective, by committing itself to providing incentives for rail transport which, where appropriate improvements are made, can guarantee a high level of efficiency with a low environmental impact.
The trans-European networks should be completed as soon as possible, and require greater financial support from the EU.
On the other hand, Member States must guarantee and watch over the completion of this construction work, except in cases where damage to the environment or to health is proven.
in writing. - (PL) Amendment 1 to the report on sustainable European transport policy tabled by the PPE-DE Group was a cause for justified concern - both for me and for the entire transport sphere.
This amendment is aimed at delaying a review of the Eurovignette Directive.
To accept this amendment would be to send a negative signal from the European Parliament and would contradict the report by the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of 28 January 2008.
This is why I voted against the amendment and against the entire content of the report.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report on sustainable transport policy.
It takes account of European energy and environment policies.
In the EU 70% of demand for oil is attributable to the transport sector.
We need to put an end to our almost total dependence on fossil fuels by combining the various policies that encompass all modes of transport.
This approach should create the conditions essential for realism, such as technological innovation to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and the development of biofuels, the reform of the taxation system to take account of environmental impact, and accompanying measures to make better use of infrastructure and encourage citizens to change their habits.
Every citizen can be a player in sustainable transport by using public transport in preference to passenger cars, where this alternative is possible.
To make passenger and freight transport easier using low-emission modes of transport such as rail, river, sea and public transport, a range of new services, more competitive organisation of the sector and different ways of using certain infrastructure are needed simultaneously.
Since it is impossible to comment in this explanation of vote on all the important issues raised by this EP own initiative report, given its complexity and breadth, it is notable that the document does not address or incorrectly addresses aspects that researchers regard as essential in addressing issues of transport and energy and their impact on the environment.
For example:
there is no mention of high oil prices or to the consequences thereof;
there is no mention of the use of methane in road transport (in the form of CNG, LNG or biomethane);
there is a lack of clarity on the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel for road transport;
the uncritical bias towards the use of biofuels, with their serious consequences that have already been widely demonstrated;
there is no reference to documents such as the 'Target 2020' programme advocating the replacement by 2020 of approximately 20% of the petrol and diesel consumed within the European transport sector.
Finally, I must point out that, in addition to listing problems already clearly identified, we need policies to respond effectively to those problems, such as challenging the current capitalist globalisation and the role of transport within that framework, in particular the increasing geographical distance between the point of production and the point of consumption, and the consequent rise in transport needs.
There is much more to be said on all of this...
in writing. - I and my Fine Gael colleagues in the PPE-DE Group would like to confirm that we abstained in relation to Amendments 3 and 11, and indeed the overall report, due to concerns over the issue of taxation and road charging.
We continue to feel that both of these issues are up to individual Member States to decide and therefore should not be included in a Parliament report.
in writing. - British Conservative MEPs voted in favour of Mr Albertini's own-initiative report on Sustainable European Transport on the basis that it provides a clear policy framework that will increase efficiency and tackle transport's burgeoning impact on climate change.
However, Conservatives remain concerned that the report's call for further Commission proposals on internalising external costs should not begin until the impact assessment is fully completed, and the Parliament has properly debated the issue.
We are also keen to see that this policy option, if it is introduced, should be applied uniformly across all transport modes, so that no market distortion takes place.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the harmonisation of transport, environmental and energy policy within the European Union, because only coordinated efforts in these three sectors can bring about a lasting improvement in each one individually.
With my vote I should like to support in particular the development of a generally applicable, transparent and sustainable model for evaluating the external costs of all modes of transport.
I am therefore voting against Amendment 1 which, in my opinion, is aimed at delaying the internalisation of internal costs for road traffic.
Acceptance of the amendment would hinder the EU's efforts to achieve a sustainable transport policy and would furthermore create conditions for unfair competition between modes of transport.
Owing to the constantly increasing volume of traffic and the resulting ecological impact, intensive Europe-wide cooperation in the field of new technologies and alternative fuels should be strongly encouraged in order to stem greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the quality of life even in congested areas.
In this regard I am also calling for the average emissions for new vehicles to be reduced to 125g CO2/km through technological improvements in the transport sector and the use of biofuels.
in writing. - I welcome the recommendations contained within Gabriele Albertini's report on sustainable European transport policy.
Safe and affordable means of mobility should be a right afforded to all EU citizens.
Indeed, the sustainability of such transport is also a very pressing issue.
In encouraging technological innovation and market-based instruments, such as the Emissions Trading Scheme or tax incentives, particularly in large cities and environmentally sensitive areas, there is an opportunity to ensure that means of transport and infrastructure are used efficiently.
I support the call for increased investment in infrastructure and intelligent transport systems to tackle issues such as congestion.
I voted for the report's recommendations.
in writing. - (DE) In order to detract from the fact that we are marking time despite innumerable action plans, car drivers are now to be driven to their bikes by congestion charges, vehicle tolls and the like, or politely asked to walk or make greater use of public transport.
We must, however, get something straight here: this is the result of badly coordinated, local public transport that has been economised to death, the boom in shopping centres on the edges of towns whilst local shops are in decline, the falling quality of living conditions in the inner city, the rising crime rate, neighbourhoods that are home to large numbers of foreigners turning into ghettoes and, last but not least, longer journey times to work owing to urban sprawl and greater flexibility in working hours and employment relationships and the associated role of the car as a prerequisite for gainful employment.
In these terms and in view of the fact that cars in themselves cause only around 10% of particulate emissions, the EU is wanting, 'just' wanting, here, to grab more competences for itself and set up futile monitoring systems.
It should instead be taking the bull by the horns itself and fighting causes instead of symptoms, by revising its policy on subsidies, for instance, so as not to abet the exploding volume of heavy goods vehicles any further, for which the proportion of emissions produced is much greater.
Piggy-back transport systems should finally become economically advantageous and the euphoria of privatisation should not be allowed to reduce public transport to an unattractive patchwork rug.
in writing. - (PT) Over the past decades the transport sector has successfully made substantial investments to enhance energy efficiency, and has brought onto the markets intelligent technology with environmental and security benefits.
Nevertheless, these efforts do not appear to be sufficient, since the parallel constantly increasing demand in this sector almost cancels them out.
We therefore need to take a fresh look at this difficult equation so as to enable us to respond to the challenge.
The transport sector is a dynamic economic sector; it is technologically advanced and ever more competitive.
Industry has made extensive investments in research and development in close consultation with institutional and private partners.
Greater coordination is, however, necessary for us to draw all the added value from our efforts.
Specific action in terms of informing citizens and raising their awareness, including as far as their behaviour is concerned, is essential.
Moreover, we should be pursuing collaboration and coordination regarding progress in the field of fuel efficiency, investment regulation, stimulating a dynamic market for safer and less polluting vehicles and supporting technological innovation.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the excellent report by my fellow Member Mr Albertini on sustainable European transport policy, taking into account European energy and environment policies.
I believe it is of fundamental importance for the EU to coordinate its policies to develop urban public transport and alternative transport systems while protecting the environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
As regards infrastructure, I note that the emphasis is continuing to be placed on road transport projects at the expense of rail projects.
Completion of the trans-European networks still seems a remote prospect, and the EU's contribution is minimal compared to the burden to be shouldered by Member States individually.
In order to reduce gas emissions and improve the efficiency of freight and passenger transport, I would also stress the need for the EU to provide financial support for the implementation of priority projects in the framework of the trans-European networks.
in writing. - (DE) The Albertini report states that better internalisation of external costs can help to eliminate market disturbances and an increase in emissions.
I therefore voted against Amendment 1 because its aim is to delay the internalisation of external costs for road traffic.
This is the wrong signal, since road traffic is primarily responsible for emissions from the transport sector.
I hope that the review of the Infrastructure Charging Directive announced by the Commission will bring rapid progress in this sector.

Common organisation of agricultural markets and specific provisions for certain agricultural products as regards the national quotas for milk (debate)
The next item is the report by Elisabeth Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (single CMO Regulation) as regards the national quotas for milk - C6-0015/2008 -.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Let me first say that the Presidency welcomes the report by Mrs Jeggle on the proposal to increase the milk quota and is of the opinion that it is a constructive and balanced contribution to the debate that has been running for more than a few weeks now.
Based on the favourable market conditions, the European Commission has proposed in its report, or analysis, a 2% increase in national milk quotas starting with the next quota year, that is to say on 1 April 2008.
Milk quotas are not simply a matter of percentages; they are a wider issue linked to the review of the common agricultural policy.
That is why the Council did not restrict itself to this issue but entered into a wider, simultaneous debate on the overall package of the common agricultural policy health check.
I must say that there were some very similar thoughts or doubts about this proposal in the Council and Parliament.
For example, there were calls for more anticipation and stability in the milk sector.
There was concern about areas with less favourable farming potential where there are few alternatives to traditional dairy production.
On the other hand, there were resolute calls to enable European farmers to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the developing international and European markets.
Despite the complexity of this problem, we are convinced that we can find balanced answers and solutions to it within the framework of the common agricultural policy health check.
I would like to add here that the Council supports Parliament in the suggestion that the Commission prepare a general, long-term strategy, that is to say a proposal for a strategy, for the European dairy sector.
We think that the essential part of that strategy should be a so-called soft transition to the elimination of milk quotas, which would secure an unhindered transition to a more market-orientated dairy policy and predictability in this sector.
To this end the Council intends to call on the Commission to study all the appropriate means of achieving this.
However, we think that the Commission's proposal for a 2% increase in the quota for the next quota year should be treated as part of a package and that the other parts should be appropriately debated within the common agricultural policy health check.
I would also like to add that the proposal will be on the agenda for the session of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council that is to take place next week.
I hope it will be adopted.
So, if the conditions are satisfied, implementation will begin in the present quota year, that is to say 2008.
Finally, allow me to thank everyone who contributed to the debate on this report, above all the rapporteur.
In our opinion it is a balanced and well-founded observation.
Thank you for your efforts.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think it is a very good signal from the Presidency that the Minister for Agriculture is present here today to participate in this very important discussion.
I shall start my speech in the traditional way, by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and especially the rapporteur for the very constructive report on the proposal to increase the milk quota system by 2%, as was stated by the Minister, for the coming milk year starting on 1 April 2008.
Many people have pushed the Commission to alleviate the very tight dairy situation.
In the Council, a large majority of Member States invited the Commission to put a proposal on the table on increasing quotas.
A resolution here in the European Parliament, adopted in October 2007, on rising food prices also called on the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to propose a temporary increase in milk quotas.
In December 2007 the Commission presented a market outlook report that showed that there clearly is, and will be in the future, a growing demand for dairy products.
Your report also confirms that we should increase the possibilities for producing more milk.
I think everybody would agree that the Commission's proposal is fairly prudent and clear, with a predictable and equal outcome for all the Member States.
May I respectfully suggest that your amendments seem not to pay full attention to the need for predictability and equal treatment for farmers?
The amendment to make the increase of 2% voluntary for Member States, if applied, would be likely to create some difficulties.
Firstly, I think we would all agree that we are looking for more market orientation and higher productivity.
Therefore, I personally feel that the producer should be given the choice of whether or not to produce more milk.
I think we would also agree that dairy farmers need predictability - certainty about their production possibilities within the quota system - and I do not think that a voluntary system would contribute to this.
As a solution, Member States have the opportunity to decide not to distribute the quota but to keep it in the national reserve.
This is a possibility, although I would push the Member States and I would be happy to see the quota distributed, because I think it is the most proper way.
The amendment to use balancing-out of the quota at the end of the quota year is not a new idea.
In fact, it is something that the Commission has been looking closely into, since such a theory could facilitate the use in some Member States of the unused quota in other Member States.
But I think we would also agree that theory is one thing and practice is another.
Firstly, I think it clearly introduces uncertainty for milk producers.
They would then have to make their best guess of how the situation would look at the end of the production year and, on that basis, try to make a choice for their production, and only the following year would they know whether that production was levy free or not.
I think, with all respect, this is not to the advantage of the decision taken on the dairy farm.
It is obvious that milk production implies heavy investment, and we owe it to our farmers to have a predictable system until the quotas disappear in 2015.
Secondly, who would benefit from this?
I do not have to point out that it would largely benefit only a small group of Member States.
This already makes it politically difficult.
The most important thing is that it will benefit those producers who have already exceeded their quotas - those who have produced too much - and not those who have tried to keep within the limits of the quota system.
So there is no certainty that this would lead to more milk being available on the market.
Thirdly, in my view, this also goes against the idea of simplifying the common agricultural policy.
I fear that implementing rules in this area would be extremely complex, and I am not in favour of making our system more complicated in a situation where there are only seven years left of the lifetime of this quota system.
All in all, I note with pleasure that we all agree on the necessity for increasing the possibilities for the dairy sector in Europe to increase its production.
It is an extremely important political signal to me and to all the Member States that the Agriculture Committee unanimously chose this line after the very divided opinions at the beginning of this discussion.
I therefore send my biggest congratulations to the rapporteur for that achievement.
I hope I will have the same rate of success in the Council.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as already stated, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has unanimously rejected the Commission's proposal to increase the quotas for the coming milk year by 2%.
This would amount to 2.8 million tonnes.
We consider this proposal to be too rigid, too inflexible, and it is the wrong signal in the current situation, particularly for the markets.
Based on the rulings of 2003, there will be a 0.5% increase in quotas for 11 Member States anyway on 1 April this year - the equivalent of 700 000 tonnes more milk in the European Union.
The intensive debates with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture have shown that there will be no panacea, nor any comfortable way to conduct further debates.
There are widely differing opinions and all positions, from the general and fundamental rejection of any increase in quotas up to and including a 5% increase, were represented.
We nevertheless managed to find a compromise that took account of the positions of all the groups, and this was unanimously accepted with no dissenting votes or abstentions.
My heartfelt thanks go to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation.
The agreed compromise has two focal points.
Commissioner, you have said as much.
I have a different opinion on this.
Firstly, the establishment of a European balancing mechanism, by which under- or over-shooting of the existing national quotas can be compensated at EU level.
This would not be very bureaucratic and would result in producers who exceed their quotas being penalised only after balancing.
Secondly, as from 1 April, the Member States can decide to raise national quotas voluntarily for the 2008/2009 quota year.
We want flexibility, not rigidity!
This compromise means that the quotas that already exist will be used more efficiently.
For Member States with greater potential, there is also the opportunity to use this European quota framework along the lines of a common European internal market system.
Commissioner, you always stress that the existing milk quota will expire in this system in 2015.
A linear increase in quotas alone will not, however, create the soft landing you promise.
Just think back, if you will, to the old milk lakes!
The Committee on Agriculture has therefore unequivocally been arguing, as it has done already in the mini milk package, in favour of setting up a milk fund in order to achieve savings in costs resulting from the reforms explicitly for the milk sector.
In our view such forward-looking promotion and preservation of the entire sector can be made possible only in this way.
In particular this instrument should be used for dairy farmers in disadvantaged areas and in areas completely given over to grazing land and pasture.
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to include this request by the European Parliament in tangible terms in your legislative health check proposal.
In our view the application of Article 69 is insufficient because it is not clearly defined in terms of practical measures, particularly for the sector already mentioned.
It is also pure cynicism when a high-ranking Commission official announces to a gathering of farmers that they should not be complaining about producer prices already effectively falling again, since they had already been making do with 27 cents per litre of milk.
This is contempt for the legitimate interests of an entire profession, which I, as a Member of a Parliament, having taken up the cause of democracy at the highest level, do not accept!
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am sure that an increase in milk quotas in the 2008/2009 quota year will not threaten the stability of the EU milk market, and there will not be a significant fall in milk prices.
We would have expected a greater increase, but on hearing the arguments put forward by Mrs Jeggle and other MEPs we supported the package of compromise amendments that talks of a voluntary increase of just 2%.
It transpires from information in the press that the Commissioner supports proposals for an annual increase in quotas of only 1% from 2010 as part of what is called the soft landing.
This is rather a conservative approach, although the Commissioner is reportedly a liberal - but let us get down to business.
On the one hand low quotas limit the development of the EU milk industry by lowering its competitiveness and export potential.
On the other hand this is a guarantee of stable income for our farmers.
We shall continue to discuss the choice of the best solution in the future.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the truth is that the extremely low prices that were paid to European milk producers for years caused major damage to the sector.
They caused large-scale abandonment of the sector, especially in some regions such as my own, Galicia, and another of their consequences was that there were huge reductions in the strategic reserves of milk, which is a basic necessity.
I would like to say that, since 2007, the market has been developing positively, and in fact this is giving producers some respite, and even enabling them to invest in their farms, which was unthinkable until now.
There are two pieces of good news in this respect, according to the Commission's own report: positive prospects for the future mean that additional amounts of milk are required from the market, therefore a 2% increase is proposed for this year.
I have been in agreement with this proposal from the start, Commissioner.
I have been in agreement with this proposal and I have tried to work alongside the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, precisely because it is clear that there was some reticence and that there were some members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who did not think that this proposal from the Commission should be supported.
However, from my perspective and as I understand it, Parliament should not, as you said, be curbing those producers who decided to respond positively to the demands of the market.
It was therefore I who proposed, in agreement with Mrs Jeggle, to make this measure voluntary.
As Mrs Jeggle has already said, the report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Although it is true, as the rapporteur said, that there is underusage of the quota at EU level, this underusage is by no means equally distributed between all the Member States, nor is the production deficit as against theoretical consumption.
Just consider that in my country, Spain, the production allocated to us is 6.1 million tonnes and our theoretical consumption is 9 million tonnes.
Spain therefore has, it has to be said, almost the largest deficit per inhabitant per year in the whole of the European Union.
Therefore, in Mr Goepel's report, we have asked for this adjustment of the quota to be done in future, not by means of a linear increase, as in the proposal that you are putting forward now, but rather based on the gap that exists between the current structure and the structure that the sector should have, as you say, in order to be competitive and face up to the market alone.
In this respect, Commissioner, I would like to ask you whether you are considering the possibility, in relation to the adjustment mechanisms or soft landing, of designing individual models for each Member State.
I would like to make it very clear that I think that milk production should be preserved right across Europe.
With regard to quotas, before saying that we are now going to abandon them and that they are going to disappear, we need to think about their socio-economic role of protecting many fragile economies.
In many areas milk production is, as you know, the only agricultural option, therefore this system has helped...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, has again produced an excellent piece of work, for which I should like to thank her.
European milk producers are currently facing great challenges on account of the soaring demand for dairy products from the Far East, in particular.
This is a very positive problem.
At the same time, the production economy is being undermined by soaring feed prices, as the EU is preventing the import of feed, which our competitor countries need.
In order to survive we need to give permission for quota increases now.
Otherwise, if we wait until 2015, when quotas are hopefully to be abolished, we shall miss a unique opportunity for the European dairy industry.
My group wants to see the liberalisation of milk production in Europe by means of market economy and free competition, and the quota system is at odds with this.
Increasing production by at least 2% and reassessing at a later stage whether further quota increases are needed will support and maintain strong, forward-looking milk production in Europe and create a smooth transition to the abolition of the quota system, which was introduced in 1983 - incidentally as a transitional arrangement - owing to the development of whole milk powder and butter mountains.
Fortunately, these no longer exist - now the market wants more milk products.
Let us give European milk producers the opportunity to provide these.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I shall be no exception in congratulating our rapporteur on a solid piece of work, which I think is best viewed as part of a wider picture of how we ensure long-term stability for Europe's farmers and growers.
I have two points to make.
We accept and we welcome the proposals from the Commission for quotas to be done away with by 2015.
We would, however, like to see a system of production controls, and we disagree with the point in the report that there should be a voluntary opt-in mechanism for the Member States.
We in the UK in particular have seen voluntary modulation which, of course, is not voluntary at all for the farmers who are stuck with it, and we disagree with that principle.
We do not believe that asymmetric deregulation makes sense.
In the longer term as well, I would stress to our Commission colleagues that one of the major points, as we see a much more liberal and much freer market in milk products, will be the impact of competition law on how farmers, in particular, have to deal with long-term private contracts and the abuse of certain producers and purchasers, in particular, within the milk market.
But, on the whole, this is a solid piece of work and we are happy to broadly support it.
(BG) The condition of dairy production in Bulgaria is an example that there is something wrong in the economic system of the European Union.
The increase of the quotas is of little relevance since 30 % of the cows in Bulgaria have died of starvation for the first year of the EU membership alone.
This is due to the huge inflation rates brought about by the EU, as well as the new regulations, quotas, and higher prices of feeds and fuels.
How much more time will have to pass?
Perhaps it will be some two years before the country that is the homeland of the yoghurt, the homeland of Lactobacillus bulgaricum, remains without a single living cow thanks to the EU.
Mr President, first of all I welcome the recommendation that the rapporteur has put before us here today of 2% for the 12 months as a voluntary measure.
I think it is a measured position to take.
I am opposed to opening the floodgates on production as this, I believe, would solve nothing.
Let us see how the market develops over the next 12 months.
Then we can come back next year, re-visit the situation and take a much broader view.
Everyone talks about a 'soft landing' for quotas but no one can tell me what that soft landing will be.
It is a word that we use - the President-in-Office has used it and the Commissioner has used it - but what are we really talking about here when we hit 2013?
I know that it is a long way away, but there are many dairy farmers out there at the moment who are really wondering what the situation is going to be as we lead into that time?
So, while the returns for the dairy sector have changed dramatically during 2007, we cannot guarantee that this will continue forever.
Let us be very honest about it.
It was not what the Commission did.
It was not what we, the politicians, did.
It was not what any national government did or even the dairy sector did.
It was market forces in the world that drove market price up and that is exactly what happened.
Cereal prices have been driving the price up.
But we have also got to understand that, coming into the next 12 months, the cost of cereals, the cost of fertiliser, the high cost of energy, the forage cost this summer, is going to mean that lots of the extra money that has gone to the dairy sector will in actual fact be absorbed in these extra costs.
So let us not get carried away in believing that everything is so rosy and everything is wonderful in the dairy sector - because it is not.
The extra 2% will produce a substantial amount.
But I do agree with the Commissioner - let us not make the situation more complicated.
Let us make it easier for the producer.
The milk and dairy farming sector, regardless of where you are in Europe, is the backbone of the small family farm structure, and we must support it.
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner Fischer Boel, the 2% milk quota increase proposed in the report affects numerous Member States.
Hungary is not affected by this, since it uses only 70% of its milk quota allocation, but we are nevertheless in solidarity with Member States such as Poland and others which need to increase their milk quota.
In addition to the quota increase, we must prepare for the abolition of the milk quota regime altogether in 2015, as the Commissioner proposes, and so we need to devise support mechanisms that will provide real help in promoting quality milk production.
A particular problem in some countries is the lag in technical and technological development.
It would therefore be good if Community resources could be used to foster technological development in countries such as Hungary or other new Member States that have not been able to use their entire quota allocation.
When increasing the quota, it is also important to develop innovation in the agricultural sector.
The increase in fodder crop prices is a problem, and there is a particular problem that neither Commissioner Fischer Boel nor anyone else can do anything about, namely that in Hungary the dairy processing industry is unfortunately not owned by the milk producers, and this puts them at an enormous competitive disadvantage.
Thank you for your attention.
(DA) Mr President, as the Commissioner knows, the general debate in Denmark is very unfavourable towards agricultural subsidies.
We are very much aware that, if it is attractive to produce milk in Europe, this can be attributed in great part to artificially high prices and the restriction of competition from third countries.
The conditions resulted in overproduction, which we have endeavoured to ration via quotas.
I shall not go into all of the misfortune this has entailed, but merely point out that, if the Commission wants to increase quotas to take into account the growing demand, this is of course insufficient.
Quotas must be abolished completely, and the distortions in the market must be eliminated.
Therefore, there must be a thorough reform of the common agricultural policy, with payment by surface area being phased out much more quickly than is the case at present.
The market must be liberalised properly, and this should be the main objective of the reform.
In addition, we can examine the possibilities for continuing support to selected small areas where there are good arguments for milk production despite the economic conditions.
Liberalisation must form part of the EU's agricultural policy: a policy that incorporates environmental sustainability into the general market conditions and ensures free access to EU markets under fair conditions for developing countries.
There is still a long way to go before we can take pride in the EU's agricultural policy.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, I should also like to thank Elisabeth Jeggle for having worked so ably on the report.
The present quota system has been agreed up to 2015.
It will therefore remain in force for a further seven years and a few days, to be exact.
I think it is wrong, Commissioner, to raise the milk quota now by 2%.
I would have understood completely if the quota had been raised by 2% for the new Member States because consumption of milk products there is way below the EU average.
Commissioner, however much I may respect you, I think the Commission's proposals are wrong.
Over the last few months our dairy farmers have been obtaining a fair milk price for the first time in many years.
Our dairy farmers, who milk their cows morning and evening, 365 days a year - 366 days this year - deserve to earn a better income than has been the case in recent years.
Increasing the quota now therefore means that milk prices will be put under enormous pressure and they are already under pressure without any increase.
We talk here of a soft landing, which for me means pulling the wool over the milk producers' eyes.
There will be no soft landing; there will be a rough landing when it is realised what the Commission has in mind as regards quotas.
I believe the Hoelgaards and Rasmussens in the Commission, who would like to see a sudden fall in milk prices, must be stopped.
You should not let them get away with this.
Even without any increase we have problems and we must try to counteract this here.
The Bavarian CSU Members will be voting against the report tomorrow because they are against the increase.
This is not directed against Elisabeth Jeggle, but against the increase in quotas.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mrs Jeggle for the enormous amount of work she has spent on drawing up this report.
What we are discussing today I presented three years ago when I first started my work in the European Parliament.
For three years we have been saying how necessary it is to increase milk quotas in the new Member States and in the European Union, to even out the unfair and disproportionate split in these quotas between the individual countries, to increase production, and primarily export, and above all to cease penalising those farmers who want to increase production and who want to produce good European milk.
The essential arguments confirming my stance of three years ago are also to be found in the Report from the Commission to the Council 'Market Outlook for the Dairy Sector', which announces the continuation of positive trends in the world milk market.
Milk quotas allocated to individual countries are not being fully taken up.
On the other hand a 2% increase in quotas does not necessarily imply the same increase in milk production in all regions.
More and more farms in the EU are moving away from milk production, considering it to be too labour-intensive.
Consequently in all those countries that wish to produce it we should increase the quota by 5% rather than 2%, particularly in view of the fact that there will be an increase in the number of customers worldwide and, especially in Asia, an increase in demand for excellent European dairy products.
(DE) Mr President, opinions are divided on milk quotas.
We have also seen this within our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has nevertheless accepted a unanimously agreed compromise.
If the European Parliament therefore wants to send out a signal to the Commission and the Council of Ministers, it should also be aware, however, that the farmers and their representatives are still divided.
Some are fully able to accept an increase in quotas of 2% or more and therefore a soft landing prior to the total abolition of quotas.
They want growth opportunities through better use of their production potential, because the market opportunities in the EU and on the world market as a result of constantly rising demand are very attractive.
Others fear a slump in production prices, which have only recently become fairer, if greater quantities of milk are produced.
Opinions are also divided on the European balancing out proposed by the Committee on Agriculture.
Does this not now mean abandoning the national milk quota system when there is an undersupply of 3 million tonnes across Europe?
Would the target not be reached too by reducing the superlevy and increasing the dairy quotas?
Which dairy farmer has the courage to play poker in the countries where - as in Luxembourg - the superlevy for 2006-2007 will once again be falling due by overshooting the quotas?
Because a voluntary 2% increase in milk quotas for the 2008-2009 milk year is part of the compromise, I am able to support it.
I am particularly pleased with our report's request to set up a milk fund restructuring programme.
I think it is extremely important that an analysis of the economic, social and ecological effects of increasing the milk quotas and a report on consumer behaviour will shortly be demanded that expressly calls for consideration of the particular factors of milk production in disadvantaged regions such as Luxembourg, with difficult production conditions.
The money planned for the milk sector must continue.
It must also be clarified that producer prices, which are fairer in the long run, are only marginally to blame for higher prices for food.
Distributors and the dominant food chains are continually counting their blessings here.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Mrs Jeggle and all the coordinators who have really tried to achieve a balance in the particularly sensitive area of milk quotas - a policy that European stock breeders and farmers expect to bring far-reaching, radical changes.
Commissioner, it is particularly encouraging that, when faced with a change in dairy product supply and demand, the Commission responded by amending one of the key regulations and increased the national quotas by 2% for the period 2007-2008.
I should like to point out that it is acceptable for the Commission to show this kind of flexibility in matters of developing the market for agricultural produce, particularly foods, especially during a period when the stock-breeding sector is facing viability issues owing to the crisis on the international market.
However, it is also a matter of principle that such a crisis cannot be resolved by the same measures and policies for all types and sizes of stock-breeding operation.
For this reason, I stress that within the scope of their discussions the Commission and the Council must re-examine the question of fat content, in order to prevent distortion of competition at the expense of countries for which a low fat content has been stipulated.
(RO) First, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her work and efforts made in finding a compromise in this extremely delicate matter.
In my capacity as a European deputy from a new Member State I consider beneficial the increase of 2%, even though we wanted a significantly higher percentage, especially for the Member States with both low milk quotas and unused production potential.
The increase in national milk quotas is not a threat to the stability of the milk market.
I would like to point out the fact that an increase of the quotas by 2% represents -in fact- an actual increase in milk production at community level by only 0.8%.
I also believe that we need to maintain the current quota system to stimulate the consolidation of the existing farms and to stimulate new ones.
The term used in relation to the quotas from the perspective of common agricultural policy reform is "smooth landingâ, meaning a gradual elimination of quotas.
The new Member States, mainly Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the Union on 1 January 2007 and which, if I am to use the same language, "took offâ abruptly, will be facing difficulties in adapting the "takeoffâ procedures to those of a smooth "landingâ.
If this proposal had not been accepted, the quota assigned to Romania would have run out, like in 2007, in mid-year, which in fact does not stimulate but rather completely discourages the development projects of our farmers.
I hope that the vote in plenary session for this report be as firm as the vote in the Committee on Agriculture.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent report and all the hard work that went into it.
There is no doubt that the European Union needs to respond appropriately to the growing global demand that is prompting a significant increase in the milk quota.
The proposed 2% quota increase, scheduled to take effect in every Member State at the beginning of April 2008, will perhaps help this sector within the European Union to take advantage of the opportunity offered by global demand.
Nevertheless, we need to resolve the issue of milk quotas without creating another problem in the process.
I would like to emphasise that as well as meeting genuine market demand and expanding the range of products on offer, we must help to improve the already difficult situation of producers.
This is why we must ensure that appropriate weight is given to the social and environmental impact of the quota increase, and its impact on production, especially as regards supporting producers in less favoured regions.
Ensuring that the price is appropriate for producers and consumers alike is indispensible for internal market mechanisms.
In view of the fact that the quota system will be abolished after 2015, we must start to think now about how to help producers make their businesses efficient and profitable.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Thank you.
Increasing the milk quotas in the current market climate is rash and risky for two reasons.
On the one hand, the market outlook is nowhere near as favourable as the European Commission supposes.
Recent developments demonstrate clearly the risks involved in raising the quota.
Consumers in Europe and beyond have responded sensitively to the increase in prices of dairy products.
In a number of countries consumption has decreased by 10-30%, and imports of milk powder from China have decreased.
As a result, the purchase price of milk in Hungary, for example, has fallen by 10-20% in the past few weeks.
The prime reason for all this may be that, while prices of other foods have risen, meat prices have not so far followed suit, with the result that consumers are meeting their protein requirements by consuming meat rather than increasingly expensive dairy products.
At the same time, in many Member States a significant proportion of the milk quota is unutilised.
Increasing the quota would impede producers in these Member States from using the opportunities available to them; indeed, for these countries a quota increase could actually result in a drop in production because producers in Member States that are using their quota will buy up the livestock they need to increase milk production from these countries.
For the time being, therefore, there is no need to increase the quota.
Let us wait and see what happens.
If the price rise and increase in demand persist in the long term, then we should revisit this issue.
(SK) The figures for the 2006/07 quota year show an under-usage of 1.9 million tonnes of milk at EU level, with 18 out of 27 Member States producing below their national quotas.
The European Commission is expecting for the 2007/08 quota year an under-usage of 3 million tonnes of milk.
The issue of an additional 2% quota increase is, on the other hand, debatable.
I agree with the view that all the options should be considered based on their applicability, with emphasis on their economic, social, regional and budget impact.
In my opinion, the new Member States should receive bigger subsidies, set at 2% as proposed, in order not to be discriminated against because of their past, as we are all aware of the higher demand as well as the higher prices.
(PL) Mr President, my fellow Member Mrs Jeggle has put forward a good proposal for increasing milk quotas.
The case for increasing them and for creating a system of balancing out at EU level is also supported both by the situation on the milk market and by dairy farmers.
In view of this situation, questions must be asked.
Why has the European Commission been so slow to react to the need to increase milk quotas?
Is it planning to secure the interests and existence of EU producers by setting a minimum price for milk at a level that guarantees a profit for all EU producers and puts an end to purchases below the cost of production?
Does the Commission envisage an evening out of the imbalance in milk production between the old and the new Member States?
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, two weeks ago, four and a half thousand dairy farmers descended on Brussels from all corners of Europe.
They joined forces to form a European Milk Board and are now demanding fair prices.
This has already had a considerable impact in Germany.
We have producer prices that were around 40% and are now coming under some pressure again.
Dairy farmers are therefore demanding a volume-based market policy.
If this development were to grow, if it were to influence agricultural policy, can you imagine that a Commission in the year 2015 would be able politically to resist the demands of this movement to increase or again apply the dairy quota system in a flexible manner?
Mr President, I share the concern of many in this House about a definitive increase in milk quotas.
