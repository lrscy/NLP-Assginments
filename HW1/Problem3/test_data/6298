(DE) Mr President, first of all, thank you to both Vice-President Verheugen and Commissioner Kuneva for being here and enhancing the debate.
If commercial and economic policy has a truly important task, it is where the safety of our children is concerned.
Children's toys have become increasingly inexpensive in recent decades and the cheaper the toy, the greater the likelihood that it was not produced in the EU.
I have to say even as a Liberal that there is justifiable doubt that parents always know best what is good for their children when buying toys.
The range is colossal and unmanageable.
Quality toys produced in Europe such as Lego, Playmobil, MÃ€rklin, Brio wooden trains or Wader plastic toys are also correspondingly expensive.
Competition needs people who can and want to take responsibility.
Anyone who buys their children the cheapest junk toys untested does not want this responsibility!
We also have to consider whether the Commission should launch an information campaign for parents like these.
Yes, I am in favour of free trade, but not at any price!
As Europeans, we have certain standards, and - this has been repeatedly addressed here - we have to implement them in a clearer way.
At this point I should like to highlight once again the 'Made in ...' campaign.
Following the current events, it may be time to introduce a mandatory designation of origin, at least for toys.
I know Commissioner Kuneva's efforts on this issue and can only encourage her in them.
The label on the product must be sufficiently large.
Even though we are not in a position to change production conditions in China, this would at least educate citizens about this to a sufficient level.
Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Kuneva, Commssioner Verheugen, colleagues, I would like to start where the previous speaker ended.
I believe that all in this Parliament would agree that the best protected consumer is only the informed consumer.
If the safety of the products placed on the market is a priority for all of us, the safety of children's toys is twice as important because children are the most vulnerable group of consumers.
We would all like to see only safe children's toys on the market and therefore we often rely on the CE marking.
Most manufacturers outside the European Union have understood that European importers will no longer run the risk of offering on the market products that do not conform to this marking.
At the same time, our citizens firmly believe that it is the guarantee of quality and, especially, a guarantee of security.
It is in this sense, Mr. Chairman, that the recognition of the precise meaning of the CE marking is of special importance to all of us.
Many surveys reveal that, unfortunately, many consumers, especially in the new Member States, are not familiar with the actual meaning of this marking.
Therefore I would like to call upon the Comission:
To organize a public awareness campiagn, once the European Parliament has made a decision on the new approach, to inform the European citizens about the actual meaning of the CE'marking because one of the best ways to protect the rights of 500 million consumers on the European market is to raise their awareness and because only the informed consumer is the best protected consumer.
(ES) Mr President, the recall of dangerous toys in August and September caused public alarm.
However, I do not think that we should add to the alarm as, in general, the toys sold in Europe are surely the safest in the world.
However, reality shows us that we need to improve European safety standards, especially for those products that consumers have direct contact with, such as toys or textile products.
The situation that arose should lead to greater market surveillance, inspection and the banning or withdrawal of dangerous products.
However, sometimes the only priority is increasing profit margins, generating growing pressure on businesses and increasing the risks.
We need to demand that China improves safety, but it is essential to cooperate with them to achieve these objectives.
Before the Christmas period, when millions of toys are bought in Europe, all the authorities involved, from the Commission to local authorities, as well as companies producing and marketing toys, need to act responsibly, maximise precautions and commit themselves to guaranteeing the safety of toys.
We all have a great interest in offering transparency, safety and confidence to European consumers.
(CS) Commissioner, we have to give parents back their trust in the European market.
Since the health of children is at stake, we want to act fast and we are now discussing how to do that.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that we need a new law or even a new marking as soon as a problem develops.
We must first of all persuade countries to test their product safety mechanisms.
Secondly, we must negotiate with third countries in order to ensure that they, too, introduce safety standards for the products they export to our Union.
The Commission's analysis that we are soon to be presented with will expose the flaws in product safety control in Member States.
Then perhaps we will find out why, for example, Denmark and Austria allow more dangerous products through than Germany, despite having the same laws.
Commissioner, I am pleased that you have started the negotiations with the Chinese Government in such an uncompromising manner.
That is the right direction at last and I hope that the other Commissioners will follow that example.
Now I will turn back to Europe.
I would call on the Commission to focus on how to prevent misuse of the marking that tells citizens that they are buying a harmless product.
A new marking will not solve this problem.
We simply need sufficient sanctions for misuse of the existing CE marking.
In that way, without incurring high costs, manufacturers will improve their internal quality control and other dangerous products that are on the market will be quickly withdrawn, not just toys.
Significant penalties are incorporated in the Slovak legislation concerning toys, for example; that is not the situation in the Czech Republic.
At any rate, countries are expected to impose fines for the provision of false information on toys, footwear and other products under their general legislation.
That is why I am asking the Commission to ensure that the Member States assume their responsibilities, for once and for all.
(PT) The topic under discussion today has been on the agenda ever since the US giant Mattel recalled 21 million toys because they were dangerous.
Today I should like to congratulate the Commissioner for her promise of firmness and action.
I only hope that she will act effectively before the strong euro and the Christmas period combine to flood the European market with dangerous imported toys.
However, we still need clear answers to two questions.
Firstly, if the Mattel affair had not happened, can the Commission assure us that European consumer safety would have merited this attention?
What specific lessons does the Commission draw from this on the meaning of the 'CE' marking, the responsibility for control conferred on producers and importers and, in general, on the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanisms in the European market?
Secondly, this is not a short-term problem.
What is happening with toys is also happening with textiles and many other products.
The European Union's high standards with regard to the environment, health and quality are in practice constantly being breached by imports, subcontracting and relocation of Europe's businesses.
How does the Commission intend to overcome that fundamental contradiction in today's global market?
Thank you.
(SK) Toys are very sensitive goods that affect human health from an early age.
The news that American toy manufacturer Mattel is withdrawing three million Chinese toys from the market on account of high lead levels and the detachment of small magnets concerned me as a strong advocate of consumer protection and at the same time prompted me to initiate legislation.
The issue of small magnets, which, I should mention, pose a new safety risk that should also be dealt with immediately in a directive on toy safety, must be brought before the European Parliament without further delay.
Within the Rapex system it is necessary to explain its objective so that it is understood by all Member States alike.
It must be stated clearly whether the primary objective of Rapex is to notify the risk posed by a specific dangerous product or to notify identified channels by which dangerous products reach the single European market, which is very time-consuming.
Experience shows that the CE conformity marking does not provide sufficient certainty that the product concerned is in fact safe.
In the case of toys the situation is further complicated by the fact that the manufacturer does not have to issue a declaration of conformity.
To the supervisory authority the CE marking is the only indication as to whether conformity, that is to say de facto safety, has been assessed.
In the debate on whether it is desirable to support or abolish further use of the CE marking I support its retention, provided that entitlement and marking are monitored by the Member States' supervisory authorities.
I should mention that the consumer public is beginning to perceive this marking as a technical passport for all products entering the single European market.
In drawing up the legislative package relating to the review of the new approach directives known as the 'Goods Package', in which I am closely involved as one of the shadow rapporteurs for the PPE-DE political group, it is necessary to discuss in greater detail the need to place further marking on goods, such as the K-markt quality mark already in use, or new marks that would place an excessive burden on undertakings, primarily small and medium-sized businesses, and might be confusing for final consumers.
I believe that together we will succeed in creating effective tools to ensure that this year children only get safe toys for Christmas.
(RO) Mr. President, the latest voluntary withdrawal of dangerous products manufactured in China raises serious questions related to the correct implementation of the European legislation on consumer protection.
These products bore the EC label, thus facilitating the exportation of the toys to the European market by the Chinese manufacturers.
Many consumers misunderstand the significance of this mark, believing that this symbol is a guarantee that the products were manufactured in Europe.
Nevertheless, giving up the EC mark is not a viable solution, because it represents an advantage for the European manufacturers in international trade.
It is necessary to find an additional label to the already existing one, which would introduce mandatory inspections and drastic penalties for those abusing the EC mark.
In order to prevent any future placing on the market of potentially dangerous products, it is important for the national consumer protection authorities to improve their measures of monitoring and investigating compliance with the EU legislation.
Moreover, national authorities must assure consumers that they have the right to get their money back for the dangerous products they purchased.
(PL) Mr President, most of the events that have been linked to the withdrawal of toys of Chinese manufacture have centred on excessively high levels of lead.
A short-term solution to this problem is to withdraw post factum all articles that give cause for concern.
But this is a solution that is effective in the short term, and one with many tragic consequences, such as the suicide of the boss of one of the companies that produces the toys.
A much better and more promising solution is to establish a safe limit for the amount of lead in the manufacture of toys, and of other articles too.
Previous arrangements have been based on a recommendation formula which has negligible force, as witnessed by the large discrepancies between the permissible amounts of lead in different Member States.
We have to introduce genuinely binding limits that hold for all EU countries.
Furthermore, as much as I approve of the RAPEX system, I am of the view that the most important thing where the safety of imported toys is concerned is to concentrate on coordinating actions at the level of the whole Community.
Incidentally I would like to point out that the EU should apply thorough monitoring of all products imported from China.
The subject of toys is just one element in a broader problem area.
I would like to use this debate to draw attention to something that appears to have been forgotten.
I do not hear too many voices talking about child safety in China.
Children from this country are frequently exploited for work in inhumane conditions.
The employment of children who are often under ten is universal, for example to work in brickworks.
This is an exceptionally live issue, particularly with the Olympic Games coming up.
According to a report from the International Trade Union Confederation, factories producing gadgets for these Olympics are allowing breaches of employment laws, including the exploitation of small children as slaves.
Although international organisations like the Fair Play Alliance, for example, are concentrating on conditions for the manufacture of souvenirs for next year's Olympics, I am of the view that the European Parliament should take a stance on this matter.
(DA) Mr President, I would like to say to the two Commissioners that I agree with your view that we have a problem with market surveillance.
This represents a weak point within the internal market today.
The initiatives of the Member States relating to market surveillance are simply not good enough.
For example, in my own country, Denmark, there has been a cut in the funds allocated to general product safety monitoring.
I urgently request that you use all the funds at your disposal to pressure the Member States into doing more in terms of market surveillance.
It is absolutely crucial that we secure and strengthen this.
However, market surveillance alone is not enough.
We also need better rules, and this is something that we are working on at the moment; this includes the product package for the internal market and subsequently the Toys Directive.
We need minimum rules for market surveillance.
We need to impose stronger requirements on producers and importers, and we need to enforce the consequences of not abiding by the rules applicable to the market.
However, we are working on this and we hope that it will be implemented soon.
(NL) Mr President, it is good that we as a Parliament are making our voice heard in the discussion that is taking place in the media, as product safety directly affects our citizens and our children.
Mr President, I stand here with a positive attitude, because international trade contributes towards improved prosperity, both here and elsewhere in the world.
China is a major trading partner.
For that reason, we must invest in strong contacts and fair trade relations that benefit China and also our citizens in Europe.
We therefore cannot and must not tolerate non compliance of our trading partners' products with the safety standards that we have laid down in our legislation.
Approximately half of the warnings in respect of dangerous import products relate to products from China, and not only to toys, but also to toothpaste, body lotion, beds, colour rinses, dog and cat food and even pacemakers.
Mr President, we in Europe must improve the order in our regulations and checks and make appropriate efforts so that safe products are manufactured in China and third countries.
That is of course one of the responsibilities of the manufacturers themselves, who must not aim solely for the lowest price, but it is also the responsibility of our Commissioner for Trade, Mr Mandelson.
I feel that it is commendable that two commissioners are represented here, but would you also please ensure that Commissioner Mandelson places product safety far higher on the agenda for the trade conferences, because it is at these conferences that we can exact measures and must put up a fight.
We must of course also offer technical assistance, but product safety must constitute a major element in trading agreements with, for example, China.
If necessary, we then have an incentive - in other words, sanctions.
Therefore, Commissioner Kuneva, take a firm line in our trade relations too; involve Commissioner Mandelson, because thus far, he has unfortunately not yet shown appreciation for this topic.
Mr President, one of the first speeches I made in this House 23 years ago was on the then proposal for a Toy Safety Directive.
I welcome the plans now to strengthen that Directive.
But let us make it clear: the Mattel problem would almost certainly be with us with or without a strengthened Toy Safety Directive.
I believe we need three courses of action, which other colleagues have mentioned this morning.
Firstly, we have to push manufacturers to take a greater interest in their supply chain and, if necessary, apply penalties to those who do not take that interest.
Secondly, we need the Commission to bring together the Member States to ensure tougher inspections in Europe, to ensure adequate customs control and to ensure the application of the existing European Union laws.
With China, we know that it does not respond to health and safety concerns, but it does respond to economic threats.
We should consider banning the use of the CE mark on all products from China until it establishes a clearly independent, high-quality accreditation and testing centre or centres in China.
Only then can we have some confidence in the goods that are coming from China, and only through such action will China respond.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the summer, Mattel recalled 20 million toys from China, thereby reopening the debate on the value of CE marking and sanctions against operators who do not meet European standards.
What will it take before the EU reacts?
Brazil has already banned imports.
The United States and Canada are starting an inquiry.
As for us, we are debating.
The Commission must take action.
This means: revising EU legislations on toys before Christmas, insisting on the need for maximum harmonisation; ensuring that manufacturers comply with safety standards, as well as social and environmental standards - why not introduce a new European label to reinforce CE marking?; reviewing the effectiveness of controls and penalising manufacturers if necessary; clarifying the responsibilities of producers and importers; stepping up market surveillance through real customs cooperation between Member States.
The responsibility and credibility of the EU in the eyes of consumers is at stake.
How can we encourage consumers to have a positive image of Europe if we cannot restore their confidence?
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there are countless unscrupulous manufacturers and company directors around the world who trade within the WTO.
They do not care about the environment any more than about the health of their employees and customers, or that these may be children.
For them, profits must be had at any price.
These are not just Chinese companies and they do not just sell toys.
They must be confronted with institutions and legislation capable of blocking their fraudulent - even criminal - practices.
We have to recognise the weakness of our control systems and question the meaning of CE marking on products marketed in Europe.
This marking should mean that products comply with European legislation and not that they might comply with them, which is misleading for consumers.
CE marking is pointless if it is not based on genuine product safety.
This is what European consumers demand, just as they demand that their health be put before market interests.
To this end, the European Union must be firmer in its negotiations with the WTO.
(PL) Mr President, what we are doing today is reacting to a critical situation, as we fear for the life and health of our children.
In the proposed resolution we are concentrating chiefly on product safety, the product being a toy.
What we are looking for is for this product to be made according to European standards.
We want better control, we want a safe product, because European consumers, be they large or small, must feel safe.
But this is not the only possible reaction.
Fellow members, a toy is not just a market product, and regarding it from the aspect of safety and price alone is not good enough.
A toy is something more than just another form of goods - it shapes a child's thoughts, helps it to develop, impacts on its education - which is why I am calling for the Commission, when it reviews the Toy Safety Directive, to bear these things in mind too.
Commissioner, we are using this review to give our children something more than a Chinese product that reflects American popular culture.
Our children must have a wider choice of toys, including toys that have a European spirit to them.
They deserve this.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a batch of toys imported from China turns out to be unsafe.
That requires cooperation with the Chinese authorities.
Work needs to be done at the start of the product chain where this happens.
Multinationals are not without guilt.
They invest in the country because of the cheap labour force.
I expect the Commission to adopt a comprehensive, high quality and safe product policy that is based on the following measures.
I support what my fellow members have said with regard to imposing a rigorous revision of the legislation relating to the CE marking, with liability regulations for importers and facilities for placing sanctions on those that infringe upon the regulations.
Mattel declared that it made a mistake and I therefore expect the Commission to reprimand Mattel heavily.
An agreement must be made within the framework of the WTO to combat unsafe products from China or elsewhere, even those for onward export.
A greater level of cross-border cooperation is required on the part of the market supervisory authorities and customs.
That requires political will and requires financial resources.
These already exist for safety in the workplace and for food safety, so why not for product safety too?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years the approach taken to 'free' trade has been completely ideological: the single dogma of laissez-faire globalisation.
We now find ourselves struggling with problems such as dangerous products, which is particularly worrying in that toys are involved.
Is there a problem with China?
Yes!
It concerns the guarantee rules that must be complied with.
Yet we are thinking about an effective guarantee mark that would be in addition to the CE mark and, for products from outside Europe, even the possibility of a recognition mark, the 'made in' mark.
There is also a problem, however, with Western multinationals manufacturing products in China or elsewhere, which have major responsibilities for safety and control, including for toys; there is also the problem that products declared to be made in Europe should really be made in Europe.
We cannot ask China to respect employment rights and environmental standards, as it must do, while concealing the fact that our multinationals are also responsible for violations of this kind.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it was really a very interesting and very deep discussion and I am grateful to all of you.
This discussion brought a lot of doubts and a lot of concrete measures, which, in a way, had already been anticipated by the Commission.
I am glad to say this because, as we can confirm, these measures are well elaborated upon together with Parliament.
I believe that, whatever kind of signals we could give, like the resolution you produced, or proposals by the Commission, or trying to intervene with benchmarks from the Commission to compare how the different Member States work on the ground, we can succeed only if there is a common vision for the future, a vision which is based on open societies and free market, and in the first place, when we are talking about consumers, that we will not comprise on consumer safety.
Finally, I should like once more to reiterate that for me this is of the utmost importance and I will not compromise on this issue.
Several of you referred to RAPEX.
RAPEX works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which means that there is no delay in notification through RAPEX.
And I would like you to talk to your local communities to advertise RAPEX, because through these notifications we have, in many ways, already prevented dangerous goods from being put on the market.
It is very important to reiterate that by recalling goods, economic operators are complying with an obligation under European legislation.
It is not a matter of good will: it is because general product safety exists in European legislation.
The lead paint in the Mattel case was detected first in the course of the tests carried out on behalf of the European distributor.
So we should never underestimate the efficiency of our RAPEX.
We are also extending RAPEX-China, which is very important.
Just before I finish, I would like to inform you that I asked Mattel what it has done with the recalled toys.
I was thinking about the internet in particular and how those goods could be reached through the internet.
I would like to tell you that all the toys have been destroyed, and this has been confirmed by Mattel.
I think that all of us should assume our obligations, and this is the only way the Community can proceed.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, two more factual clarifications.
Firstly, the European rules on product quality and product safety apply to every product, irrespective of where it is produced.
Regardless of whether a product is produced in China or Europe, if it is brought onto the European market, the same regulations apply 100%, since there is no distinction at all.
This goes without saying.
Secondly, I will say it once more: obviously, even the old existing Toy Safety Directive bans the importation of dangerous toys.
Toys that Mattel has recalled did not comply with European rules and could not be marketed in Europe.
I now come to the two major complex issues that have played a crucial role in this debate.
First of all, the Toy Safety Directive.
The Commission, of which I am a part, announced the revision of the directive at the beginning of 2005.
The beginning of 2005!
Since then it has been part of the Commission's legislative programme.
This legislative programme has been discussed in this Parliament.
I have not heard that any Member of Parliament has demanded that the new Toy Safety Directive must be in place any sooner.
Nor would this be possible.
This is such a complicated and enormously huge market, that you cannot come up with it just like that.
I guarantee once again: this new Toy Safety Directive will be in place by the end of the year.
The policy instruction to officials, on which they are working, is: the strictest possible regulations in relation to toy safety, the 'strictest possible'.
This, for instance, expressly includes - because several people have said so here - the fact that I gave instructions, a long time ago and not just now, that carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic chemical substances should not be used in toys.
There are still more than 900 of them.
All this has already been decided.
Then there is the question of market surveillance and CE marking.
I should say, Mr Sturdy, that it is really not right to blame the Commission for the fact that we respect the legally enshrined division of labour between the European level and the Member States.
Market surveillance is the sole responsibility of the Member States.
What we can do - and this we are doing - is to strengthen and improve cooperation, but we cannot assume responsibility.
A series of requests has been made here as to how we could improve the system.
I am very happy about these requests because they pinpoint precisely what the Commission put to you at the beginning of this year on the reform of the internal market.
It demanded that the Member States should be obliged to carry out market surveillance internally and at external borders - and this is precisely what is stated in our proposals.
The Member States should be forced to make appropriate resources available - this is included in our proposal.
The Member States should be compelled to exchange important information immediately - this is included in our proposal.
And finally, it has been proposed that strict penalties and sanctions be applied to those who breach the rules - this, too, is included in our proposal.
Therefore, as a matter of urgency, I appeal to you, the European Parliament, and to the Council, which not present here, to discuss the Commission's proposals from the beginning of the year without delay and to adopt them.
Then the greater part of what has rightly been demanded here today will already have been completed.
(Applause)
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 26 September 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the movement of goods is a self-regulating system.
Dangerous toys made in China are a problem for us all.
Many millions have made their way out of Asia and entered Europe and the USA.
Who is responsible for this?
The manufacturer?
The sub-contractor?
The importer?
Everyone?
Or no one?
In the present era of progressive globalisation, nothing could be more wrong than to think that the problems of others have no bearing on us.
The EU is trying to face up to these challenges and has therefore proposed a regulation on marketing of goods.
By the end of the year, a review of the Toy Safety Directive should also have been proposed.
In my opinion, the problem of product marketing is linked to several further questions, and these need to be emphasised:
information for the consumer on goods bought by him/her; good information is the best consumer protection,
market surveillance by Member States,
enhanced cooperation between States,
a new approach to the CE mark which symbolises a safe product that meets EU requirements.
These are just some of the many suggestions for improving the current situation with regard to product marketing and consumer protection.
We are just at the start of a long road which will end in a market that is free of uncontrolled and hazardous goods.
Much work still lies ahead, but EU legislation is the right way forward and gives us hope that the future will be free of hazards from everyday items and that neither we nor our children will be threatened by them.
in writing. - Consumer safety raises serious concerns among our citizens when threats can be identified endangering the most vulnerable ones, namely: our children.
We ought therefore to address rapidly and transparently these concerns as there cannot be compromises when consumer safety is at stake.
The European Union should indeed ensure thoroughly the respect of its high standards when importing goods from countries with lesser quality production standards like China.
In this respect, the role of RAPEX, the system for the rapid exchange of information on dangerous non-food consumer products (including dangerous toys), is of the utmost importance as the flow of imports from countries like China is enormous.
We thus need detailed and regular reporting and to provide our partners with the necessary consumer safety requirements so that they can effectively track down potentially dangerous products.
Consumers' trust is essential, we therefore have to further focus on prevention, rapid reaction mechanisms and the effective enforcement of the Union's standards requirements.
in writing. - The recent recall of millions of toys by US manufacturer Mattel, over safety concerns, including lead content, has raised alarm bells world-wide.
This issue is a concern to all, because public health and safety is at stake.
An updated directive is critical to protecting our domestic interests, and children's health.
I call on the Commission to take action on the problem of dangerous products and consider an alternative regulatory approach.
Chinese authorities must take appropriate action to improve their standards of production, but equally important is the duty of toy companies, who order products from the Far East in order to benefit from lower costs, to ensure that safety standards are met.
Product safety is a matter of public health and this issue needs immediate attention.

Restructuring of the sugar industry (vote)
- Report: Batzeli
- Before the vote on Amendment 8:
(DE) Mr President, this proposal concerns the investment held by farmers in the restructuring fund and the Committee has approved the wording: '...50% of the relevant restructuring aid ...'
I should like to change it to 25%.
This has been agreed with the other groups and I hope that this can be adopted.
(The oral amendment was accepted.)
- Before the vote on the legislative resolution:
(DE) Mr President, on behalf of our Group I would like to request referral back to the Committee in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The reason is that we have just agreed on a 25% investment by the sugar beet growers in the restructuring fund, but the Commission is insisting on 10%.
In the latest version the Member States were able to go beyond this.
This too has now been abolished.
We were already considering on the last occasion whether we ought to be asking for referral back to the Committee at this point and therefore allowed ourselves to be satisfied with 10%.
We ought not to be doing so once again!
Our only opportunity - because we are in a consultation procedure - to get into discussion with the Commission, is to refer the report back now and to negotiate with the Commission and Council.
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I do not believe it is right to take this back to committee.
I think we want to make the decision.
We need to get on with the restructuring, and so I would not want to bring this back to committee, and I am afraid I am against what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf wants to do.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I do not agree with the proposal by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
I would like to make myself perfectly clear to the House: we have just voted for a proposal on the basis of which for the first time all producers are being given a lump sum of EUR 260 plus EUR 25.
Thus the total subsidy is almost in the region of EUR 400.
From a financial point of view, this is balanced, and I believe that it will help the sector as a whole.
(The request for referral back to committee was rejected.)

Common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (vote)
- Report: Batzeli
- Before the vote on Amendment 1:
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, allow me to skip reading the technical text of the amendment - provided, of course, you do not agree with the policy issue which I put to you:
Article 10(2) of Regulation No 318/2006 is about the institution of a possible additional reduction in sugar quotas for the post-2010 period.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed the amendment in advance, before we could even know the results of the implementation of the new CMO in the Member States and in businesses.
The amendment suggests a linear reduction of 13.5% in the rate for the post-2010 period.
If, for example, the Commission proposes a reduction of 10% for the post-2010 period, there will be a problem.
My oral amendment is simply intended to send a message and provide a basic methodology to be adopted for the post-2013 period for a possible additional reduction.
The amendment will take into account the conduct of businesses, i.e., to what extent businesses have adapted to the status quo and the situation of the Member States.
(The oral amendment was not accepted.)

Explanations of vote
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague, Mrs Niebler, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel.
I wholeheartedly congratulate the European Commission, which negotiated this Agreement based on the principles of mutual benefit, reciprocal opportunities for participating in each party's programmes and activities in the areas covered by the Agreement, non-discrimination, effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights.
I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague, Mr Galeote, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising France to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on 'traditional' rum produced in its overseas departments and repealing the Council Decision of 18 February 2002.
The proposed decision authorises France to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on a significant quota of 'traditional' rum produced in its overseas departments from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012.
It increases the volume and duration of the tax arrangements currently applied to traditional rum because the situation has worsened over the last few years.
This is excellent news for cane-sugar-rum sector production, which is crucial to the economic and social balance of these territories.
I am pleased that this vote at first reading without amendment is opening the way to a swift adoption of this text and I recognise the important work done by my French colleague, Mrs Sudre, who staunchly defended this matter in the Committee on Regional Development.
The new tax arrangements take account of the fact that the competitiveness of traditional rum from the overseas departments has deteriorated considerably since 2001, and that support for the cane-sugar-rum sector is crucial to the economic and social balance of these regions.
The measure is proportional to the additional costs borne by the sector as a result of the handicaps associated with outermost region status, particularly remoteness, the small market and the difficult topography, which explains the high price of sugar cane.
The Commission opportunely took into account that 40 000 jobs depend directly or indirectly on sugar cane cultivation, across a total of 5 500 farms.
The new tax system should also contribute to the maintenance of ten distilleries in Guadeloupe, nine in Martinique, three in RÃ©union and one in French Guiana, as well as 22 000 jobs directly connected with rum production.
European aid will help ensure a trade outlet for rum from the overseas departments, resisting competition from ACP producers, and will benefit local producers who have been waiting for a positive sign, conscious of the extreme difficulties they face over the next few years, particularly following the devastation wrought by Cyclone Dean in the Antilles last month.
in writing. - (SV) I voted against Gerardo Galeote's report today.
France must not be allowed to favour rum producers in its overseas departments by lower taxes than permitted.
The best way to help agriculture in the less developed countries is through tariffs on agricultural products from all countries in the world and by scrapping the common agricultural policy (CAP).
In addition, excise duties on alcohol serve the purpose of moderating alcohol consumption.
The damaging effects of alcohol are exactly the same when the alcohol is produced in Guadeloupe or Martinique as when it is produced somewhere else.
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Mr Mayer on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on passenger hand-holds on two-wheel motor vehicles (codified version).
I am taking advantage of this explanation of vote to criticise the delay in the codification of European law.
With regard to this matter, the facts date back to 27 March 2003, when the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Directive 93/32/EEC on passenger hand-holds on two-wheel motor vehicles.
In its opinion of 26 June 2003 the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts stated that this proposal did indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it.
Yet it is only in September 2007 that we are voting on this codification. This is not right.
I call on the European Commission to accelerate the codification of European law.
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Mr Mayer on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles (codified version).
I am taking advantage of this explanation of vote to criticise the delay in the codification of European law.
The facts date back to 28 March 2003, when the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Directive 93/31/EEC on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles.
In its opinion of 26 June 2003 the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts stated that this proposal did indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it.
Yet it is only in September 2007 that we are voting on this codification. This is not right.
I call on the European Commission to accelerate the codification of European law.
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Mr Mayer on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (codified version).
I am taking advantage of this explanation of vote to criticise the delay in the codification of European law.
With regard to this matter, the facts date back to 5 September 2006, when the Commission presented the proposal for the codification of Council Directive 93/94/EEC of 29 October 1993 relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel vehicles.
I do not know whether this was referred to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts.
In any case, it is only in September 2007 that we are voting on this codification. This is not right.
I call on the European Commission to accelerate the codification of European law.
in writing. - (PT) We know that Community education and training statistics were developed in the past decade based on an informal agreement between the Member States as a response to the Council Resolution of 5 December 1994 on the promotion of education and training statistics in the European Union.
Those statistics are compiled by the Member States and forwarded to the Commission (Eurostat) annually on a voluntary basis through a joint action carried out with the OECD and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, usually referred to as the 'UOE data collection'.
Eurostat also collects data on education, training and lifelong learning through other sources in addition to data on vocational training in enterprises.
Now there is an attempt to have a new legal framework to regulate and formalise the production of Community statistics if there is to be a viable system for producing statistics in these sectors, but there were some gaps and some confusion which it was necessary to clarify during the Parliamentary debate.
The final text therefore appears to ensure greater transparency; it is also hoped that implementation will not impose undue administrative or financial burdens.
in writing. - (SK) I congratulate Nikolaos Sifunakis on his well-prepared report.
I voted unequivocally for the document submitted.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education in relation to a proposal to establish a European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning, I welcome this legislative initiative from the Commission.
I consider it important, in the effort we are making to emphasise education, vocational training and lifelong learning in the context of the Lisbon strategy, to ensure that there is also feedback in response to that effort and concrete steps in the field of education in the European Union.
Comparable statistics will establish a viable system for collating statistical data on education and lifelong learning.
We will have available to us the most meaningful possible statistical information which will help us focus attention on shortcomings or misplaced objectives in implementing Community education policy.
in writing. - (SV) The June List accepts the Commission's proposals and the European Parliament's amendments, provided the EU institutions respect the principle that education policy is a national matter.
However, in Amendment 7 the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament proposes that a reference should also be included to the 'Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union'.
There is no such thing.
The EU Member States have not adopted any such charter.
There was a reference to such a document in the draft Constitutional Treaty, which was rejected through the democratic process in the summer of 2005.
On the other hand, all the EU Member States have signed the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights.
This means that all EU citizens can assert their fundamental freedoms and rights in the European Court of Human Rights.
The EU charter represents the opposite of the 'leaner but keener' EU which is often mentioned in solemn speeches about subsidiarity.
The EU should concentrate on cross-border matters, but stay away from matters on which the individual Member States can take their own decisions or which are already regulated in other international treaties.
It follows that the proposal for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should be rejected, of course along with the 'new' Treaty for the EU.
in writing. - (DE) The statistics prove what we all know: a good education promises a higher income and protection against unemployment.
In this respect it is irresponsible of the EU constantly to allow in a vast number of unskilled migrants, who are then condemned to a life of unemployment and switch to moonlighting, as a result of which the low-wage sector comes under even greater pressure, who turn to crime or 'just' put pressure on the welfare state.
And if there really is a shortage of skilled workers, we should be training our own people instead of enticing cheap replacements from abroad with Green or Blue Cards, pushing wages down.
On this note it is important to have statistical data in order to be able to respond to undesirable trends.
(DE) Mr President, I abstained from voting on the Jarzembowski report since high-speed routes in Europe have been extended in recent years, mainly between major cities, and shorter routes have been most appallingly neglected, despite the fact that 90% of journeys are made on shorter routes.
On the one hand, Brussels is demanding that people become more mobile, and is wanting to shift traffic from road to rail, but on the other hand it is trying to bring into play precisely the opposite development with the magic formula of privatisation.
The EU needs to ensure that common standards and systems facilitate cross-border rail travel and important projects are promoted within the arterial roads.
In the end, however, it must understand that private investors do not have the welfare of the country and its people in mind, but ultimately only their profits and returns on their investment.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Georg Jarzembowski, partly because I hope that our excellent rapporteur will listen to the pensioners in Rome who, when I was leaving for Strasbourg, and knowing that this report was to be voted on, said to me: 'But Mr Fatuzzo, you haven't given an explanation of your vote for such a long time!
We would like you to tell the European Parliament, even if when you speak everyone is leaving, thinking about their own affairs and chatting, we would like you to tell the President, who is listening to you carefully, that passes should finally be produced for free movement throughout Europe, for the pensioners who want to see Europe with their own eyes after having spent so many years working to build it.
in writing. - (PT) The conclusion of the process of negotiation between the EP and the Council on what is euphemistically called 'the development of the Community's railways' establishes the beginning of the liberalisation of international passenger services from 1 January 2010.
We would point out that in previous readings in the EP we tabled proposals for rejection of this European Commission initiative.
However, the majority of the EP voted in favour of speeding up the liberalisation (and privatisation) of rail passenger services and attempted to include national passenger services as from 2017.
That attempt was not, however, successful and did not obtain the majority required for adoption.
The liberalisation of rail transport is an attempt to hand over the (most profitable) lines to large private interests by privatising the operation of those lines (in particular by means of concessions), promoting the creation of monopolies at the expense of public funds.
Rail transport is a strategic sector for a country's development because of its important role in the movement of goods and in the mobility of workers and of the population in general, and it has enormous benefits for the environment and for social and territorial cohesion.
What is required is the promotion and development of public rail transport systems in the various countries, not their privatisation.
That is why we voted against it.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for liberalisation of international transport as from 2010.
Two years after the law comes into force at the latest, the European Commission should examine the impact of the directive and discussion on opening it up further will then take place.
Competition will thus be allowed to a limited extent and national suppliers will not be at risk.
I am relieved that the European Parliament has argued against the automatic liberalisation of national rail transport in 2017.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of Georg Jarzembowski's report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways and Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure.
The Third Railway Package constitutes a very important element of the regulations on transport.
International passenger transport networks need to be opened up, and the European Commission should analyse the situation in the international passenger transport market with a view to taking a decision on further liberalisation which also covers national transport.
in writing. - (SV) I welcome the possibility of cross-border train traffic, but for a market to function properly competition must be on equal terms.
It is therefore unfortunate that the EU is forcing through legislation under which countries that have not yet deregulated railway transport are to be given the right to compete with operators on a deregulated market where international train services are concerned.
In practice this proposal gives state-aided railway companies the possibility of competing on a market where there is free competition, which in the long term poses the risk of deactivating market mechanisms.
I have therefore chosen to vote against this report.
State-aided railway companies should not be allowed to compete on a market with free competition.
in writing. - (PT) The proposal for a directive on the ' forms part of the 'Third Railway Package', which aims principally to promote the liberalisation of international rail passenger services.
Here too, it should above all be stressed that the first objective of this directive will be, through harmonisation, to remove any obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail passenger services which might derive from different rules on professional requirements in the sector within each country.
The measure will also favour worker mobility in the sector.
In addition to the important set of questions which such a directive poses, it must be stressed that the adoption of harmonised rules at Community level on the certification of workers in the rail sector of each country must never jeopardise more progressive rights or standards already established at the level of each Member State, or deny the prerogative of each Member State to establish those rights and standards.
Here, too, reality shows that it is the liberalisation and privatisation of rail services which has jeopardised workers' rights and reduced the number of workers in the rail sector, with serious consequences for the level of service provided.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for a standard driving licence for train drivers.
The harmonisation of training for drivers will also ensure greater safety in future on the railways.
A minimum age of 20 and an appropriate school education and language training are now compulsory as conditions for being allowed to work as a train driver in international rail transport.
The standardisation of training is key to a European rail network.
The driving licence issued in a Member State will be recognised in future by all the other Member States.
in writing. - (PT) The 'Third Railway Package', which aims principally to promote the liberalisation of international rail passenger services, contains a regulation on 'rail passengers' rights and obligations'.
Above all, we can state that the essential aim of this regulation is to remove any obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail passenger services which might derive from different rules on passengers' rights and obligations in the various countries.
In addition to stressing this first point - which is the central issue - we certainly consider that it is essential to safeguard passengers' rights, starting with the right to a public rail transport service provided by public undertakings in each country.
Reality shows that it is the liberalisation and privatisation of rail services that jeopardise passengers' rights: they have led to a deterioration in the services offered to the public and in the conditions for passenger mobility as well as an increase in fares; they have meant the loss of hundreds of kilometres of track, station closures, a reduction in the number of workers in the rail sector and a threat to their pay and to labour rights.
This is a disastrous policy opposed by workers and the public.
in writing. - I supported this report on the conciliation agreement on regulation of the rights and obligations of rail passengers.
This was originally intended to apply only to passengers on international journeys, and I am pleased that our views have been heeded, and that the rules will now include passengers on domestic journeys too.
From 2009, a reasonable set of basic rights will apply, including the right to accessible transport for people with reduced mobility.
In addition, I welcome the fact that a scheme of compensation in the event of delays will be introduced.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for a new passenger regulation as from 2009.
Among other things, the regulation governs compensation for major delays, companies' liability for passengers and their luggage, transport of disabled people and the information to be supplied by the rail companies.
In practical terms this means that, in the future, when there is a delay in cross-border transport of between 60 and 119 minutes, customers will be entitled to a refund of 25 % of the fare.
This rises to 50% for delays of more than two hours.
This does means more legal claims, but also greater certainty for rail customers.
It is now also up to the Member States to extend these rules to their national transport networks as soon as possible and not just after 15 years.
in writing. - This report on rail passengers' rights and obligations should be welcomed.
in writing. - (SV) Although the latest proposal does not impose such stringent requirements on train operators as previous ones, it still contains much too extensive provisions on everything from how tickets can be purchased (by telephone, on the internet and from ticket machines) to the liability of train operators for damage to passengers' luggage.
There is also detailed regulation of various forms of compensation in the event of delays (compensation levels, entitlement to meals etc.) and minimum requirements for information on what may be the cause of any delays.
I chose to vote against the proposal because the operators must be allowed to develop their own services on the basis of the protection which passengers themselves demand (and are prepared to pay for in the form of higher fares).
Furthermore the wide-ranging regulations are not proportionate to the value added which will be created by the replacement of regulations that already exist at Member State level in those countries which have opted for national legislation.
in writing. - (DE) Liberalisation of railways is not an end in itself; it must serve users and improve efficiency.
Liberalisation in international transport is a natural thing because no one country should be able to close itself off from another.
In national transport there can be no sense and no purpose in exposing the profitable lines to competition during liberalisation, whilst at the same time leaving the unprofitable lines to the public sector, with no compensation.
With this in mind, I am anxiously awaiting the application of the recently adopted regulation on public passenger transport.
Parliament was able to stand up to the Member States and the rail companies for the rights of passengers, which is a huge success for the citizens of the EU.
Particularly in transit countries like Belgium, a difference between international and national passengers would make no sense and would be unfair.
In this sense, the third railways package represents a step in the right direction, even though it will certainly not be the last.
in writing. - I will be voting for the compromise agreed by our rapporteurs with the Council of Ministers because I believe it is a step forward for the railway industry throughout the European Union, and is the best deal available to Parliament at this time.
However, the slow pace with which the railway industry works is not only frustrating but also acts as a very effective brake on the kind of radical action that is required to galvanise railways in many of our Member States.
A wide gulf exists between the railways of say France and Germany with those of Bulgaria and Romania.
This gap needs to be closed if we are to be serious about developing a railway system that is clearly Europe-wide.
Finally, whilst I welcome the agreement that all railways should be fully accessible within 15 years, is it not a sad fact and an indictment on our railway industry that many people of reduced mobility do not have access to their railway in the 21st century?
The railway industry is caught in a philosophy of 'can't do' rather than one of 'can do'.
I hope this package of measures at least moves us away from negativity and starts a more positive era for our railways.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163)
(PL) We have given our opinion on changes to the previous reform of the EU sugar market.
This reform was drawn up in 2005 and was supposed to restore equilibrium in this market.
Sadly I have the impression that all these proposals are considerably restricting sugar beet growing in order to carve out a place for cane sugar.
I am fundamentally opposed to this.
We cannot allow traditional sugar beet growing and sugar production in the European Union to be eliminated.
I think that the new proposal put forward by the European Commission in May 2007, which is intended to provide incentives for the withdrawal of almost 3.8 million tonnes of sugar from the EU market, will again fail to bring about the anticipated results.
If it comes to the threatened mandatory reduction in quotas in 2010, quota cuts cannot take into account changes in the size of quotas given up previously, voluntarily and for payment, to the restructuring fund, since in line with the aim of the reform, restrictions on production took place in less competitive regions, following receipt of appropriate financial compensation.
(CS) Mr President, unfortunately the proposed sugar reform has no positive outcome.
This is due to the fact that, although the sugar reform seems to be based on economic factors, when the interested parties consider leaving the market they tend to take other factors into account.
Although the Czech Republic produces sugar on a profitable basis, we still renounced 22% of the quota: this quota is in the hands of Western Europe.
Unfortunately, the measures proposed may have a negative impact on the Czech Republic.
The same factors that make sugar production in our country profitable and give us the edge, such as the fact that the holdings of individual sugar beet growers are higher on average, may, in the light of these proposals, become a disadvantage if the farmers have the right to leave the market.
A situation whereby those who need no subsidies to survive are leaving the market is hardly desirable.
In this regard, the reform is moving in the wrong direction.
That is why I voted against both reports by the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when the vote was held today I voted, together with my colleagues in the Czech Civic Democratic Party, against the reports by the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, on the reform of the sugar regime.
So far this reform has damaged the Czech Republic: many sugar factories have closed and machinery and technology have lost their value.
For many centuries my country had a tradition of sugar production and export.
Now, because of a poor European Union policy, we have become a net sugar importer; that is the result of incompetent decision-making in Brussels.
The Czech Republic has already decreased its sugar production by more than 20%.
Other Member States of the European Union should do the same now, particularly the states that have not yet decreased their production at all.
These are the reasons why I voted against the reform.
(LT) Ladies and gentlemen, the restructuring of the sugar industry and the changes in the organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are necessary.
However, it is possible that the Commission's proposal will not solve problems but create even more in some countries' sugar market.
If a country is not able to set the priority order of criteria for the acceptance of growers' applications itself, taking into account farm productivity and the amount of production, it is possible that not only farms with the lowest productivity but also the competitive growers will stop producing sugar beet.
In Lithuania's situation, sugar factories may face a shortage of raw sugar and this would have negative economic and social consequences.
Moreover, the Commission has not considered Lithuania's proposal to reduce the quota until 2010, taking into account not only whether a Member State voluntarily reduces its production quota, but also whether it has bought a supplementary production quota.
I would encourage the Commission to take account of the remarks made.
Incidentally, I abstained in the vote on this project.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted against Parliament's report on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.
Basically we are favourably disposed to a reform of the Community sugar sector.
However, we do not think that Parliament's proposed amendments add anything positive to the Commission proposal.
We think that they pose the risk of cost increases in a sector of agriculture which is already far too large, something that we Swedish Social Democrats can never support.
In addition, we think that export subsidies for sugar must be completely removed in the long term.
Subsidies which continue to be paid to agriculture should be given in the form of direct aid entirely decoupled from production.
in writing. - (SV) The June List supports a radical reform of the sugar markets in the EU with a view to liberalising them as quickly as possible and giving sugar-producing countries outside the EU the chance to compete on fair terms.
The amendments proposed by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs in this report are nothing more than a further attempt to impede the rate of reform as much as possible so that a protectionist trade policy can continue.
The amendments would also mean an increase in the cost of the industrial restructuring of existing refineries which the reform would involve, at the same time as more generous direct compensation to players on the sugar market.
The June List can never give its backing to a report which frustrates the purposes of reforms to the sugar market in the EU and which would inevitably dilute those reforms as well as jeopardise their completion.
We oppose blatant attempts to renege on commitments which have been made to less developed countries.
For the above-mentioned reasons, therefore, we vote against this report.
in writing. - (PT) Reality has shown that in this as in other sectors, persuading small growers to renounce quotas and abandon production - as proposed for sugar beet and sugar production - with a view to promoting competition, has adverse effects; it accentuates development inequalities and will increase poverty and the exodus from the countryside.
We therefore object to the European Commission's proposals and stress the need to reverse this policy and take account of the specific reality of the Member States and their production needs.
We therefore support food sovereignty and hence consider it unacceptable that a country such as Portugal, with only very limited sugar production, scarcely able to supply half the country's consumption need should be confronted with the obligation to reduce its quota for sugar produced from sugar beet.
We consider it essential for the liberalising trend seen in successive CAP reforms to be reversed and measures to be taken to maintain national sugar beet production, supporting agriculture that is essentially focused upon food production and thus helping to safeguard the two factories' production as well as employment.
in writing. - (CS) The European Union is often justifiably criticised for interfering in a range of industrial sectors.
Particularly controversial is its interference in the affairs of the food processing industry.
It is true that some Member States create their own problems.
A classical example is the strenuous effort by a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe to liquidate cooperative farms even though they are prosperous.
In the Czech Republic several amended laws governing cooperative farming have been trying to achieve exactly this.
Many cooperative farms have fallen apart and others have transformed into different legal entities.
At the same time production has decreased in a range of industries, for example in the sugar beet growing industry.
Furthermore, processing has unfortunately become detached from production as a result of privatisation.
Most sugar factories have been acquired by foreign parties.
This has resulted led to a disastrous situation in the sugar industry in the Czech Republic: the profits end up in the pockets of the foreigners while the losses hit the people of the Czech Republic.
There has been more than a 20% decrease in sugar production in a country that had been exporting sugar for 150 years.
Now the country must begin to import sugar and at the same time look for new opportunities for the farms that have been growing sugar beet until now.
This untenable situation is not solved by Mrs Katerina Batzeli's reports; however, we voted in favour of them because they at least draw attention to the unsatisfactory situation.
I would add a word of warning to those who see today's texts as a solution to the problem.
I trust that we will return to the sugar issue and that the next time we will be able to respond more successfully to our farmers' needs.
in writing. - I support the report on reform of the sugar sector, although there are some areas of concern with this report.
I do not agree with the report in its intent to apply the process of withdrawal of sugar surplus to cane refiners.
This is in contrast to the Commission proposal to exclude cane refining from the withdrawal process.
As the refiners are not directly part of the restructuring scheme, to reduce by withdrawal the refiners' traditional supply needs (TSNs) would have no effect on reducing the surplus of sugar on the EU market, because the EU would still have to meet its international obligation to import specified quantities of raw sugar from ACP countries.
The amendment would, however, tend to weaken the impact of the measure in providing incentives to beet processors to dismantle their plant.
in writing. - I shall be voting in favour of the report that has been prepared by Ms Batzeli, because it is quite obvious that a restructuring of the sugar industry is required.
My only concern relates to Amendment 31, which, if passed, would still commit the European Commission to keeping the existing fund open up to 2011, and would be a negative aspect of this restructuring process.
This report, whilst not perfect, nevertheless strikes a balance between the needs of the producers and the obvious need to reform this sector.
My only concern regards the effect any restructuring could have on sugar cane producers from developing countries.
At all costs we must avoid a restructuring that protects beet producers at the expense of cane producers and I would hope that the Commission will ensure that this does not happen, whilst still being fair to our own farmers.
in writing. - When voting on agriculture reports such as this report on sugar, Members with a financial interest should declare it or decline from voting.
We should support the EU's commitment to achieving the ambitious goal of generating 20% of total energy consumed in Europe from renewable sources by 2020.
Renewable energy offers numerous advantages for Europe: lower CO2 emissions, reduced European dependency and a contribution to job creation and growth.
However, we need to monitor the development of all renewable energy from the point of view of sustainability, depending of course on the capacities of the Member States, as well as saving energy through lower consumption and increased energy efficiency.
I regret that the Directive on electricity from renewable energy sources does not make cogeneration compulsory and will lead to the building of large-scale biomass power stations without cogeneration, which are not energy efficient and destabilise the market in timber for both industrial and energy generation purposes.
There are examples of this in my own region, Limousin.
I am pleased therefore that the European Parliament is asking for a proposal on the heating and cooling sectors to be central to the future Framework Directive on renewable energies and I therefore voted in favour of the Thomsen Report.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Thomsen report on the Roadmap for Renewable Energy in Europe, since I believe that increasing investment in renewable energy is essential to reduce the European Union's external energy dependence, cut CO2 emissions, and therefore help to combat climate change.
This report underscores the importance of the sustainable use of biofuels in the transport sector in order to reduce oil dependency and greenhouse gas emissions, thus lessening the environmental impact.
in writing. - (PT) This is a very unbalanced report, despite some positive changes compared with previous reports, in particular in that it admits that fossil energy sources will inevitably run out in the near future - although it makes no mention of high oil prices - and in that it recognises the environmental and social harm associated with the recently deified agrofuels.
However, it then forgets the need for a different set of energy policy priorities geared towards reducing costs for consumers, rationalising consumption in order to reduce it (and not merely through energy efficiency), less polluting public transport and a public policy that is genuinely in the peoples' interest.
The idea of setting up a Common European Energy Policy is an attempt to find ways of providing greater support for the sector's private financial groups, overriding the sovereign right of every Member State to set its own energy policies.
It also omits to analyse gaseous biofuels; it fails to stress the need to encourage research into and development of biogas and does not mention the Target 2020 Programme.
That is because the main objective of the report is to guarantee ever greater profits, specifically by using the market in greenhouse gas emissions trading.
I voted in favour of this report, which encourages Member States to take the necessary measures to increase the share of renewables in their energy mix.
Renewables must become the 'stepping stone' to reaching the dual objective of increased security of supply and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
The energy efficiency objective should not be seen as a precondition for achieving the 20% renewables target by 2020, but as a condition in its own right.
This will create new jobs and encourage research and innovation in the energy sector.
I am thinking for example of research into increasing access to environmentally-friendly housebuilding materials.
Renewable energy is one of the best ways of protecting consumers and industry from the dual effects of increased energy imports and rising fuel costs.
Finally, I am pleased about freedom to choose the most appropriate renewable energy sources given that the potential to develop certain renewable energies varies because of the particular geological, hydrological and climatic conditions in each Member State.
in writing. - I supported the Thomsen report and strongly believe that more effort should be directed towards the promotion of renewable energy.
My own country, Scotland, has immense potential in the field of renewable energy and the Scottish government has recently signalled its intention to promote as diverse a range of renewable technologies as possible.
I believe that Scotland's efforts have a vital role to play in the EU's targets for renewable technology.
I voted against setting a 10% target for plant fuels, and in favour of calls for a full impact assessment before considering any possible biofuels target.
Biofuel production can accelerate global warming by speeding up the destruction of forests, peatlands, healthy soils and other ecosystems which are carbon sinks and which help to regulate the climate.
in writing. - (CS) I adore amateur performances.
It does not matter much what subject the amateur covers, with his ideological blinders on: the result is always the same.
A black and white description of reality; ecstatic conclusions divorced from the world of facts.
In addition, in the course of practical application sometimes there are high costs and 'unexpected problems'.
Especially charming are the speeches by some of my fellow Members on such attractive topics as biomass and biofuels, which consume high levels of energy during the transportation of raw materials, processing and product distribution: as experience shows, this is a basic fact.
In order to reduce costs we should build small production units supplying local neighbourhoods with alternative fuels.
I must stress that these sources cannot provide the solution to our power supply situation.
They only offer a relatively slight improvement on the current situation.
The same is true of the rainwater harvesting systems that are becoming very popular and a number of other renewable energy resources.
In the next 10 years large cities and industry will depend on large-scale energy production and on natural gas.
If we want to meet the Kyoto Protocol commitments, the countries with a rapidly growing gross domestic product will also have to build large power plants.
This can mean only one thing: more nuclear power plants.
Otherwise the European Union will soon become highly dependent on energy imports.
The daydreams of romantic amateurs will not change this fact.
in writing. - (IT) I supported the Thomsen report, which confirms the need to obtain 20% of energy from renewable energy sources by 2020.
This will be a major challenge for every European country, and we must no longer seek to evade the challenge or require only the most virtuous and far-seeing Member States to meet it.
I think differentiated national objectives need to be set, allocated fairly with regard to the existing levels of renewable energies, the energy mix and the differing development potentials that result from varied climate, geological and territorial conditions in the Member States.
Renewable sources represent the future.
Investment in innovation and technology will need to be huge in order to allow Europe to resolve the problem of energy dependency within a reasonable time-frame, guaranteeing affordable prices for users.
I believe, however, that we ought to be pragmatic, and avoid succumbing to hypocrisy.
Imagining that the production of renewable energy will by itself allow us to meet such ambitious targets is unrealistic, although the preconceptions and often ideological ideas of certain left-wing and Green politicians may convince us otherwise.
What can save Europe in the medium term is an energy mix which also includes energy sources that are not wholly renewable, such as nuclear power, which, like it or not, accounts for one third of Europe's electricity production.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (NL) In view of the fact that our party, the Dutch Socialist Party, attaches great importance to renewable energy sources and feels that action must be taken on a much wider scale in this respect, we have not voted against this report.
However, it contains a few very negative issues.
We strongly reject nuclear energy as a sustainable, renewable source of energy.
In addition, we are opposed to the idea that energy markets must be liberalised at European level.
Finally, we are of the opinion that solar energy, wind energy and water energy are better alternatives to biofuels.
in writing. - (EL) The Commission's proposal to set a production target of 20% of total energy from renewable sources, which must be achieved by each Member State and must be included in national action plans, would have been acceptable were it aiming to meet people's needs, reduce energy dependency, save energy, protect the environment and confirm that energy products are a public asset and not a commodity.
The EU guidelines, however, are aimed at profitability for investors and using renewable energy to pave the way for private capital, while guaranteeing the profitability of renewable energy.
Although renewable sources of energy are natural and inexhaustible, and they contribute to reducing the use of pollutants, the environment continues to be ruined in the name of profit.
An example is the uncontrolled promotion of wind farms for private profit, even in areas protected by NATURA.
As a result, the environment is a hypocritical pretext concealing the liberalisation of the energy sector and its effects on the people's interests.
Energy is being dealt with as a commodity rather than as a common asset.
As for biofuels, it is a provocation to use food products for energy and not to feed the hungry when millions of people are starving to death.
in writing. - (DE) Even though the promotion of renewable energy is important, this should not be a pretext in relation to the EU Constitution for reducing even further the sovereign rights of Member States by the back door.
Since this point has unfortunately not found its way into the present report, and no clarification has been made, I must therefore reject the present report.
Concentration on expensive nuclear power plants has obstructed the development of other energy technologies for far too long.
The nuclear research budget is still seven to eight times higher compared with funds for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
If the EU really is serious about renewable energy sources with its roadmap, it must provide a fairer distribution of subsidies here, but there is no indication of this in the report on which we are voting either.
in writing. - (PT) Increasing consumption is a sign of a generalised (if not always balanced) improvement in living conditions.
Measures aimed at combating the negative effects of increasing consumption should therefore bear in mind that one of the factors in the equation - that growth cannot be altered.
That then leaves the possibility of acting on two fronts: rationalising of consumption and improving the efficiency (particularly energy efficiency) of what we produce.
That means that much of what we need to try to achieve depends upon research and innovation.
The approved resolution quite rightly stresses that 'renewable sources of energy are a key element in a sustainable energy mix, contributing to: reduced import dependency and diversification of the fuel mix; lower CO2 and other emissions; the development of new innovative technologies; and employment and regional development opportunities'; one of the conclusion's drawn is that greater use should be made of the EU's research and technology programmes to encourage the development of renewable energy technologies.
To sum up: I agree with the approach taken and am in favour of increasing investment to this end.
That is the main reason why I voted in favour of the report.
We fully support the promotion of renewable energy, whether for transport, heating or electricity generation.
Like all our fellow Members, we see it as a way of protecting the environment, but also of reducing our energy dependence.
However, we cannot support Mrs Thomsen's report.
First of all, her real aim is not ecological or even economic, it is dogmatic: as indicated in the explanatory statement, the aim is to introduce a common European energy policy, and this must take precedence over everything else.
However, energy policy, a matter of sovereignty and independence, should fall solely under national competence. In no way does this prevent cooperation and solidarity.
In addition, the proposals in the report do not seem sufficient to guarantee that national circumstances will be properly taken into account: not only geographical characteristics, but also specific economic constraints.
The text is also silent on the ways of helping countries that are least advanced in this area to achieve a binding, universal target.
I say yes to renewables, but not as a pretext for extending the powers of the European Union.
in writing. - Renewable energy in Europe is an important issue, which, in my mind, does not get the recognition it fully deserves.
In this era of energy crisis, global warming and diminishing stocks of the most traditional fossil fuels, it is right that Parliament should examine a better use of renewable energy.
However, I would also like to point out that we still have large reserves of coal throughout the EU and, with the development of clean coal technology, I pose the question whether or not our abandonment of coal, as a source of energy, was premature?
I will support this report, but I think we must be realistic in what can be achieved with wind or wave energy, especially when matched up with the ever-increasing energy demands of the EU.
I think it is right to ask the Commission to draw up action plans involving renewable energy including wind, wave and solar power generation, as well as developing a strategy for biofuels.
Although in regard to this, we must ensure that we do not save the planet, environmentally, only to see its population starve to death, which is why the committee's call for a fair balance between food and energy production is a correct stance to take.
in writing. - In my country, Ireland, residential energy accounted for about 25 % of the total final energy consumption.
A large proportion of this energy accounted for was connected to the consumption of energy for heat.
Energy consumption in the domestic sector is greater than necessary, as people living in inefficient dwellings must consume more energy to heat their homes.
Improving a household's energy efficiency status can often be achieved by taking some relatively simple and inexpensive steps, such as fitting thermostatic valves onto radiators or using more energy efficient household appliances.
Other measures include installation of full central heating systems, or the provision of insulation in cavity walls or lofts.
These latter options can be more disruptive in the short term, but their impact is long lasting.
I would like to call on governments to promote insulation in housing and the other measures that I have mentioned.
In promoting these measures one can save in energy costs whilst helping the environment.
The VAT reduction on renovation should be promoted by governments.
Better insulation would cut the residential energy consumption down by up to 5 %.
in writing. - I can vote for this report and believe that its overall objectives are balanced against the back-drop of continued concern over energy security.
Renewables are an important aspect of our future electricity generation but still we need to work with existing energy production.
If the EU can put its emphasis on the technology necessary to take it into the 21st century, it will also enjoy a competitive edge in this sector in the years to come.
in writing. - (NL) The report on the roadmap for renewable energy is a clever piece of work.
It clearly states that the coming years are crucial and that a legislative framework is needed to support the codecision procedure in order to raise the current share of 7% renewable energy in the energy mix to 20% in 2020.
The report rightly emphasises the enormous potential of offshore wind energy: a possible contribution of 15% of the total EU energy demand by 2020, which could lead to the creation of 368 000 jobs.
The necessary question marks have rightly been placed alongside the development of biofuels, certainly in relation to the necessity for sustainable production methods and the reasonable balance between food and energy production.
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance would have put it somewhat more sharply and therefore request that a serious analysis be carried out into the effects of biofuels on the climate, the environment, the social structure and a secure food supply.
It is unfortunate that in the report, the target for biofuels remains unchanged at 10%.
Another minus point in the report is Recital E, in which the nuclear lobby proposes nuclear energy as a 'bridge' technology.
The Greens disagree with this and therefore submitted Amendment 2.
Overall, this is a thorough report that merits our support.

Implementation of the Council decision on the moratorium against death penalty (debate)
The next item is the Council statement on the implementation of the Council decision on the moratorium against the death penalty.
Madam President, I am very pleased to be here today speaking on an issue that is central to our common European values.
Opposition to the death penalty is an integral part of the EU's human rights policy and was the subject of the first EU human rights guidelines.
Those guidelines, as you well know, ladies and gentlemen, have since 1998 set out the main aspects of the EU approach to that question, thus crystallising our well-known opposition to the death penalty.
We might recall the Union's objectives on the death penalty, as enshrined in the guidelines.
The first objective is to work towards universal abolition of the death penalty as the policy view agreed and strongly held by all EU Member States.
The second objective is, for countries where the death penalty still exists, to call for its use to be progressively restricted and to insist that it be carried out according to minimum international standards.
I am very pleased to be in this Chamber today to tell you of the latest developments in our fight to abolish the death penalty.
As you know, we recently launched an important initiative to promote these EU objectives.
I am, of course, referring to the Council's decision of 18 June this year in which the European Union committed itself to introducing a resolution against the death penalty at the 62nd UN General Assembly as part of a cross-regional alliance.
Parliament called for the European Union to take such an initiative in two resolutions adopted this year in February and in April.
Since the opening of the third session of the United Nations General Assembly is rapidly approaching, I realise that you will want to know how the Council has been preparing for that event.
I shall tell you a little more in a few moments about the preparations we have in hand.
Before that, let me look back briefly over the period of almost 10 years since the guidelines on the death penalty were adopted.
I should stress that we have achieved a great deal since 1998.
We have developed a broad range of instruments in our campaign against the death penalty, from political action by means of demarches, declarations and multilateral diplomacy to financial support through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, an instrument created essentially thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament.
For example, between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007, the European Union made general demarches on the death penalty in 28 countries, from Bahrain to Zambia; we also made demarches on individual cases in various countries from Yemen to Iran; furthermore, there are frequent EU declarations on this subject.
To give you an example which received fairly wide media coverage: in August this year the European Union issued a declaration on the 400th execution in Texas.
I should also like to point out that the death penalty is also on the agenda of the human rights dialogues and consultations which we hold with third countries and we do not shy away from raising the question with any of them.
Our confidence in effective multilateralism also takes the form of tireless action against the death penalty within the United Nations and other international bodies.
Every year from 1997 to 2005, the European Union submitted a resolution on the death penalty to the UN Commission on Human Rights and, re-launching our action in December 2006, the EU submitted a statement on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly initially bearing 85 signatures and later signed by 10 more countries.
The Presidency of the European Union reiterated that December 2006 declaration at the opening of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council in March 2007.
Despite the continuing concern about the use of the death penalty, we are very pleased to note a global trend towards abolition or introducing a moratorium on the death penalty.
More than half the countries in the world have already abolished capital punishment either by law or in practice: 133 countries, according to Amnesty International.
I should like to believe that the European Union, including of course the European Parliament, has played a role, if only a modest one, in that trend towards abolition through our systematic and sustained action over the years.
This brief list of the European Union's actions against the death penalty is proof of our commitment to this cause and let me stress that we acknowledge that the European Parliament has been a loyal ally in our work, which brings me back to our current agenda item, that is, the resolution for the UN General Assembly calling for a moratorium and the abolition of the death penalty.
This initiative confirms that the European Union is at the forefront of abolitionist efforts throughout the world and that it will continue to oppose the death penalty in all cases and under any circumstances, since it considers it to be a cruel and inhuman punishment.
There is a lot to be gained with this initiative, but also a lot to lose if we are not successful.
We must not forget that this is our third attempt, I repeat, our third attempt to obtain a resolution on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly following our two failures in 1994 and 1999.
What is at stake is nothing more and nothing less than our credibility as leaders of the global efforts to abolish the death penalty.
That was why the Council considered it necessary to be well prepared and to have enough time to form a cross-regional alliance.
That would not have been possible at the time of the 61st General Assembly, as some of you would have preferred.
It was not only the Council's experts who were of that opinion.
Several NGOs which lead the fight in this field, such as the Coalition Against the Death Penalty, asked us not to be too hasty in submitting the resolution but to wait long enough to guarantee its success.
That was exactly the path we followed.
The Council decision of 18 June to introduce a resolution at the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly marked the beginning of a new phase in the multilateral sphere.
The Council, the Presidency and the Member States have each played their role to put the Council's decision into practice.
Even before the summer holiday the CFSP Working Party on Human Rights had decided on the approach to be taken - that is, for the EU Member States to agree on a draft text and, in a second phase, find other co-authors from various regions of the world; that was done, so that at the end of August there was a first meeting with all the co-authors in New York.
Within the space of two weeks agreement was reached on the wording.
We are now launching a lobbying campaign to have co-sponsors of our draft resolution.
As I speak, our embassies throughout the world are sounding out possible supporters of our initiative.
We are doing everything possible to win maximum support in order to make this resolution a success.
In that spirit, ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your confidence and support to enable us to carry out that process.
You will certainly be aware how difficult political negotiations can be.
You will therefore understand that the Presidency needs a certain degree of flexibility and room for manoeuvre to manage and find the appropriate timetable for an initiative of such complexity, because this is a cross-regional initiative and the co-authors must also review the text and the strategy of this resolution; moreover, we must quickly make contact with a large number of possible co-sponsors, so that the initiative gains weight.
We have embarked upon a campaign which is also a great challenge, but I am convinced that if we take concerted action we shall make this initiative a success.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) Madam President, Commissioner, Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, today here in the European Parliament we are returning to the issue of a moratorium on capital punishment.
We have already considered this issue twice over the last year, with two resolutions on the implementation of a global moratorium on capital punishment being adopted (on 1 February and 26 April).
We can only regret that in the case of each of these resolutions the European Parliament addressed the Council, encouraging it to submit the resolution to the General Assembly of the United Nations, but the Council has not yet done so.
The Council could do this before the start of the session of the 62nd General Assembly and it would be possible to adopt the resolutions before the end of this year.
Capital punishment is a cruel and inhuman kind of punishment infringing one of the inherent human rights - the right to life - and we really cannot tolerate a situation where thousands of people face capital punishment every year in Iran and China and other countries.
Therefore, the implementation of a global moratorium on capital punishment seeking to fully abolish it remains one of our most important political aims and we therefore require not only the consensus of our parliamentary groups on this issue, but also the consensus of all EU Member States.
I am sure that in adopting this resolution the European Parliament could show extraordinary solidarity and consensus, despite a difference of opinion, for example regarding the declaration of 10 February as the European Day against the Death Penalty.
The European Parliament has a golden opportunity to demonstrate cohesion and solidarity to the Council, especially when taking a decision on a political issue that has clear added value.
Politics without value is just cheap politicking and populism, while human life is valuable to us all, irrespective of geographical or cultural divides.
I truly encourage my fellow members in all groups to support this important resolution.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, State Secretary Lobo Antunes has convincingly demonstrated the Council's efforts here.
I have nothing to add to what the Minister has said.
Our Group supports you fully in your efforts to make it clear that the European Union wants to give strong backing not just to a moratorium, but to the aim of banning the death penalty throughout the world.
As the previous speaker has said, the European Parliament has already said twice this year: this Parliament is spearheading the battle to ban the death penalty.
For us as European Social Democrats, the death penalty is the lowest point in human ethics.
I come from a country in which human dignity is the first article of the constitution.
The duty of each and every government regulation is to preserve and protect it.
That is the message of my country's constitution.
On the basis of that message we in the European Union have drawn up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the prime message of which is as above: human dignity is the foremost guiding principle of the European Union.
Simply put, the death penalty is the opposite of human dignity.
It is the vilification of the human being down to the lowest point of his or her existence.
The duty of each and every morally-driven democrat is to ban it.
We are fighting for this moratorium to be supported by the European Union.
Why, then, is there no consensus in the Council?
There is one Member State in the Council boycotting a joint resolution of the European Union.
I shall not hesitate in naming it publicly here.
It is the Polish government, which does not want us to make this fundamental decision.
It is linking the issue of the death penalty with other issues and saying: when the others link their opinion on this issue with that on abortion and euthanasia, then we too will be prepared to argue against the death penalty.
That is a pretextual argument!
Why?
I'll gladly tell you.
I should like to read a quotation to you, which comes from a radio interview of 28 July this year.
I quote: "I personally was, am and remain an advocate of the death penalty.
A return to this penalty is not possible at present, but I am counting on the fact that a more favourable climate will prevail in the EU in future.â
Lech KaczyÅski, President of the Republic of Poland.
That is the reason why there has been no European Council resolution to date on this moratorium.
The Polish President is an advocate of the death penalty and he hopes that there will be a better climate in the European Union for re-introducing it.
I therefore say: this Parliament is there to ensure that the climate in Europe remains against the death penalty.
That is the crucial point.
(Applause)
As long as we as European Socialists have influence, we shall do this.
I would ask the Council one question, however: Mr Lobo Antunes, not of you personally, but of the Heads of State and Government of the other 26 States.
How long will the other 26 Heads of State and Government put up with this and remain silent about the fact that an advocate of the death penalty, who states quite openly that he is so, is able to paralyse the European Council on this issue?
We need an answer to this, too.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the statements that the Presidency has been making to this Parliament for a year would seem - if we were a parliament such as the British parliament or the United States parliament, for instance - like an offence not only against the truth but also against Parliament.
No, President-in-Office of the Council, I think that you have been misinformed by the apparatus and structure which is behind you at the moment, and which since 1994 has been adopting an unworthy and incomprehensible approach, for which the six-monthly Presidencies that follow one another are responsible, or manage to make themselves responsible!
In 1994 we were on the verge of winning.
We lost by 8 votes, because 20 European countries which are now members of the European Union collaborated with each other and abstained.
The universal moratorium could have been proclaimed throughout the world, had it not been for that disgrace, which we should not dismiss: 20 European abstentions, in 1994, with a Council that was fully and hypocritically complicit.
You, President-in-Office of the Council, also had the impudence to say in 1999 - according to all the European ambassadors we had won because there was a very large absolute majority - on the morning of the vote, a telegram arrived from Brussels telling us to withdraw.
This was inexplicable!
In 2003 the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, then occupying the Council Presidency, declared that because of a lack of agreement by the European Union, Italy was not taking forward the resolution on which we again had a majority.
Now, the state of affairs is more shocking.
Do you understand, though, Mr Antunes?
In which country could we tell a tall story like this?
You say that 173 of 192 UN Member States have abolished the death penalty in fact and in law.
All this is your immense exertion!
You ought to have tabled a resolution in the 61st Assembly, the previous one, you ought to have tabled one at the beginning of this one, that is, yesterday, and already the news we have today from New York is of further postponements.
You also told another small or serious untruth: it is true that 95 countries have signed a declaration, and that on 28 December we, as the Italian Government, already had 85 signatories and what you have achieved we actually achieved together, namely only 11 more.
So if you want to lose, go ahead, but it is a shame, we will do...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, seeking humanitarianism in the administration of justice is one of Europe's important missions.
We need to stand up against public show executions in which the remains of the executed person become an unhealthy object of excitement for the crowds.
We must do everything we can to oppose executions carried out to political order from the authorities in China or Iran.
What we cannot agree to, however, is a narrow understanding of this whole problem.
In particular, we cannot agree to a termination of discussion on this subject.
We cannot agree to the kind of censorship proposed by Mr Schulz in his speech.
It is not up to him how long Lech KaczyÅski remains President of Poland, no matter how much he wishes it were.
It depends on the Poles, who have their own doubts.
And it is not just the Poles who have doubts about the global moratorium, or about the propaganda and social campaigns proposed by the Commission.
I have one question - is it in fact possible, from a comfortable government seat in Paris or Lisbon, to dispatch an appeal for the suspension of capital punishment to regions that are rife with cruelty and violence?
Is it not hypocrisy to expect capital punishment to be abolished today in Iraq or Afghanistan while doing nothing to restore security and justice in these countries?
I do not share the conviction that abolition of capital punishment in other parts of the world will provide a solution to violence and brutality.
Anyway, Poland abolished the death penalty in 1988, nearly twenty years ago now.
We did this in the face of our own public opinion.
We did it in the name of European unity.
We want to continue supporting that decision today.
It may be that in fact our part of the world can permit itself alternatives to capital punishment.
We wish to show solidarity by cooperating on this matter, in the UN forum too, but we cannot agree to European censorship on the death penalty as proposed by Mr Schulz.
The draft resolution makes unnecessary reference to the issue of the European Day against the Death Penalty.
May I remind you that the death penalty is not the only place where we run up against matters of life and death in politics and law.
If we are to conduct a dialogue in Europe on contemporary challenges to humanitarianism, we cannot restrict ourselves to the death penalty, on which we do, after all, have a common opinion.
We cannot avoid discussing abortion on request, which is also so keenly defended in Europe and around the world by this Parliament and Mr Schulz's club.
We cannot avoid discussing euthanasia, guarantees for human dignity, or the burgeoning development of biomedical science.
If one of the days on the European calendar is to be a day for reflection on the humanitarian aspect of the legislator's work, and also ours, we cannot just shut our eyes to all of this, or we shall descend into hypocrisy.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to continue along the lines already set out by Mr Pannella and I would ask the Presidency to give a reply, if possible.
I would like to know why the Presidency has withdrawn the request or the proposal to establish a European Day on the death penalty.
It is not written anywhere that this is a decision that must be taken unanimously.
If you can quote me a rule where this is stipulated, I would be grateful - although since we are talking about political cooperation, I am fully convinced that if you had wanted to, you would have been able to force a vote and obtain an overwhelming majority, minus one.
I believe that that would have been a great day for Europe.
Thus, an opportunity has been wasted.
Secondly, I too am very confused, Mr Antunes, about your reconstruction of the sad history of the various tablings and withdrawals of resolutions for a moratorium.
I would like you to answer a specific question: since you, as the Portuguese Presidency, have decided to act practically alone, excluding other countries such as my own from the United Nations negotiations - but that is not an issue for this forum - I would like to know when you are tabling the resolution.
This too is unclear, and if you table it too late it will be utterly useless.
Thirdly, you said two things that worried me slightly.
I was up in my room because I had a problem, but I listened to it in the original, in your marvellous language.
You said that it was necessary to have flexibility and to leave room for manoeuvre, and that is something that worried me greatly.
What do you mean?
Also, you spoke of the so-called front that seeks abolition and does not have any great belief in a moratorium.
This is even more worrying because it is precisely because of this false dichotomy that we have lost so far.
Therefore, I would like you to give us some specific answers, and I hope that these answers will be forthcoming.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was engrossed listening to Mrs Frassoni, whose questions and passion I completely share, and I also endorse what Mr Pannella said.
Today I am really sad; listening to the speech by Mr SzymaÅski truly distressed me.
To think that Europe - for which we have all battled, fought, and believed - is experiencing these obstacles - these positions - is truly a cause of sadness for us all.
Today, however, I am also sad because a great man, a historic Palestinian figure, died in Gaza of cancer, and it was not possible for him to be treated.
Gaza is under siege, but he would probably have died in any case because he was very old.
He was a man who believed deeply in peace, in democracy, in a democracy and a secular Palestine without violence.
His name was Haider Abdel Shafi and I would like to pay tribute to him here, because there are so many death penalties in the world against which we must fight.
I too support what the other Members were saying.
The session has opened and I hope that on 28 September, when the Portuguese Presidency and the Italian Government meet everyone, they will really decide to table the resolution in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty.
It is true that over the last 14 years the resolution has been compromised by mistakes and delays, if not outright obstructionism.
This time we can succeed, and we must do so.
Italy, together with Europe, will build a network of alliances spanning all the continents.
The vast majority of the international community is in favour of this resolution, while the countries backing the death penalty are few in number.
Certainly, the dichotomy between a moratorium and abolition of the death penalty ought not to be exploited.
We are in favour of abolition of the death penalty, but today it is the moratorium that can unite us and achieve a victory.
We know that it is difficult, we know that we cannot take it for granted and we can see this with the internal positions, not only that of Poland, but among citizens worldwide, and political leaders in Europe who call for the death penalty.
If, however, our view of international relations is founded on a moral framework of values in which human life and justice and rights prevail, then we must win.
Thus, the next few weeks will be crucial and a moratorium is truly a fundamental stage in the international community's repudiation of a barbaric practice that substitutes vengeance for justice.
We truly must succeed and isolate the voices that say 'no'.
Madam President, Members of the Council, in 1977, under the Carter Administration, two probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, were launched into space. You may think this has nothing to do with our debate.
However, in these two probes, the late physicist Carl Sagan placed a message from President Waldheim, the drawing of a man and a woman, the principal mathematical formulas known on Earth, and a record with the sound of the wind, of a tractor, a baby, and extracts from Mozart, Beethoven and Chuck Berry.
Last year, these two probes left the solar system, or the 'heliosphere', as it is called, to travel 42 000 light years to the nearest star; in other words, 200 000 kilometres multiplied by 3 600, multiplied by 24, multiplied by 365, multiplied by 42 000.
In 30 years, these two probes have not sent back any signals, since none have been picked up.
For the time being, the only known life is on Earth.
From that perspective, it is evident that the penal codes of Texas or China, which can allow something as extraordinarily rare as life to be ended, are a real aberration.
By contrast, the Portuguese proposal for a conference about life and human dignity reflects the perspective of this nation of explorers, because to be opposed to the death penalty is only one aspect of the challenge and of the political teleology.
The aim of any policy can only be rich and diverse life.
To be against the death penalty is all very well, but it is only one aspect, as is euthanasia, of a central political problem: what is the point of politics?
To create the economic, social and physical conditions so that this mysterious thing called 'life' can flourish, or the Malthusian policy of no future, austerity pacts, rationing, prohibition, grubbing-up, Herod premiums, and the British foot-and-mouth slaughters and pyres?
This is the crux of the matter and the real scale of the death penalty: it is this political choice between no future and life.
(SK) I unequivocally support the initiative to introduce a European day against the death penalty, even if there is not a unanimous decision by the 27 Member States.
I welcome the introduction of this prohibition that was brought in recently, partially under pressure from the European Union, by certain African countries.
The death penalty has been abolished by Rwanda and Gabon, for example.
These countries, too, have come to the realisation that the death penalty has no place in a democratic society.
I believe that it is necessary to put pressure also on other countries, such as America and China, to consign this action to history.
On the other hand, it is also necessary to highlight certain European countries that have consistently failed to ratify the protocols prohibiting use of the death penalty.
Protocol No 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which unconditionally prohibits the death penalty in peacetime, has been ratified by all 27 Member States.
Protocol No 13, however, which prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances, has been signed by all 27 Member States but still not ratified by five, namely France, Italy, Poland, Spain and Latvia.
Therefore, even though today the main criticism regarding the introduction of a European day against the death penalty has been levelled at Poland, I fully agree with and support the view of Mr Schulze, Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Morgantini that the finger should also be pointed at those countries.
I would like to stress that there is no evidence to show that the death penalty has a deterrent effect on violent crime.
Its irreversible nature means that miscarriages of justice, which are unavoidable in any legal system, cannot be rectified.
(PT) I would remind you of what Victor Hugo said about blood being washed away with tears, not with blood.
When Europe set its values and made abolition of the death penalty one of the conditions for arriving and being here, it laid down a code of principles which mark it out as the home of enlightenment and as the area where no law exists without the moral basis of sublime human dignity.
The fight against the death penalty is the fight of civilisation against barbarity.
The fight against official, organised, calculated and cold-blooded death.
Death by rule, not by the rule of law, because the death penalty falls outside the limits of any law worthy of the name.
Death by means of a brutal and illegal rule.
The fight against the death penalty is a question of universal justice because it touches on the essence of mankind's humanity and determines our relations with the world.
This is why Europe cannot overlook the fact that countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan and the United States tragically share that barbarous mechanism of the death penalty.
Europe does not have the right to complicit silence about all this.
Neither can it remain silent as regards its own internal dynamics.
Europe must remind Poland that the fight against the death penalty is laid down in the a priori principles of justice which are the sine qua non of being European.
As regards the European Day against the Death Penalty, it would be appropriate to ask, and I am asking the Portuguese Presidency, under what circumstances is a country entitled to decide against the consensus values in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union?
I would also ask the Portuguese Presidency whether unanimity could be used for areas of consensus concerning the rules on which the Union is founded.
Is unanimity intended only for issues which divide us rather than for the fundamental consensus on which Europe is based?
Those are my questions for the Presidency and my thoughts about the European Day against the Death Penalty.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the third time this year the European Parliament is returning to the subject of a moratorium.
We believe that it is possible to achieve this objective by the end of the year, and that is why we are urgently asking the Portuguese Presidency to table the text in the next few hours with the relevant United Nations committee.
We ask it to do so in close collaboration with Italy, the country which initiated the campaign, and to associate with it not only the countries of the European Union but also all those that have shown willingness to be co-sponsors and co-authors.
I would also like once again to make it clear that the aim of the moratorium does not conflict with the more general aim of abolition and in any case it is a moratorium that we wish to obtain today, partly as a first concrete step towards abolition.
None of this must be allowed to muddy the waters!
Finally, I join with my fellow Members in disbelief that a European country as significant as Poland should have dissociated itself from declaring 10 October European Day against the death penalty and that as a result of this the Day has been put on hold.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, we ask you not to abandon this objective.
Please do not dissipate that little spirit that we have succeeded in introducing into a Europe that is still swayed too strongly by questions of economic policy, trade policy and monetarism.
(FR) Madam President, the number of abolitionist countries, or countries where a moratorium has been introduced, is growing each year.
People are wavering, even in States that still maintain the death penalty, such as the US, and coalitions are forming in Muslim countries.
Every day, steps are taken to avoid executions.
Homosexuality is still punishable by death in several countries and, unfortunately, the current European climate is a reminder that this remains a very difficult battle.
On the moratorium and the UN General Assembly, Parliament asks you, President-in-Office of the Council, for the third time this year, and in the most solemn way: we must do our utmost to obtain a resolution from the UN General Assembly as soon as possible and by the end of the year, with a view to a moratorium and a strategy for abolition.
I think we are all saying the same thing here: it is your move.
On the European Day against the Death Penalty, how do we explain why we have not said a word about the situation in Europe today?
How is it conceivable that a country can use this issue for political purposes, remaining out of step with the rest of Europe, with Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and out of step with perhaps the most longstanding common objectives of its external policy?
The institutions of the European Union, and you, as President-in-Office of the Council, cannot tolerate this situation.
The World Day against the Death Penalty is on 10 October.
The European Parliament will be meeting in a part-session in Brussels.
It is vital for Parliament to mark this event as solemnly and as resolutely as possible.
Madam President, I was very pleased to hear about the Commission initiative to establish a European Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October, and I fully support that initiative and urge all colleagues to support it, as many in this debate have done already.
It was shocking for me to realise that not all EU countries were in favour of this initiative.
Poland's position puts the credibility of the EU as a primary force for abolition in jeopardy and I sincerely hope that the Government of Poland will reconsider its position.
The death penalty is a cruel and inhuman punishment.
It is detrimental to human dignity and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the use of the death penalty serves as a deterrent against crimes.
Fortunately, the trend in the world is now towards abolition.
The whole of Europe, except for Belarus, is already on board, and more and more states from all continents are joining an ever-growing list of abolitionist countries.
I also think that we should continue to urge our American colleagues to abolish the death penalty once and for all.
A moratorium on executions is the first step towards abolition.
The EU must continue to urge all states that still maintain the death penalty to introduce a moratorium.
A resolution at the UN General Assembly against the death penalty will hopefully play an important role in this respect.
However, we should take care that the situation does not develop in the same way as in 1999, when Finland, my home country, tried to get the UN General Assembly to adopt the death penalty resolution.
It was watered down so much that it would have done more harm to the cause than good.
Now that Italy has put the issue back on the UN agenda I hope that the EU as a whole will back the proposal and we shall get a UN General Assembly resolution on this.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, I am obliged to commence this address with a personal reflection.
When I was listening, a moment ago, to the speech delivered in this Parliament by Konrad SzymaÅski, representing the Polish right wing, I was reminded of a scene from yesterday's speech by President Ahmadinejad at New York's Columbia University.
Mr SzymaÅski, your Law and Justice government, the Polish right wing, has placed my country, my homeland, in the company of such countries as Iran and Belarus.
President Ahmadinejad yesterday referred with pride to the example of America as a country which is still carrying out the death penalty.
Polish public opinion is outraged that the government in Warsaw has succeeded in blocking the European Union's Day against the Death Penalty.
After all, this is a matter that has united the European Union, it unites European public opinion, it unites European political parties, and it creates a democratic-liberal consensus, regardless of ideological divisions in Europe.
I believe that the forthcoming elections in Poland will reveal a Polish society which is determined that the European Union will be able to act together on this issue in the forum of the United Nations with an initiative against the death penalty.
(PT) My country, Portugal, was a forerunner in the abolition of the death penalty in 1867 and I therefore take the greatest pride in this initiative by the Portuguese Presidency to institute a European Day against the Death Penalty in line with all Portugal's actions at international level, within the framework of Europe and the United Nations, for the abolition of the death penalty and in protest against the governments who are the main perpetrators of that inhuman practice, in particular China, the United States and Iran.
I find it absolutely shocking that the Polish Government should have tried to block this initiative with such opportunistic and contradictory arguments.
The Polish people must be made aware that the Kaczynski Government is not only doing a disservice to the European Union and its fundamental values, but is also doing dreadful harm to the good name and prestige of Poland.
At stake are the most essential values which distinguish civilisation from barbarism.
The Portuguese Presidency cannot be stopped, must not allow itself to be intimidated by opposition from the Polish Government.
It must keep the proposal, put it swiftly to the vote within the General Affairs and External Relations Council, leave the Polish Government to its chosen isolation and go ahead with celebrating the European Day against the Death Penalty on 10 October.
(PL) Madam President, I am distancing myself from the utterances of my fellow Member, Konrad SzymaÅski, and associating myself fully with those of Mr Pinior.
Poland signed the Sixth Protocol abolishing the death penalty and took upon itself the legal obligation of eradicating this form of punishment from our land.
On 17-18 June last year in Luxembourg, European Foreign Ministers, all European Foreign Ministers, including the Polish Foreign Minister, agreed that the European Union should submit a joint draft resolution against the death penalty.
What has happened since 17 June to make Poland change its view in September?
Obviously it must be the domestic situation, and obviously it must be the elections.
But can we say in fact that Poland has changed its view?
It is not Poland, it is the Polish government.
Poles are not barbarians, they do not accept the death penalty.
Poles have stood against the death penalty on many occasions.
And I have to say to you, and especially to Mr SzymaÅski, that public opinion polls indicate that 57% of Poles do not want the death penalty.
Please remember this when representing Poland, and convey what Polish society thinks, with this trend in mind.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you very much, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for your thoughts, comments and questions.
That was, and I knew it would be, an easy debate for the Council.
Easy because the Council and the European Parliament are agreed on what is fundamental and that is obtaining, at the next session of the UN General Assembly, a resolution on a moratorium and the abolition of the death penalty; I am of course pleased to see that we are united on the central objective of the debate we have had and that we shall be working together to make it possible.
As was mentioned by a Portuguese MEP, I too am very proud, to be taking part in this debate as a representative of Portugal, because we were the first country in Europe to abolish the death penalty.
It is a theme, an issue, a problem on which the Portuguese are especially sensitive and I am proud to be able to say so here and to have the opportunity to be leading the Council's efforts at the United Nations at this moment with a view to achieving the objective we have set ourselves.
I am not here to talk about the past.
We must learn from the lessons of the past, of course, and that is why we must naturally avoid any errors we might have committed and which did not in the past make it possible for us to achieve the objectives we had set ourselves.
The past is past; let us now focus on the future.
Let us focus with determination, with resolve, in the knowledge that the task is not, politically speaking, an easy one, but that it is possible.
When we speak of flexibility we are talking about confidence in the work of the Presidency.
What we are seeking and specifically requesting - and we are sure that the European Parliament will grant us this since it understands that this is a politically complex and at times even difficult issue - is naturally the European Parliament's confidence in the Presidency and the Presidency's efforts, so that we can finally bring this objective to a successful conclusion.
We shall be submitting the draft resolution at the beginning of October - early to mid-October.
That is our intention and I can tell you that the many demarches and contacts we have made give us some confidence.
We hope that our confidence will grow with the passage of time because our cause is a just cause.
I should also like to say, finally, that the European Union already has co-authors who are going to sign this draft resolution with us; I must also tell you here that I am very proud that those co-authors include Portuguese-speaking countries representing Africa, representing Asia and representing Latin America too - countries which like us, like the Portuguese, are also underwriting respect for the total value of life.
We are confident, I repeat, that with your support and your confidence, the Portuguese Presidency will bring to fruition this objective we have set ourselves at the 62nd session of the UN General Assembly and that we shall in fact have a resolution approved in the terms in which the European Parliament and the Council wish to see it approved.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to make a personal comment on the basis of Article 145.
The Polish Member, who has spoken as a representative of the UEN Group, has completely misquoted me in a comment on my speech and I would like to put it straight.
I asked the Council how long it would continue to put up with this attitude of the Polish President, Mr KaczyÅski.
I had quoted Mr KaczyÅski, who very much wants a better atmosphere to make the re-introduction of the death penalty in Europe possible.
My question to the Council was therefore: how long will the Council continue to put up with this?
How long will the 26 other governments continue to remain silent on this?
I have not presumed in any of what I have said to decide (how could I?) how long Mr KaczyÅski will continue as President of Poland.
It is an absolute sovereign right of the Polish people to elect their government and President.
I do, however, implore the Polish people to be so wise as to put this government out of office as quickly as possible!
Thank you for clarifying that.
(PT) I asked a very specific question.
I should like to know on which article the Presidency was relying in saying that unanimity was required for this type of question on, for example, taking a decision on the Day against the Death Penalty and why it did not insist upon a vote in the Council.
I should like to know why the President did not say anything about that point, which all the speakers mentioned.
It is the Council's interpretation that decisions of that nature do require unanimity.
I have received five motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007.
Negotiations on an Interregional Association Agreement with Mercosur and the new bilateral strategic partnership with Brazil (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on negotiations on an Interregional Association Agreement with Mercosur and the new bilateral strategic partnership with Brazil.
We understand that the association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur must be comprehensive in all its aspects, that is, political and economic association and cooperation, aiming not only to promote trade and investment, but also to strengthen, in a decisive manner, the strategic relationship between the European Union and that region.
This agreement will create the largest free trade area between two regional blocs, nearly 700 million inhabitants, enhancing economic and social integration, facilitating investment and bringing significant economic growth for both regions.
It is true that the results of the negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda influenced the negotiating process.
We cannot, however, view the association agreement from a purely economic perspective; the importance of the political dimension of the agreement needs to be stressed.
In order to make the qualitative leap which we all want in the relationship between the European Union and Mercosur, it is fundamental to take account of the balance between the political and economic components.
We must, however, acknowledge that after seven years of negotiations we are at an impasse.
That impasse is the result of the discrepancy or difference between the offers presented.
On the one hand, the offer made by the European Union covered all sectors and, on the other hand, Mercosur's offer omitted sectors that are very important to the European Union.
The Portuguese Presidency is waiting for the political commitment demonstrated by Mercosur to take the form of an improved offer, so that the Commission might resume the negotiations with a view to the speedy conclusion of an agreement which is fair and balanced for both parties.
The strategic partnership between the European Union and Brazil established at the Summit in Lisbon on 4 July, must be regarded not only as a vehicle for strengthening relations with Brazil, but also as a way of enhancing strategic biregional relations between the European Union and Latin America and, in particular, the EU's negotiations with Mercosur.
The joint statement issued following the Summit with Brazil unequivocally demonstrates the commitment to concluding negotiations on the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.
With regard specifically to Brazil and, bearing in mind the growing strategic significance of that country on the international scene, the partnership established within the scope of the work of the Portuguese Presidency, constituted the beginning of a new relationship between the European Union and Brazil, similar to what we are seeing now with Russia, India and China.
The partnership will develop on the basis of an action plan that will include strengthening dialogue and cooperation in the areas of mutual interest presented in the communication from the Commission to the Council on the EU-Brazil strategic partnership, which naturally include the Mercosur agenda.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic.
As has rightly been pointed out, the decision to establish a strategic partnership with Brazil goes back to the Commission's first communication on Brazil, where we proposed a way forward in our relations with Brazil, and the first EU-Brazil summit in Lisbon has confirmed and cemented this new relationship.
Why a closer relationship with Brazil?
The EU-Brazil strategic partnership is a natural reaction to geopolitical realities.
Today, Brazil is becoming an international player with a strong weight on important global issues like climate change, the fight against poverty, peace, security and multilateralism.
It is a respected voice in the developing world, as shown by its chairmanship of the G20 within the WTO or as an active promoter of the South-South dialogue.
It has forged new partnerships with all key players: China, Russia and the United States.
The European Union has a lot to gain from a closer partnership with Brazil in order to progress on global issues of common concern.
The strategic partnership provides the appropriate framework, as experience has shown with all other members of the BRICS group.
What effects will this partnership have on Latin America and, more specifically, on the Mercosur region?
The promotion of regional integration is one of the cornerstones of the partnership.
This is clearly stated in the Commission's communication, and it is also how Brazil perceives it.
President Lula made this point very strongly at the first EU-Brazil summit in July.
I cannot stress enough the importance of the Southern Cone for the European Union.
