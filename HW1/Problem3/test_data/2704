The Commission intends to table an amended proposal following on from my proposals adopted by this House on 14 November 2001.
I reject neo-liberal interpretations that stand in the way of this.
Â Â  . Although some very good ideas were expressed, it was particularly important for the European Parliamentary Labour Party that the impact on social housing and health services was taken into account.
This is why it was very important for the Purvis compromises to be included in the various articles mentioned during the vote.
Â Â  The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the report, as it does not stand up to the pressure emanating from the Commission to privatise services of general interest, but, if anything, intensifies that pressure in parts.
It is made even more difficult for municipalities, regions and Member States to offer the services to the public that they are often legally required to provide.
Public undertakings will have to compete even more with global operators in the field of service provision.
From the publicâs point of view, the provision of public services will further deteriorate: the market functions according to neither social yardsticks nor need, but simply lucrative demand.
We are particularly critical of the fact that compensation for services of general economic interest will continue fundamentally to be treated as âstate aidâ and will therefore still come under the state aid regime.
In addition, only a few public undertakings will continue to receive compensation in any case.
The report also strengthens the Commission proposal as regards hospitals and social housing.
Instead of extending the exemptions provided for, to cover at least care services, education, culture and the public media, bureaucratic procedures are now being called for across the board.
The report totally fails to mention those employed in undertakings providing services of general interest and the general interests of social welfare, such as the protection of the weaker members of society.
For the big service providers, privatisation initiatives in the field of services of general interest mean profitable business.
Anyone helping them to achieve those objectives should be conscious of what they are doing.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mass unemployment, lack of growth, repeated budget deficits, the explosion of public debt, stifling taxation, relocations ... unfortunately everyone is aware of our sad economic situation.
Your recipes for dealing with these problems are always the same.
According to you, the reason that everything is going badly is that there is not enough European standardisation.
Not enough competition between the European economies, not enough competition in services, not enough openness to global competition, with no regard for whether or not it is fair, not enough immigration of qualified workers, too much social protection.
Overloaded bureaucracy?
That is purely a national problem.
Your regulations, which are unconsolidated, dense, sometimes incoherent if not absurd, are not responsible!
But the monetary policy, which is causing an over-valuation of the euro and draining our economies?
It is perfect.
Neither Brussels nor Frankfurt could get it wrong.
We think, however, that the Europe of Brussels is getting it wrong.
Despite 20 years of standardisation, and Europe entering into global free trade, our problems are only getting worse.
And the reason for that is precisely this policy, your policy.
Â Â  Sometimes, one is forced, as an MEP, to make a choice between two bad alternatives and choose the least bad.
In this case, I voted in favour of Amendments 9 and 22, although I did not agree with everything they said.
In spite of everything, they were better than the original wordings and would thus, if accepted, improve the report as a whole.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the report on public finances in EMU â 2004 and also in favour of Amendment 7 about distinguishing between loans for investments and current expenditure.
It is our view, however, that the ability to provide loans for public investments and thus exceed the ceiling for budget deficits should be reserved for those countries that fulfil the national debt criterion.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The next item is an oral question to the Commission on the policy for financing nature protection and especially Natura 2000.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, both Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a large number of NGOs believe that the European Unionâs Natura 2000 programme is in grave danger.
The decisions taken last year by the previous Commission on the financing of this programme were extremely vague, meaning that it is already a foregone conclusion that there will be a major dispute between farmers and those in favour of Natura 2000 within the Committee on Agriculture and among those in charge of the Regional Development Fund.
We therefore believe that MrÂ Dimas must devote a great deal of energy to finding a simple solution to the problem of how Natura 2000 is to be reinforced in future.
What matters is not the level of funding, or even the individual programmes; what matters is that the ideas associated with the Natura 2000 programme are translated into real-life policies.
It is for this reason that funding must not be tied up in negotiating structures to such an extent that it disappears when the crucial debates are finally held.
We have used the Habitat Directive for many years to encourage the Member States to designate appropriate sites in their territory, whilst assuring them that funding would be guaranteed.
If we were to stop this funding now, or even to take it out of the budgets for agriculture or regional development, it would be a pretty poor show on our part.
It would inevitably lead to arguments, and this is why we are asking you today to take proactive measures to prevent this problem.
If it turned out at some point in the future that funding were to be taken out of the agriculture or regional development pillars, we would have hundreds of thousands of mayors lined up here to complain, and there would be little hope for the NGOs or for you as Environment Commissioner.
There is no need for me to remind you that a strong agricultural lobby exists, to which I, as a farmer, also belong.
It is therefore inevitable that disputes will arise.
I should like to encourage you to ensure that your Commission lays down clear rules, and I would be very grateful to you for doing so.
I hope that we will be able to adopt this regulation.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the protection of biodiversity is a priority policy for the Commission and that the successful application of the Natura 2000 framework is the cornerstone of the European Union's efforts to achieve this objective.
Securing adequate financing for Natura 2000, as MrÂ Florenz stressed, is therefore one of our top priorities, and I fully endorse the objectives and priorities of the European Parliament.
I should also like to point out that this priority is shared by many of my colleagues in the Commission, who have agreed to adjust the Regional, Agricultural and other Funds in order to include Natura 2000 in financing.
The Member States have a legal obligation and are committed to effective management of Natura 2000 areas.
Safeguarding the financial resources for such management comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States but, precisely because of the specialised character of Natura 2000, the Commission helps by providing Community cofinancing.
Use of these Community resources is the responsibility of the Member States but, for our part, we are prepared to offer all possible help in order to facilitate access to them.
If, therefore, it is found that management of these areas is not being adequately supported, the Commission is prepared to refer the Member State in question to the Court of Justice.
Bearing this in mind, the Commission, as Mr Florenz said, adopted a communication on financing for Natura 2000 on 15 July 2004.
It examined all the possible permutations, including the creation of a separate fund, and concluded that the most efficient approach is to incorporate financing for Natura 2000 in existing Community funds.
The new Structural Fund regulations, which are currently being discussed in the Council, will be applied by the Member States and the regions on a decentralised basis.
Consequently, there is no facility to determine a specific sum within any one fund.
For the time being also, we cannot know what sums it will be possible to make available each year for cofinancing of Natura 2000 areas during the period from 2007 to 2013.
This is because, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is incumbent upon each Member State to decide on the requirements of these areas when preparing their national programmes.
In all events, the Commission has the means to safeguard priority for Natura 2000 within these national programmes.
I shall come back to this point at the end of my intervention.
To start with, a few comments on the new regulations being debated.
As regards the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, I must say that it contains a reference to cofinancing for Natura 2000 and for biodiversity, which are included in the objectives of convergence and competitiveness.
There are also cofinancing facilities under the Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund regulations, especially in order to strengthen management capacities in relation to Natura 2000.
Natura 2000 is also included â and this is important â in the second land management axis in the new rural development regulation, which will account for 25% of its total.
The Commission is proposing a total of EUR 22 billion for land management during the period from 2007 to 2013.
It is necessary â and here, MrÂ Florenz, I need the support of the European Parliament â for this sum to be secured and, if possible, increased.
The support of the European Parliament on this issue is therefore of prime importance.
The new regulations contain mechanisms which allow the Commission, as I said earlier, to provide guidance and to control to some degree the content of the programmes submitted by the Member States.
Immediately after the adoption of the proposed regulations for the Structural Funds, which will possibly happen towards the end of spring, the Commission will define its specific priorities for financing all the funds in detail in one set of strategic guidelines.
As is standard practice, consultations will be held on the content of the guidelines with the participation of all the interested services, including the Environment DG.
Care will be taken during these consultations to ensure that cofinancing for Natura 2000 is included as a priority.
Once the strategic guidelines have been issued, the Member States will need to prepare national strategic frameworks during the second half of 2005 or in early 2006, together with operational programmes, which they will submit to the Commission.
All the interested Commission services will be included in the consultations held on the content of these programmes.
Of course, suitable action will be taken on the part of the Environment DG to safeguard the priority of Natura 2000 actions.
In particular, as far as national rural development programmes are concerned, which Mr Florenz said earlier would be in a competitive relationship, every programme submitted will be examined in detail in order to ensure that account is taken both of the Community legislative framework and the priorities of policy on issues such as biodiversity, Natura 2000 area management, climate change, the application of ideas on water resources and other issues. If, of course, it is found that a national programme does not include adequate financial coverage for all this, the Commission services always have the right to reject it.
This is another safeguard to ensure that Natura 2000 maintains its priority in the Member States' programmes, although it is not an absolute guarantee.
It is therefore the main obligation of everyone interested in financing Natura 2000 to exert pressure so that the Member States not only propose ambitious objectives in their national and operational programmes, but also safeguard permanent and continuing action to prepare valid Natura 2000 programmes.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are all pleased that the Commission has dealt with the issues of the Natura 2000 Network, which relates to the LIFE Programme, for which I am shadow rapporteur.
Nevertheless, I believe we are finding the situation very frustrating because the issue has been dealt with without taking account of the concepts which are essential to sustainability and, furthermore, we have made the old mistake of seeing Natura 2000 as a crystallised territory, with no life or activity.
Since the first declaration of protected areas, Natura 2000, rather than bringing society pleasure, has become a problem.
Nowhere wants to be declared a protected area, because there is no parallel support policy.
It has become a constant battle.
There has been no education about the exploitation of natural resources, nor of the true added value of the Natura Network, which generates and awakens enthusiasm.
Furthermore, there has been hidden expropriation, since the use of land is much more restricted than before and, in many cases, the value of the land is reduced.
It has therefore become a burden.
So what is the problem with the document we are dealing with?
Firstly, it does not recognise typologies.
We cannot introduce the concept of Natura 2000 without looking at the great families of biodiversity, because each of them requires a different financial instrument.
For example, how are the marine funds, which do not appear, to be managed by means of rural development?
A separate Natura will have to be created.
Neither are rivers treated as significant, while I believe they should be treated as an essential project.
Neither is there any proper distinction between the different forest areas.
There should at least have been an indication of an intention to produce a diversified policy.
Finally, I would like to say that, if we did not introduce Natura into the market economy, we will not have achieved anything, because nature means life, economy and sustainability.
Â Â  . Mr President, some years ago a leading EU official visited a small village in eastern Hungary.
The village was close to a wetland â a real bird paradise.
As we got out of the car he asked me to stay silent for a while.
He wanted just to listen to the concerto of the birds and the cicadas.
In our region in the west, he told me sadly, we have lost these untouched nature sites forever; you should preserve yours at any price.
The goal of the Natura 2000 initiative can be defined by scientific criteria, but the basic motivation is simple: to save at least some parts of European natural sites for ourselves and for future generations.
The biggest challenge for our future is the decrease in natural resources such as clean air, pure water and a healthy environment.
A high grade of biodiversity is crucial for a healthy living environment, for food security and for quality of life in general.
In addition to these goals, Natura 2000 is also an effective tool to support European villages and the people living there.
It is an important way of promoting organic farming and ecotourism.
It provides jobs and revitalises rural areas.
Natura 2000 can help redefine the role of rural areas in Europe.
I hope we came here to praise Natura 2000, not to bury it, as Shakespeare might have said.
The future of our natural heritage needs and deserves at least the EURÂ 6.1Â billion per year set aside for these brief projects.
Natura 2000 can be funded in different ways, either by what is known as 'earmarking' a share of existing funds, or through an independent Natura 2000 fund.
There are many technical details we have to resolve, but we should be united on one thing: the level of funding for Natura 2000 cannot be even one cent lower than was proposed earlier by the Commission.
I ask every political group and everybody in leading positions to rescue the original proposal and to improve it in order to ensure that, one way or another, the given amount will be spent entirely on Natura 2000 purposes.
Â Â  . Mr President, we have known for a long time that less and less land is needed to produce food, which means that we can indulge in more extensive agriculture and can create more nature as a result.
As far as I am concerned, agriculture is a specific component of rural development, and as far as I am concerned, so is the Natura 2000 programme.
Nature plays an essential role in the development of the countryside and cannot be see in isolation from other aspects of agriculture and of other employment initiatives in the countryside.
For years, Europe has promoted this by means of legislation.
We are familiar with the Bird and Habitat Directive, which has been transposed into the Flora and Fauna Act in the Netherlands, and we have created special payments systems for all those regulations.
We are also familiar with the mountain farmersâ regulation, the Natura 2000 additional payments, and such like.
As for the future, I have already said that I see all those programmes as forming part of rural development, and I think that we should therefore ensure that a special fund for Natura 2000 is set up within the framework of the rural development fund.
The big question then is: how should the money be spent?
As the Commissioner already indicated, we are familiar with the system of cofinancing, which, in my view, can take on special forms.
In some countries, this cofinancing is clearly a problem â probably a bigger problem for poorer countries than for the richer ones.
Perhaps the Commission could look into the possibility of having different cofinancing systems running parallel in the framework of this programme?
Following on from what I said about agriculture being, by nature, a form of rural development, another question which the Commission might be able to look into is whether subsidies to agriculture are generally more expensive than subsidies to nature development in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer, but we are not satisfied with it.
I am not satisfied with it, because, if you will allow me to be particularly direct and straightforward, at the end of the day the question we might ask ourselves today, following your proposals, is whether the European Union really wants to preserve its biodiversity. If so, it is like a cathedral, we need to provide the resources to manage the NaturaÂ 2000 network.
Without money, without a budget that is actually set aside for this expenditure, I do not think it is worth us deluding ourselves.
Commissioner, we are all well aware, and most of my fellow Members in this room know this from their experience on the ground that if it is not clearly stated that funds can be obtained in the regions through the Rural Development Fund, the ERDF Structural Fund or the ESF, then all the money will go to everything but NaturaÂ 2000.
NaturaÂ 2000 will be in direct competition with all the other projects.
Of course, agriculturally there will be possibilities for integration, which will be the proof that NaturaÂ 2000 has been integrated.
But we are not deluding ourselves, Commissioner.
We really need to go further.
And because we have absolutely no confidence in this proposal, as rapporteur for Life+, I am proposing, as the Council and the Commission have not decided on the 3 billion euros per year needed for management, that in Life+ we should include a Life section, which was formerly âNatureâ: Life management NaturaÂ 2000.
We are waiting for all the guarantees that the NaturaÂ 2000 network can be put in place, because, Commissioner, both here and on the ground, we have fought hard for it.
On the ground, we only wanted âŠ
NaturaÂ 2000 is an important step in protecting and developing biodiversity in the nature reserves of the European Union.
The policy must be guaranteed by mainstreaming Natura 2000 and integrating it into the main EU funding programmes.
The financing regulations for these programmes need to reflect this integrated approach.
Regulations for the 2007-2013 financial perspective now need to be strengthened for the integrated approach to work.
Â Â  As you know, there is no interpretation of Gaelic, but we understood part of your intervention.
Â Â  . Mr President, is there anything the EU does not seek to control?
Are there any issues at which most Members of the European Parliament will not try to throw taxpayers' money?
Sadly, it seems not.
Not content with single legal frameworks, tax harmonisation and the rest, the EU apparently wants to control nature.
That is patently stupid.
The Habitats Directive of 1992, which established Natura 2000, states the EU's intention to define a common framework for the conservation of wild plants and animals.
In the bold new Europe, even nature has to be standardised.
Wiser counsels know this is impossible.
When man seeks to play God, nature has an uncomfortable habit of reasserting itself.
As a member of the IND/DEM Group, which has Danish and English co-chairmen, I am reminded of the story of King Canute: tired of the flattery of his courtiers who told him he could control anything and everything, he took them to the beach and commanded the sea to turn back.
The waves, of course, continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point.
It strikes me that Canute had more sense than Europe's rulers have today.
If the EU is not power crazy and really is just an economic bloc, perhaps someone could tell me why it is necessary, for example, to list and protect all species of bat?
Has anybody asked the bats?
No, of course not.
Once again, I can only conclude that if the EU is the answer, it must have been a silly question.
You could even call it batty!
Â Â  All people have their own dreams and aspirations and politicians have their ideals and visions, which they subsequently embody in various projects.
The Natura 2000 project is exceptional simply because it incorporates ideals and also peopleâs aspirations.
It is based on the protection of Europeâs cultural and natural heritage, on the preservation and protection of biodiversity.
Apart from these rather grand ideas, the Natura 2000 project is also exceptional in that it could be a driving force in the development of rural areas.
It is of great socio-economic significance with respect to employment and tourism and also to the protection of the populationâs health.
Today, just as the Constitutional Treaty is being adopted and ratified in the different states, it is very important that, on this matter too, we are able to say what is the position of Parliament in the development of such projects and what is the position of the Commission, which has to facilitate such projects and which has to provide the resources for the project to achieve its goals.
The question of cofinancing has often posed problems for many Member States of the European Union, particularly the new ones, since, under the terms of decentralisation, the authorities in the different regions have taken direct responsibility for schools, hospitals and also the protection of this heritage.
It is therefore important and essential that you provide help in the implementation of this project, that you directly release financial resources to assist those regions which do not have the money for cofinancing.
Commissioner, you have spoken about subsidiarity with respect to this very matter.
I should like to ask you, however, to bear in mind that the natural environment has no borders âbirds donât need passportsâ.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for having initiated this debate on Natura 2000.
In comparison to other European countries, Poland can boast of significant achievements in the field of environmental protection.
The designation of protected areas is a Polish tradition that goes back to the 19th century, with such areas now covering 32% of the country, up from 9% just 20 years ago.
Yet Poland is concerned at the fact that whilst the concept of the Natura 2000 network in Europe has evolved, this has not been backed up by an appropriate guarantee of funding for the creation and maintenance of this network.
The country has therefore put its name to the declaration submitted by a majority of EU Member States in October and December, in which they express their disappointment at the European Commissionâs proposal concerning the cofinancing of the Natura 2000 network.
No clear details are provided regarding the principles according to which funding can be obtained for protection measures for Natura 2000 sites between 2007 and 2013, and this will undoubtedly mean shortfalls in funding for the Natura 2000 network.
It will then be impossible to implement many much-needed protection measures.
The majority of areas designated as Natura 2000 sites in Poland will not be covered by the funds indicated, for example, land that is part of national forests, or swamps, natural grasslands, dunes, moorlands and scrublands that are not used for agricultural purposes.
In the context of the European Commissionâs letter of 6Â JanuaryÂ 2005 to Poland, which suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of extending the list of Natura 2000 sites in the country, a guarantee of separate funding for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network has taken on even greater significance for Poland and other countries.
Poland therefore expects that in the course of work on the new Financial Perspective, appropriate levels of funding will be safeguarded for the establishment of the Natura 2000 network.
I would suggest that the LIFE+ Regulation also contains separate provisions for LIFE+ and for Natura 2000.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by saying, by way of an introduction, that I am fully aware that when acting in your capacity as Environment Commissioner you are following in the tradition of the Commission, a European institution.
The comments I am about to make will therefore relate to the Commission, and not to you personally.
Firstly, it is my opinion that the reason why this House is having to deal with the problem of Natura 2000 is that the Commission has not had the courage to propose a suitable financial instrument.
This is the first point I should like to make; in the Habitat Directive we committed ourselves to cofinancing and to the provision of funding, yet no corresponding provisions have been made in our various funds.
Neither, secondly, has the Commission had the courage to ensure that the existing regulations â the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation â contain appropriate stipulations.
They are full of âcanâsâ, âshouldâsâ and âcouldâsâ, which is by no means adequate, or at least not in our opinion, and indeed we are all aware of where such language gets us.
The intention is that regions in the Member States submit operational programmes, and the Commission then assesses and approves them.
We are well aware of this, but there is no guarantee that what is written down will actually be read.
In the current programming period, for example, the advancement of womenâs concerns has been included as a goal in the Structural Funds Regulation, and indeed this was something for which Parliament fought strongly.
The Member States, however, have reacted by doing next to nothing, and this is intolerable.
It is for this reason that we need a separate instrument to finance Natura 2000, and indeed this House has already agreed that a separate financial instrument is needed; one need only look at the individual committeesâ opinions on the Financial Perspective.
The Committee on Agriculture has already said that the protection of biodiversity is not a primary or genuine rural development policy.
We all know what that means; our agriculture experts do not want to have to use money from rural development funds to pay for Natura 2000 either.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should firstly like to thank the Commissioner for his answer.
With a single exception, we are all agreed that NaturaÂ 2000 is incredibly important, and we are also all agreed that the money must be obtained.
I do not know if everyone is aware of how much money is involved â at least EURÂ 6Â billion per year.
This means that at least EURÂ 3Â billion must be obtained from NaturaÂ 2000.
This could not ever possibly be obtained using just one fund.
Irrespective of ways and means, we must have this project integrated into the other funds, and that is something on which we agree.
We shall support the Commission in this matter, and I must also say that the green movements, Bird Life etc are in favour of our having the funding of NaturaÂ 2000 integrated.
The problem is that I could not glean from the Commissionerâs answer how he is to ensure that this will in actual fact happen.
MrÂ Florenz provided an engaging description of the conflicts that will arise.
If it has not been ensured that the money is earmarked and tied, nothing will come of matters.
Purely for the sake of funding, we therefore need a clearer answer from the Commission than we have received so far.
Allow me also to say, however, that it is not only an issue of obtaining enough money.
It is also an issue of getting the whole of our rural districts policy in tune with the natural environment, so that agriculture is carried on, and development pursued, in these areas in ways that respect the vulnerable natural environment instead of, as now, in ways that include driving large road systems through vulnerable areas.
I have seen how, in Poland, exemptions are granted for brutal pannage in an extremely vulnerable and very rich, but therefore fragile, natural environment.
We therefore need also to take account of the way in which we develop rural districts and to ensure that NaturaÂ 2000 is incorporated and that there is enough money.
If the money cannot be found within the existing funds mentioned, allow me to point out that we have just obtained a majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in favour also of beginning to examine the first pillar, where almost all of the EUâs money is, of course, to be found.
There are such large sums allocated to direct agricultural aid that it is time we began to look at this aid.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Florenz said that Natura 2000 is in grave danger because confusion reigns over the financing of the programme.
I believe that the problem is a great deal more serious; not only is there no guaranteed funding, there is also an increasing lack of knowledge and growing uncertainty on the ground over what it really means when a NaturaÂ 2000 site is designated.
In view of this, I should like to raise a number of points.
Firstly, Natura 2000 programmes must not be financed at the expense of farmers, and under no circumstances must farmers be the only ones to suffer; otherwise, as Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines clearly stated, property owners will be deprived almost entirely of what is due to them.
Secondly, it is intolerable that infrastructure and economic development in large parts of the EU should languish due to delays and a lack of clarity over the designation of sites.
In many rural areas, investment programmes that would be useful and compatible with the nature of these areas cannot be carried out because questions remain unanswered.
It is also intolerable that the Natura 2000 programme, the real aim of which is to improve the EUâs standing by sending out a clear signal that we wish to be an environmental union, and not just an economic union, should be perverted in such a way.
Finally, it is unacceptable that we are reaching a point where noÂ one knows what they are doing any more, and that the reason for this is to be found, above all, in the bureaucratic procedures in Brussels and the Commission.
Brussels bids us designate sites everywhere â noÂ one is entirely sure where the money will come from, but that can be dealt with later.
Countries have been told they will be brought before the Court of Justice if they do not designate any sites, something that the Commissioner has now, indeed, confirmed.
This programme is not about the environment; it is designed to make a public nuisance of itself.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, NaturaÂ 2000 is one of the major issues that often allow doubts to persist about European construction.
Our fellow citizens share our ambition of protecting biodiversity and see that we are producing texts, but when it comes to obtaining funds, Europe does not deliver the goods.
Our fellow citizens accept the idea of sustainable development, thinking that it is possible to reconcile protecting the earth with economic development and employment, but when they need the channels and resources to do this, Europe does not deliver the goods.
We therefore need to find some new instruments for maintaining NaturaÂ 2000.
I would like to make three demands: first of all, we need a specific fund, because objectively there is a contradiction between expectations for funds to promote economic development, rural development, and sustaining the land in accordance with Natura 2000.
We therefore need a specific fund, which is the first demand.
My second demand: the implementation of Natura 2000 needs to be favoured in the criteria for all European funds.
I will give you an example to illustrate the contradiction.
In the current ERDF regulation that you are in the process of negotiating, the areas are limited to wooded or cultivated areas.
NaturaÂ 2000 needs natural, untouched land that is not wooded or cultivated, in other words wetlands.
Thirdly, we need an instrument for innovation, so that practices on the ground are more in line with what we could provide for in the future.
Therefore in LifeÂ + we need a specific instrument and we need to maintain two pillars: a general environmental pillar and a pillar for Life Nature, as we had before.
As you have understood, Commissioner, as they stand, we do not think that the Commissionâs proposals will convince our fellow citizens on the ground.
We believe that protecting biodiversity is a step forward, which is compatible with the development of rural areas and the economic future of our country.
We therefore now need proof of this conviction, in the form of three billion euros at least from the Structural Funds.
Â Â  I would like to thank MrÂ Florenz for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important topic.
It is in all our interests that Natura 2000 should become a workable system.
This is why we questioned your colleagues during the sitting of the parliamentary committee and that is why we ask you too what assurances and what guarantees you can give us to ensure that the entire network will be financially viable.
Unfortunately, we have learned that the answers received from the Commission have been meaningless and that they could not promise any kind of solid guarantees behind the attractive facade of an integrated approach.
But there is a need for guarantees.
I have come from Hungary, where the government has been able to contravene the earlier agreement made with the European Union, and redirect 8 billion Forints from agricultural-environment protection into direct subsidies for farming.
Because of this and similar reasons, farmers are demonstrating with their tractors in the capital of my country even as we speak.
In Hungary there is a saying that if someone burns their mouth once with hot water, then later they will blow on cold water too.
This is how we feel now the empty responses of the Commission and the stance of some Member States have burned us and are forcing us to be more careful.
Therefore, I, together with my fellow representatives, ask the Council and likewise the Commission to create a separate budget item serving the goals of Natura 2000, that is within the financial projections in preparation, in parallel with the significant upgrading of the LIFE+ programme and within the farm budget â to which I would immediately add that we can only imagine this together with real increases in the farm budget earmarked for this purpose â or on the other hand, with steps being taken to create a completely separate fund.
I further ask the representatives of the Commission to take into account the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and also Croatia â which has not been considered in the draft in its current form.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I see this as a very important debate, and as one that shows that pressure must be brought to bear by this House to ensure that a separate instrument is created to finance NaturaÂ 2000.
One of the previous speakers said that Natura 2000 is seen in some quarters as a programme for annoying the public.
In a great many other quarters, however, it is viewed as providing real assistance in the struggle to protect biodiversity.
I believe that it is our task to support those who view it in this way, and, in common with many of my fellow Members, I am therefore in favour of there being a separate financial instrument in future.
I also believe that it is not entirely accurate to say that it is not the amount of funding made available that matters.
Many of the NGOs working in this field have told us that the Commissionâs estimate of an annual cost of EURÂ 6.1Â billion can only be considered an absolute minimum.
We will therefore have the task of ensuring that not only a separate instrument, but also sufficient funding, is made available.
I can see the attraction in an integrated approach, but I share MrsÂ Haugâs views, who said that the situation is similar to what we have seen in the case of policies on womenâs issues; for years anyone who did not wish to give any consideration to womenâs issues said that there was no need to do so because of gender mainstreaming.
Everybody then waited for progressive policies on womenâs issues and equal opportunities to miraculously appear.
If an integrated approach is to be adopted, then what is needed is a dual strategy; integration into existing funds, but a separate financial instrument in future.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, in Germany we have a rule that is no less clear for being unwritten, namely that he who places an order foots the bill, and indeed it is a well-known fact that very little happens in this EU of ours without money.
The European Union ordered, or rather instigated, the establishment of the Natura 2000 network throughout Europe.
Yet the EU has still not provided a precise definition of what kind of measures must be taken, what kind of regulations must be adopted or what kind of arrangements must be made with regard to the sites that have been designated, and indeed this fact was pointed out a short time ago by Commissioner Dimas.
The annual cost of Natura 2000 has now been estimated by the Commission to be EURÂ 6.1Â billion.
This is a great deal of money, yet at the same time it is very little for all 25Â Member States, depending on the final scope of the programme.
At present management plans for SACs have to be drawn up on a national and regional basis, and it is not hard to see that each area will have varying requirements when it comes to a field as complex as environmental protection, and that different measures will therefore need to be put in place.
Questions still remain, such as the instances in which greater expenditure will become necessary, and whether there should be changes to land use, given that this would mean a shortfall in income and financial losses for agricultural undertakings.
The Commission is now proposing that money spent on these commitments should come from existing EU funds.
This is a source of some concern to me, and it would mean that a struggle for funding of the kind referred to by MrÂ Florenz would be inevitable.
A separate financial instrument must be created that allows compensation to be granted in every instance where restrictions have been imposed as a result of Natura 2000 sites being designated.
That, MrsÂ Haug, is what the farmers are calling for.
It is intolerable that an increase in funding for SAC compensation should occur at the expense of agricultural and environmental measures or of other rural development programmes.
Sufficient funding must be provided by the European Union for any additional tasks and costly obligations it imposes.
This would then safeguard the substance of Natura 2000.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, this question by Mr Florenz is appropriate because the Natura 2000 Network is the most important initiative undertaken by the European Union in the field of protecting natural areas and the Member States have understood this.
My country, which represents 16% of the European Unionâs territory, contains 40% of the entire Natura 2000 Network: 25% of Spanish territory is included in it.
Natura 2000, however, has a cost that has not so far been calculated precisely.
The EUR 6Â 100 million calculated by the Commission could be very far from accurate, because this figure does not take sufficient account of the spending on compensation which could have been paid to landowners and farmers who, in reality, are deprived of the use of their land and the rights over it.
Furthermore, we should remember that, as well as for managing natural resources, we should compensate them for loss of revenue, as laid down in Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, included in the European Constitution.
The Natura 2000 Network is a Community initiative, and the European Union must therefore take responsibility not just for the cost of managing the areas, but also for the loss of revenue for the farmers.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs proposal to fund part of this cost by means of the rural development policy indicates that the Commission is not taking the Natura 2000 Network seriously or that it undervalues rural development, or both.
The Member States must choose between these two objectives; one always at the expense of the other.
If the proposal being presented on the new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, with a funding of EUR 11Â 000 million per year, is accepted, we would have to deduct 20% of that sum in order to fund a substantial proportion of the cost of Natura 2000.
Furthermore, the reform of the CAP in September 2003 extended the list of actions to be funded from rural development, adding to it improving quality, food safety and the welfare of livestock.
The Natura 2000 Network is therefore very important and requires an instrument for funding, either exclusively or by improving the sum for rural development.
Â Â  Mr President, the question asked by my colleague, MrÂ Florenz, is a legitimate one.
There is a political gulf between the priorities set for the Community and the lack of clarity regarding financing.
It is worthy of you, Commissioner Dimas, that you should express a wish, as you did at the start of this debate, to safeguard the financing of Natura 2000.
In addition, we also need effective tools to make your wish a reality.
We need a special fund.
A key challenge for the European Union is to protect the diversity of nature in the area we all share.
Diversity is an all-important issue and for that reason it does not need to be justified separately here.
Every Member State has committed itself to this by drawing up a list of its conservation areas in accordance with the Habitats Directive.
From the point of view of nature conservation policy, the Natura 2000 network is unique, because it protects the environment of approximately 200 habitat types and 700 species, and will soon cover more than 17% of the EUâs territory.
The Natura 2000 network requires considerable input on the part of the Member States.
The areas must not see any significant reduction in the natural resources which qualify them for inclusion in the Natura network.
The authorities must likewise draft an appraisal of the environmental impact in all projects and plans that may have an effect on the natural worth of the areas concerned.
As this wide-ranging impact of the Natura 2000 network on all current and planned conservation area activity will demand a good deal in the way of resources and financial investment from the EU Member States, we really must ensure that sufficient, comprehensive funding is assigned at EU level to the administration of the Natura 2000 network by means of a separate financial instrument.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissionâs Communication on the financing of NaturaÂ 2000 lists various possibilities for dealing with the needs that will arise during the 2007-2013 period.
It concludes, as the Commissioner pointed out, that the creation of a new financial instrument is not the appropriate formula.
I completely agree with this point of view, even though it has not been expressed a great deal here this afternoon.
The NaturaÂ 2000 areas proposed by the Member States are eligible as priorities, in the majority of cases, for the Cohesion and Structural Funds, and could be priorities for benefiting from Life funds for the costs of managing and monitoring the programmes.
Why, therefore, should we want to distinguish the funding of Natura 2000 programmes from the funding of regional or rural policies?
The actions in both cases are very much linked, whether the objectives are related to local development, protecting environments or maintaining biodiversity.
There would be a huge risk that Natura 2000 would become completely disconnected from everything that was done elsewhere in the areas concerned.
The obstacles encountered during the long â or even very long â period of defining the Natura 2000 areas would be multiplied, and the isolation of this mechanism, which is supposed to be exemplary, would be even greater.
The other risk would be that it would be excessively complex to implement and manage programmes.
This would result in an increase in operational costs and create the impression of a monumental technocracy that would be rejected by the populations concerned.
Finally, it should be pointed out that the forecast costs of the programmes are very variable depending on the country and the Natura 2000 areas chosen.
Intelligent use of the Structural Funds, to which additional funds under Life could possibly be added, would, in my view, enable us to respond to them much better than with a specific financial instrument.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, historically many habitats which elsewhere in Europe have vanished have survived in the new Member States.
This is why priority was given at the national policy level to setting up the Natura2000 network.
Today, now that the inventory of territories to be protected and their importance for preserving biological diversity are fully understood, the resources for maintaining them may be lacking.
The Commission has announced that it supports funding Natura 2000 from the Rural Development Funds and the Structural Funds.
It has not, however, planned to create a specific financial instrument designed for the network.
I believe that particularly in the new Member States, where there is intense competition at the local project level to obtain resources from Structural Funds and the rural support funds, the European Union nature protection network does not have much prospect of obtaining match funding: this state of affairs should not be permitted.
First, we ought to create a new, unified environmental funding instrument.
Second, we should welcome proposals to supplement the activities supported in the draft regulation with the following â allocating funding for the management of those habitats which will not find support within the framework of the Structural Funds and the Rural Development Funds, allocating funding for pilot projects in the field of environmental technologies, planning preparatory measures for future allocation of money from the Structural Funds.
Only in such a way will accessible sources of funds complement each other in order to maintain Natura 2000, and will we achieve what we intended when creating the Natura 2000 programme.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, there can be noÂ one who does not believe that nature and the environment need to be protected, and NaturaÂ 2000 is an outstanding idea and a positive initiative.
When it comes down to brass tacks, however, and the time comes to provide money for initiatives of this kind and to get them off the ground, a large number of those who had previously expressed their enthusiasm beat a pretty hasty retreat.
The number of people who put themselves out in any way, or who are at least willing to do so, is small.
A number of teething problems have been experienced with regard to the implementation of Natura 2000 that could potentially have been avoided.
For example, the Netherlands has taken the opportunity to ban hunting in many parts of the country, using Natura 2000 as a pretext.
I believe that this has given rise to a great deal of opposition, and in fact CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m stated clearly during the previous parliamentary term that NaturaÂ 2000 is entirely compatible with hunting.
It is also important that knowledge be shared and that uncertainties over application be resolved.
I am firmly convinced that the officials in MrÂ Dimasâ DG have done splendid work in the past, yet no matter how much effort is expended, work of this kind cannot be carried out unless the groundwork has been laid.
Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of landowners or agriculture, and compensation must be granted instead of depriving people of what is due to them.
Natura 2000 must not be implemented at the expense of the common agricultural policy or rural development.
Natura 2000 sites cover 15% of the old EU, and funding measures for the remaining 85% â not including cities and built-up areas â come under rural development and agriculture.
No further reductions should be made to this large area, and I therefore believe that separate and ample funding would be the best solution.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, NaturaÂ 2000 is an extremely ambitious programme that has been in existence for a great many years.
It sometimes imposes restrictions upon landowners, yet this is the first time that the Commission has turned its attention to financing for the programme at European level.
The Commission is proposing that the programme be cofinanced, and I support this proposal.
At the same time, however, it is proposing that the money should come from the Rural Development and Structural Funds, and there are a number of reasons for thinking that the primary source of funding is intended to be rural development, as no separate fund exists for Natura 2000.
As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that either a new fund will be created to finance Natura 2000, or that new provisions will be made to allocate more money to rural development.
Another point I should like to stress is that as a result of the decisions taken by Brussels to cap the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved modulation funds from the first to the second pillar â or in other words to cofinancing for rural development â it is inevitable that landowners and farmers will receive compensation for their efforts from this pillar.
Something else that is quite clear is that there can be no question of the budget available being any less than that proposed by the previous Prodi Commission.
It is impossible to have more Europe for less money when there are 25 Member States, and I am entirely opposed to property being encroached upon without appropriate compensation being granted.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, todayâs debate focuses on the question: âHow does the European Commission, when applying its integrated approach, intend to ensure that the aims of Natura 2000 are met in practice?â
No satisfactory answer has so far been put forward, since neither the European Rural Development Fund nor the Structural Funds enable all the aims of Natura 2000 to be met, or cover all the necessary cofinancing requirements.
Therefore, I consider it important that an opportunity be given to use the Life+ Programme to cover the deficit.
I believe the present proposal should be amended to include an opportunity to make available EU cofinancing for the protection and restoration of habitats of European importance that lie outside agricultural or forested areas.
This is why Natura 2000 should be added to the Life+ regulation as a separately funded activity; also, it would be expedient in the case of Life+ to direct most of the funding for projects through the Member States.
Here the actual contribution of each Member State to the EU Natura 2000 network should be taken into account, including the area of designated bird and nature protection areas.
One current problem is that neither the Structural Funds nor the Rural Development Fund take this Member State contribution to the Natura 2000 network into account, but rather, give preference to projects in more densely populated areas.
Coming from Estonia, I can testify that one of Estoniaâs unique assets is the existence of relatively extensive natural areas.
Estoniaâs projects encompass 16% of the countryâs land area.
The preservation of these areas is simpler and cheaper at the moment than the restoration of former natural areas in Central Europe.
It is not, therefore, logical that a fund to support nature protection activities uses population density, but not the current preservation status of natural resources, as a criterion for funding.
Â Â  Mr President, I support the concept of integrating care for the environment into other policies such as the structural funds, agricultural funds and so on.
However, anyone who cares for the environment knows that the Member States cannot necessarily be trusted to make integration work.
We have heard much about that this afternoon.
I would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to the following point: some states have been very slow to designate Natura 2000 sites at all.
Four countries â the Netherlands, France, Italy and Finland â have Court judgments against them for inadequate designation of special protection areas for birds.
Only one country in the EU â the Netherlands â has completed its designation of special areas for conservation.
These sites make up the Natura 2000 list, so how can we possibly be happy to leave the financing to Member States when they cannot be trusted to nominate the sites?
It is a triumph of hope over experience to suppose that Member States will provide adequate funding for Natura 2000, unless the incentives of specific co-financing for it are on offer via the EU budget.
If and when Mr Dimas replies to the debate, I would like to ask him to give us some up-to-date news on exactly how Natura 2000 is progressing.
Are a number of Member States still not in contact with the Commission on the designation of sites, or is the network now complete?
Second, those who want EU funding for all the Natura 2000 sites have to guard against overbidding.
We need the assurance that care will be integrated into Natura 2000 via the structural funds.
We also need funding via the annual bidding process for the special needs of certain Natura 2000 sites, possibly through the establishment of a biodiversity programme within the LIFE+ Programme.
The Commission has never liked the LIFE Programme.
It involves very few officials doing a lot of very hard work trying to track down what is happening to very small amounts of money.
There is no doubt that it would be administratively convenient for the Commission completely to wind up the LIFE Programme But it would be wrong to do this, Commissioner.
You might say that what you are trying to do is effective, but my colleagues and I believe it is wrong.
Â Â  Commissioner, the inclusion of the Natura 2000 Network in the Regulation on rural development, as proposed by the Commission, is equivalent to throwing away this very ambitious nature protection initiative.
We all know that, following the current discussions on the financial perspectives, there may not be sufficient funds even to cover the lines that until now have been funded by means of the rural development fund, let alone the new actions planned following the reform of September 2003, on improving safety, food quality and livestock welfare.
It is, therefore, a fantasy to believe that, in this context, there will be money to pay for the enormous cost of Natura 2000.
Less and less is known about the funding of this network, but we must acknowledge that we have never really known.
Evidence of this is the designation of the areas for the Natura 2000 Network, which has been delayed by at least twelve years, since the adoption of the directive on habitats.
When the European Commission originally consulted civil society, all the actors â from the farmers to the ecological organisations â expressed their support for funding that initiative by means of a separate and single fund, since that would be the only way to oblige the European Union to make a funding effort.
The Commission, however, took no notice of any of the actors involved in that initiative.
Funding a substantial proportion of the cost of Natura 2000 by means of rural development is not just a fantasy, but its inclusion within the context of agri-environmental measures could jeopardise the efforts of European farmers to respect the ecological conditions imposed on them by the recently implemented reform of the CAP.
The European Commission says that nature conservation is one of its priorities, but at the end of the day it is miserly with the money and expects the farmers and landowners to take responsibility for its financial cost.
Â Â  . Madam President, thank you very much for that constructive debate.
The Commission is fully aware of the importance of securing adequate Community cofinancing for Natura 2000, for which the lists have been approved for five of the six regions, with few gaps in the lists.
All the new Member States have submitted their lists.
The integration approach as proposed is consistent with the intention of Article 8 of the Habitats Directive, which calls for cofinancing from existing funds.
It also builds on existing practice, which is that the rural development and structural funds are already the most important sources of Community funding for the network.
It is estimated that EURÂ 500Â million is spent each year from rural development funds in support of agri-environment measures for Natura 2000 sites.
The Commission has taken note of the concerns with regard to the great limitations of the rural development and structural funds.
In response to this, the latest proposals recognise the need to expand the funding opportunities for Natura 2000 compared with the existing situation.
In both the rural development and structural fund regulations, funding for Natura 2000 is made more explicit and its scope extended.
Of particular significance is the extension of funding for forestry areas in the new rural development regulation.
The importance of this cannot be underestimated since forestry areas represent 30% of the Natura 2000 network.
The Commission will ensure that the integration of Natura 2000 into existing funds is made more effective by including it as a priority in the strategic guidelines that will be issued to Member States when they commence the preparation of their structural fund programmes.
In its negotiations with the Member States on the content of these programmes, the Commission will seek to ensure that the allocations for Natura 2000 match this declared Community priority.
The Commission will also have to approve the national and operational programmes presented to it.
In respect to the proposal for LIFE+, I wish to stress that it is intended to continue to support Natura 2000.
The Member States have the flexibility to set their own priorities and decide the amounts provided for Natura 2000.
It may, therefore, be the case that Natura 2000 will attract a far higher percentage of the LIFE resources than is presently the case.
Designating a precise amount for Natura 2000 in LIFE+ also risks giving the impression that it would be a dedicated fund capable of covering all the needs of the network.
Our proposal is in line with the general principle of integration and simplification of all the other Commission proposals in the context of the Financial Perspectives.
There are now ongoing discussions in the Council and in Parliament on the Commission draft regulation for LIFE+.
If the European Parliament makes a proposal for an amendment during the legislative process, I will of course be prepared to examine it seriously.
In conclusion, the Commission proposals, without offering explicit guarantees, are still able to cover the financial needs for the Natura 2000 network.
I encourage you, therefore, to give your support to the various Commission proposals currently before Parliament.
I welcome your interest in Natura 2000 and look forward to working with Parliament to ensure its effective implementation as a current central pillar of Community biodiversity policy.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  Madam President, this is a debate, or it should be.
If we are simply going to read speeches to each other, we might as well exchange our views by post.
I asked Commissioner Dimas one question: is the Natura network of sites complete, or is the Commission still taking Member States to court for failing to designate those sites?
There is no point in us talking about funding for sites if the Commission does not know what the sites are.
Â Â  . Madam President, I shall repeat what I said before: lists have been approved for five out of six regions, with few gaps in the list.
All the new Member States have submitted their lists.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0008/2005) by Mrs Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 (2004/2132(INI)).
Â Â  . Madam President, what the Commission should really have done in this Action Plan was to put forward legislative proposals.
The latter are an essential part of any action plan, and I hope that Mr Dimas agrees that the central focus of this Action Plan ought to have been the protection of children.
Yet if we ask ourselves what MrÂ Dimas has turned the Commissionâs SCALE programme into, the answer must be that SCALE is now short for âstopping caring about legislating for the environmentâ, and this, MrÂ Dimas, is the major criticism that must be levelled at your proposal.
It is true that you inherited it from the previous Commission, but an action plan cannot consist merely of research, research and more research, with not a single genuine measure to reduce environmental pollution and impact on health, in particular childrenâs health.
An action plan should also not be something that uses a lack of scientific consensus to put off action indefinitely, as that would be to turn the precautionary principle completely on its head.
What we expect from you, MrÂ Dimas, is action, and I am delighted that this House has sent a clear signal in this respect today; we cannot lend our approval to your Action Plan, which in reality is nothing but a plan of non-action.
After all, we agree that the protection of children must be an absolute priority for the European Union; I therefore find it incomprehensible that you can dare to submit a plan of non-action of this kind to this House, and not only that, but that you can dare to call it an action plan.
I believe that this not only insults the intelligence of Members of this House; it flies in the face of our expectations and indeed of the Commissionâs previous proposals.
I should like to say to Mr Schnellhardt and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party that I take a dim view of those who bow to pressure from the tobacco lobby and say that passive smoking does not cause cancer, as this is very far from being the truth.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Ries on her report.
The recognition that health is interconnected with our physical and social environment must become a consistent aspect of mainstream policy and debate.
Mrs Ries is correct in her criticism of the significant gap that exists between the Commission's initial health and environment strategy and this action plan. The gap can be seen in the small number of concrete actions proposed.
We also need to look at the success stories in Ireland and elsewhere in relation to the smoking ban in workplaces.
There has been an 18% drop in cigarette consumption in Ireland and many who opposed a complete ban on tobacco smoke in workplaces now accept it as normal.
We need to move beyond the notion that health is simply a lifestyle choice and the action plan fails to do this.
For the most disadvantaged in our society to be empowered to break free from ill health and poverty, we need defined and concerted action by Member States and the Commission.
Such action must also be adequately resourced.
More action is needed in working with health professionals and NGOs to empower communities to play an active part in building a better environment; we need more action on the protection of children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups, from hazardous environments and products; we need more action on removing hazardous chemicals from the market; and we need adequate labelling on the environmental and health implications of products and materials.
It is also vital that we have recourse to the precautionary principle because of the possible serious risks to health if we fail to act.
I wholeheartedly agree with Mrs Ries and her assertion that in order to ensure the coherence and effectiveness of the action plan, it is necessary to establish adequate funding now for the 2004-2007 period.
I would like to thank her for her work and commend her report to Parliament.
Â Â  I should like to point out to MrsÂ de BrÃºn and to the other Members of the House that interpretation can only be provided for speeches made in an official language of the European Union.
Â Â  .Â Â  We believe that the European Environment Action Plan for 2004-2010 has significant shortcomings, and that it does not deal with the root of the problems.
The fact that the warnings issued by many experts have been ignored for years is not only a result of ignorance and thoughtlessness, but also of the activities of wealthy and influential interest groups that profit from other peopleâs misfortune.
Risk analyses have already demonstrated that a clear risk exists, so research similar to the National Childrenâs Study is not what is needed in many Member States.
That would amount to no more than another risk analysis.
What are actually needed are immediate corrective measures that both reduce and, ideally, eliminate sources of harmful emissions, as such measures would genuinely make it possible to protect peopleâs health and save their lives.
An effective monitoring system is also required, comprising regional screening panels and local prevention programmes.
The Action Plan should focus more on protection of the environment, including the local environment, and on the setting up of a European Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
Like its American prototype, this Agencyâs remit would be to offer a service to citizens of EU Member States by making use of scientific advances, providing reliable information and reacting to public health threats.
In my opinion, the European Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry should come under the umbrella of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and work together with the European Environment Agency.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Madam President, we live in an internal market community, comprising 25 Member States and encompassing a population of over 475 million people.
This creates a system where there is free movement of people from one Member State to the next.
It therefore makes a lot of political sense for the European Union to take a lead coordinating role to promote better health within the European Union.
The EU is in a very strong position to see exactly which Member States are exercising the best techniques to tackle diseases, such as acute respiratory infections, which is the main cause of death for children under the age of five.
The EU must learn from the best practice techniques available within the European Union to tackle health disorders, such as asthma, childhood allergies and neuro-development disorders.
We should recall that it was the European Union that took the initiative recently to ban the use of particular chemicals in the manufacture of plastic tiles.
On a separate matter, the European Commission has already stated that the reduction in the use of tobacco products will be a key political objective of this European Commission.
Great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union.
The bottom line is this: if we are to improve the public health of the people of Europe, we must ensure that adequate budgets are put aside to deal with such problems.
That is why I fully support the recommendation in this report that at least EUR 300Â million be put aside under the 7th Research Framework Programme (2007-2012) to promote a higher standard of health within the European Union.
Finally, the European Parliament has extensive powers of codecision to deal with environmental and public health issues.
I can assure the Commission and the Council presidency that we will use these powers rigorously in the future.
Â Â  Madam President, our way of life is having an ever-greater impact on the environment.
It would be all too easy to paint a black-and-white picture of nightmare scenarios, but we should not forget that we have succeeded in making enormous progress in various fields relating to environmental quality.
One need only think of the Auto Oil I and II programmes which we used to improve the quality of petrol, in so doing combating the problem of acid rain, or the European legislation that has been used to achieve certain levels of air and water quality.
In spite of this, however, I do not believe that we can rest on our laurels.
The figures are alarming; one in six deaths or diseases suffered by children in Europe is attributable to environmental factors, the incidence of allergic respiratory diseases having doubled over the past 20Â years, with every seventh child now affected, and nearly 10% of workers being exposed to carcinogenic substances.
This means that the Action Plan that is currently before us is urgently needed.
We must ensure that the precautionary principle gains acceptance, not least for budgetary reasons.
Public health should be regarded as our top priority in any case, but it is also true that poor public health is an excessive burden on our state budgets.
The form taken by the Action Plan therefore needs to be improved in the following respects.
Although the Commission was right in its decision to prioritise the need to combat four environmentally-related diseases, the approach it has taken leaves much to be desired.
No consideration has been given to a large number of recently published studies, and there are no provisions relating to the application of legal instruments, in contrast to the SCALE initiative.
There is also a lack of measures aimed at informing the public about the causal connection between environmental pollution and health, and no provision has been made for a long-term evaluation that would make it possible to examine whether the measures are helping to reduce environmentally-related health problems in a cost-effective manner.
Priority should therefore be given to research into the production and use of everyday products that contain allergenic or carcinogenic chemicals.
Â Â  Madam President, the risk of dying of cancer is four times greater for women hairdressers than for women in general.
A third of work-related illnesses are due to the use of chemicals dangerous to peopleâs health.
As we write in this report, damage to the nervous system caused by mercury, pesticides and other chemicals has increased markedly in recent decades.
The work on discovering and phasing out dangerous chemicals is, then, a decisive factor in improving peopleâs health.
This fact, although emphasised in this report, must also form the basis for this Houseâs forthcoming discussions concerning the future chemicals policy, REACH.
Diseases and ill-health affect different groups in society in different ways.
Children are very sensitive to environmental influences.
People on low incomes are affected more often by disease than people on high incomes, and there is a difference between ill health in men and ill health in women.
The committee has borne these factors in mind, and it has been very important to us Social Democrats to have them included.
We have had the report include both the fact that there needs to be more focus upon particularly vulnerable groups and the fact that data must be collected in such a way that more information can be obtained about the ways in which different groups in society are vulnerable and are affected by various forms of environmental pollution.
For example, we want to see statistics broken down according to gender so that we can discover and combat differences between men and women where health and disease are concerned.
It is not only our environment that causes illness.
Lifestyle-related illness also constitutes a great threat today.
We Social Democrats have therefore chosen to emphasise the need for increased efforts to combat disease caused, especially, by alcohol but also by tobacco, poor diet and lack of exercise.
Â Â  Madam President, many thanks are due to Mrs Ries for her hard work on this report.
Human health, both physical and mental, is directly related to the environment we live in.
Most disease processes are the result of interactions between our bodies and various environmental factors.
This is common sense.
An environment and health action plan should have two main goals: firstly, to identify quickly the main environmental health risk factors and, secondly, to eliminate or minimise their effect on human health as soon as possible.
This is also common sense.
The action plan proposed by the Commission is, unfortunately, more planning and less action.
It is principally concerned with improving information and research relating to environmental pollutants and disease causation, and enhancing environment health communication procedures between Member States.
It eventually aims to help improve human health.
Is this common sense?
On one hand yes, because information, research and cooperation in environment-health interaction matters are always a good thing, , we do not necessarily need more time- and money-consuming, research-related mechanisms in order to act fast and save lives now.
We already know which main environment hazards kill people, so it would be common sense to concentrate first on these and try to eliminate them quickly and efficiently.
An obvious example is smoking.
We know that both active and passive smoking kills hundreds of thousands of people in Europe every year.
We also know that the only effective way to reduce the deadly habit of smoking is to drastically increase the price of cigarettes, to ban cigarette advertising completely and to stop our farmers from producing tobacco.
Is this what we are doing?
Not quite!
A packet of cigarettes is still relatively cheap in many EU Member States; cigarette advertising, in particular indirect advertising, which is more effective because it acts subconsciously, is still happening and we are still subsidising many of our farmers to grow tobacco.
This is definitely not common sense.
In conclusion, I say 'yes' to research and information for combating long-term environment-related diseases we do not know much about, but I urge the Commission to say 'yes' to immediate drastic action to prevent the diseases we already are very familiar with today.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people are concerned about the impact of the environment on their health, and these are very specific concerns.
It has now been adequately proven that fertility is decreasing and the number of miscarriages is rising as a result of environmental influences.
It is becoming increasingly clear that people suffer from allergies.
The number of children suffering from asthma and having to go through life with inhalers is on the up.
The influence of tobacco smoke on the health of non-smokers has become abundantly clear to us all.
The action plan thus fits into the scale approach which focuses on five key concepts: science, children, awareness, legal instruments and evaluation.
I have to say, though, Commissioner, that when the action programme was presented, there was a great deal of disappointment and scepticism.
Allow me to mention three points.
Firstly, there is the significant gap between the ambitions in the general strategy and the action plan itself.
Secondly, the action plan is not really an action plan, but rather a research plan, and one that will probably fail to actually reduce the disease burden that is caused by environmental pollution.
As various Members have told the House, Commissioner, we do not need more research or studies; what we really do need, though, is action.
Thirdly, there are no concrete financial proposals from the Commission as to how all this is to be funded.
Without funding, you cannot get the show on the road; that, Commissioner, is impossible and not feasible, that much we know.
This leads to much scepticism, much concern, although fortunately there is satisfaction about Mrs Riesâ report and the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I should like to focus on two more points that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to introduce by way of two amendments; we would like to emphasise that no targets have been proposed for the proposed actions, and that, out of the 13 actions, only three pertain to specific measures to reduce the disease burden.
Secondly, we would like to emphasise that there is no system of biomonitoring in place with a link to environmental medicine.
I urge you, Commissioner, to take Parliamentâs remarks into consideration and would be grateful if you turned your action plan into a real action plan that does credit to its name.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was high time that account was taken of the direct impact which environmental factors may have on man.
This is something that we oncologists know about and, unfortunately, frequently come up against.
Environmental pollution plays a huge part in the development of cancer, a disease which will attack one in three Europeans during their lifetime.
Allow me to give you a prediction, Commissioner: at the rate at which cardiology, both interventional and surgical, is progressing today, do not be surprised if, in a few years' time, cancer becomes the primary cause of death in the Member States of the European Union.
However, the prevention of cancer and other diseases is necessary and clearly more economical than their further treatment.
I would like to emphasise here that smoking, against which Commissioner Kyprianou is campaigning, is the basic but not the only environmental factor which plays a huge part in the development of cancer.
Unfortunately, the Commission confines itself in the REACH plan to pronouncements alone, while it delays the definition of legislative measures and special headings for their application with the excuse that more research is needed.
As Mrs Ries also said, the plan is an evaluation plan rather than an action plan.
There are numerous valid scientific studies on substances which are harmful to the environment and human health, which makes us wonder what interests the Commission is protecting: the interests of the European citizen or of the big industries?
There is an urgent need for certain specific dangerous substances referred to in the report to be withdrawn from the European market, especially as safer alternatives are available.
In this case, among other things, the supposed lack of information should not be put forward as an excuse for the lack of action.
Similarly, it is absolutely necessary for resources to be found both for research, which naturally needs to be intensified, and for the prevention of diseases with an environmental cause.
Nowhere does the plan propose taking recourse to the precautionary principle. Nor does it stipulate where the money will come from.
In addition, resources are needed for informing the public and professionals, with a view to cleaning up workplaces and indoor and outdoor spaces frequented by children from active and passive smoking, which the report provides for, as well as from other factors.
I should like to emphasise here the vulnerable position of low-income social groups which, because of their economic and social position, are exposed to a disproportionate degree to environmental risks, such as workers in unhealthy professions.
I close with the hope that both the European Commission and the European Council will take serious account of the report by Mrs Ries, whom I congratulate on her work.
Â Â  Madam President, if we are ill, health is our most desired object.
If we are well, it is hopefully one of our most valued.
In Ireland we have a saying that illustrates the priority we give to health.
If someone fails an exam or dents his car bumper or something like that, we put the calamity in perspective by saying 'at least we have our health'.
I want to congratulate Mrs Ries: she has not minced her words.
The health of people, especially of children, is being put at risk in our countries in Europe and the health action plan in its present form is not equipped truly to protect us.
Mrs Ries has also strongly continued the important process of naming and shaming toxic chemicals and seeking their eradication.
I would like to support her in this and, if anything, express the hope that we can soon add to the list more chemicals such as antimony, dioxins, and fluorosilic acid.
I would like to mention that the last toxic chemical, fluorosilic acid, which is used to fluoridate water supplies in my country, has the invidious effect of making other toxic substances, such as lead, mercury and aluminium, exponentially more dangerous.
It is a chemical usher that leeches these other poisons into the water and then transfers them to body tissue and bone.
I am glad that mercury, which is probably the most neurotoxic pollutant of them all, comes under scrutiny in Mrs Ries' report.
I would also extend the awareness of the dangers of mercury to include the fact that it is used as a convenient industrial preservative that needs to be replaced.
I am also especially concerned that the action plan should be improved to include truly efficient and responsive health monitoring systems.
Another saying we have at home is 'at least no one died', but this is no longer true: people are dying.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb in my part of the world to the effect that the healthy have one hundred wishes, whereas the sick have only one â to become healthy.
There is a great deal of wisdom in this proverb, and we must therefore support every effort made to maintain the health of society and the individuals within it.
Yet without wishing to disparage the Commissionâs efforts, this Action Plan is an investigation â and not only that, but an investigation for which the latest findings could unfortunately not be used â rather than an effective, detailed and far-reaching measure aimed at rectifying a situation that has been recognised as a problem.
Unlike many of the previous speakers, my aim is not to see the glass as half empty; I should like to see it as half full, and to congratulate you on your efforts. At the same time, however, I should like to encourage you to do more and to be more courageous in the conclusions you draw.
By way of an illustration of the precautionary principle, I should like to cite the following example.
The Italian Government recently banned smoking in virtually all indoor spaces in Italy, and a wave of indignation swept through the country; yet there can be no doubt that the ban has had a positive impact.
If the EURÂ 1Â billion spent today on growing tobacco were, gradually and in due course, to be reallocated to health, a courageous step could be taken towards improving it.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam President.
When the European Parliament through the report of FrÃ©dÃ©rique Ries sets out specific measures for implementing the programme of the common environmental and health policy for the period 2004-2010, we may be aware that these are areas in which the European Union is becoming a world leader.
After all this is not just a free trade zone, it is also a political, economic and even social project.
The fight against social exclusion is one of its key elements.
Following enlargement, environmental and health policies have acquired new frameworks.
The European Union of 25 members is registering an increase in regional and social differences, something that is directly reflected in peopleâs quality of health.
Counter to expectations, 55 million people are living in poverty.
The most vulnerable groups are older people living alone, single mothers and the unemployed.
The profiles of these groups, which are at risk as a result of exclusion and therefore also in terms of health, clearly illustrate how societies have developed, how production methods have changed and how economies work.
The new Member States are not a homogeneous whole, but certain indicators are similar, since they are the result of similar conditions in the transition period.
There is an especially large gulf between the old and new Member States regarding the extent of funds invested in health care.
I trust that by means of the common strategy it will gradually be possible to reverse the negative trends we are seeing at present.
Like the environment, the health of the population is an interdepartmental issue.
Less development means less health.
Timely investments in health reduce the costs to the economy as a whole.
Â Â  â Madam President, this plan proposes to implement actions through existing initiatives and programmes to which resources have already been allocated under the operational budgets of the services concerned, in particular the Public Health Programme and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research.
Forgive me for being sceptical.
It is inevitable that new initiatives will be required to move the action plan forward.
I would stress the importance of identifying gaps in knowledge and ensuring that any initiatives necessary to fill such gaps are well thought out and capable of delivering the required outcomes.
These must be based on EU risk evaluation procedures and the opinions of relevant scientific committees, which also allow for peer review.
The integrity of the legislation we adopt in this House continually and increasingly depends on scientific rigour, and I have increasing concerns about that.
All impact assessments must be attributable to their authors.
They should not be merely the result of in-house navel gazing.
The authors' names must be on every impact assessment, so that we know where they come from and whether we believe vested interests are involved.
In our Member States there is a need for much-improved coordination between public bodies carrying out activities related to food monitoring, drinking water monitoring, air quality monitoring, and so on. In relation to health impact assessment, it seems to be internationally accepted that the methodology is evolving rather than settled, and that there is considerable difficulty in establishing and collecting the statistical data needed scientifically to underpin health impact assessments.
We cannot protect people from themselves, nor should we legislate for all life's risks.
We have to be frank about this.
I would like to see a definition of public health.
We continue to use that term across a swathe of legislation; it means different things in different countries.
The Commission is talking about the health of the European public, not delivering public health services.
In conclusion, I would like the Commission to ban mass medication of the public water supply.
From an ethical point of view, it can no longer be accepted by the EU institutions.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking you all for your constructive remarks in both the report and during the debate today.
The contribution of the European Parliament is very important.
Through the close cooperation between Parliament and the Commission we will be able to provide the European Union with an effective and efficient way of addressing the possible consequences on human health of environmental concerns.
I wish to comment briefly on your observations and try to answer your questions.
The gradual setting-up of an integrated environment and health information system, in which human bio-monitoring will play an essential role, is the added value of the Action Plan.
It is a long-term and ambitious plan, but this will not prevent us from taking action.
Indeed, many actions have already been taken on the major environment and health issues.
Just to give you some examples, I wish to draw your attention to clean water and sanitation, which are dealt with through the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Bathing Water Directive.
Respiratory diseases will be tackled even more through CAFE the Clean Air for Europe programme.
Diseases related to chemical and physical stresses are already addressed through the legislation on pesticides and biocides.
The new chemicals policy REACH will be an essential cornerstone in this area.
We need to bear in mind how far we have come and ensure that we build on existing efforts rather than duplicate them.
There is already a great deal of legislative action forthcoming which will have an impact on the protection of human health.
This relates in particular to the thematic strategies of REACH and CAFE.
We must continue with our efforts before coming up with additional elements and it is for this reason that the environment and health strategy focuses on preparing the next generation of environmental legislation.
The environment and health strategy contained a specific focus on children and during the stakeholder consultation process to prepare the Action Plan, experts highlighted that concern.
Firstly, that parental exposure should be included to cover the unborn child and, secondly, that we should look at adults in order to cover diseases caused by childhood exposure.
For these reasons the Action Plan has widened the focus to include adults as well, taking into consideration the various categories of vulnerability.
The precautionary principle is at the core of environment policy and it will continue to be the cornerstone of our action.
It will be applied according to the conditions set out in the relevant legislation.
The Commission fully agrees with this line.
I want to be extremely clear to avoid any possible misunderstanding.
The Commission will not use this lack of information in the field of environment and health as an excuse for inaction.
Regarding the financial plan, we very much welcome Parliament's support in its role as budgetary authority for the funding to implement the Action Plan.
We are constrained by the existing budgetary initiatives until 2006 and we will make the best use of all available funds.
We are currently making the case within the Commission for a very substantial increase in the amount of research funding devoted to environment and health.
Parliament's request for funding of EUR 300 million for 2007-2010 provides us with extremely useful political support.
However, the Member States must also play a role.
A European Union version of the United States' National Children's Study, which the Parliament has requested, would cost about EUR 100 million per year.
This amounts to a massive increase of our current environment and health funding.
We hope to provide as much support as possible at European Union level, but major commitment must also come from the Member States.
The Commission greatly values Parliament's cooperation and its constructive efforts in this area.
In order to make the most of this the Commission will regularly inform the relevant parliamentary committee on the progress made in implementing the Action Plan.
Finally, I would like to underline that by 2007 we will have made significant progress in establishing the information system and we hope to have the first results of the effectiveness of cost efficiency measures to address health problems.
At this point we will report back to Parliament in substantive terms on whether existing policies are working and what new policy initiatives will be required.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0016/2005) by MrÂ Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on driving licences.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 October 2003, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on driving licences, which you will debate in a moment.
There are currently more than 110Â different models of driving licences, some granting different rights, that are valid and in circulation in the Member States.
In an open area in which freedom of movement of citizens is the rule, the consequences of this situation are clear.
It is difficult to carry out checks on the licences, the public authorities have problems making sense of them, and citizens often have problems with their driving licences not being recognised.
This situation is no longer acceptable.
The directive proposed by the Commission has three main objectives: protecting against fraud, freedom of movement and road safety.
In terms of protection against fraud, the Commission proposes eliminating the paper model.
From the date of application of the directive, the only Community model that can be used will be the plastic card.
This will also help to reduce the number of models in circulation.
The Member States will be able to insert a microchip into the driving licence that will, of course, only contain the information on the plastic card and will not be able to be used for other purposes.
This will help to increase protection against fraud.
The Commission also proposes introducing a period of validity for the licence that is limited in time.
This administrative period of validity, which will be ten years for car and motorcycle licences, will mean that each time it is renewed, the fraud protection elements can be updated and that a recent photo can appear on the document.
This is the real way to avoid a similar situation to the one we have now.
The introduction of the limited period of validity will enable us to remove the final obstacle to free movement in this area.
Citizens who settle in another Member State will therefore no longer be faced with validity periods that vary from one Member State to another.
This is the element that, along with the harmonisation of the licence model, will enable us to remove obstacles to free movement.
The Commissionâs proposal also aims to improve road safety.
For this purpose, the Commission proposes introducing a new category of driving licence for mopeds.
Moped drivers are the youngest people on the road driving motor vehicles.
They are also particularly vulnerable, as all the statistics show, as they have a proportionally much higher involvement in accidents than other road users.
The Commission also proposes regulating access to driving the most powerful motorbikes on a progressive basis, doing the same for HGVs and the most powerful coaches, harmonising the frequency of medical examinations for professional drivers and introducing minimum requirements for initial qualification and continuous training for driving licence examiners.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, here is an ambitious proposal for improving road safety, ensuring freedom of movement and combating driving licence fraud.
It will have a clear impact on many citizens for whom a driving licence is a guarantee of mobility and freedom of movement and an identification document for everyday life.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking all those involved â not only the Commission and Parliamentâs administration, but also my fellow Members.
Over the past few months, work on the directive on driving licences has been marked by a desire to achieve coherence and to engage in extensive dialogue.
The reason for this is that the varying opinions that have emerged on this issue have resulted from differences in outlook between the individual countries, rather than from party politics.
This is why, Commissioner, I wish to thank the Commission for its clear advice, as well as everyone who has worked very hard on this subject.
While seeking consensus and coherence, we also considered it important that this whole instrument should be of public benefit, affecting as it does, after all, almost two thirds of the adult population of Europe.
This is precisely why we chose to go a little further: instead of 111 driving licences plus a European model, the proposal tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism envisages a reduction to one single European driving licence within a reasonable time frame of about ten or twenty years.
This naturally has a certain symbolic value, but it also offers the advantage of simplifying roadside checks; simplified checks, of course, are consistent with the fight against crime and fraud â and we are all familiar with the problem of licence tourism in Europe; the Internet is full of pages devoted to it, which is why this is a matter for the Member States too.
The point is that, if we have a single driving licence and can therefore simplify and centralise data in the Member States, and if the latter are also willing to cooperate in exchanging these data, this will surely go some way towards curbing fraud and improving mobility in Europe.
The public also gain added value from legal certainty.
Far from wishing to encroach upon acquired rights, we seek to reinforce them.
We also want to ensure that those who drive for a living do not lose their rights when they move home, for example, as we have seen from some of the complaints lodged with the Commission.
The proposal would also benefit people who travel from one country to another as tourists and who would like their rights to be recognised wherever they go.
We have also opted to refrain from any age discrimination and have therefore left it up to the Member States to introduce medical or other purely preventive tests as they see fit.
I firmly believe, however, that the rules already established in several countries will spread to others.
Another benefit is increased road safety; in this respect, the draft directive follows the Commission line in its reliance on basic training.
Basic training is the fundamental element, but it does not interfere in any way with systems of advanced training.
In this respect we have sought consistency with the Directive on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers, be it for bus drivers or for HGV drivers.
Another example is our solution to the problem of campers and caravans, which lies in appropriate training rather than the introduction of a complex B+E licence; in this way, we take due account of tourism, which plays an important part, as we all know, in the development of the European economy.
A step-up approach with regard to motorcyclists is also a feature of the underlying philosophy, and in your introduction, MrÂ Vice-President, you referred to the universally recognised fact that more efforts can and must be made in this direction.
There are still more than 40Â 000 deaths on our roads, and while the number of deaths in car accidents is falling, the same cannot be said, regrettably, for motorcycle accidents, which continue to claim an alarmingly high number of lives.
This is why we have adopted the step-up approach, but we do not intend to base this on theory tests.
We have opted for training, and accordingly we intend to enable those Member States which prefer to set a younger minimum age to guarantee legal certainty in this respect for their citizens, but their systems would have to be graduated as prescribed in the draft directive.
We do not wish to challenge the traditions of a number of countries in this domain, traditions rooted in factors such as mobility requirements and economic conditions, but we do wish to pursue a general strategy based on a European average age and a system of progressive training.
There are equivalence problems, and these will not go away.
What we have done is to launch an initial attempt to cover three- and four-wheeled vehicles too, but we are also aware that the inherent problems cannot be resolved overnight.
For my own part, I still believe that it would be ill-advised to cover cars and motorcycles with the same licence, because they require two very different sets of driving skills, even though it might be a means of improving mutual understanding between motorists and motorcyclists.
To sum up, then: simplification, legal certainty, road safety and the suppression of fraud are the main elements we sought to emphasise in our proposal.
Finally, let me reiterate my thanks to all my fellow Members for their great goodwill and cooperation over the past few months.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, on his excellent report on the Commissionâs proposal for a third Directive on driving licences.
He has presented detailed proposals for improvements relating to the future introduction of a uniform European driving licence and, most importantly, has drawn up people-friendly provisions, such as those dealing with caravans and campers.
He has also tabled clear proposals for improvements in the realm of so-called driving-licence tourism.
The cause of road safety is not served by allowing someone whose licence has been revoked with good reason to obtain a new one immediately in a neighbouring country.
In this respect, MrÂ Grosch has made an excellent job of fleshing out the principle of eliminating licence tourism.
There are, however, two points in the report which my group rejects.
Like the Commission, MrÂ Vice-President, we oppose the compulsory exchange of existing driving licences.
Road safety is not improved in any way by making people go to a public authority, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document.
At best, such an arrangement facilitates police checks, but it does nothing to improve road safety.
If the benefit of simpler police checks is compared with the trouble and inconvenience to which drivers would be put â tens of thousands of them, if not more, who will never drive in another EU country would still be required to obtain a new licence â the inconvenience outweighs any benefits, and my group joins the Commission in opposing such a provision.
The second point we reject in the report relates to the compulsory limitation of the validity of licence documents.
This does nothing to enhance road safety either.
It only means that people have to go to the authorities, have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document, even though, as the rapporteur rightly recognises, the authorisation resulting from the original driving test remains valid.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to help us by supporting our position for the sake of the people of Europe.
We do not want the compulsory exchange of driving licences, and we do not want any limitation of their validity.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to thank MrÂ Grosch for his excellent cooperation and his very constructive method of working on the process of producing the committeeâs proposal.
All the political groups participated, and we are grateful for their having done so.
It is a matter, in this case, of shuttling between traditions and differences in the various Member States, but without losing sight of the objective, namely that of increasing peopleâs mobility in the EU and promoting road safety.
It is now a question of embarking upon the long road towards a driving licence for the whole of the EU.
This will take many years, but it is important for old driving licences to be replaced.
The reason for this is the need to put a stop to driving licence tourism whereby driving licences are lost and new ones bought.
We now have 110 varieties of licence, and the police cannot check whether a driving licence that might be confiscated, or one that they see, is genuine.
In Sweden, a situation existed a few years ago in which you could go into a back-street printerâs and buy a driving licence from your old country of origin and then go to the relevant Swedish authority and exchange the licence for a Swedish one.
That is unacceptable, and we cannot have such a situation.
I therefore think that the Council of Ministers needs to approve the replacement of old driving licences.
It will take 60 years before we have an acceptable situation if we have to comply with the proposal by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
That is not to be tolerated.
Change is vitally important for us as fellow road users, for we too are out and about on the roads and we want to know that the driving licences that exist are genuine.
Where doctors or pilots are concerned, we should never accept a situation in which we did not know whether their papers and knowledge were genuine.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the greater part of the committeeâs proposal.
We do not think that endless doctorsâ examinations of healthy drivers, as proposed by the Commission, are a good idea.
Europeâs doctors must be used to treat people who are ill and for work in the health sphere, not for checking up on every driver.
It is of course self-evident that doctorsâ examinations and sight tests should be required when driving licences are issued.
Where mopeds and motorcycles are concerned, we in the PSE Group wish to encourage training and tests in a situation where drivers begin with mopeds and then advance through the classes of driving licence.
We also want the Member States to be able to introduce rules concerning peopleâs having direct access, within those Member States, to heavy motorcycles when they reach the age of 21.
National exemptions are accepted for cars and mopeds, and we therefore believe that this should also be the case for motorcycles.
Where caravans and motorised campers are concerned, we share MrÂ Groschâs position.
Finally, the development we anticipate is one in which more and more cars are equipped with safety devices such as alcohol locks and reminders to drivers to fasten their seat belts and switch their lights on.
This is encouraged by the European Commission and by safety organisations.
We must, therefore, also help produce a basic document entitling people to drive vehicles: a driving licence that is genuine, reliable and up-to-date.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, I have to congratulate the rapporteur, whose task was incredibly difficult and who was dealing with something that affects nearly all citizens but was at the same time very technical, with many details and large differences between Member States.
His task was made all the more difficult because, although everyone may accept the principles and agree that the system should be simplified and better monitored and such like, no one is actually prepared to give up national differences.
We use each otherâs roads more and more, which means that we must trust each other to a greater extent in the documents we issue to drivers, but the issuing of those documents is still considered a kind of strategic, almost military secret within every Member State, where the seals must therefore be closely guarded.
I think, Mr Grosch, that this must make your assignment all the more difficult, and it has not made our job any easier either.
My group agrees on the evident need for the introduction of a European model, and we believe that this should be done as quickly as possible, with regular administrative updates.
We are, however, opposed to the introduction of additional tests.
They are administrative updates, after all, and it would not be fair on the elderly.
Besides, the statistics do not bear out the need for them.
There is no evidence anywhere to suggest that the elderly are particularly unsafe drivers.
Moreover, we should not make it more difficult for them to drive cars, which are, for very many older people, simply a lifeline.
The same must apply to those in poor health.
Ideally, the decision to drive a car or not should be a joint decision taken by a patient and his GP, with the GP judging in good conscience whether or not that person is still able to drive a car, and the patient should respect that decision.
I think that the principle we need to adhere to is not to draft European rules that are too detailed, to impose general principles as is the case in your report and take the decision as close to the citizen as possible.
The Committee of European Experts can continue and do their work by all means, but I think that the work should ideally be done as closely to the public as possible.
Our group has tabled a few amendments to bring driving licences for mopeds and motorcycles into line with the tradition in the Member States and not to be too restrictive in this.
We support the general thrust of Mr Groschâs report, which we see, at any rate, as a major step forward.
We are moving towards better scope for control within the European Union.
In time, we will explain to the citizens that they have licences allowing them to drive a car or motorcycle, or such like, across the entire Union.
In the Union, we will be able to rely on the tests set in the different Member States.
Therefore, we have certainty that anyone who is given such a licence is a good driver of a moped, a motorcycle, a car or a lorry.
I think that the public will come to realise that the European Union also serves very concrete purposes.
I think that your report is a step in the right direction, and for that I should like to thank you.
Â Â  Madam President, I should firstly like to thank MrÂ Grosch for a really constructive piece of work and to congratulate him on this.
We have listened to each other, and I think we are now in a situation in which it is also apparent that arguments have played a helpful role.
I think that some sterling work has been done, and I also think it splendid that MrÂ Grosch has shifted attention away from some rather abstract fight against terrorism, or whatever it was to begin with, to the issue of road safety and of the real terror we have in Europe whereby the number of people killed and maimed on our roads is equivalent to the number of casualties that would occur if one jumbo jet per week were to crash, killing everyone on board.
It is really important that we get something done about this, and a prior condition â or one of the prior conditions â for getting something done is, of course, that we have driving licences that can be checked up on and that are recognised throughout Europe.
I think it excellent that we have not subjected our elderly people to more tests.
It is good that, in this House too, we recognised that most of them are, of course, outstanding motorists who compensate for their reduced reaction times by driving carefully.
If only fit and healthy people would put careful driving before over-confidence.
There was one point we found it very difficult to understand.
There are countries â and I do not believe that the whole of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fall into this camp â that apparently attach inordinate value to their driving licences.
I think they should take a much more relaxed attitude to their old driving licences instead of cherishing them as if they were things that cannot be exchanged.
In that way, we should obtain a driving licence we can use in the rest of Europe.
There is no sign of driving licences being exchanged.
We tried it in Denmark, and it worked.
The world did not come to an end.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Grosch on his work, which I believe will continue to pay dividends for a long time to come.
At the same time, however, there is another point I should like to make.
This House frequently favours unnecessary regulations and a surplus of details, thus making issues that are simple and obvious needlessly complex.
One of the reasons for this may well be that the European Parliament is an EU institution.
Many European countries, including my country, Poland, already issue perfectly good driving licences equipped with a great many security features, and paper driving licences are in any case being gradually replaced.
Training for learner drivers is also constantly improving, and countries are learning a great deal from each other.
This is why I am concerned to hear that many citizens in EU Member States will have to undergo the ordeal of exchanging their driving licence yet again.
In my opinion the inclusion of microchips and the frequent exchange of driving licences as proposed by MrÂ Grosch entails unnecessary expense.
It would also be a waste of time for the citizens, who would prefer to do anything else rather than stand in a queue waiting for a licence to be issued.
Finally, I should like to point out that, in my view, official restrictions that determine whether foreigners may apply for and be issued with driving licences are incompatible with the principle of the free movement of persons.
A distinction should be made between those who have committed an offence in their own country and are attempting to acquire a new driving licence in another country, and those who live in border regions and prefer to choose a better and cheaper driving school on the other side of the border.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to begin my speech by thanking Mr Grosch for his fine leadership of this project under difficult circumstances.
As a representative of a new Member State, this situation with driving licences actually came as a big surprise to me since in Latvia, my country, we started issuing plastic licences of the size of a credit card two years after regaining independence.
Speaking personally, ten years of using my first plastic licence have already expired, and I replaced it last year with a new one displaying the European Union symbol.
Because of this it is relatively difficult for me to understand why the representatives of some states find it politically impossible to say that paper licences should be replaced with plastic licences.
If Latvia was able to do this then in my view other states can do it too.
And if we have a common internal market and free movement of the labour force, it is difficult to understand why we cannot adopt a unified system for obtaining driving licences, health requirements and similar matters, since any European Union driver may cause problematic traffic situations in any other European Union state.
It also seems to me that on the issue of microchips and their use, both the Commission and Parliament could have been stricter and could have retained an obligation to introduce them in the foreseeable future.
I very much hope that tomorrow we will vote in favour of this commendable draft directive at first reading.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating in plenary an issue on which much time has been spent by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, whom I thank for his diligent and timely report, with which I am largely, although not wholly, in agreement.
Mr Sterckx stated that we all agreed with the aim of having a single EU format, although some differences undoubtedly exist.
He was referring, in particular, to administrative renewal of licences for the elderly.
In my view, this is an area which, in general, requires greater attention.
By way of example: I fly a totally harmless machine, one which does not even have an engine.
I believe that in the event of an accident, the only victim would be myself and, at most, one other person.
Despite that, I am required, in Italy, to take out compulsory insurance, undergo a medical examination every two years and submit to a raft of administrative and other requirements which, frankly, appear excessive when compared to the level of danger to society represented by a motor vehicle which, in the event of an accident, can cause carnage.
Accordingly, we have to be very careful.
The issue is, therefore, to harmonise an area with significant consequences on the lives of citizens and with obvious social implications for motoristsâ behaviour.
Thus, we need to harmonise not only a document â it is not just a question of switching from a paper licence to a plastic one â but also peopleâs performance at the wheel.
To this end, we need to ensure that police are able to identify with certainty a driver who may be infringing the Highway Code.
I should also like to mention particularly the amendments submitted jointly with some fellow Members concerning the introduction of the AM licence for mopeds.
I believe we should be grateful to users of 2-wheeled means of transport because, particularly in countries in southern Europe, they contribute to resolving serious traffic problems, help our environment and improve the quality of life in towns and cities, particularly those with an older, more traditional urban fabric.
All dangerous behaviour must be punished and prevented, and there is no shortage of ways of achieving this.
However, penalising two-wheeled traffic, which this directive does in part, will, in my view, damage not only our economies but also the quality of life in general.
Â Â  â I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Grosch on his report and by saying that my main concern in this debate on the future adoption of a European driving licence is that a good idea should not be spoiled by excessive regulation leading to more obligations and obstacles for drivers in the EU.
The idea is a good one.
Given that European citizens are enjoying increasing freedom of movement, it is necessary to harmonise basic rules intended to foster safety on the roads, to prevent fraud due to the improper use of false licences and to prevent drivers who have been penalised in one country from easily obtaining a new licence in another.
Presented in this way, this is a simple message, which will be easily understood by those it is intended for and will be heeded by the public without any difficulty.
The problem arises when a good idea, an obviously welcome political initiative, is undermined by the temptation to regulate.
What we must avoid, when it comes to beneficial measures such as this one, is an increase in regulatory and bureaucratic constraints and in financial costs for EU drivers, when such steps are always debatable.
We must also ensure that no national limitations are created for those learning to ride other vehicles, such as motorcycles.
Otherwise, the subsidiarity principle â and respect for practices that have been legitimately established by the authorities in the Member States â will not be duly taken into account.
This would then result, in one way or another, in obstacles â sometimes imperceptible ones â being in the way of all European citizens seeking to enjoy their right to drive, regardless of all of the statements to the contrary that we shall all no doubt make.
These were the underlying reasons why I supported a range of amendments to the report before us, all of which were drawn up with the aim of making life easier for the public and for the various road sector operators and, at the same time, with the aim of promoting safer road transport.
I shall conclude by saying that the most significant of the four European freedoms is freedom of movement.
Â Â  Madam President, I am pleased that you are chairing this sitting, because I know that you are a very careful and safe driver and that you are greatly interested in the whole question of road safety.
It is a regrettable fact that skulduggery, cheating and forgery take place in the EU in connection with driving licences.
These activities are made easier by the 110 different licence models that are currently in use in the European Union, and let us be honest: we need look no further for an example than Germany, where many drivers still have the collectorâs item we call the grey rag; some of these have even paid the occasional visit to a washing machine.
The limp grey card with its youthful photograph may be a cherished memento in the eyes of its owner, but it is certainly an inadequate form of identification for roadside checks.
As you know, I started my working life as a police officer; what is a poor policeman in Palermo, Bordeaux or Madrid to do when he stops a vehicle and is shown a tatty piece of scrap paper that is no longer of any use to anyone?
If we expect young people to be issued with a plastic-card driving licence today, it is absolutely reasonable to expect other people to exchange their droopy old paper documents within the lengthy transition period that the rapporteurâs very sound proposal prescribes.
Let me say to MrÂ Jarzembowski that to call this compulsory exchange in German is a very emotive thing to do, for the term is associated with the dictatorial regime in the German Democratic Republic, which compelled visitors entering the country to exchange deutschmarks for East German currency.
We have to mind our terminology when we discuss European rules; a little care will keep the communication process on an objective level.
As I said, the rapporteur has presented a very good proposal, and for that I thank him.
My final point has already been mentioned.
We must put an end once and for all to driving-licence tourism.
If a person has his or her licence withdrawn in Germany today and does not pass the subsequent medical and psychological test, known colloquially in Germany as the idiotsâ test, that person can go to the Czech Republic or elsewhere and obtain a new driving licence at little cost by pulling a residence trick.
This situation cannot go on indefinitely here in Europe.
We want to put an end to it with this directive, which is why I hope that, in tomorrowâs vote, MrÂ Grosch will be given a large majority, including the backing of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have already welcomed the Commissionâs initiative and Mr Groschâs report aiming at harmonising the rules regarding driving licences, and I welcome them again.
We agree on the objectives of preventing licence fraud and above all of implementing a measure that will facilitate free movement for the citizens of the Union and contribute to improved road safety.
Nowadays, it is very easy for Europeans to move around and to share Europeâs roads.
It is no longer acceptable to conceive of Europeans who have been granted their driving licences under different rules, having fulfilled very different requirements, driving on the same roads.
This is a classic case where the principle of subsidiarity is substantially inapplicable.
I am referring in particular to the roads in my country, Italy, throughout the summer.
We cannot have rules that are applied in different ways just because they apply to different individuals and contexts.
The Europe of motorists and of road haulage is today one of the most successfully integrated aspects of Europe, and it requires harmonised, if not uniform measures.
In relation to road safety and the target that the Union has set itself of halving the number of road accident deaths by 2010, if the driving licence issuing and renewal system were to contribute even just minimally to improving peopleâs driving knowledge and skills and to keeping a check on driversâ mental and physical conditions, if it were even to make the tiniest contribution to improving road safety in Europe, it would definitely be welcome.
It is for that reason â and certainly not for love of pointless red tape â that we should emphasise and support the idea of making the new licences subject to regular renewal and calling for existing ones to be gradually replaced as well; it is for that reason that we should agree on the idea of combining compulsory training with equally compulsory testing to ensure that driving skills are acquired and maintained; and it is for that reason that we should agree on the idea of making the issuing and renewal of licences subject to checks that potential drivers meet minimum standards of mental and physical health.
While common sense demands that we should be moving towards uniform rules in all such areas, one area where differences could possibly be allowed on the basis of subsidiarity might be motorcycle licences, which are issued in varying numbers in the various countries of the Union.
In that respect, I believe it should be noted that in some countries people are allowed access to small motorcycles at a younger age than in others.
That factor helps to improve peopleâs mobility in historic city centres and may favour the development of a system of progressive access to increasingly powerful motorcycles, which is one of the most valuable aspects of the directive in question.
That is why I think that we could also let category B licences be equivalent to category AM licences, so that car drivers could always ride motorcycles as well in major historic city centres.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me also begin my speech by thanking MrÂ Grosch once again, in particular for the well-balanced nature of his proposals with regard to the prescribed amount of regulation, because this provided a platform from which we were able to reach a very broad consensus on many points.
I find it hard, on the other hand, to understand the attitude of the conservatives or that of MrÂ Jarzembowski, who wants to burden the changeover to a European driving licence with a transition period of seventy years.
I ask you!
If we were talking about a rule concerning the single market, a transition period in excess of ten years would not be contemplated for a single minute.
In this matter we are seeing far too many signs of movement towards a rather cheap form of populism.
There is, however, another point I should like to add.
We should bear in mind that basic and advanced training will have to be a central and important objective.
Â Â  Madam President, when people have acquired the right to drive a motor vehicle, they should, normally speaking, retain that right for as long as there are no physical or legal objections to them doing so.
I do not think that this House is in any doubt about that.
What we do question is the form in which the citizens are faced with this, more specifically, the standards for acquiring and retaining that right in the form of driving licences.
In addition, driving licences often function as a form of identification, which means that verification aspects are important.
I take the view that we should be very careful about establishing someoneâs identity, certainly in the case of unknown people.
The improper use of ID does not always prove conducive to a sustainable society.
That is why it is vital that ID cards should be up-to-date, both visually and technologically speaking.
In my view, driving ability can considerably contribute to reducing the number of road victims.
Since reduction starts with prevention, it is of vital importance for drivers, both physically and mentally, to be able to take part in traffic effectively.
It is quite acceptable for this to be subjected to requirements, for all drivers.
These requirements should guarantee the holdersâ capability.
Mr Groschâ report puts my mind at ease on that score, and for that I am grateful.
Â Â  Madam President, if the Germans have a problem with their driving licences, what is to stop the German Government from sorting it out?
Equally, if we are talking about road safety, what is to stop the Portuguese and Italian Governments from improving road safety on their roads?
We in the UK have some of the most crowded and some of the safest roads anywhere in western Europe.
Yet we are now faced with the prospect of harmonising driving licences, and this report makes clear that harmonising penalties for driving offences cannot be far behind.
When you look at the disgraceful treatment of legitimate tourists in Greece on a plane-spotting holiday, we now know just what pan-European Union justice can mean!
That affected only a few unfortunate individuals, but almost everyone in Britain drives a car.
If national courts are given powers to impose penalties on drivers' licences issued in other countries, the prospect of a Greek court banning, or attempting to ban, a British driver from driving in Britain will cause a row the like of which even you have not yet experienced from Britain!
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we have to hold Question Time now. I must therefore adjourn the debate at this point.
It will be resumed this evening at 9.00 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is questions to the Commission (B6-0009/2005).
We shall take a number of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . I wish to say at the outset that this is really a question on public procurement and not on the Services Directive.
The first point to note is that, as regards the participation in procedures for the award of public works contracts, it is not contrary to Community law that technical, architectural or construction companies holding shares in other companies which provide audiovisual services in one Member State, including the Member States of establishment, participate in such procedures in any of the Member States, including the one in which they are established.
Under Community public procurement law, there is an exhaustive list of criteria to exclude companies from public procurement contracts.
Examples of these are when a company is being wound up, when its managers have been involved in proven misconduct, or when tax or social security obligations have not been fulfilled.
Member States may not add criteria to this list.
As regards the proposed directive on services, the Commission can confirm that all these services fall within its scope.
It is the case that certain Member States impose restrictions on multi-disciplinary activities that may restrict either the freedom of establishment or the cross-border provision of services.
In order to deal with these kinds of potential barriers, Article 30 of the proposal stipulates that Member States shall ensure that providers are not made subject to requirements which oblige them to exercise a given activity exclusively, or in a manner which restricts the exercise of different activities either jointly or in partnership.
However, exceptions are made for regulated professions and providers of certification, accreditation, technical monitoring, and test or trial services. For activities where multidisciplinary activities are authorised, Member States shall ensure that conflicts of interest and incompatibilities between certain activities are prevented, that independence and impartiality â when required â are secured, and that rules on professional ethics and conduct for different activities are compatible.
These requirements will be subject to mutual evaluation by the Member States and the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the clear answer he has given to the question which I raised and to add that the restrictions imposed under Greek legislation on the basis of the basic shareholder will not only hit construction companies, as stated in my question; all economic service sectors, wherever they move and are proposed, will be affected by the Services Directive on the part of the Commission, such as food, advertising companies, the tourist industry, architectural firms, private individuals and companies.
I therefore consider that the adjustment needs to be made in this direction.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member for her addition.
What is in the Services Directive does not change in any way the problem to which the honourable Member has alluded, and the Commission is indeed aware of the relevant legal framework in Greece.
The Commission is in contact with the authorities there and is currently examining the whole situation.
Â Â  . As far as the freedom to provide services is concerned, the Commission has been made aware of problems encountered by companies from the new Member States who post their workers to the Netherlands.
A number of complaints have been received.
The Commission is presently looking into the matter to ensure that the freedom to provide services as provided for under Article 49 of the Treaty is respected and any unjustified obstacles are removed.
The Commission is not aware of instances in which Polish firms operating in Italy, Germany or other Member States may have been discriminated against.
No such complaints have been lodged with the Commission.
However, the Commission is in the process of writing to the relevant Member States to request further information to establish whether breaches of EU rules may have taken place.
In light of the information provided, the Commission will assess the situation in each Member State and decide upon the appropriate steps.
Â Â  Â Â (Â Many thanks, MrÂ President, thank you, Commissioner.
I should like to inform the Commissioner that according to the reports to which Poland has access, which include government reports, three EU Member States still have in place legislation that makes no allowance for enlargement of the EU that took place on 1Â MayÂ 2004.
Under this legislation, rules that were in force before that date continue to be applied to entrepreneurs from the new Member States.
At the same time, seven other Member States employ practices that do not comply with principles such as the free movement of persons and services and the freedom of establishment on the common EU market for companies from the new Member States, including Poland.
I would be more than happy to provide the Commissioner with relevant examples.
I thank you.
Â Â  . EU citizens and businesses must have confidence in the EU's legal framework if they are to maintain a positive view of the Community.
The free movement provisions of the Treaty are fundamental to the EU and are amongst the major benefits of EU membership.
Accordingly, the Commission places the highest priority on maintaining the integrity of the internal market and carefully investigates all complaints in exactly the same way, irrespective of where they come from or which Member State they concern.
The Commission is aware of the fact that some Member States have adopted national measures that do not conform with the transitional provisions relating to the free movement of workers under the Accession Treaty.
The Commission is looking into these matters and will contact the Member States concerned in accordance with its role as guardian of the Treaties.
Â Â  In the light of the question from our Polish colleague, I would like to ask Commissioner McCreevy whether he would agree with me that this is exactly the sort of problem that will be fully addressed by the proposal for a directive on the internal market for services.
Perhaps he could take the opportunity to confirm something I read in an independent report this week: this directive will apparently reduce prices, raise output across the European Union, create 600Â 000 new jobs and increase the trade in services.
Will the Commissioner therefore finally confirm his unequivocal support for this directive and his willingness to work with us in Parliament for its speedy and smooth transition?
Â Â  . It is undoubtedly correct that any impulsion that could be given to the area of services in the EU would have a major economic impact.
As Members are aware, approximately 70% of the Union's GDP comes from services.
Therefore, any way of giving a major boost to this particular area would have a major impact in terms of jobs.
The Services Directive is an attempt to open up this particular area and to achieve that major economic impact.
I am aware of the various studies carried out on the number of jobs that could be created.
However, as the Member is also very much aware, the draft services directive has provoked a considerable amount of discussion within Member States and in all areas throughout the EU.
As the Member is further aware, I am working with MEPs and I hope we can ensure that, when the Services Directive passes through its various processes, it will have a very positive economic impact, having taken on board the legitimate concerns of parliamentarians and others.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the gist of my question is whether the Directive on the posting of workers actually applies to temp agencies which send clients on job placements or whether there is a danger here that sham contracts or contracts designed to circumvent obligations might be used in the future.
Â Â  . The position that was agreed when the accession countries were joining must be adhered to.
If some Member States are invoking other procedures which do not conform with the accession provisions, then the Commission will follow these up and action will be taken.
It is true that some Member States negotiated special provisions and if they are operating in accordance with those, there will be no difficulties but if others are not, action has to be taken.
Â Â  .
The information in the question could refer to at least three different possible problems, each of which has to be addressed differently.
If there is circumvention via Ukraine of anti-dumping and/or anti-subsidy measures imposed in a number of third countries â such as Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and several others â then Community producers should lodge a request to initiate anti-circumvention investigations in line with the relevant provisions of the basic anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations.
If the product is of Ukrainian origin and is imported into the Community market at dumped prices thus causing injury to Community producers, the latter are encouraged to lodge a request for the initiation of a new anti-dumping investigation in line with the relevant provisions of the basic anti-dumping regulations.
The Commission's trade defence services are at the disposal of producers to explain the relevant requirements and procedures for anti-dumping measures to be exposed.
If it is a case of the falsification of certificates of origin, the customs authorities and the EU anti-fraud service â OLAF â should be called upon to act.
OLAF's responsibility to protect the financial interests of the European Community include the investigation of irregularities and illegal trade in the framework of existing Community legislation.
That would include any irregularities identified in the Community's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy legislation.
I want to add that no investigations are ongoing in this field for the time being and OLAF does not have any records on this situation.
However, OLAF has good working relations with the Ukrainian customs authorities.
In conclusion, I should like to reiterate that the Commission is grateful for the information provided by the honourable Member and it will examine any relevant information provided by European industry.
On the basis of that information, it will take appropriate action.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President and thank you, Commissioner, for the very extensive response.
Since submitting this question, I have indeed received confirmation from various quarters that this is fairly systematic practice to such an extent that European manufacturers of PET bottles suffer huge losses as a result.
It does therefore seem important to me that the Commission should ask OLAF to launch an inquiry.
I can, moreover, inform the Commissioner that the European manufacturers, in line with procedures, have submitted a request to review anti-dumping legislation.
My question is therefore very specific, Commissioner.
Are you, given the seriousness of the situation and the implications this may have for our industry, prepared to follow this up promptly?
Â Â  As the honourable Member knows, that comes under Commissioner Mandelson's portfolio, so I cannot give a detailed answer to the supplementary question.
However, I can promise that I will duly inform my colleague and, if he thinks it appropriate, then he will certainly start an investigation into the matter.
As the author is not present, Question 44 will not be taken.
Â Â  . I would like to respond in the following way to this first question regarding the implementation of the trans-European high-speed rail link.
I would like to answer MrÂ Posselt as follows.
The Paris-Strasbourg-Munich-Budapest trans-European rail link is one of the thirty priority projects of the trans-European network decided upon by the European Parliament and the Council on 29Â AprilÂ 2004.
In fact, it is priority project no 4 (Eastern high-speed rail link) and no 17 (Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Brastislava rail link).
Some of the common interest projects on this line are at an advanced stage of preparation or implementation, in particular the Eastern high-speed train between Vaires and Baudrecourt, and the improvement of the Danube rail link between Salzburg and Vienna.
Others, however, in particular the cross-border sections between Member States (France and Germany, Germany and Austria) are experiencing considerable delays, particularly for financial reasons.
Mr President, in order to better coordinate the efforts of the different national and regional, public and private partners involved in this project, the Commission intends to appoint a European coordinator.
I dare to hope that I myself will be able to propose the nomination of this coordinator to the Commission very soon.
For some years the Commission has already been making significant contributions to the funding of these projects.
EUR 315Â million have been allocated to the project on the trans-European link in Germany and Austria, under the budget heading for trans-European transport networks, an additional EUR 66Â million are planned for 2005 and 2006 and, for the 2007-2013 period, the Commission has proposed raising the budget for the trans-European transport network to EUR 20Â million.
Obviously, Mr President, the adoption of this proposal at budget level is the very minimum requirement in order to be able to speed up a project such as the trans-European rail link.
I fervently hope that the financial perspectives as proposed by the Commission will be approved by our Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, let me begin by saying that I am glad the Commissioner has answered the question so explicitly and intends to have a coordinator appointed.
This, I believe, is important, because this major link, which could subsequently be extended to Prague and other cities, would otherwise remain a mere pipe dream.
In my opinion, we must press for the speedy implementation of this project.
I also have two very specific supplementary questions for the Commissioner.
Firstly, what is the present position regarding the plans for the Rhine bridge between Strasbourg and Kehl?
As we all know, this is a single-track bridge, and its upgrading is a matter of the utmost priority â a small but crucial part of the project.
Secondly, what can you tell us about the transverse axis from Brussels to Strasbourg via Luxembourg which is also under discussion?
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member for the relevance of his questions.
When the guidelines were reviewed in April 2004, the sections of the Eastern part of the main line between Stuttgart, Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest were added, which were the Baudrecourt, Strasbourg and Stuttgart sections and the Kehl bridge over the Rhine, priority project no 17.
The work between Baudrecourt and Strasbourg should start around 2010.
The Kehl bridge, which, as you pointed out, is planned between Strasbourg and Appenweier, is a major bottleneck, so the planning priorities for Germany and France were previously different.
According to a joint declaration from the German and French Governments, it appears that at present plans could be made so that the project will be finished by 2010.
I hope that this major priority can be achieved in order to link the two Member States of France and Germany, and therefore many other Member States.
The whole of Europe has an interest in this project, including, of course, Strasbourg.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you, Commissioner, whether you think that border crossings between Member States might be eligible for special support, and is there actually a need for this line to be constructed definitively as a high-speed link?
Â Â  . Certainly according to the financial resources that the Union receives, we will make interconnections a priority.
I am not ruling out a much more favourable subsidy rate for this type of operation.
Â Â  Â Â Â Commissioner, you mentioned the rail link from Paris to Budapest via Berlin, Bratislava and Prague.
Are there plans for a similar rail link to eastern and northern Europe, from Paris via Berlin to Warsaw or a more distant location?
Â Â  . Of course the whole point of trans-European projects is that they are corridors.
It is quite obvious that the reason why I wish to propose to the Commission that a coordinator be nominated is precisely in order to see how all the sections involved will be gradually dealt with along the corridor.
Â Â  . In answer to Mr John Purvis, I would first like to say that we do of course pay a great deal of attention to these problems of road accidents and that all of these problems, as we saw earlier when looking at the report on driving licences, are very important.
Having said that, neither the Commission, nor the Member State that is most affected, the United Kingdom, have statistics to directly prove a risk associated with driving on the left or the right.
In general, the number of accidents involving continental drivers in the United Kingdom and vice-versa is too low for us to draw statistical lessons from it or draw any conclusions.
This is my answer to Mr Purvis
Â Â  Mr Commissioner, you may not have the statistics but I certainly see in my newspapers in my constituency of Scotland all too often that our tourist guests are killed and injured on our roads in Scotland, and most particularly on roads that convert regularly from two-lane to four-lane and back to two-lane.
Could not the Commissioner institute the gathering of statistics on this to see whether something should be done about it â possibly to encourage the Member State concerned to ensure that as many as possible of our main trunk routes are four-lane â for example, the Perth-to-Inverness trunk route?
I should also like to know whether there is any plan to consider harmonising the side of the road on which we are to drive in Europe.
Â Â  . I have no hesitation in saying to MrÂ Purvis that this is a matter of subsidiarity, and it is really up to the Member State to see whether there need to be improvements to infrastructures.
What I would like to say to Mr Purvis is that we have no intention of harmonising the side of the road on which we drive in the European Union, given the exorbitant cost and the major foreseeable increase in the number of accidents during the transitional phase.
However, making improvements as you have suggested makes sense, and I think that the Member State in question should make the effort to respond to that.
Anything that provides additional information on the causes of accidents in Europe will in any case be welcomed by the Commission, which has set itself the task of proposing any measures that will help to halve the number of people killed on the road.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, allow me to come back to the Commissionerâs answer to the last question from MrÂ Purvis.
We all know that every death on the roads is one death too many.
Particularly because I come from a Member State where subsidiarity is writ large, I believe that, with regard to the uniform provisions that we need to govern road traffic, speed limits and the like, the question we really have to ask the Commission is this: are any discussions or studies being conducted with a view to assessing what action it would actually be wise to take?
Â Â  Mrs Schierhuber, we have a deadline. In other words, 2005 is the half-way point in the programme of ten years that the Union set itself to halve the number of deaths.
Obviously this is going to be the year of general evaluation.
At the moment we are in the process of collecting all the data, so that in the second phase we can step up our measures in order to achieve this ambitious but essential objective of halving the number of deaths on the Unionâs roads.
Thank you for sharing this concern, which everyone should be aware of.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say in response to MrÂ Papadimoulis that, with regard to the directive on port services, the text proposed by the Commission defines the expression âself-handlingâ and its application in a more detailed way than had been previously done.
But the debate has scarcely begun on this proposal for a directive on port services.
The hearing planned in June in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will be the perfect opportunity to look in more detail at the fundamental elements, including the social aspects, and to hear the opinions of all the parties involved.
In the proposal, self-handling is subject to authorisation, the criteria for which cover salary and working conditions.
The aim of introducing an authorisation is to ensure, among other things, that self-handling suppliers comply with the salary and working conditions that apply in a port.
Consequently, the Commission does not think that its proposal, and in particular the clauses on self-handling, will have negative consequences for the employment and income of people already employed in the port sector.
Moreover, the Commission considers that the application of the principles and rules listed in its proposal for a directive will result in a transfer of the volume of additional traffic towards maritime transport, which will inevitably create excess business and will result in jobs being created in European ports.
When it presented its proposal for a directive, the Commission invited the Member States to ratify the conventions adopted under the aegis of international organisations, and in particular the relevant conventions of the International Labour Office, including the ILO Convention on cargo handling in docks that you refer to in your question.
I hope that at the hearing in June, your examination of the proposal will be fruitful and that we will arrive at a balanced text that will enable us to revitalise the sector while, of course, preserving the working conditions which are personally very important to me.
Â Â  â Allow me to insist, Commissioner.
I am here, opposite you.
Apart from the reactions of the trades union, in December 2004, when the Commission presented its proposal to the Council, several Member States voiced negative criticism.
Of them, France, Germany, England, Sweden and Belgium criticised the Commission for failing to hold adequate consultations on the matter, for failing to investigate the consequences of application.
Taking account of the negative prehistory, when the Commission tabled a proposal which was thrown out by the European Parliament, do you intend to re-examine the content of the proposal or do you propose to proceed despite the reactions?
Â Â  Mr Papadimoulis, the proposal was rejected at the end of the legislative process when work had already been done.
In view of that, the Commission did not completely rewrite the text, but it wanted to take account of the worries and concerns expressed during the discussions.
I believe the Commission was right to take its time and give itself the opportunity to hear all the parties.
I shall see to it personally that this debate is carried through with great care.
Â Â  I would like to say in answer to Mr Papastamkos that, during the accession negotiations and in agreement with the countries concerned, the Commission identified the future Trans-European networks, both road and rail, of Romania and Bulgaria, where the main connections will be with Greece.
In AprilÂ 2004, the European Parliament and the Council decided on priority projects for Trans-European networks.
There are two projects that will help to connect Greece with its northern neighbours and with Central Europe: the Athens-Sofia-Budapest motorway and the main Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nuremberg railway line.
On 11 June 2004, the western Balkan countries and the Commission signed a protocol of agreement to promote the regionâs strategic networks as previously identified in a Commission report in 2001.
The Commission is therefore also actively involved in what the countries concerned are doing to develop the pan-European transport corridors, four of them in particular.
Corridors 4, 8, 9 and 10 involve Greece and its links with the countries of Southwest Europe.
