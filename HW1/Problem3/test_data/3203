It is very important that we allow Member States to use the opportunity of a European census to ask questions that are relevant to their own nation and to collate those questions separately from the shared questions or the exclusively European ones.
Further, more attention has to be given to the census questions.
These questions must be chosen carefully and must not cross the line separating valid information from intrusion and attacks on privacy.
We want to understand trends, to try to make policies more relevant; we do not want to pry into people's personal lives.
Once respectful questions are chosen, then we have to be very careful that they must go through not just a linguistic process but also a cultural translation.
As the report does not intend to harmonise the rules on census, this step must be taken to ensure that accurate comparability of data between Member States is achieved.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to the relationship between the objective of collecting data and the amount of data actually included in an analysis such as this, as something is clearly amiss in this respect.
Something is wrong in the relationship between the tasks of the European Union with regard to housing policy, for example, and what we are now calling for.
The Union does not have competence in this field.
Nor does this Parliament have competence to discuss the relationship between religious beliefs, ethnic origin and possible integration issues; it is not for the European Union as a whole to make pronouncements on this.
What is up for consideration, however, is how we allocate funds, how we distribute our Structural Funds.
The important thing here is having a precise insight into the number of inhabitants in the regions concerned, the regions under the NUTS classification of territorial units for statistics.
Until there are precise data on this, and until orientation towards outcomes - in financial terms - is possible, this action is indeed necessary.
Homogeneity and reliability are the primary considerations here.
I should like to make one more point, on which Mrs Novak made some very interesting proposals in the Committee on Regional Development.
With regard to interference in the family circle, the private sphere of citizens, we shall be voting against the proposal if this is not removed from it.
Perhaps these aspects will be removed during the trialogue - I am relying on the rapporteur in this regard.
Only in that case will Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats ultimately be able to give it our support; only on this condition.
(EL) Mr President, as has been mentioned by the rapporteur and almost all the speakers, it is important to compare the data from the Member States on population and the main social, economic, family and housing indicators, so that on the basis of that information, each Member State can better deal with the issues which concern it, within the framework of its policy.
At European level, however, we need to target the data which will lead to a better cohesion policy and improved regional development, so that inequalities are eliminated and the gap between different social groups and different European regions is narrowed.
By laying down common definitions and indicators, the proposed regulation ensures the comparability of data and, as a result, promotes better practice in the Member States.
However, there is a need for regular evaluation and corroboration of the statistics gathered by the competent agencies, and these agencies must undergo quality control and transparency checks.
Objectivity, representativeness and accuracy of data are important issues.
Paradoxically, although the Commission is revoking the annexes to the regulation, it is in favour of including recommended topics which may affect the clarity and accuracy of the data, since it is leaving it to the Member States to do as they wish.
If the aim of the proposal is to adopt binding legislation establishing common definitions for the comparability of data, I believe these points should be deleted.
We must proceed with a cost-benefit analysis, as provided for in Article 5a, since the cost of collecting such data is particularly high for Member States which have limited capacity to analyse the details.
Lastly, I would like to point out that if the amendments are not approved, the draft regulation will touch on very sensitive issues relating to personal, family and private life, such as the request for collection of data on cohabitation - which must be deleted - or the temperature of the bathwater!
Why should we collect information and details which are not related to European policies?
Poverty is not controlled with numbers and data.
(SL) I support the regulation on population and housing censuses.
With the data collected on the basis of this regulation we will be able better to assess the socio-economic conditions in which the inhabitants of the European Union live at regional and national level, and at European Union level.
Furthermore, with this data it will be possible to evaluate more accurately the effectiveness of the implementation of regional policy and progress in achieving regional cohesion, to which the EU is assigning an increasing amount of funds.
Two things must be ensured if we are to attain the desired objectives through the regulation: the volume of the data that we collect under this regulation must not be too great and the data collected must be of high quality and comparable.
Data which do not create the necessary added value and merely increase administration and expense must be excluded.
These are proposals which are to be found in Annexes 1.3 and 2.3 and on which the Member States should report of their own accord.
At the same time, care must be taken not to encroach excessively on the privacy of the men and women living in the European Union.
Nor may we use the collection of these data to discriminate against one sex or another.
Comparability of basic data between Member States and reliability of the data collected from the census are necessary for the assessment of European policies and for the comparison of the results of national policies at European level.
Therefore, the regulation must ensure that all the Member States use the same method and criteria in data collection.
(SK) Mr President, precise population data and reliable data on housing within the EU are at present an essential prerequisite for the correct evaluation of all areas of European policies, as well as for the formulation of operational objectives and evaluation of the progress in individual Member States.
Because they serve many fundamental objectives, I would above all like to underscore the importance of the reliability and quality of this data.
Of the many examples where exact census data are relevant, I would like to mention two: the process of qualified majority voting by the Council and the allocation of resources from Structural Funds for the development of less-favoured regions.
I believe that it is important that this area be regulated in a unified manner.
In this way the data provided by individual Member States will be comparable at both European and regional level, as is often necessary.
As a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to highlight the importance of the classification of statistical units.
The quality and comparability of this type of information can only be guaranteed by a clear European framework, in other words European legislation on population and housing censuses.
I agree with the view that the legislation must be aimed mainly at the end results and not at the information being collected.
This will reliably ensure the comparability of the statistical data, which, if missing, can lower data quality.
The Member States should be free to select the best census modes and methods in accordance, however, with certain binding standards and quality requirements.
It goes without saying that the topics, as well as the time frames and the implementing deadlines, should remain the same for all countries.
Only in this way will the census data be transparent, reliable and comparable, a fundamental factor in fulfilling many important objectives.
Before I give the floor to the Commissioner, I am reminded that about 2000 years ago King Herod instituted a census, but on that occasion it was boys only.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this will be a very encouraging start for me.
I am glad to announce that the Commission is ready to accept the majority of Parliament's amendments.
As this debate has shown, there are currently negotiations under way that will address your concerns.
A compromise could open the door to future development.
The Commission supports the debate that is still ongoing and sincerely hopes that a solution will be found that is acceptable to a broad majority within this House, as well as to the Member States represented in the Council.
However, it should not be forgotten that the inclusion of new topics in a census takes in-depth and long-haul preparation.
I am confident that the correct balance will be found between the very important reporting on the EU population and housing, and the cost and effort of collecting the data.
I would like to pay special attention to the question by Ms Schroedter.
The main point was that this legislation does not sufficiently assure data confidentiality.
My answer is that data confidentiality is being taken most seriously by Eurostat and all national statistical offices.
There is framework legislation on data confidentiality on the national as well as on the European level.
The proposal on censuses does not violate or modify any of this legislation.
In contrast, it fully respects all provisions, be they national or European.
There is no need to repeat established framework legislation on data confidentiality within this specific proposal on censuses.
No data transmitted to Eurostat allows insight into the data of any particular individual person.
It is anonymous data.
Moreover, the legislation in this current draft allows only the transmission of aggregated data, not of microdata.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at a later part-session.
Toy Safety (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on toy safety.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for its continued interest in product safety issues, and for this opportunity to give you a short presentation on the first results of the product safety stocktaking, released on 22 November 2007.
I attended the IMCO Committee meeting on 26 November and I am now pleased to address the European Parliament meeting in plenary.
My three starting points and principles are still valid and can be confirmed: there can be no compromise on consumer safety; we believe in open markets and fair competition; and we want to work in international partnership with the Chinese and the Americans.
These stocktaking results indicate that the regulatory framework is fit for the purpose, if and when it is properly applied.
In particular, the rapid alert system RAPEX is working efficiently and ensuring that dangerous products are recalled from the market throughout the European Union.
The stocktaking report nonetheless identifies certain scope for improvements, in preventive actions and international cooperation as well as in enhanced enforcement.
Some envisaged improvements are already at an advanced stage towards becoming concrete actions, as is notably the case of the revision of the Toy Safety Directive.
I intend to propose to my colleagues in the Commission that we adopt a temporary measure to require that warnings be given on magnetic toys, pending revision of the standard, to address the risks that these toys could pose.
We have this right under Article 13 of the General Product Safety Directive.
I hope that this measure will become effective soon, but I am also aware that it is just a partial stop-gap solution until the relevant standard addresses the risk associated with magnets comprehensively.
The Commission is assisting the Member States' market surveillance authorities to identify and share best practices with a view to improved market surveillance.
In October 2007, Member States reported on initiatives for better cooperation with economic operators and on specific surveillance campaigns on toys.
The Commission intends to publish comparative enforcement capacity data on the Consumer Scoreboard in the first quarter of 2008.
The Commission also continues concretely to reinforce the market surveillance capacity of the Member States by participating in the financing of well-designed joint market surveillance projects (which in 2007 will receive EUR 1.3 million in Community funding).
The protection of consumers against dangerous products requires a consistent level of protection not only within the Community, but also at the EU external borders.
In addition to actions to improve protection within the European Union, various actions are under way to strengthen protection at borders.
Recent major changes to EU customs legislation will help in identifying high-risk consignments for control.
Secure customs exchange mechanisms will also enable rapid action to be taken when information becomes available on new types of dangerous products.
Cooperation between these two networks, in practical terms, is being stepped up through regular exchanges of alerts between the RAPEX system and the customs authorities' 'risk information form' system.
The latter draws border inspectors' attention to specific, potentially dangerous, cargo.
The Commission has highlighted traceability, which is a very important area for further improvement.
Statistics show that products of unknown origin notified through RAPEX were down for the first time in October 2007, standing at 3% as compared to 17% in 2006.
The Commission is currently assessing, with the help of the Member States, how to ensure that this improvement is not just temporary.
The Commission has already included, in the 'internal market for goods' legislation package, a provision requiring economic operators to have available the identity of their supplier, which should be helpful for market surveillance interventions once this legislation enters into force.
The Commission has also asked what China could do about traceability, and welcomes the initiatives in China to require the bar-coding, at factory level, of certain categories of high-risk product.
The Commission also consistently highlights the responsibility of economic operators for product safety.
I welcome the commitment from the industry to work on measures to build consumer confidence.
We have agreed on what I call a 'safety pact'.
I will also send experts to carry out a study of business safety measures in the supply chain, and report further on this in the first quarter of 2008, because in the era of globalisation we are only as strong as the weakest part of our chain.
I also find it important to communicate with the citizens of Europe on product safety issues, and to listen to their concerns.
This is essential because both you and I want to respond ever better to their queries and needs.
I found my recent web chat under the topic 'Have a Safe Christmas' (which I very much enjoyed) most enlightening and engaging, and answered nearly 50 interesting questions.
Finally, our product safety concerns were communicated to the Chinese leaders at the EU-China Summit on 28 November 2007.
The leaders on both sides shared the view that a high level of product safety is key to consumer confidence and reciprocal trade.
To this end, the competent authorities have established a comprehensive cooperative relationship.
Both sides are willing to continue and deepen the dialogue, regularly exchange information and aim at measurable, continuous improvements.
Likewise, the Commission has agreed with the United States Government, in the context of the Trans-Atlantic Economic Council, to enhance our cooperation on import safety issues.
I believe this report to you has shown that I and all my colleagues in the Commission have taken the necessary steps to enhance consumer product safety, in association with all the relevant actors, in the most effective, proportionate and committed manner.
I would like once again to thank Parliament for our many inspiring debates on this issue.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is no coincidence, of course, that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has called for this topical and urgent debate just before Christmas, particularly as this issue was discussed back in September, surprising as it may be.
The PPE-DE Group also wants this debate to send out a clear political signal and has a political objective in mind.
We want to go all out for a high level of consumer protection, and want attention to the smallest, most vulnerable consumers - children - to remain high on the agenda.
Commissioner, I welcome your statements here.
We note that you have already done a particularly large amount of work in the Commission, and we should of course like to see Member States, too, being inspired to take on their share of the work.
After all, they, too, must continue to be committed to tightening up supervision of their toys markets.
We also know, Commissioner, that you personally have spared no effort when it comes to consumer protection.
We particularly value these efforts, and also agree with you that, when it comes to toy safety, we should not be devising the umpteenth new approach, but rather closing the gaps in the existing system.
There are a couple of points on which I should like further clarification: you have said - and you also referred to it just now - that the Chinese authorities are particularly hard at work too.
Some time ago, you announced that they were going to set up a kind of Chinese RAPEX system.
Perhaps you could elucidate this further.
Secondly, I also wonder whether any specific agreements have actually been made with the toy industry, or whether each Member State has its own way of doing things?
I should also have liked to hear how it is that we are still awaiting the new Toys Directive, or the Commission proposal for amendment of the existing Toys Directive.
We had expected this round about now.
There has obviously been a delay.
Perhaps you could explain the reason for this?
In addition, you are absolutely right: the internal market is also there for consumers.
If consumers have no confidence in it, they will not make sufficient use of it.
This is a most particularly important dossier.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for the briefing you have given us today once again on the progress of discussions.
We have definitely made progress already, but this is still not enough for me, of course.
Various matters still lie ahead of us.
One of them we have already repeatedly discussed: the European Union must carry out the preliminary work itself.
I am also rather sorry about the fact that the amendment of the Toy Directive has still not been tabled.
When I heard we would be getting an amendment in December, I assumed that it would be in December 2007, not December 2008.
We are now in December and we know we shall not have it.
I hope it will be available not in December 2008, but by this January at the latest, because it is urgent.
The second matter, Commissioner, is that the Member States also have to fulfil their obligations.
They must make much more efficient and more consistent use of RAPEX.
That is one thing.
They must also, however, take market monitoring, for which they are responsible, much more seriously.
We also have to move matters further forward here so that we can also actually achieve the necessary security.
It is not just governments or their agencies that are being interrogated in this regard, however; toy manufacturers are being interrogated too.
They themselves also have to ensure that the quality of their products is appropriate.
They cannot continue simply shifting responsibility on to others.
We cannot let them go to China and say: yes, we want toys, but they must not cost more than so much.
This will be at the expense of quality, which they must know.
We must not let manufacturers off the hook, but must demand that they do this, too.
As we have said, however, supervision is even better and this is what we have to achieve.
I hope that you will manage to move this forward in real terms in the safety package you have been addressing.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, for some families, this Christmas will be a period of tragedy - tragedy because of the loss of a child.
What makes such tragedy even more painful is that (a) it could have easily been prevented and (b) that it was caused by a gift of love - a joy that turned into a murder weapon.
Yes, a murder weapon.
Because those that produce unsafe toys know full well that those toys can and eventually, perhaps, will kill a child.
Therefore putting such a deadly toy on the market constitutes, in my view, the committing of murder and consequently those that through their omissions fail to prevent such a crime from taking place are accomplices to the act.
Madam Commissioner, we all know who are the culprits that, in this respect, kill or injure our children.
They are the cheap Chinese toy manufacturers.
And what protection have you to offer our citizens?
Not enough, I am sorry to say.
You are happy, it seems, that in 43% of cases reported in the latest RAPEX-China report corrective action was taken, but, Madam Commissioner, how about the 57% of cases where no corrective action was taken?
And how about those potentially dangerous toys which were not reported at all?
You have said that 'in this world you cannot given 100% guarantees' but 'you can make sure the system is fit for purpose'.
What purpose, Madam Commissioner?
The purpose of cutting safety corners in order not to upset the Chinese Government?
There is only one way of dealing with this problem, Madam Commissioner: ban all imports of Chinese toys till the Chinese Government can give a 100% guarantee that no dangerous toys will be sold in Europe.
Only then will you be fulfilling your most important function of truly protecting our children from death caused by Chinese toys.
And remember, Madam Commissioner, mere progress from China is not enough, because even one child's death is one too many.
Mr Matsakis, I apologise for announcing that you had one minute's speaking time.
It was our mistake and you did, indeed, have two minutes.
I always give extra time to people who speak in a language other than their own.
Your English is wonderful!
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no concessions on toy safety and the mass withdrawal from the market of toys from China has put consumer safety back at the centre of the debate, particularly the safety of our smallest consumers, who often do not have the voice or the strength to defend themselves.
There is, in fact, a very profitable market in products that are a health hazard, a market that makes staggering amounts of money each year and that finds endless routes and subterfuges for legalising what is in reality illegal and harmful.
For this very reason, we welcome the Commission's proposals to strengthen the application of checks on the safety of products, especially toys.
In particular, we believe cooperation with China and the United States is of fundamental importance in blocking the flow of dangerous products heading for the European market.
A number of actions, such as an overall examination of safety measures and the safety pact between producers and importers, must be prioritised in order to restore consumer confidence.
As regards the Member States, it is fundamentally important to improve cooperation between customs and the authorities responsible for controlling the markets.
A revision of the toy safety directive is essential, so that there are definite rules for planning adequate checks at the production and customs stages.
I will finish, however, by saying that China absolutely must play its part and the Commission must demand that it does so.
China must give guarantees, and must engage in a hard and uncompromising fight against illegal practices, otherwise the European Union will have to take serious measures and close the door on counterfeiting and unfair and unlawful competition.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, this debate criss-crosses the Directives.
Commissioner, you are confusing the Product Safety Directive with the Toy Safety Directive!
We do in fact have an implementation problem with the Product Directive, whereas we have a legislative deficit with the Toy Safety Directive.
Greater supervision does not help us here because we have safety loopholes, namely that dangerous chemicals, for example, are not banned.
Two months ago Commissioner Verheugen guaranteed that the Toy Safety Directive would be presented this month.
He said that toys containing lead should not be entering the European market.
In the first case there is no sign of the review of the Toy Safety Directive.
In the second case, Commissioner Verheugen has admitted to me in writing that he was wrong when he said that toys containing lead were banned in Europe.
This is not right either.
You are confusing the Product Safety Directive and the Toy Safety Directive.
It is therefore very odd when you say we need a bar code for particularly dangerous products.
Hopefully you do not mean that for toys!
Dangerous products have lost nothing in children's hands!
We need the principle of prevention.
Nor are there any warning messages here about magnets.
What about warnings on toys that contain carcinogenic substances?
In Europe we have polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
We shall be banning them in car tyres, but they are permitted in toys even though these are carcinogenic substances.
This debate is absurd because you are criss-crossing both Directives.
Please concentrate in your second answer on the Toy Safety Directive and answer the questions on when this Directive is finally to be submitted and when - as we proposed in our resolution - the legal loopholes are to be filled, and please do not continue to mix them both up.
Supervision is good; laws are better.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, it is of course entirely unacceptable that children should be exposed to toys which pose risks to their health.
Pretty well all of us think that we can buy CE-labelled toys in the EU with peace of mind.
Anything else is unthinkable.
But in reality we involuntarily buy toys which contain carcinogens and lead.
It beggars belief that these substances are used in toys, which children often stuff into their mouths!
The safety of children demands immediate action by the Commission.
The profit interests of manufacturers, suppliers and importers must never take precedence over children's health.
A single dangerous toy is one too many.
Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Kuneva for coming to the Chamber today, at our suggestion, and congratulate her for being very positive and strong in the action that she has taken.
Since we had the original debates back in September, she has been to China.
We have seen the results of that.
She has also been absolutely clear in stating that 'there can be no compromise on consumer safety'.
We all firmly believe that to be the case.
Turning to the practical aspects, a number of colleagues have already made the point that this an extremely complex issue in which many players are involved.
I therefore welcome Commissioner Kuneva's reassurance that she will be working with the Member States to reinforce their capacity to inspect, to test and also to stop dangerous consignments, which can be properly identified because flows of information have been established.
Let us be realistic.
We are dealing with a very large number of manufacturers and a very large number of products.
However, one of the last things we want to do is to demonise those toy manufacturers who are already doing an outstanding job and producing attractive, well-designed, good-value toys that are valued by consumers and their children across the European Union and which, as we all know, are very important in children's development.
It is entirely wrong to single out the Chinese, as our colleague from Cyprus did in what was a very emotional and illiberal speech.
There are many other countries that are sourcing products.
The most important thing is to ensure quality of design from the outset, and that the engineers responsible work with their suppliers to see that all the controls are in place.
Believe me, there are many companies producing toys in China to outstanding quality standards.
We want everyone to do that and we want that to happen now.
This is because the key decisions being made now, before Christmas this year, concern the toys that will be in the hands of children next Christmas.
That is what we are talking about, that is why we are working ahead and that is why it was very important that the Commissioner was here tonight.
Mr President, the objective of tonight's debate and the Commissioner's statement must, of course, be to send a very strong signal to consumers and to China - and those who supply toys from other third countries - that we are determined to rid our markets of toxic toys.
We have seen that numerous toy recalls in the run-up to Christmas mean that we have to keep up pressure for action.
And I want to add, Commissioner, that in recent raids in my own region - in Manchester - over 20 000 illegal and counterfeit toys were seized, with a value of EUR 150 000.
They were clearly destined to fill the gaps as a result of the toy recalls.
Therefore, we need the legitimate toy suppliers and manufacturers to meet the highest safety standards if children are not to be put at risk by dangerous counterfeit toys.
So, let me be clear, as chair of Parliament's Consumer Protection Committee, what we are calling for you to do with our support, Commissioner.
We want an urgent review of Europe's toy safety laws, to tackle the problems of new problems from third countries, Chinese imports and, of course, new and dangerous toy designs, such as magnets, which have emerged since the original directive of 1995.
It is out of date, and it does need to be reviewed.
We need to fill that law with stronger, intelligence-led enforcement and surveillance, to make sure we crack down on poor producers.
Commissioner, I personally give you my support, and I will continue to do that, to go as far as banning dangerous toy imports from China if necessary.
But it has to be said that your action has got results; we have now seen 93 bans from China itself and, since July, 184 more investigations, which means that we are seeing less dangerous toys leaving China's borders.
We need to step up that action and give you support; but importers, too, must bear the responsibility for the import of dangerous toy products, and I therefore welcome the supply chain review to close the gaps left by manufacturers.
Commissioner, we are not prepared to make any compromises on toy safety; warnings may not be enough.
We can see, for example in the US, that we have bans for under-threes on some toys and we have warnings for over-six-year-olds; they complain that they are importing our dangerous toys from the European market, so perhaps we need to follow the US model in this area.
So let us get swift and effective measures to restore the confidence of our consumers in the toy market.
I pledge, Commissioner, that my committee will work with you to achieve that.
(PL) Mr President, in speaking in the debate on toy safety, I wish to draw attention to several more general matters.
Firstly, the liberalisation of trade carried out under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, making the European market increasingly accessible, is not only bringing benefits to consumers in the form of lower prices for many goods, but is also bringing dangers, and an eloquent example of this is the matter of dangerous toys that we are discussing today.
Secondly, South-East Asian countries are competitive in the European market because they do not cover the full costs of manufacturing the products.
They often fail to bear environmental protection costs, costs linked to observing employee rights or costs linked to the safety of goods, to name but a few.
Thirdly, it is therefore necessary for consumer and competition protection institutions in EU countries to make use of the instruments they have available to them to react more rapidly and effectively to such situations and eliminate from the market not only hazardous products, but also their manufacturers or importers.
Fourthly, and finally, the European Union, in ongoing negotiations under WTO auspices concerning expansion of access to the European market, must demand of third countries that they observe the rules of fair competition, and particularly the inclusion in product prices of the full costs of manufacture, counted using European standards.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I have already stated in committee that we appreciate your efforts and that we thank you for those efforts.
Nevertheless, some of these things highlight where something is in a bad state.
If you want to provide warnings about magnets, for example, this just shows that the Toy Safety Directive is not adequate.
The Toy Safety Directive is unfortunately based on the new approach.
The new approach implies that the equivalent standardisation committees are active.
Unfortunately, the standardisation committees have not been active regarding magnets, just as they have not been active as regards carcinogenic substances.
Only three carcinogenic substances are currently banned; the rest are not.
We must check as a matter of urgency when we are revising the Toy Safety Directive whether this new approach really is the right way or whether it is not considerably more important for European legislators to lay down standards right now in the toy sector, because toys appeal mainly to children and children must be given special protection.
I appeal to you to check once again whether the new approach really is the right way here or whether we in fact need a different approach when revising the Toy Safety Directive.
I should also like to point out that we have underlined the responsibility of importers when revising the product package.
These importers must take their responsibilities seriously.
I hope that you and the Commission will also be supporting this in the trialogue.
Importers must be held responsible in the same way as manufacturers.
One final point: the Member States.
Here it can be shown that the Product Safety Directive has simply been too weak.
The Member States must be forced to monitor it and they must also be forced to actually phase out certain products.
Unfortunately, not all of them have actually been phased out.
(BG) Mme Commissioner, There are several reasons for my question today.
The firt one is your answer during the discussion on this issue at IMCO Committee, which was too general, in my opinion.
The second one is the question in writing which I have already asked and I hope to receive an answer together with the other answers today.
And the third reason is the following: I would like to specially draw your attention to the Christensen Report adopted in 2005 on the integration of the new Member States in the consumer protection system supplementing the internal market regime in the European Community.
The report contains recommendations to the European Commission to draw special attention to the new Member States, which includes also my country.
I would like to express my personal opionion that, notwithstanding the efforts made by the Commission in this sphere, only three percent of the Bulgarian citizens feel protected as consumers.
Therefore my specific question goes as follows: what has the European Commission done to guarantee the safety of the Chinese toys distributed during the Christmas and New Year holidays on the markets of the new Member States, given their relatively weaker consumer protection system?
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, without being dramatic, we are dealing with a problem that affects the whole of the Union.
To give just one example: every day 40 000 goods containers enter Spain; many thousands of those containers carry toys.
We wonder whether the authorised economic operator system, which will be introduced from 1 January 2008, will really facilitate effective measures to tackle the commercial actions that endanger children's health, and which have been condemned so many times.
In its resolution of 26 September on the safety of products and especially toys, the European Parliament urged the Commission and the Member States to take measures to ensure that consumer goods sold do not pose a risk to health.
It is time to speed up the adoption of the necessary measures in order to implement the European Parliament resolution.
We need to improve the control and monitoring of the markets that we have mentioned.
At a time of globalisation, toys are not just another type of goods.
Without controls, we will see repeats of the incidents that have been repeatedly reported; time and time again there is a relapse into commercial dumping, as well as a possibility of seriously affecting the health of consumers, especially children.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by responding to Ms Thyssen on what we are doing to enhance our positive influence on the Chinese market.
If we are to achieve success, Europe should develop its role as a standard-bearer, and that is exactly what we are trying to do.
RAPEX-China gives the Chinese authorities access to details of risks found in Chinese products sold in Europe, and this is a very valuable source of information for them.
China is currently setting up its own national rapid-warning system, copying the European one.
This really represents a great success for product safety at world level.
It ensures that information is spread swiftly to local offices for action, and this should start by the end of the year.
If this continues to develop as envisaged, Europe will be able to congratulate itself, by the end of the year, on a major success, as it has established the pattern for the Chinese authorities.
I would like also to highlight that next year will be a very intensive one for me in respect of elaborating a new memorandum of understanding with China, owing to the fact that the current memorandum, which has been in effect since 2006, will expire at the beginning of 2009.
This will be a matter for very concrete work by the Commission.
Many of you have referred to the Toys Directive.
I cannot comment on something which comes under the responsibility of Vice-President Verheugen, as the Toys Directive is part of his portfolio, although we enjoy excellent cooperation.
However, you should be aware that a revision of the Toys Directive is in the pipeline and will be presented very soon.
Before my meeting with you, I checked with the services of Commissioner Verheugen, and with him in person, and know that this directive will soon be discussed by the Commission.
I am sure that his services are working flat out.
There is no mixing of our two approaches - the industry approach, which includes the Toys Directive and the approach on which I base my activities, which includes a general product safety directive.
I can assure you that the distinction within the Commission is really very clear.
That is exactly what we are trying to do through the new approach - to keep these two sets of checks parallel to each other.
One set concerns requirements on toys as industrial goods, and the other one, over and above those efforts, concerns checks at any given point on how safe the toys are for our children.
One good example is the magnets used in toys.
These now come under the General Product Safety Directive, and we are able to carry out checks, ban dangerous products and ask for a new standard, with the toys in the mean time being covered by a warning, and then we will come up with a proposal.
There will most probably be standardisation, and a ban on certain uses for magnets.
This approach is based precisely on filling the gap on safety, through a true General Product Safety Directive.
This is an excellent example of why we need to keep the two approaches together.
I started to respond to Ms RÃŒhle concerning magnets.
The College will consider my proposal to adopt a targeted measure to require specific warnings on magnetic toys, and this would fill the gap until the relevant standards properly address this risk.
As you know, this process is a little long, but that is not up to the Commission.
This is legislation which we are simply executing concerning the way we implement on our standards.
I would like to dwell for a second on the opinion expressed by Mr Matsakis.
My line is quite simple, because I believe that Mr Harbour answered in a very consistent manner.
I do not think that dangerous toys have a passport, and we should address the danger from wherever the danger comes.
Let me just remind you that although 50% of the dangerous toys in Europe come from China, I am surprised that we have not discussed at all where the other 50% comes from.
I have to tell you that 30% of dangerous toys come precisely from Europe.
That is why I really insist on safety, regardless of passports.
We must consider again how important confidence is to our markets.
I am not going to outsource that responsibility.
Article 1 of the General Product Safety Directive states that all producers should only produce safe goods, and that whoever places a good on the market for the first time - be it the importer, the retailer or the producer - should check the safety of toys, for which he is liable.
With reference to Ms Iotova, I would like to answer in Bulgarian because it was in that language that she put her question.
(BG) My answer was very specific according to the standards of the Commission.
What we have done over the last year is intended to improve legislation.
Yes, part of this legislation relates to industrial goods and it is within the portfolio of another Commissioner but we work together on a number of issues.
Some of the questions asked relate also to the REACH Directive that is not in my portfolio either but, again, we are doing what is necessary to ensure the safety on the basis of the existing legislation.
Many meetings have been held with all stakeholders in the process - manufacturers, competent national authorities, retailers, and numerous non-governmental organisations.
Besides, I would like to tell you that we make no judgments and do not divide countries into old and new Member States.
The safety of goods is equally important for new and old members alike.
I would like to reassure you that there are some old Member States, prior to the accession of the twelve new countries, which have their serious problems and I have no intention to abandon them.
Of course, the responsibility of the Commission with regard to the implementation of the legislation, especially in the new Member States, is something which, undoubtedly, stands very close to my heart.
Therefore what I am doing in the new Member States is talk more to the authorities, insist more on a national budget for the development of market surveillance authorities.
I can tell you, Mme Iotova, that the Bulgarian market has 180 inspectors.
Yeasterday, actually it was earlier this morning, I had further talks with all participants in the safety chain and we concluded "the Christmas Pactâ, involving manufacturers at the European level, as well as traders and government authorities in Bulgaria.
After the insistent talks I had with the Ministry of the Economy in Bulgaria, inspections increased four times.
Therefore I shall continue to work along these lines and, as I had the pleasure of doing it last time, I would like to renew my invitation from this plenary hall to do it together.
I am confident that we shall be more successful in this way.
I would like to end where I started, which is to say that all our actions should be proportional and based on solidarity and subsidiarity, which will give us additional strength to tackle this very important problem.
I have listened carefully to all of you, to your kind words and to your calls to step up our work.
If at any point there are specific cases which you would like to discuss with me, I would be more than happy to continue doing this.
I should like to thank the Commissioner and all colleagues who spoke in that debate.
I wish to make one little observation: some years ago my elder daughter was given a present of a rubber doll made in China.
The head came off and inside was a little rubber knob to put the head on, and whoever made this toy had put a little face on it; but it was not a smiley face, it was a very sad face, and whoever did this was trying to get some sort of message out about the conditions in which they working.
So I am glad to have this opportunity of making it public tonight.
The debate is closed.
European Contract Law (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a common frame of reference for European contract law by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0386/2007).
author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that we have already failed once with just such an ambitious and necessary project: a European Civil Code.
This is also most certainly connected with the fact that some legal systems here in the European Union have difficulty with written law.
It is also most certainly connected with some others having difficulty with the idea that substantive rules on related themes are combined to some degree and administered conclusively and comprehensively enough and that ground rules are set outside the parentheses.
The difficulties are also related to the fact that we in the European Union have common roots, yet these go way back, some having developed differently, some being buried and some being sacrificed to an arbitrary interpretation for the sake of the politics of the day.
As the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Theodor Heuss, so aptly put it in 1956 - and please note that he was a Liberal - Europe is built on three hills: Golgotha, the Acropolis in Athens and the Capitol in Rome.
The Acropolis is the symbol here for Greek scholarship, which with its great philosophers and political thinkers established the core of our democracies and state-building.
Golgotha stands for Europe's social and moral values, spreading widely across every area of our lives, from an understanding of family to human rights.
The Capitol typifies Roman law, which helps us on the way to the rule of law and a sense of justice.
As stated, however, our legal practices, while originating from the same roots, have grown apart - often so far apart that these roots are no longer recognisable.
The sole foundation of this European Union appears to be the internal market.
Some would say that all legal traditions of the nation states can continue to exist.
However, this is far removed from any reality and also incidentally from any experience of life, when we live in an increasingly smaller, faster moving and more communicative world.
The better we spell out the four Gospels of the Internal Market - the free movement of people, goods, capital and services - the more perfectly we can express them democratically and against a background of European moral concepts, and the clearer it becomes that all this is of no value if we cannot put its form on the test bench of the rule of law and justice, between individuals themselves as well as between individuals and state control.
We have already failed once, when the Iron Curtain fell in Europe and countries were asking: do you have a law for us?
Perhaps this was understandable against a background of belief that any ramification of national legal traditions could survive, at any rate in a Union only able to negotiate unanimously.
We must not fail a second time, however.
This is perhaps the most serious challenge alongside the issue of language.
The clearer we are in spelling out our internal market, the clearer the basic need for the unity of the law, not just vertically, but also horizontally over the entire geography of the continent.
We have moved forward.
We already have competition now in the legal systems.
It would be good, and we would have enough time, if this were not the external reality.
Conflict among Europeans can benefit only those who are powerful and already have redundant legal systems.
We are not a family with brothers and sisters who quarrel with one another so that sparks fly, but are united in the face of outside challenges.
We do not allow ourselves to be fazed by outside challenges.
Oblivious to the world - self-obsessed.
People's desire for unity is therefore there, even though it subsequently creates a problem in individual regulations.
Fears are created on the basis of the powers of national policies to cultivate doctrines of self-interest - a strategy that threatens the collapse of the historical dimensions on a continental scale.
We have to come to an agreement because otherwise we ourselves will ultimately not hold on to anything.
Since the grand plan has not succeeded, we need to agree on what is possible.
The toolbox is therefore good, the reference framework is therefore good, and so it is good to sort out what is possible and a little bit more perhaps as well.
The European Parliament is therefore largely in agreement and has also repeatedly expressed this in its resolutions.
We therefore want to know from the Commission how ambitious it is in wanting to tackle this aim.
This is why we are asking questions the way we have.
The Continent and its people require a uniform rule of law, at least in the form ... at any rate in what the legal practitioner calls the general part.
We can build on this; we need justice in terms of a balanced compromise of legitimate interests, we need speed, law in the public domain and law intelligible to everyone.
Even if it is only contract law that is up for debate today, the need for action in other fields is evident: family law, inheritance law, administrative law - yes, even criminal law.
It is the method that is on the test bench in what the Commission is now starting.
The method will essentially be the determining factor when answering the question of how much, how quickly and how well we are able to react to the obvious challenges.
Many of us throughout the world are waiting for a successful example and many are simply expecting us to fail.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it comes as no surprise that this question attracts such attention, because this is a really pivotal and very important issue.
The Commission, as a whole, welcomes wholeheartedly the interest that Parliament is taking in the Common Frame of Reference (CFR).
In its second progress report, the Commission announced that, after the academic CFR has been provided by the researchers, the Commission will carefully select the parts of this draft that correspond to the common legislative objectives.
As we know from the decision, this academic CFR is due by the end of this year.
The selection process will be done in consultation with the other institutions, including Parliament and stakeholders, and I think that Parliament, which has many experts here, will play an important role as usual.
The Commission has not yet decided how to proceed in selecting those parts of the academic CFR which will be incorporated into the final Commission CFR, as this decision also depends on the content of the draft CFR that the researchers will deliver.
Also, the Commission has not yet decided which topics of the EU contract law acquis the CFR should cover.
In adopting this decision, the Commission will also take into account the content of the academic CFR - which we have not had so far - the outcome of the new CFR workshops, and the position of Parliament and the Council.
The Commission has, however, clearly stated several times that the CFR will not be a large-scale harmonisation of private law or a European civil code.
The future framework directive, as a result of the review of the consumer contract law acquis, is not dependent on the outcome of the CFR, which is a longer-term project and run separately.
The Commission will ensure that the parts of the research draft selected for the CFR - and possibly modified - are coherent with each other and with the future framework directive.
All this preparatory work will be carried out by all the Commission directorates-general involved, in close coordination.
In respect of consumer issues, my services have already carried out the respective workshops and analysed the outcome.
The results already serve as a starting point for the review of the consumer contract law acquis, and it was very helpful.
My fellow Commissioner, Mr McCreevy, recently held two workshops on information requirements in financial services legislation and on unfair competition rules for business-to-business ('B-to-B') contracts.
Concerning general contract law, the services of Vice-President Frattini plan to organise several workshops during next year.
The Commission fully understands that Parliament wants to be kept informed of, and involved in, the ongoing work on the CFR.
We welcome Parliament's involvement in the CFR process.
In addition to the consultation which I mentioned earlier, the Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way, in particular through the Parliament working group dedicated to the CFR.
I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its support of the Commission's work on this important dossier.
I know that one of the major events in 2006 - if I am not mistaken - took place in Vienna, and the outcome of that conference was very inspiring for our work.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you most sincerely for your commitment to this matter.
It has brought with it great progress in the development of this project in past months.
I should say at this juncture that I regard this project as the most important in the entire legislative term, although it is actually a pre-legislative rather than a legislative project.
Of course, we as Parliament do have an enormous interest - and this is also the key reason why this oral question was tabled again today - in the fact that we are very consciously keeping up the suspense and keeping the discussion going not only at the level of the working group we have set up and at committee level, but also here with you in plenary.
It is therefore also important that we have put this on the agenda today.
We also want to find something out from you - you are still not able to say much about the definite schedule - because from Parliament's point of view it is also significant, of course, in view of the upcoming elections in 2009, for our strategy as to how we continue to deal with the Frame of Reference.
Over the coming year there will be a preliminary draft, but there will not be a final text until April 2009.
In any case it will be so late that it will presumably no longer be possible to deal with the content in depth in this legislative term and the next Parliament will therefore have to do so in the next term of office.
I wish to emphasise very clearly once again that we think the Frame of Reference, if it is adopted by the Commission and inserted into the consultation document, must not to refer to subjects of contract law alone, and Parliament has continually made it clear by an outsize majority that this must go beyond the framework of pure contract law in order to have the desired effect.
We also want specifically to be able to consider the option of whether we can subsequently solve the many problems we have in the internal market in the shape of an optional instrument for cross-border businesses.
At the moment we have a situation in which we are having to live in a happy coexistence of the country of origin principle and country of destination principle alongside the many directives and European legislative decisions with up to 28 legal systems, all of which have also to be simultaneously applied - depending on the circumstances.
This is not right in practice because nobody - no solicitor, judge or barrister - is in a position to know 28 European legal systems.
Against this background one optional instrument could be an instrument that actually opens up the internal market, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for the consumer, and throws open every kind of possibility in the internal market.
All the activities of the Commission and Parliament should be aimed at keeping this option open so that a final decision can be made on this in the next legislative term.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the fact that we are here, at this late hour, discussing the common frame of reference, is an indication that at least those of us who are here have a strong interest in this issue, and the Commissioner herself has indicated the interest that she and other Commissioners have in the matter.
I think, as we all do, that the procedure being adopted by the Commission is the correct one.
Before launching into a codification project, it is important that we understand its elements from an academic point of view, and we think that the initiative is a magnificent one: not just launching into legislative proposals without having considered them first.
I think that the result could be quite good.
With regard to the second phase, however, with which we are concerned, as some MEPs are working on or taking part in the parliamentary group that is monitoring the common frame of reference, what we are finding is that apparently so much material has now been accumulated that selection seems to be difficult.
My fellow Member, Mr Lehne, referred to the temporary framework; in other words, although the codification project is a long-term project, it is nevertheless helpful for us to at least start to look at the guidelines for the project.
The idea of a framework directive on this issue seems to be a good starting point.
In any case, it is clear that what we have done in recent years towards harmonisation through procedures, legislation and the recognition and enforcement of sentences is useful, but does have huge limitations.
European law in general and contractual law in particular can only be developed by establishing certain principles.
I think that Parliament as an institution could be a magnificent instrument for the Commission to use, because the different legal systems and different national legislations are represented here, and it could be an excellent framework of reference in order to see the extent to which the harmonising proposals are ultimately going to clash with the national legal systems.
The harmonisation of the European Union is quite difficult for reasons that we are all aware of, but the correct procedure is the one undertaken by the Commission, with this initial academic phase and a second legislative phase.
What we are saying to the Commission at the moment is that, in Parliament, we feel a certain amount of time pressure, because European integration is already happening: European citizens are facing practical problems every day that can only be resolved through legal harmonisation.
These practical problems were considered by the Commissioner herself when she presented her proposals for the harmonisation of contractual law on consumer protection, which is just one of the aspects, but quite an important one, because, in short, in the European Union we are all consumers and to some extent it is an excellent principle for taking action.
I do not think that it is a question of creating a common frame of reference that is purely theoretical.
As far as possible, specifics are the most useful thing.
My fellow Member Mr Lehne referred to establishing some type of optional document.
The model would be something like the United States Uniform Commercial Code, which has been described as the least uniform code of all, giving the least possibility of unification.
This is a possibility, but perhaps the most important thing may be to see which principles can be recognised by all the legal systems, and we will really only have this information once we have studied and taken into account what the academics give us.
Therefore, Commissioner, I think that Parliament will be a good collaborator in the subsequent development of this legislation and here we already have a degree of impatience to get to work, so that, in the year and a half that remains of the legislature, we can contribute positively to the development of this legislation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her answer, and indeed for her commitment to this subject, which has been mentioned by other colleagues.
However, I have to express a little surprise.
This morning and yesterday evening I was in Munster, at the University of Munster, on the occasion of the presentation of an honorary degree to the President of the Court of Justice.
Taking place at the same time was a meeting of the acquis group on the common frame of reference.
They told me that they were discussing, amongst other things, those bits of the academic Common Frame of Reference (CFR) that might be used by your services.
So this exchange is already going on, and I would point out that, clearly, Parliament wants to know what is happening at any moment, so that it can see how the process is developing.
The Commissioner will know how keen this Parliament is on this whole issue, and how much it has tried to champion it.
Indeed, the Committee to which I and my colleagues belong will, in the new year, be hosting a reception with the Slovene Presidency to celebrate the arrival of the academic CFR.
So we really want to make something of this and continue the work.
But we need to be included along the way.
We have felt for a long time that this is an essential part of the whole better legislation agenda.
I do not know how many times I have risen, in relation to this, to talk about coherence.
We know that the CFR is almost there, is almost usable, and yet still we are proceeding with various bits of legislation that contain contract law, without looking at some of the basic ground rules which we are already beginning to formulate in the CFR.
We are looking at the consumer acquis review, and separately we are looking at time share.
There are other colleagues dealing with payments or with issues to do with passenger transport.
We have a tremendous tool here in the making.
We need it, and we need it urgently.
We accept and are grateful for the work the Commission as a whole has done in trying to get this matter dealt with in all the different directorates-general.
That is good news.
I can only finish with the plea that I have already made, Commissioner, which is to please keep us involved.
We know there is ongoing work.
We can be at your side.
We know this is a difficult issue vis-Ã -vis the Council.
Please use our voices along with your own in order to give this project as much push and drive as it deserves in order to best serve our citizens through the internal market.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is not just a courtesy: it is always a great pleasure to listen to such distinguished lawyers talking about one of the most important things to have happened in recent years in the area of civil law.
However, I know that you want me to be as practical as possible.
So let me just tell you that in 2008 the Commission needs to decide on the scope - in respect of the time schedule, content and form - of the CFR, and how to carry out the above work in terms of methodology, human and financial resources and distribution of work amongst the DGs concerned: Justice, Freedom and Security, the Internal Market and Services, Enterprise and Industry, the Secretary-General, and Health and Consumer Protection.
A meeting of director-generals or their representatives will take place on the 11 December - which means tomorrow - and the intention is to prepare a college decision in 2008 on the scope, contents and form of the CFR.
As you know, and I kept you informed, I asked the College of Commissioners about the CFR and sent them a note on the subject this year.
On optional instruments, the Commission has announced in the single market review that it will look at the merits of such an initiative in the area of financial services, and I think that this is a good sign.
All of you referred to the framework directive relating to the consumer acquis.
I believe that this is a very good exercise and, whatever we are doing with consumer credit or with the timeshare, we are trying to avoid this concentration on the horizontal instrument because I believe that we currently need a discussion on the timeshare in Parliament.
But we need to define the framework scope, and I believe that we will have an excellent test of how united we are when we harmonise the main pillars of contract law as a backbone during the framework directive.
I will, of course, gladly undertake to keep you personally informed of what is going on in this very important field.
I have received, in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 12 December 2007.
Tenth Anniversary of the Mine Ban Treaty (Ottawa Convention) (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the tenth anniversary of the Mine Ban Treaty (Ottawa Convention).
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity to discuss this very important issue and to comment briefly on the motion for a resolution on a mine-free world, which we received today.
Ten years after the approval of the Ottawa Convention we can celebrate considerable progress in the achievement of its objectives.
One hundred and fifty-six states have ratified the Convention, and the use of anti-personnel landmines has been markedly reduced in recent years.
Fewer mines are being produced and there is virtually no trade in this hazardous weapon.
Since the adoption of the Ottawa Convention in 1997, the European Community has been highly committed to its universalisation and to the achievement of its objectives.
Mine action has been part of the European Community's assistance and development programmes in third countries, which have covered a wide range of activities - stockpile destruction, mine risk education, mine victim assistance, rehabilitation and socioeconomic reintegration.
A dedicated budget line, complemented by funding from other geographic instruments, underpinned the EC Mine Action Strategy and Programming.
In total, approximately EUR 275 million was committed over the 2002-2007 period, making the EC one of the leading donors worldwide.
As Parliament has noted in its resolution, the EC Mine Action Strategy comes to an end this year.
An evaluation will be carried out to assess whether it responded adequately to the Nairobi Action Plan.
A preliminary internal analysis shows positive outcomes.
With the changes in the Commission external funding mechanisms in 2007, the anti-personnel landmine budget line has been replaced by new instruments for EC external assistance which can be used for funding appropriate mine actions.
Geographical budgets for development, pre-accession and the Neighbourhood Policy are now the key financial instruments.
In urgent cases, action in the area of anti-personnel landmines and explosive remnants of war can also be funded by the humanitarian aid budget and the new Instrument for Stability, which allow for funds to be mobilised rapidly in cases of crisis or emerging crisis.
This is the new legislative environment, agreed by the budgetary authority, in which we must operate.
The EC's overall approach, however, remains unchanged: landmines and other explosive remnants of war must be considered within a broad context of humanitarian assistance, long-term and sustainable socioeconomic development programmes.
Countries wanting assistance need to prioritise mine action in their requests to the European Commission.
We fully share Parliament's concern, also expressed in its comments on the Instrument for Stability strategy, that a security gap in this important humanitarian field has to be avoided.
Although means and methods have changed, the EC's commitment to the Ottawa Convention continues.
In 2007, the European Community committed assistance for mine action for a total of at least EUR 33 million in the following countries: Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Jordan, Lebanon, Senegal and Sudan.
I want to assure Parliament that the Commission remains firmly engaged in continuing its support for the implementation of the Ottawa Convention and its assistance to third countries in destroying stockpiled anti-personnel mines, clearing mined areas and assisting victims.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the Commissioner for the comprehensive and exhaustive speech she made, effectively explaining what has already happened in this area.
This is a subject, however, that I believe should continue to engage us and others - as the Commissioner has already said, and I have noted it - because the numbers are terrifying.
Earlier we were given figures for the safety of hotels and other types of safety and, though every human life is very important, these were quite low numbers.
Here we are talking about a very different situation: 10 000 to 20 000 people affected each year.
There are probably more than half a million people who have been maimed in countries outside the EU, and therefore this is a very topical matter and it is no accident, in fact, that it is being discussed ten years on from the Ottawa Convention, but that in this Chamber it is being dealt with again after only two years.
We dealt with it in a resolution in 2005 and we are discussing it again now.
We are discussing it again now because there is a danger that people will stop talking about it.
The Commissioner - and once again, I thank her for what she said - highlighted a few channels for finance with which we can continue to fight anti-personnel mines, and I mean specifically anti-personnel mines.
I believe, however, that there much more should be done.
Too many of the world's countries have not yet signed the Ottawa Convention, too many countries still have arsenals of these implements of war, too many countries and too much land are still covered with these mines and therefore we need to take mine clearance very seriously.
I should mention, to add to what the Commissioner said, that 34% - those are the data, but it remains to be seen whether the statistics are realistic or not - anyway, in principle 34% of victims of anti-personnel mines left in land where wars have been fought are children, making this matter even more serious.
I therefore believe, Commissioner, that we should not only continue with the programme, but that it should be financed better and for longer.
The Commission has already done a great deal; the European Union has already done a great deal: 335 million over the last ten years, 33 million in 2007 alone; however, I think that the Council, the Commission and the Member States should call a meeting to review the Ottawa Convention and should do more to ensure all the countries in the world act on this matter and to bring about mine clearance and the total abolition of anti-personnel mines in the immediate future, as quickly as possible.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) The Ottawa Convention was the result of a global and effective effort for a just cause which united and continues to unite governments, public opinion and non-governmental organisations.
Even some States not party to the Convention, and unfortunately there are still 37, have already partially complied with the Convention.
This instrument therefore acts as a barometer for measuring the degree of participation of countries in the global community of values.
As the Commissioner said, it is worth remembering what has already been achieved.
Over a period of 10 years the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention have already destroyed more than 41 million mines.
Last year alone, Serbia, Montenegro, Angola, Cyprus, Cape Verde and Latvia fulfilled their obligations and got rid of their mine arsenals.
Thirty-eight out of fifty mine-producing countries ceased production, including four States not party to the Convention: Egypt, Finland, Poland and Israel.
However, the celebration of the Convention's 10 years of achievements should also be the occasion to highlight how much there is still to do.
Ten States Parties have still not completely destroyed their arsenals which total 14 million mines.
Two of the ten States Parties have significant arsenals of anti-personnel mines and do not envisage any measures for their destruction: they are Ethiopia and Iraq.
The overwhelming majority of mines, however, are in the hands of States not party to the Convention.
China alone still retains an arsenal of 110 million of these inhuman weapons, whilst at the same time continuing production.
Even more shocking, perhaps because it is an ally of ours, alongside which European armies are fighting on fronts such as Afghanistan, the USA, another State not party to the Convention, not only continues to maintain an arsenal of more than 10 million mines, but also, last year, the Pentagon requested new financing for two new types of mines incompatible with the Convention.
It is to be hoped that the efforts of the American Congress will once more curb the generosity of the White House as regards the new toys of war.
The European Union still has its own glass houses with Finland and Poland continuing to refuse to ratify the Convention.
That should not, however, stand in the way of Europe fighting for as broad an interpretation as possible of what constitutes an anti-personnel mine.
It is scandalous to see how some in this Parliament insist on drawing distinctions based on the formal military definition of the device rather than on the nature of the damage it causes.
A civilian blown up after activating an anti-vehicle mine is hardly going to be interested in the complexities of the technical terminology.
Colonel Gaddafi, on his website and in the full-page advert he placed in the Portuguese press in the final days of the EU-Africa Summit, attacked the Ottawa Convention and defended anti-personnel mines as the weapons of the poor.
There are some in this House who, like that criminal madman, want to interpret the Convention in such a way as to allow rich countries to develop and use more sophisticated versions of mines to meet a supposed military need.
Finally, Mr President, faced with such obscene positions, the objective of the European Union should be simple: a world free of mines, all kinds of mines, and no more civilian victims of mines.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Ottawa Convention on banning mines has been very successful in saving thousands of lives and in preventing thousands of people from becoming severely wounded.
Unfortunately, however, there is still a lot to be done and a long way to go in order to achieve a more drastic reduction in the manufacture and use of mines.
So, as we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Ottawa Convention, we must turn our attention to how to achieve the signing and ratification of this treaty by all states in the world.
My opinion is that we should proceed as follows.
Firstly, we must produce a much-publicised name-and-shame blacklist of all countries that have not signed and have not ratified the Convention.
This concerns 31 countries to date, amongst them, unfortunately, the biggest countries in the world, i.e. China, India, Russia, the USA and others.
Secondly, we must try to impose strict and effective sanctions on the countries on this list so as to attempt, at least, to force them into signing.
Thirdly, we must set up a very effective and quick mine-clearing service which would be available on request to states that are not capable, i.e. for reasons of cost or lack of expertise, of dealing with such a problem on their own.
Consequently, we must invest more in research on how to carry out demining more efficiently.
Fourthly, we must make sure the obligation to deal adequately with the health and social assistance to victims of landmines is fulfilled by all countries concerned.
To this end, a more sufficient funding system must be made available to poorer nations.
Fifthly, the time has come to direct our attention, not just to anti-personnel mines but to all mines, as well as to other types of weapons that have the capacity to go on killing after a conflict has finished, an example being cluster bombs.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Commissioner, I too would like to recognise the achievements of the Ottawa Convention.
I would also like to praise the European Union's considerable achievements in supporting the Convention.
There are a few problems, however.
In their defence strategies, Pakistan, India and China still insist on retaining anti-personnel mines.
Unfortunately, in the EU Member State of Finland, this issue is being reviewed, with an attempt to debate the possibility of replacing anti-personnel mines with cluster bombs, which would not be acceptable to the European Union.
As is well known, the United States and Russia are developing a new alternative to the Convention: controlled and self-destructing mines.
The question therefore arises: How should the EU Member States and the Ottawa Convention act now?
These countries could possibly be encouraged to acquire next-generation, more humane anti-personnel mines.
I therefore call upon the European Union to immediately prepare its position with regard to the wish of the United States and Russia to develop these new-generation anti-personnel mines and to take action against it.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is the actual point of this debate today?
On Friday we as Parliament want to adopt a resolution in which we firstly point out that we have recognised the 10th anniversary of the Ottawa Convention here with an exhibition in Strasbourg, but in which we also very clearly state that it is not enough to outlaw anti-personnel mines, but that anti-vehicle mines also have to be included.
The 10 years in which the Ottawa Convention has been in existence are so important because for the first time it was a civil society law suit that led to an international ban on a weapon of mass destruction, namely the anti-personnel mine.
It is very revealing that the only group not to support this consensus in Parliament disappeared after Mr ZappalÃ 's speech.
The point is that I wanted to ask Mr ZappalÃ  - in view of the fact that in 2005, for example, 100 accidents took place with anti-vehicle mines in Afghanistan alone - whether he had ever looked a crippled child blown up in a school bus in the eye and given a reason why he thought anti-personnel mines were bad, yet anti-vehicle mines were good.
The point is that I would like to know from him and his group whether they have just once looked soldiers who are now crippled in the eye, or the relatives of the dead who were crippled and murdered by anti-vehicle mines, and how they justify that.
There is no difference between good and bad mines, but there is a need to ban anti-vehicle mines internationally as well.
I should like to say something else on the issue of funding.
The Instrument for Stability is necessary and helpful, of course - and I, too, continue to do what I can to ensure this as rapporteur - in carrying out mine-clearing work in short-term measures.
We also know, however, that a short-term measure, a strategy for clearing our world of mines, is not sufficient.
With 2009 fast approaching, we are therefore pleading that we again discuss the adoption of an independent budget line.
If we are talking about humanity here, then we need clear resolutions.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Ottawa Convention is a success thanks to the upward pressure from social movements.
It was not governments that started it, but the anti-land mine movement.
In the meantime 156 countries have signed it, as have 30 armed non-state actors, interestingly enough.
The problem is that it does not cover anti-tank mines.
These anti-tank mines must also be banned, because trucks, buses, etc. are also affected.
Exports must be stopped so that further exports across other countries are no longer possible.
The point is also that other mines associated with land mines must likewise be banned.
Jean-Claude Juncker pinpointed it beautifully in 2004.
He said that a ban on cluster bombs would be the logical extension of the ban on land mines.
I must state very clearly that EU defence procurement groups are producing land mines.
I refer to the German firms Diehl, Rheinmetall and EADS.
There must finally be an end to these brutal murder weapons, land mines, not just here in the European Union, but throughout the world.
Mr President, I am delighted to see Commissioner Kuneva here this evening.
I have literally just got off a plane and I was not expecting to speak, but I am delighted to have the opportunity.
I am probably one of the few people in Parliament who was actually at the signing of the Ottawa Convention 10 years ago.
The campaign against anti-personnel landmines is something that I have been very heavily involved in over many years.
So I very much welcome this debate.
I think it is very important that we keep our minds on the real problem.
When we were all at Ottawa 10 years ago, we hoped that this would be a problem that we would really eradicate over the coming 10 years.
Well here we are, 10 years on, and we are still saying more or less the same things that we said 10 years ago, which I think is a great pity.
We have got to get the thing into perspective.
We managed to have that ban on anti-personnel landmines because responsible armed forces recognised that they could take this particular weapon out of their armouries and they were fully behind it.
We have got to be very careful that we keep our armed forces on board in these debates, so trying to widen the ban into all these other areas is sometimes unhelpful - when we talk about anti-tank mines, for example.
These are weapons which we still need, to be used by responsible armed forces in our democracies.
We should always point the finger at the real culprits.
The real culprits are what some people politely term 'armed non-state actors'.
These are actually insurgents and terrorists and these are the people who are making greatest use of these weapons around the world.
If we look at the problem in Afghanistan at this moment: the anti-personnel landmines which are still being laid are being laid by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
These are the people who are causing these problems at the moment.
So we need to direct our attention in the right sort of way.
I very much welcome the debate.
I would like to think that we are putting the right resources into overcoming this problem, and that has my full backing.
(NL) Mr President, sometimes it is a shame that there is no open debate, then I could reply to Mr Van Orden, but I shall not do so.
The worldwide campaign against landmines could be seen as a great success.
Thousands of square kilometres of land are now free of landmines thanks to the work of people taking great risks in Bosnia, Angola and many other countries.
However, 10 years after the Ottawa Convention, there is still no reason to be cheerful.
Although 156 countries have signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, and there has been a decrease - a drastic decrease - in trade, there is still investment in the production of landmines, including by financial institutions in Europe.
Dutch and other banks and pension funds are guilty of this.
It is good to point out to these institutions the consequences of their investment in landmines.
After all, since 1975, landmines have been responsible for one million deaths.
They claim tens of thousands of lives each year.
During this debate they will claim at least three lives, 70 per day.
Landmines have made 200 000 square kilometres of land inaccessible, and there are still 250 million of them in circulation.
The governments of Burma and Russia still lay mines, and that, Mr Van Orden, is rather different from 'terrorist clubs', but then again ... the Russian Government ...
There are still 13 countries in the world that either produce them or reserve the right to do so again in future.
In the US, companies such as Alliant Techsystems and Textron continue to produce mines undisturbed, with orders from the US Government.
Mr President, Commissioner Kuneva, investment in landmines is banned in Belgium, but companies are active in the rest of Europe; one Member referred to Rheinmetall and Thales.
This activity has to stop, and that is exactly what our resolution is calling for, or rather is calling for again, as the European Parliament made the same demand back in July 2005.
The EU Member States must agree together that there should be not one European company or financial institution still investing in companies that develop and produce landmines in the future.
The same must happen in the case of cluster bombs and anti-vehicle mines, which explode as soon as someone comes into the vicinity.
The arms industry is not influenced by ethical arguments.
The threat of an investment ban has the potential to help.
Let the EU take this initiative and make an exception to the rule that politics does not interfere in the investment policy of trade and industry.
In respect of matters that are banned under international treaties, political intervention is a moral and political obligation - and this should be incorporated into European and national legislation, in the interests of a world without landmines and without anti-vehicle mines, as Mrs Beer quite rightly said.
We should like to hear your opinion on this, Commissioner Kuneva.
The European Commission needs to show initiative in this field at long last.
Finally, it needs to do more in the way of mine-clearance effort.
We have the money, we have the know-how, but the European effort is lagging behind.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, success has been achieved in the last 10 years, as many of you mentioned, but it is clear that significant challenges still lie ahead.
Every year, landmines still leave thousands of civilians dead and thousands more with missing limbs, and they contribute to keeping countries in post-conflict poverty.
This is why we will continue to pursue action in support of the Ottawa Convention.
The European Commission is determined to continue its efforts to financially assist communities and individuals affected by landmines, through all available instruments.
Mr President, may I note with regret that, in this debate, as indeed in the previous debates, i.e. in the dangerous toys debate and in the fire safety debate, there has been no representative of the Council in this Chamber.
I think that this is shameful.
We will pass it on to the Council.
The debate is closed.

Common organisation of the market in wine (debate)
The next item is the report by Giuseppe Castiglione, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine and amending certain Regulations - C6-0254/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to make a few comments about the reform of our wine sector.
I would like to offer my particular thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his remarkable hard work in bringing this draft together.
Parliament has made a valuable contribution to a debate which, I must say, has at certain times been very emotionally charged.
I am ready to follow your suggestions in a number of areas, at least to some extent.
For example, with regard to the grubbing-up scheme, I see some advantages in reducing the five years to three years as suggested in the report.
I have also listened to your concerns about channelling some spending on wine through the rural development budget.
But let me remind you that all the money from the wine budget will be allocated specifically for the wine regions.
Nevertheless, I will be willing to propose a lower transfer of spending into the rural development budget.
There are three big issues where the Commission, the Presidency and most Member States still have to find a consensus in the final sprint to get reform finalised this month.
The first issue is the national envelopes.
There was always going to be a debate about exactly what measures should be allowed in this envelope, that is to say, which menu we should put into the envelope.
I am prepared to be a bit flexible here.
For example, I am open to putting into the envelope certain ideas concerning innovation and the restructuring of wine sellers, but I think we still need to keep a clear demarcation line between what is possible within the national envelopes and what is possible within rural development policy, to avoid a situation where you can actually finance an investment from both sides, what is called the 'double guichet'.
On the other hand, the national envelopes are no place for permanent crisis distillation measures.
Support for crisis distillation holds back competitiveness and we must abolish it completely and not try to reintroduce it through the back door.
Also there is no possibility of reopening a general discussion on how large the envelopes of the different Member States should be.
If we reopen this debate - a Pandora's box - I can guarantee that there would be no agreement at the end of this year.
I can foresee a very long and very difficult discussion if this is going to take place.
The second big issue is capitalisation.
There has been a huge row about this and I have not simply blocked my ears to this discussion. Nevertheless, the status quo does hold a genuine problem to be solved.
Aid for enrichment with must cannot continue at the same level in this manner.
It is an old-fashioned, inefficient, ineffective, costly and trade-distorting support and, this being said, I clearly understand the importance of keeping the balance between enrichment with sugar and must in order to arrive at a compromise supported by the wine producers in both the southern and northern parts of Europe.
We will find a way through this.
I have listened to the broad call for continuing to allow enrichment with sugar, but - let us be clear - I am not inclined to accept the status quo, so any compromise would imply new conditions.
The third big issue is the discussion on the end of the planting rights system.
I am listening to arguments about when the system could come to an end, but we cannot afford to kick the whole idea into the long grass.
The wine sector clearly needs more freedom to respond to demand as soon as possible, so my suggestion of prolonging the system of planting rights until the end of 2013 was based on the clear idea of a two-stage approach to balancing the sector - first grubbing-up to bring down the production, and then liberalisation to give the successful producers the freedom to expand.
I have listened to the comments from the sector but one thing is clear - the final date for the planting rights system is indispensable.
What that exact date will be, will be part of the final compromise.
So overall, I have been listening to arguments from all the different sides, including all the arguments from the European Parliament, but one iron fact has not changed: our wine sector still needs reform if we want to keep it at the front of the pack.
We have to seize the chance now and agree on a real reform.
Carrying out reform will mean that we have to invest effort, but I am quite sure that we will get a good return.
The cost of inaction is too high for us to accept, and I hope that we can agree on this point.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her cooperation with Parliament during this lengthy process.
I also thank her for her appreciation of the European Parliament's work, a significant and interesting job of work involving a major input from the Committee on Agriculture, but also from the entire House and all colleagues.
Thank you, Commissioner, for having proposed a very ambitious reform, one whose aims we cannot fail to endorse.
Consumption is falling and imports are rising, all of which means that a radical form is vital.
Our wine-growing sector needs a fresh start: new life blood, new energy and new proposals.
You are right when you say that if we wish to remain competitive, if we wish to remain world leaders in the sector, we need to invest in the wine sector.
We have to keep an eye on the market, we have to produce for the market, and we have to penetrate the market with top-quality products.
For this reason, Commissioner, I have attempted - along with my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and the European Parliament, whom I would thank once again - to envisage in the report a comprehensive, coherent reform which is above all transparent.
The system must be capable of meeting our producers' needs, of supplying the wherewithal for them to be competitive and successful.
All in all, we have sought to draw up a text providing suitable responses to common requirements, but also to respect, stimulate and in some case settle differences between the different national settings.
I have just one preliminary remark: we need a radical change of mind-set, of production strategy.
We must break away from the logic of quantity and instead pursue quality production - excellence - in a way that celebrates the specific national, regional and local characteristics of European wine-growing.
That is why, Commissioner, we agree to the abolition of market mechanisms which have proved inefficient, which are ineffective and have merely added to surplus, poor-quality production.
I would give only one example: crisis distillation, which has now become a routine structural measure and is no longer a means of responding to emergency situations.
EUR 500 million per year for distillation had become untenable.
We therefore support a more efficient use of economic resources: for national development programmes and for the implementation of measures better tailored to the specific needs of each producer country.
For this reason, Commissioner, we saw fit in the report to extend the list of available measures: we decided to include restructuring of the sector, research, innovation and qualitative improvements.
All these actions will encourage that entrepreneurial creativity so badly needed by our wines.
It is crucial in the same vein to encourage promotion campaigns, not only on international markets but also on domestic markets.
We have said so before, and this fact also emerged from the analysis conducted by the Committee on Agriculture.
It is absurd to think we can compete beyond our borders if we cannot be at the front of the pack at home, if we cannot convince our fellow citizens of the quality of the wines we produce.
That is why the report advocates a harmonised system of protection for designations of origin and geographical indications, clear and transparent labelling, and positively identified oenological practices.
Only then will consumers, who are central here, have faith in what they buy.
It is thus essential, Commissioner, for designations of origin and geographical indications, which embody the quality of European wine-growing, to be well protected.
Protection means the obligation to produce within the designated area, but it also means confining the reference on the label to the vintage year exclusively to wines with a designation of origin or a geographical indication.
These are the only wines subjected to ongoing checks, and hence the only ones for which it is possible to ensure the truthfulness of the information given; otherwise producers of quality wines would be at a disadvantage and consumers would be misled.
With the same logic in mind, and for the sake of coherence, the report supports the proposal for a voluntary grubbing-up scheme with payment of a premium, so that those wishing to leave the market can do so with dignity.
Furthermore, I cannot refrain from expressing my satisfaction that the Commissioner has just agreed to my idea of reducing the five years to three.
It seems in fact that the number of hectares eligible for grubbing-up has fallen from 200 000 to 175 000.
Unlike our original proposal, the report also strives to meet wine-growers' need for future certainty.
Given this need for certainty, we cannot decide to liberalise planting rights as of now, before seeing whether - and above all how well - the new system functions.
That is why the report provides for planting rights to be preserved at least until 2013 and calls on the Commission to present an impact assessment on the first phase of the reform, so as to be able to decide what to do next in full knowledge of the facts.
It should of course be borne in mind that decisions taken in areas with geographical indications must be taken with due regard for - and under the supervision of - those who have invested their capital and labour in these projects.
If it then proves that the system hampers the development of those who are competitive, we can increase circulation at Community level and ensure that, where reserves exist, they are properly used.
I have one final remark, Commissioner: there can be no denying that the debate has been dominated by the question of sugaring.
Coming as I do from a country like Italy where the use of sucrose is prohibited, and especially coming from Sicily where must is produced, no one can understand better than I do the Commissioner's disappointment on this issue.
Nevertheless, we are talking about the need to give European wines a new lease of life and make them competitive, equipping them to compete in the marketplace.
This is our goal, and in order to attain it we have attempted to look beyond national differences.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your cooperation and above all for your appreciation of the European Parliament's work.
We have put into this reform...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a long and sometimes contentious debate on this subject.
Let me express my thanks to the rapporteur.
He has earned a great deal of respect for his work, which he performed in a focused manner, cooperating well with all his fellow committee members.
Yes, the common organisation of the wine market must be reformed.
It must be adapted to take account of present circumstances and future markets.
At the same time, Commissioner, this proposal raises the question as to whether the Commission ought to interfere in the small things that help to create a regional identity, in the methods that have been practised in particular regions for centuries and underlie the culture of those regions?
Such interference certainly does not help ordinary people.
People sometimes do not understand what is going on.
It is incomprehensible that we should prohibit sucrose while at the same time be signing agreements to import wine produced with sucrose from countries outside the European Union.
Commissioner, as the third institution alongside the Council and Parliament, the Commission should concentrate on its own specific task, namely making proposals which foster the continuing development of the Community, which promote that whole development process.
The common organisation of the market in wine is part of that process.
Let me say on this point that the compromises we reached in committee, for which we grappled and, in some cases, are still grappling, are good for the whole House.
I endorse them on behalf of the PPE-DE Group: we all support the compromises.
We shall reject any amendments that run counter to them.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, today the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are to decide on the future of one of the most complex common organisations of agricultural markets in Europe.
The European Parliament gave its opinion in good time before the Council's opinion, and this is due to the intensive efforts made by our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, and all the efforts of the political groups.
Commissioner, I would like to stress certain points which you must take into account in the Council's final decision on reform of the common organisation of the wine market.
Firstly, reform of the wine market cannot be carried out on a linear, bookkeeping model like the model you used in the common organisation of the sugar market, which we were called on, two months ago, to re-examine because it has reached an impasse.
Reform of the wine market cannot be based on the disastrous model of the common organisation for cotton and tobacco, with the transfer of funds to the second pillar, which has resulted in a decline in production of these two products, while the countryside has become depopulated.
The wine market needs a strong budget in the first pillar in order to strengthen the measures directly for the vine-growers, who will be called on to improve quality and to monitor their production, and also to strengthen the policy of promoting all wines, inside and outside Europe, thus boosting their commercial distribution on the markets.
Commissioner, the European Parliament wants a new common organisation of the market which will prioritise an aggressive promotion policy rather than a defensive import policy.
The European Parliament's report will secure aid for vine-growers who apply measures to stabilise supply, upgrade quality and protect the environment.
Market regulation measures are retained and adapted to current needs, such as the distillation of by-products, which operates as a mechanism for improving quality and at the same time regulating the market and supply.
The report proposes a rationalised grubbing-up scheme which does not waste valuable Community funds on reducing the dynamic of the European wine sector, and it fixes aid for wine-growers at the regional average for assistance, without the restriction of the EUR 350 per hectare ceiling.
Commissioner, we take the view that restrictions must be placed on all those measures that create surpluses, disrupt the balance of the market and create distorted and unfair prices at the expense of other wines.
Here, on behalf of the Socialist Group and also personally as Katerina Batzeli, I shall applaud any measure proposed by the Commission that maintains balance on the question of enriching with sugar, because, as has also been said by the Socialist Group, we have contributed to a balanced motion in order to avoid creating transitional problems.
Nevertheless, the new common organisation of the market should enrich and also respect the consumer's wine knowledge and enhance consumer protection through labelling policy.
The Committee on Agriculture has specified, amongst other things, indication of the CO2 percentage in Amendment 166, information relating to public health matters in Amendment 157, and information on the production of wine from hybrid or genetically modified vines, in the zu Baringdorf amendment.
We should reinforce this respect for the consumer with labelling that includes details of the wine-making practices followed.
Commissioner, we wish to signal a new policy on two categories of wine: the category using geographical indications or a designation of origin, and table wines.
These are two different products and both have a place on the international European market, and I do not think we should have dividing lines which have regional impact.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy reform cannot be treated as an impasse or as a failing of the institutional bodies.
It is due, Commissioner, to the cultural dimension of this product, which we should respect in our proposals.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in vino veritas or, to quote Goethe, life is too short to drink bad wine.
These sayings sum up the essential point of reforming the EU market in wine.
What our report is about is the quality of European wine, which can certainly stand comparison with that of imports from the New World.
So what is the status quo?
In 2006, wine production accounted for 5% of the total value of agricultural output in the EU.
With 45% of the world's vineyard surface, 65% of its production, 57% of its consumption and 70% of the volume of exports, European wine enjoys a leading position in the world market.
In the world of wine, we are a global superpower!
Accordingly, there was a need for action to consolidate our superpower status and particularly to raise the quality of our wines.
The reforms that you proposed, Commissioner, included an immediate end to crisis distillation.
I believe that many of the things you mentioned, such as private storage and the ending of export subsidies, must aid and, of course, the enhancement of wine with sugar, are central points of your proposals.
We have to say, however, that they reflected a rather technocratic perspective from the outset, addressing questions such as whether there should be a link between sugaring and must aid.
In my view this Parliament has negotiated quite a good compromise between North and South, given that their respective concerns have dominated this issue.
In the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we struck a very, very good balance with our compromises.
In this context my special thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, who made great efforts to broker compromises, and we managed to take account of everyone's concerns.
I believe we have moulded the initial technocratic solution into a new elegant shape.
We have a balance between North and South.
I also wish to thank you, Commissioner, for indicating in your speech that you essentially intend to follow this line.
What are the main points?
Besides the compromise that allows continued sugaring, another key aspect of our report is the protection of regional products.
In the light of this quality drive for European wine, there is also a continuing need for national support measures, and these have been set at EUR 1.3 billion.
We believe that these matters should remain part of the first pillar, so that payments can actually go direct to growers.
In addition, there was a need to refer - and this, I believe, is one of our primary achievements - to the need to give special attention to designations of origin and geographical indications on labels.
That is an extremely important issue in our view, because indications of the geographical origin of wines are, of course, a matter of intellectual property.
That has to be protected, and I believe we have obtained a very good compromise on this point.
The ALDE Group will support these compromises, that is to say the whole package of compromises, because we believe they constitute a good solution.
We hope that the Council will now adopt our suggestions.
The voice of the European Parliament is the voice of the people as well as the voice of the wine producers and consumers.
We ask you, Commissioner, to fight for these things too in your dealings with the Council and in the public domain in general.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the text on which we are about to vote constitutes a good compromise and considerably improves the Commission's initial proposal.
Our aim is still to launch a reform geared to revitalising the sector on both the domestic and international markets.
Global demand is not falling, but rising, so the right approach is not to produce less but to invest in the quality and character of European wines, in cutting costs, in promoting wine so as to expand the market and in helping young people to establish vineyards.
It is equally necessary to limit the reduction in European wine production, as proposed by the Commission, by increasing the Member States' autonomy to govern the grubbing-up scheme.
We must avoid destroying vineyards which, while perhaps not having a particularly strong market position, produce high-quality regional wines, have well-established historical traditions and even today make up the social fabric of entire regional areas.
Despite creating the conditions for greater competitiveness, this reform must retain links with the past and promote the continuation of wine-growing as a factor in preserving the land and the environment.
We are therefore in favour of allocating the earmarked resources over three years rather than five and distributing them primarily on the basis of historical data, broadly according to the same criterion used for all other reforms adopted until now.
Commissioner, we are opposed to the liberalisation of new oenological practices and the use of imported must to enrich our wines or blend them with third country wines, because we believe that this could be detrimental to the wine's image and could compromise the consumer's trust in the product, with extremely serious consequences for consumption.
On the other hand, we think it is vital to provide aid for concentrated musts and rectified concentrated musts used for enrichment purposes, so as to protect an oenological practice common in many Community regions.
We believe that investment by producers must be borne in mind and that any disruptions to trade flows which could increase available supplies must be avoided.
This reform must encourage the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin, as a means of better guaranteeing and protecting European wines in the context of multilateral negotiations and bilateral trade agreements.
Finally, Commissioner, we are against the full liberalisation of planting rights from 2014 onwards for wines with designations of origin and geographical indications, and we can endorse the rapporteur's proposal that the new reform should enter into force on 1 August 2009.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we want wine to be a unique beverage, both in its production and in its consumption.
What I mean is that we do not want any oenological methods that take us in the direction of Coca-Cola; we want the future of designations of origin and geographical indications to be secured.
We want to see support for organic production methods, and it is our wish - we have tabled an amendment to this effect - that regions should be able to decide by a majority vote that their wines can be traded in bottles only.
We agree with you that permanent distillation of wine is inappropriate, and its introduction through the back door of crisis distillation must be prevented.
We share your view on that point.
On the question of planting rights, we believe there must be a grubbing-up option.
In point of fact, if no indication is given that new planting will be authorised at some time in a given location, the decision to grub up there is not based on the quantity of wine that can be sold.
This linkage, in short, is imperative, and we support it.
When you speak of enrichment with grape must or sugar and say that there must be a shift in the balance between these two methods, that is fine by us, because it basically means that chaptalisation will remain legal.
If a compromise were found on that basis, we would regard it as an acceptable outcome.
Sugaring is an old oenological process.
We should therefore preserve it and reject the Americans' many unreasonable demands regarding our winemaking processes.
Provided that our amendments are carried, we shall support the rapporteur's draft in its entirety.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr Castiglione that - as the Minister, Mr De Castro, has said - the proposal having emerged from the committee responsible and now before Parliament is worse than the one originally put forward by the Commissioner.
We are talking here about millions of individuals who are dedicated to a product which has made Europe great on account of its quality and links with the land.
The first point I should like to make concerns grubbing-up.
We are told that the area affected will fall to between 175 000 and 200 000 hectares.
My first question is this: who will grub up the vines and who will take over this grubbed-up land, and what is wrong with proposing that the funds be used - and perhaps even reduced rather than increased - with a view to restructuring these vineyards so as to improve quality?
I would ask Parliament the following: why must we expel dozens or even hundreds of workers and farmers in order to make way for large multinationals, as is happening in Sicily, Mr Castiglione?
The point, then, is this: why use European funds for grubbing-up, rather than using them to improve quality and for business restructuring?
We have adopted so many measures in this House and in Community policies over recent years!
My second point relates to the free market in the rights of areas under vines.
Why should the market be liberalised for the whole of Europe?
What is the sense in buying a hectare under vines in Sicily, Campania, Greece or elsewhere and transferring it to another area?
That hectare under vines is linked to a given quality and production, a typical product, an ecotype established in that area.
Why make this sort of proposal?
Are we seeking here, too, to encourage the large-scale buy-outs which are occurring in some parts of the Mediterranean?
This is the key point, and it is why we believe that the Commission's proposal was better.
The proposal emerging from Parliament is worse than the one advocated by the Commission, if what we want is a reform that improves quality and keeps farmers and other workers on the land.
That is why we shall vote against a reform of this kind.
on behalf of the IND/DEM group. - (CS) Mr Chairman, the proposed wine sector reform puts the Czech Republic at a disadvantage and discriminates against it.
The European Union, which did not object to the diluting of US wines now legally accessing the EU market with up to 30% of water and which tolerates the addition of acid to oversweet wines in southern Europe, that same European Union proposes a ban on the use of sucrose in the more northern European countries.
The use of sucrose has been a tradition in our country for over 200 years.
The EU wants to replace it with must concentrate, which will be willingly supplied at an inflated price by the southern European countries.
The subsidy for the Czech Republic works out at EUR 85 per hectare of vineyards, while some favoured countries receive as much as EUR 245.
This is because the European Union is trying to establish a so-called historic principle, which will discriminate against the new Member States.
However, the wine grown and produced in the Czech Republic also gets consumed there.
It does not, in any way, contribute to the surplus European production.
In addition, that same Union now requires the Czech Republic to contribute financially to the advertising of European surplus wine in third countries.
We demand therefore that the money for the wine sector reform be put into the national envelopes so that the Member States can allocate it according to their own needs.
The Union has two ways of dealing with the surplus wine production.
One is the senseless and barbaric distillation of wine into industrial alcohol and the other is the grubbing-up of vineyards: grubbing-up everywhere but where it should be done.
In fact it would be enough to grub up all the illegally planted vineyards in those traditional southern countries, and one of them in particular, and the whole reform would be accomplished.
The total area of those illegal vineyards actually equals the number of hectares that the EU needs to grub up.
It is not as if the EU did not know the exact location and did not have the satellite pictures of the vineyards in Italy that were planted secretly and are over the quota, for example.
In conclusion, yet another topic favoured by the Eurocrats comes up again in the proposed reform: the handing over of the competence in this matter from the Council to the Commission, that is to say to non-elected EU officials.
In this way the smaller countries will be stripped of their right to decide, and the wine which has been traditionally grown in the Czech Republic since the time of the Roman Legions will become yet another product taken away from us in favour of the often illegal production in the southern countries of the EU.
However, we have no intention of letting them deprive us of this wonderful tradition of ours.
(SK) I ask myself, is the reform really about good wine?
Good wine, as we know, is the wine that sells.
That means that the customer accepts its quality at the asking price.
However, some EU countries produce unsellable wines at the cost of EUR 500 million a year.
The Slovak Republic and other Member States have carried out an uncompromising reduction of their wine sector, which is the reason why they no longer produce unsellable wines.
To create the national envelopes of financial aid on the basis of the so-called 'historic principle' runs against the rules of the market.
It discriminates against us, penalising us permanently for not having supported the production of unsellable wines.
According to the proposed reform, we should be permanently receiving just a fraction of the aid being afforded to the producers of unsellable wines.
That is the reason why we demand that aid be based solely on the area under vineyards, and it is on the same grounds of discrimination that we disagree with the changes to the labelling of wines and want to keep the existing system.
(ES) Mr President, next weekend the Council of Agriculture Ministers will likely take the political decision on this reform of the COM in wine.
Wine is not just a foodstuff, it is also an economic gem in the agriculture sector, which has been severely penalised by Commission decisions in recent years.
We are on time, for the first time in a long while: Parliament is going to draw up a report that can be used by the Council to determine its ultimate political decision this weekend.
I must say I am genuinely satisfied with this, and wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, since for the first time the EP has resolved to focus on quality, culture, tradition, a Mediterranean product that has also been taken to other parts of Europe, a product which enhances our stature not only on our own continent, but around the world.
Our wine - and let there be no doubt about this, ladies and gentlemen - is the best in the world; Europe's wine is the best in the world.
That is why we have to protect it and focus on promoting it: promoting it not only outside the EU, but here, too, because young people in Europe have stopped drinking wine in recent years.
Why have they stopped drinking wine?
Because we have not bothered to promote it or to encourage them to drink it.
We must supply the tools of competitiveness to the wine sector to keep it competitive within and outside the European Union.
We must promote wine consumption and involve young people and European society as a whole in a culture, the culture of wine tourism, the culture of wine consumption, the culture of wine know-how and the culture of discussion and participation within society.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a shortage of funds for rural development because a political decision taken in December 2005 did not provide enough money for the second pillar.
However, funding must not be secured to the detriment of the COMs, but by encouraging the Member States to allocate slightly more of their national budgets to the Community budget.
It is not by taking money away from the farmers that we will fill a gap as huge as rural development in the European budget under this financial perspective.
With regard to planting rights, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that tools must be given to the sector to allow it to regulate itself.
These tools must be legal tools and they must be issued here so as to continue to protect planting rights, which enable production to be controlled.
There are already indications that it may be profitable to control such production, just as the designations of origin are strictly controls.
Commitments must be upheld, and therefore we will vote against all the amendments tabled, especially any amendments that do not respect the commitments already made, and here I am referring to the Socialist Group.
(PT) Mr President, I too want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work, and also the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group, not only as shadow rapporteur for this report, but also for the own-initiative report that preceded this debate.
Her work typifies the spirit of compromise and constructive attitude of the Socialists towards finding a balanced solution.
The long months of debate have confirmed three things: the great importance of this sector in economic and social terms, despite being so badly mistreated in the past by the common agricultural policy; the fact that the current rules are out of step with the current market situation and changes in consumption patterns; and the need to introduce reforms to solve these problems.
This debate has also revealed the high degree of consensus on the list of problems affecting the sector.
However, we have not all agreed on the solutions proposed by the Commission, which is why the European Parliament's constructive attitude is proven by the broad compromise reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and by the PSE Group's detailed proposals.
These proposals aim to supplement this compromise on the most sensitive issues such as: liberalisation of planting rights; grubbing-up of vines; addition of sugar and must aid; maintenance of potable alcohol, which is so important for some prestige wines such as port, the competitiveness of which must be guaranteed; crisis prevention; promotion and so on.
Parliament's position therefore provides real impetus and is a good indication to the Council and the Commission of the path that must be followed.
The general lines of Parliament's position show that it is possible to ultimately find a solution capable of responding to the sector's general problems and also to the specific issues of the production regions.
Commissioner, at a time when we are about to start discussing the Health Check and, something which is of particular interest to us, the scenario for agriculture after 2013, it is vital that this reform be completed quickly.
I therefore hope that Parliament will inspire the Council in the decisions that must be taken because Parliament's attitude and the general line of its recommendations are a good sign for European vine and wine.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner, but allow me to say a particular word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his excellent, thorough and valuable work.
Meeting the challenges of international competition, through schemes to improve quality and protect typical characteristics, is the key objective that must be pursued by the reform of the European wine market.
However, it is important to ensure that we retain aid for concentrated grape musts and rectified concentrated grape musts produced by the European Community, since this is an oenological practice common to many Community regions.
With regard to sugaring, any use of sucrose for enrichment purposes should be indicated on the label, so as to achieve greater transparency and consumer information.
National aid programmes must be used to target promotion campaigns within the European Union, as well as for the purposes of crisis prevention, research, development and above all improvements in wine quality.
As far as the liberalisation of planting rights is concerned, the postponement until 2013 might be acceptable for wines protected by designations of origin and geographical indications.
So as to achieve a balanced situation for other wines, liberalisation should be allowed only following the Commission's impact assessment, to be carried out before the end of 2012.
(PL) Mr President, one of the fundamental problems of the wine market is that more and more wine is being imported from third countries.
We might well ask ourselves whether wine from these countries is better.
The answer is that it is not.
The quality of wine from third countries is no better than that of our wine, but their wine is much cheaper.
My homeland is mainly a wine-consuming country.
My fellow citizens are interested in two criteria, namely price and quality.
The identifying label is less important to them, yet it is common to pay more for the brand than for the quality of the wine.
Promotion alone will not achieve anything.
It will not attract price-conscious customers in the countries of the old Fifteen either.
I have observed that for myself in shops in Brussels.
I very much welcome the fact that the possibility of using the term fruit wine has been retained.
This is a specific segment of the traditional market, and is not in competition with the grape wine market.
As in the case of the definition of vodka, it is not acceptable to act to the detriment of the traditions of particular countries, brands or quality simply because the wine sector is experiencing problems.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we certainly agree with your wish to put an end to subsidies that encourage overproduction and have unacceptable perverse effects, but we cannot accept the fact you intend to make wine, which is first and foremost attached to a terroir and an increasingly standardised product sold all over the world, subject to the whims of fashion and marketing.
I wish to highlight two points here.
The first the absolute necessity to protect the geographical indications and designations of origin, which are often questioned but nevertheless establish the link to the land that characterises the European agricultural model.
We want you to highlight this model and not sacrifice it at the altar of larger markets to the sole benefit of money-grubbers.
We also call for more attention to be paid to ecological vine-growing methods, which still require significant various chemical products and additives.
In this regard, we would ask you to provide specific support for organic wine, the specifications for which are now being drawn up.
Biodiversity of terroirs, cultures and tastes, development and promotion of quality, and the extraordinary richness of European vines: these are the future and the principles that ought to form the basis of this reform.
(PT) Mr President, we are highly critical of the European Commission's proposal to reform the common organisation of the market in wine.
In addition to the grubbing-up of vines, the proposal to liberalise planting rights is particularly worrying.
We consider that the report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development does not offer any protection in this respect.
At stake are the European wine-growing heritage and the future of vast regions which not only form wine production areas with designations of origin or geographical indications, but also areas producing good table wines.
As a result, in order to defend the traditional culture of vine and wine, employment and biodiversity, we insist on defending planting rights and maintaining support for restructuring vineyards, monitoring of production and maintenance of quality, with particular attention being paid to family-based agriculture and cooperative producers, support for the distillation of potable wine and use of grape musts produced in the region.
However, we do not support the addition of sugar.
(FR) Commissioner, beyond its technique on envelopes, premiums or plantings, this project - the third in 15 years - boils down to three ideas focused on a single objective.
The first idea is Malthusianism.
The winemakers are not to the Commission's liking, so it wants to grub up, throw away the grapes, ban chaptalisation and curb production, in the same way as the milk or wheat shortages were brought about.
The second idea is laissez-faire capitalism for profit, laissez-faire for plantings, imports, watering down, adding wood shavings, fake wine, must imported to concoct a global wine gruel.
The third idea is globalism. After the single market and the single currency comes the single wine: a flavoursome woody 'parkerised' Coca-Cola wine, which would not even require any winemakers, because the real aim is to free up the Mediterranean's winelands, especially those 250 000 hectares around Languedoc-Roussillon, two and a half billion square metres of land, where they will grub up the vineyards to plant houses, a market worth a thousand billion euro.
The COM in wine would eventually become a COM in property.
Here I am thus the Member for the winemaking Indians.
I do not wish to take your scalp, Commissioner; All I want is for winemakers, who have been making people happy for over 2 000 years, to be left alone.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking our rapporteur for doing everything that was humanly possible to arrive at this compromise.
Ever since the Commission first presented a document on the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine and again in today's discussion, we have seen that wine is one of the most sensitive of agricultural products; it is one of the most sophisticated but also stirs the emotions like few other products.
I believe the European Parliament, especially the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has managed to assemble and present a compromise package that reflects a wise choice of approach, ensuring, for example, that the traditional oenological methods used in the Member States are clearly explained on the basis of differences in European viniculture and - something I consider very important - that quality wines are set apart from table wines.
It is imperative that designations of origin should remain in place. They are beneficial to wine producers, but most of all they benefit consumers.
Preservation of the enrichment limits bolsters traditional wine production in Europe.
The diverse climatic, geographical and structural conditions in which wine grapes are grown in Europe have to be taken into consideration.
As an Austrian, I know how necessary certain measures are, but I am opposed to compulsory grubbing-up, because there is a need to observe consumer wine choices very closely and identify where there are prospects of further increasing consumption.
Savings we achieve through these reforms - and I am also anxious to make savings - must remain in the first pillar and continue to support viniculture and wine producers in some way or other.
Let me conclude by saying that I believe the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has managed to present a coherent and prudent package, and I hope that tomorrow's parliamentary vote will send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission that we want viniculture to have a future in Europe, too.
(ES) Mr President, I first wish to congratulate the EP rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for his splendid work.
The virtue of his report lies in that it includes many of the concerns expressed not only by ourselves as Members of the European Parliament, but also by the European wine industry.
Commissioner, there have been certain changes since you submitted this proposal for a new wine COM.
Some certain aspects have changed very little, while others have changed considerably, but I feel that many of the changes have been positive.
For example, grubbing-up is no longer the main focus of the reform, and I was pleased to hear you say earlier that the Commission is now working with a time frame of three years, as Parliament is requesting, and not five years as you had suggested.
This is a reform of a COM that is so important for European agriculture, as has been said from the outset, has some extremely positive aspects, and I thank you for that.
For example, the regulations have been simplified and made more flexible, and that will help to make us more competitive.
This point has already been made by Mrs Herranz in relation to the promotion of European wines within and outside Europe.
A large number of amendments have been tabled to your proposal to eliminate current market arrangements and replace them with a menu for national envelopes.
It is obvious that market measures have already helped to maintain income for farmers and economic activity in rural areas, and continue to do so.
Thus, without jeopardising Mr Castiglione's compromise, I wish to table a new amendment to secure direct aid for diversification, aid which the Member States could include in their national allocations to help farmers in the transition to the new COM.
The duration of this and the methods employed would be drawn up by the management committee.
Commissioner, I feel that for stakeholders used to working with this COM, with back-up from the current market measures, this is the way to help them through the transition to diversification and guide them into the new COM which - I hope - the House will adopt tomorrow.
(FR) Commissioner, I hope you can hear the message from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which has made significant amendments to your reform proposal.
I support the refusal to allow the automatic liberalisation of planting rights in 2014, particularly for wines protected by designations of origin and geographical indications.
For other wines, the decision to liberalise planting rights ought to be taken only after the effects of the COM reform have been gauged.
As far as chaptalisation is concerned, I feel that we should not waste our energy on this issue.
What matters is maintaining the oenological practices that give European wines their quality and identity.
I would particularly like to mention table wines.
The Commission's proposal offers the possibility of referring to a specific place of origin: for example, wine from the coasts of Provence, wine from Andalusia, wine from Tuscany, etc. This will certainly confuse consumers and lead to unfair competition between quality designations of origin, which comply with strict specifications, and table wines, which have much freer production criteria.
Let us therefore retain the current legislation, since the only reference ought to be the country in which the wine is produced: Spanish wine, Italian wine, French wine, etc.
As to the issue of the information to be provided on the label, I feel that it is important to mention the type of bottler: whether it is an independent winemaker, a group of producers, or some other format.
The winemaking profession as practised in France has an extremely positive image, which is not necessarily the case for wines produced in other parts of the world.
Therefore, I feel that it is important to provide some information in this respect.
Finally, I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, who has largely managed to unite the Members on a compromise text amid a debate which often aroused great passions, sending out a clear message so that the EU remains the world's leading wine producer, guarantees a future for over one and a half million wine companies, and retains its ranking as leading exporter.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to focus on planting rights since, as we are all aware, the reform intends to liberalise the market by 2013 by eliminating planting rights and freezing funds, with no real alternative for 2.4 million vine growers in Europe.
This would take out small and medium winemaking facilities at one fell swoop, and once again leave a market so culturally ours in the hands of half a dozen or so multinationals.
I consider this to be unacceptable.
Does the Commission fail to realise that the staunchest defenders of planting rights are the designations of origin - Rioja, in my case, for example - and that it is they who produce, sell and export the most wine and the best quality wine?
I am from Navarra, where liberalisation has already been implemented: planting rights are worthless, but while in Navarra a kilo of grapes sells at 15 cent, the same kilo of grapes is worth more than 1 euro barely 10 kilometres away in La Rioja.
While La Rioja sells all it has, in Navarra we have to resort to crisis distillation.
Therefore, it cannot be denied that the gradual elimination of protectionism is a good thing, but it should not become a dogma.
The Commission has not submitted a single serious report to show that liberalisation, elimination of these rights, in 2013 or whenever, will benefit the wine market.
(EL) Mr President, the Commission's proposal aims to reduce funding and concentrate this sector in the large cartels.
We know very well what the result will be: we have seen it with other crops.
When thousands of hectares are grubbed up, thousands of small and medium-sized vine-growers will be wiped out, and areas - particularly those which are mountainous or less-favoured - will be deserted and depopulated, with an impact on biodiversity.
The repercussions will be dramatic: unemployment and environmental problems will increase.
Imports will increase, including wines of dubious quality, at the expense of public health.
We reject the Commission's proposal, and also the report by the Committee on Agriculture, because it introduces measures which are even worse: it allows the addition of sugars with a view to increasing the alcoholic strength with foreign matter, when we could achieve the same result with must.
It also accepts the use of the term 'wine' for products which are not made from grapes, thus downgrading the quality of European wine, which is the world leader in exports.
This insidious, retrograde policy is detrimental to European wines and small and medium-sized vine-growers, and strengthens big business.
These proposals should therefore be rejected and condemned.
(BG) Mme Commissioner, You repeatedly pointed out in your speech that our wine market needed reform.
Please explain, Mme Commissioner, which your wine market is because the Commission's proposal you are putting forward does not mean protection of the market in Bulgaria.
For the proposal of the Commission contains flagrant discrimination, a double yard-stick against the Eastern European countries, where the conditions for the production of wine are less favourable.
When it joined the European Union, my country expected a free market and economic growth but what it received in exchange was only high prices, high inflation rates and regulation what my people had not seen even in the times of socialism and planned economy.
Thank you.
(EL) Madam President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, on his report.
A great deal has already been said about the reform of the wine market and, although I have always been a supporter of the view that Community wines have to retain their quality, tradition and authenticity if they are to make progress and gain a competitive position, I nevertheless recognise that the advantage that southern Europe enjoys in terms of sunshine should not stand in the way of production in the north.
I am sure that everyone here in this Chamber wants a balanced decision.
I therefore believe that since the Council is gearing itself towards allowing the addition of sugar, it is right that it should make provision for maintaining the status quo, i.e. support for musts to enrich wines, so that the substantial difference in price between sugar and musts does not come as a serious blow to producers who traditionally use concentrated musts to increase alcoholic strength, especially as we are talking about an authentic wine product.
Lastly, I would like to add that the measure of grubbing up vines may be regarded as a way of limiting Community production, but we must take account of small island areas, where the Member State must be able to limit grubbing-up for social, economic and, above all, environmental reasons.
Besides, those vineyards are not the ones responsible for Community overproduction; on the contrary, in most cases they produce wines of excellent quality.
I shall conclude by saying that European wine is the best in the world.
It is wine with tradition behind it.
Wine originated here!
We must therefore maintain quality and the tradition and also adopt a more aggressive policy: we should advertise because it is only here in Europe that consumption of alcohol is increasing among young people - an extremely unwelcome fact - while their consumption of wine is decreasing, and this shows that there is a lack of information.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this reform undoubtedly rewrites the fundamentals of the wine sector to make it competitive on world markets.
Through the Castiglione report we have emphasised the fact that the competitive strength of European wine, and what has enabled it to overcome competition from the New World, is its quality.
Furthermore, it is for the sake of quality that we have improved the Commission's proposal on certain points, such as on grubbing-up with reference to the time frame and the ecological constraints, and on the liberalisation of planting rights with the provisos recalled during this debate.
We have supported the idea that there should be more careful checks to ensure that the approval of oenological practices is not made too easy, and we have come out in favour of increasing Community cofinancing for promotion campaigns.
Nevertheless, our support for quality cannot be reconciled with the practice of sugaring.
We do understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this practice is favoured in some countries on economic grounds, but in that case we call for the same standard, the same scheme on aid for must as under the previous legislation.
Above all, we believe that it is essential, for the sake of transparent and accurate information to consumers, that where sucrose is used this must be indicated on the label.
Ladies and gentlemen, and here I am addressing some of you in particular, it is a matter of respecting the principle of traceability, which we in this House have fought to uphold in a bid to protect consumers.
Quality and health: as far as I am concerned, sugar makes me ill, so let us remember that the two go hand in hand.
(SV) Wine is a drink with an age-old tradition, a drink which belongs to European culture.
In vino veritas, the ancient Romans used to say.
But wine is also an alcoholic beverage which is damaging to public health, in particular if it is consumed in copious quantities.
Winegrowing is an important industry in many of the EU's Member States and gives jobs and vitality to rural districts.
I think of wine as a product which, to a large extent, should be able sell itself if it is of good quality.
Hence the report's proposals for substantial and increased support for its marketing are difficult to understand.
