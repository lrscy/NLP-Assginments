It creates a stronger Community, which is also reflected in the fact that all the amendments tabled by Parliament have been taken over by the Council.
From my perspective, it means simpler, speedier common customs clearance, and that is good for business and for the European Union as a whole.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and, of course, to our shadow rapporteur, both of whom have done valuable work on a highly technical dossier.
With the new customs code the aim is to replace the existing code and the related regulations with a modernised code, streamline current customs procedures and create the bases for accessible interoperable customs systems across the European Union.
This is something which we greatly welcome, for it will mean that companies will benefit from the adaptation to current developments in information technology and faster and more secure processing of the increasing volumes of goods passing the EU's borders.
Business associations and chambers of trade have rightly warned from the outset about the excessive red tape being generated by the EU's security initiatives which have spilled over from the US.
Through our deliberations in Parliament and intensive contact with the Commission's offices, we have finally achieved a relatively sound and unbureaucratic solution, for which I am grateful.
A key point for companies that is now being implemented is centralised customs clearance through a single point of contact.
We have also been able to push through our demand - and I am very proud of this - for privileged status for those businesses which fulfil the requisite criteria.
As a Member from South Baden, I must point out, however, that the customs code could cause considerable problems at the EU's external borders with countries which are not EU Member States, unless precautionary measures are taken in time.
I know that the Commission wishes to take these precautions - I am talking about Switzerland here - and I hope that the Member States in the EU-Swiss Joint Committee will also play their part.
Switzerland is one of the most important markets for EU goods.
Switzerland's four immediate neighbours in the EU account for 41% of its total exports and 59% of its total imports, which is why there is a need for action here.
We cannot allow kilometre-long queues to form at the Swiss borders as a result of the introduction of the customs code, simply because the Swiss system of customs clearance differs slightly from that of the EU.
Commissioner KovÃ¡cs, I would ask you to look at this problem and draw it to the attention of the Member States concerned as a matter of urgency.
We are talking about an economic centre in the heart of Europe which must not be cut off from the international flow of goods as a result of our activities.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I trust that tomorrow we will approve at second reading the Council's common position on the customs code.
It is a successful modernisation of European customs legislation. It is a true gateway to an electronic, centralised, interoperable and automated customs system.
All EU bodies will be able to avail of a single management point - a one-stop-shop - for their operations, making the much-needed controls more effective.
Thanks to a unified customs information portal - single window - entrepreneurs will be able to communicate with only one customs office in the EU at the place of their establishment.
This rule simplifies and unifies terminology and definitions, as well as making them more user-friendly.
It is a good example of the ability, even in an enlarged EU, to simplify bureaucracy and improve the legal environment for entrepreneurs and citizens.
Moreover, the project will reportedly have paid for itself by 2010.
I thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Newton Dunn, the Commission and the Council for the excellent work carried out over the last three years.
Mr President, I would just like to make one comment in response to Mr Heaton-Harris saying that he thought that Britain in 1975 was joining a free-trade area.
I am very worried about his memory, or perhaps it is his education.
Britain was leaving a European free-trade area - it was called EFTA.
We chose to leave it to join the European Community, and Mrs Thatcher, who was the Conservative leader at the time of the 1975 referendum in the UK, said that it was 'more than a free-trade area'.
Very simple, very clear, on the record.
Now, since Mr Heaton-Harris wants a referendum today on the Lisbon Treaty in the UK, he is clearly confident that the British public would read all the documents to make up their minds how to vote.
And that must have been true in 1975.
The British public in 1975 will have read in the documents that this is about an ever closer union and not a free-trade area.
The European Union is about an ever closer union.
So please, Mr President, can we get a pill for Mr Heaton-Harris's memory?
Thank you, Mr Newton Dunn.
How gloomy our evenings in the European Parliament would be without these interesting British discussions.
Mr President, I will resist the temptation to join in.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the detailed work on this report.
Let us be honest, this is not the stuff that people talk about in public houses and on social occasions.
But getting our customs laws right is very important for business and for jobs, and that is why we are doing it.
So the idea of centralised clearance makes good sense, if it works - and let us hope that it does, under these new rules.
Also, the idea of a single window has potential to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy.
But can I make just one point: let us take feedback, when this all is up and running, from the economic operators, and be willing to adjust it where we see problems which have been identified by other speakers this evening.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, my point of departure is that I am not only pleased but also very proud that we have reached this point, because I agree with all those speakers who consider it a very great achievement for the Union as a whole.
First of all, I would like to express my thanks for your support for the Modernised Customs Code and for your interest in future developments.
As you have recalled, the adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Code will not be the end of the story, since its application will depend on the finalisation and application of its implementing provisions.
The new regulatory procedure with scrutiny will be used for the adoption of these provisions.
It will give Parliament the possibility to check the way the Commission intends to implement in detail, with the assistance of the Customs Code Committee, the general provisions resulting from the Code.
Besides this procedural requirement, the Commission intends to keep Parliament, through its Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, properly informed about the state of preparation of the draft implementing measures and the time-schedule envisaged for the application of the Modernised Customs Code.
Concerning the problem of Switzerland and the European Union, which Mr Schwab raised, on 1 July 2009 the security amendment to the Community Customs Code will be fully implemented.
This means that all goods entering or leaving the Community shall be the subject of a pre-arrival or pre-departure declaration.
The Authorised Economic Operator will benefit from the facilitations envisaged in the Code.
As with other third countries, we are currently negotiating with Switzerland on the mutual recognition of control centres, the results of controls and the status of Authorised Economic Operator.
The negotiations are ongoing, and we are looking for a mutually satisfactory solution to be in place by 1 July 2009.
Now let me finish by inviting you to join the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union on 1 July 2008.
The Customs Union was the first cornerstone in building the internal market and remains one of its essential components.
I am looking forward to continuing our discussion about the future role of customs in the context of the celebrations.
Thank you very much, once again, for your support.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken and all those who have contributed to the drafting of this report.
Since Mr Medina Ortega has spoken about smuggling I cannot resist the urge to bring up the subject of counterfeiting.
Between 1998 and 2004 the number of arrests for counterfeiting rose by 1 000%.
This just goes to show that the controls currently in place need to be updated and a new approach adopted as far as the duties of customs officials are concerned.
I also wish to pay tribute to the professionals themselves, who have displayed a real openness of mind, and I would like to say to them that I still feel a debt of gratitude towards them.
This will no doubt answer the concerns voiced by Mrs McGuinness.
As far as the implementing measures are concerned, I will do my best to encourage dialogue between the customs authorities and the Community institutions, including the Commission, with which there has always been a good measure of close and productive cooperation.
I therefore call on you to support the common position and would conclude by thanking you all for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 19 February 2008.
The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists (debate)
The next item is the report by GÃ©rard Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the report that I have the honour of presenting to you today on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has its beginnings in a proposal that was tabled at the end of 2005 by our colleague Mr Duquesne, to whom I now pay tribute.
I also wish to point out that the bulk of the work relating to this report was carried out by our colleague Mr Mayor Oreja, who for reasons that I cannot comment on here decided to withdraw his name following the vote that was held in committee.
As regards the content of the report that has been presented to Parliament, I believe that it can be summarised by structuring the numerous elements it contains around four main themes.
Theme one is the gravity and permanence of the threat.
It is an undeniable fact that terrorism in general, and Jihadist terrorism in particular, is now one of the most serious threats to the security of the citizens of the European Union.
The bloody attacks on Madrid in 2004 and on London in 2005, and let us also not forget all the other attempts that have been foiled since then, all testify to the permanent and serious nature of this threat.
From this it follows - and the report is fairly emphatic on this point - that the fight against terrorism must remain one of the priorities of the European Union and its Member States.
However, and this is the report's second theme, this determined fight against terrorism has to be waged in a certain way.
There are fundamental principles to be respected; otherwise, we shall distort the basic values that govern our societies.
The fight against terrorism has to be carried out on the basis of scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of religion and the right to a fair trial.
At the same time, and especially where Jihadist terrorism is concerned, it is important to draw a distinction between cultures and religions, on the one hand, and terrorism, on the other.
The vast majority of Muslims, and here it must not be forgotten that it is they who have been the main victims of terrorism in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, have nothing whatsoever to do with the extremists; it is these groups, who distort the religion they claim to follow, that we have to combat.
Finally, setting out from the principle that hatred and frustration are two of the factors that drive radicalisation, the report reminds the Member States that combating all forms of discrimination, and in particular those measures that seek to integrate minority groups, are priority policies to be implemented in order to promote calm, tolerance and good relations in our society.
The third theme relates to the measures specifically aimed at preventing terrorist activities.
While there is a long list of recommendations for Member States in this area, the report emphasises the need for greater vigilance against propaganda sites, especially via the Internet, places where preaching sessions are held and the audiovisual media in general.
The fourth theme concerns repressive measures.
Here there is obviously one action that needs to be highlighted above all others, for it will certainly cause no shortage of controversy.
It is presented in paragraph 10 of the report and proposes extending the scope of the definition for acts of terrorism to the justification of terrorism.
Now while I am not sure whether the term 'justification' is adequate here - and personally I think that in French it would have been preferable to use the term 'praise' or 'apologia' for terrorism - and whether it would not have been better to change it, I will be interested to see how this House reacts tomorrow to this somewhat delicate point, which goes to the very heart of the debate, namely where to draw the line between security, fundamental rights and freedom of expression.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, addressing radicalisation into violence is at the core of the Commission's counter-terrorism policy, and I therefore welcome the report being discussed today and the very vital issues it tackles.
I also welcome the progress in interinstitutional cooperation in the area of recognition of the enormous challenge we face in developing a coherent EU policy that prevents, interrupts or reverses radicalisation processes.
After a series of initiatives in recent years, since my first communication on the subject in September 2005, a communication will be presented to the Council and Parliament in July this year, identifying good practices in the Member States and making concrete recommendations for the way forward.
I notice that the report makes a recommendation to the Commission in this regard.
We have devoted time and resources in the last three years to better understanding this phenomenon, its trends, its manifestations and its dynamics.
We have commissioned four separate comparative studies which are now being completed.
We have sent a questionnaire to all the Member States and are currently analysing the answers received.
We have organised a conference on the role of education in preventing radicalisation, which brought together educators, religious leaders and policy-makers to brainstorm new ideas.
We are working on drafting the communication at the moment.
The first three studies - on trigger factors, narrative and mobilisation tactics - are to be approved in the coming month.
A fourth study on civil society engagement (best practices) is likely to be published around the time of the communication's adoption in July.
Its main results will by that stage already have been incorporated into the communication.
Analysis of the questionnaire sent to the Member States is ongoing and will also feed into the reflection on the communication.
We can therefore now formulate our policy with much deeper insight into the problem.
Our communication will deal with important issues like the narrative used by violent radicals and radicalisation in prisons and in other places of vulnerability.
We will also be talking about the role of education, and civil society engagement in countering radicalisation.
Members will be aware that, in relation to incitement, we have presented a proposal for the amendment of the Framework Decision on combating terrorism that is one part of the 'terrorism package' introduced last November.
That instrument aims to introduce into the Framework Decision offences parallel to those covered in the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism: public provocation, recruitment and training for terrorism - including via the internet - and in particular internet instructions on how to produce home-made bombs.
The Commission is strongly committed to supporting the victims of terrorism.
We have, since 2004, demonstrated our support through financial assistance to numerous projects intended to help associations of victims of terrorism and to promote solidarity among European citizens.
We envisage creating, in 2008, a European Network of Associations of Victims of Terrorism, in order to represent victims' interests at European level and to strengthen European citizens' solidarity with victims of terrorism.
In conclusion, in order to tackle the terrorist threat at European level, it is absolutely necessary to implement a global prevention policy on the factors leading to radicalisation and recruitment, in order to explore its deep roots, while never justifying terrorist behaviour.
Jihadist terrorism remains the biggest threat to democratic societies, including thousands of millions of honest Muslim people in the EU and in many other parts of the world.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is sad that we have to hold yet another debate about terrorism.
Radicalisation and terrorism do not fit with Europe.
The Europe which we are building is a Europe of tolerance, so it is always sad when we have to discuss this issue.
There is a great deal that unites us.
Terrorism is recognised as a major threat.
Recruitment must be stopped.
We must respect fundamental rights.
Dialogue is the key to tolerance.
We must be particularly aware of the Internet, particularly its significance in communication.
In our foreign policy we view anti-terrorism as being particularly important.
In Europe we need better networking of services to ensure that we can combat radicalisation and terrorism.
I would particularly like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for his suggestions here and for his summary.
For my group, therefore, it is a great pity that the outstretched hand of our own rapporteur, Mr Mayor Oreja, was not taken and that we could not reach a compromise at the end of the process.
The EPP-ED therefore has a number of key points which we have defined for tomorrow's vote: for example, when there are motions for deletions which state that the violation of individual rights and the rule of law lead to terrorism; when there are motions for deletions which put school and religious centres under special surveillance; and when there are motions to delete references to Jihadist terror.
If we want to combat a threat, we need to know where the threat comes from.
That is why we must identify Jihadist terror as the key challenge and state this in the report.
If it is deleted, we will not be able to vote in favour of the report.
We will not support any further watering-down of the report.
I therefore hope that we can achieve a good result in tomorrow's vote.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my colleagues and say immediately that we were, quite frankly, obliged to work on a report that got off to a bad start, sent out mixed messages and contained shaky proposals.
I believe that the Committee on Civil Liberties did a remarkable job of restoring a meaningful, tangible political profile to this report.
The basic premise was of course shared by us all.
The violent radicalisation of individuals and groups in recent years has shown up one of the greatest weaknesses in our legal system and represented one of the greatest onslaughts on our democratic institutions.
It is essential to combat this phenomenon.
In this sense, European Union action offers added value since it provides harmonisation, because if we pool our instruments we shall have a sum of instruments, each of which will have its own intrinsic weakness.
However, this is a new challenge which calls for well-balanced efforts without giving way to the natural human temptation - inevitable, given the attacks we have suffered in the years since 11 September - to generalise or to build a Fortress Europe, or to sideline a priority that is central to the process of EU integration, namely the safeguarding of fundamental rights.
That is why we believe it is essential to move in the three directions set out by this report.
The first step is to uphold fundamental rights and the rule of law, particularly - as Mr Frattini said - religious freedom and freedom of expression.
Unless these rights are guaranteed, the very idea of Europe will be a failure, as will an integration process predicated above all else on the fundamental rights of European citizens.
We need to strengthen judicial cooperation so as to strike at radical, violent, organised fringe groups.
We need full harmonisation of terrorist crimes at European Union level, and that of condoning criminal activity should be added to the proposal of the Committee on Civil Liberties.
Of course we also need careful prevention work: we must attack the causes and factors - which are numerous, and it is pointless to pretend otherwise - leading to the radicalisation of various population groups within our societies.
This entails expanding the rights of citizenship, active citizenship, in other words a form of citizenship comprising responsibilities and participation in political life, as well as dialogue with religious movements.
As the Vice-President has said, we must also fight in favour of, and protect, the millions - tens of millions - of European citizens who profess a religion different from our own, as well as the Muslim non-Community citizens who have always lived by the rules of our democracy and complied with our laws, which makes them worthy of our full respect.
Lastly, we need to build a dialogue which genuinely represents an alliance of civilisations and not a clash of civilisations.
'Alliance of civilisations' - I am concluding now, Mr President - Is not a term we have borrowed from a political polemic; it is the term coined by the United Nations Security Council.
It expresses a major responsibility and a strong commitment for this House and our communities.
I believe it is vital to keep this term in tomorrow's resolution.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) I feel, Mr President, that beyond its actual format the report is balanced, extremely important, and deals with an issue that is all too familiar to us nowadays.
There can be no doubt that terrorism is a policing phenomenon and we are all aware that it has a policing dimension.
Nevertheless, the reasons behind terrorism, or rather the reasons that lead certain people to become terrorists, lie well beyond this.
Jaime Mayor Oreja set this out in his first report, in an extremely debatable fashion at the outset, but after many meetings and many amendments he produced a result that was fully acceptable, including to his own Group.
I wish to testify before this House, as one might testify in court, that it is not true that Jaime Mayor Oreja's outstretched hand was rejected.
I would testify to this under oath if it were the practice of Parliament.
This is not true.
The reasons why stumbling blocks are now being produced for this report are best known to the European People's Party and the Group.
I can testify to meetings in Mr Mayor Oreja's office at which we accepted 99% of what is to be put to the vote tomorrow.
They cannot tell us that certain items have been rejected or that the offer has been rejected, since this is purely and simply their misrepresentation of the truth.
The position to be adopted by the Partido Popular tomorrow, therefore, remains a mystery, and doubtless this will serve to weaken the joint political message we wish to convey.
I therefore wish to express my regret at this attitude.
I feel that to say the problem is that the word 'Jihad' must disappear in one section, when it subsequently appears in three sections, and again in recital H that Jihadism is doubtless the main focus of the type of terrorism we are dealing with, is looking for excuses that do not hold water.
In any case, this report talks of freedom, religious freedom, freedom of thought and even freedom to reject a social model, but makes it clear that Europe cannot accept incitement to violence, incitement to hatred or the destruction of the very pillars of society under the cloak of religion.
The State is entitled to instruments to be used in its own defence, instruments to defend its citizens.
It may, in fact, fully implement this right in terms of the police and the judiciary, while simultaneously maintaining dialogue, participation, and working towards the full integration of people who may one day become such fanatics that they could attack their own society, the society into which they have integrated, or simply their own society, since in many cases these people were actually born among us.
It is debatable, and my Group has debated this, to what extent current legislation is or is not sufficient; concepts such as apology and justification for terrorist acts are necessary for some, while they are rejected by others as potential excessive curtailment of freedom of expression.
This, then, is the position of my Group: to go no further in modifying the law and to reject the concept of apologia.
At any rate, and I am finishing up now, Mr President, I welcome this report.
I hope that the European People's Party reconsiders and reflects on the support it could lend to the contents.
As a guideline towards a global policy, I welcome a Commission policy whereby police forces act in close cooperation throughout Europe and measures are adopted that, beyond the polish, produce a result which respects the rights of one and all.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, paraphrasing Ernest Hemingway I would say: 'Do not ask for whom the terrorist bell tolls, it tolls for thee'.
Following the attacks in Spain four years ago and those in England three years ago, this is a very relevant message.
If Oriana Fallaci, a fellow-countryman of Commissioner Frattini, could read the document we are debating, she would most probably be shocked.
Mrs Fallaci was a distinguished Italian intellectual renowned for being uncompromising and controversial She believed Islamic terrorists essentially represent Islam in a nutshell, and are the quintessence of Islam.
Clearly, the European Parliament may have a different view on the matter.
It is worth considering, however, why Muslim terrorists are able to garner so much support amongst young people of Arab descent born in Member States of the European Union.
I fully support the statements that the war on terror will remain a priority for the European Union.
It is very important for us to focus on terrorist propaganda conducted over the Internet.
I would add that satellite television broadcasts in Arabic can also be used to promote radical Islam.
Mr President, I represent Northern Ireland in this House, a region which, as everyone will know, has suffered decades of vicious terrorism.
And from that experience, I have two points to make in this debate.
Firstly, terrorism should never be appeased; it has to be defeated.
Start treating with terrorism, giving its prisoners special status and, ultimately, early release, and soon you will end up like Northern Ireland has ended up: with unrepentant terrorists at the heart of our Government.
Appeasement only whets the appetite - the insatiable appetite - of terrorists.
The second point I want to make is this: whereas state abuse is wrong, the naive belief, such as I find in this report, that lavishing so-called 'human rights' on terrorists will neutralise them will, in fact, only strengthen their cause as they expertly exploit and misuse every such right to their own advantage, while they go on denying their victims the most basic right of them all: the right to life.
Because of the excesses of their murderous strategy, sometimes the defence of society requires a choice between the uninhibited rights of terrorists and the rights of the innocent.
In such circumstances, I have no difficulty in choosing the right of society to defend itself over the supposed human rights of the terrorist.
The battle against terrorism is a battle of good against evil, and, if needs be, the right of the terrorist is secondary to that of society.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by reiterating that the unrelenting fight against terrorism must be pursued within the law, with respect for the rule of law and without infringing fundamental rights.
I am not sure whether terrorism is, as the report states, the main threat to the security of the citizens of the Union, but I agree with Mr Deprez that it is definitely one of the main threats.
I believe that underestimating this threat will prevent us from fighting it effectively and increasing the security of our citizens.
I will therefore vote against the proposed amendments.
Terrorism does not just affect the citizens of those countries which have suffered attacks; it also threatens the security of everyone else.
It spreads the fear and threat of terror.
Terrorism is an irrational manifestation of fanaticism which disregards the value of life and the dignity of human beings.
The Union and also Commissioner Frattini have placed the fight against terrorism at the top of their priorities.
We need a global strategy that can dismantle the terrorist networks.
This strategy must recognise the value of prevention, including the fight against the recruitment of terrorists and all factors favouring violent radicalisation.
It is important to analyse and understand the reasons, grounds and processes leading to radicalisation and terrorism, particularly among young people living in our Member States.
There have definitely been failures in the integration processes.
I agree that, within the law and with respect for the freedom of expression, the terrorist propaganda aimed at encouraging terrorist acts must be prevented.
To end, I must agree with Mr Mayor that a European initiative, particularly in this area, cannot and must not be used as a platform for the promotion of national electoral strategies.
(SV) Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Deprez for the report and the much needed discussion on terrorism.
I also think that it has come at the right time, as we are now in the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue.
What I do not think the report conveys sufficiently well is the reason why people, mainly young men, become or are lured into becoming terrorists and place themselves outside democratic society.
If we look around us, we cannot ignore the poverty that is there and injustices that are manifest.
There are many young people to whom we cannot offer training, jobs, housing or hope for the future.
This is a breeding ground for fanaticism and the conditioning of young people into acting to secure more rights for their group or people.
An analysis of this is lacking in the report.
I urge you especially to vote for Amendment 12, since terrorist propaganda today is usually spread on the internet, something which too few of us here see or can control.
It is a generation question, and we must increase and improve our knowledge of recruitment and become better at preventing it.
Otherwise I support the amendments of the PSE Group.
(DE) Mr President, many thanks to Mr Deprez and Mr Guardans CambÃ³ for their comments.
I think they are very much in line with our group's position.
The report is entitled 'The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists'.
Other speakers have welcomed the fact that we are talking about this issue, and they are right to do so.
However, we are not discussing it for the first time.
The European Parliament and the Union as a whole have talked about the preachers of hate and have taken preventive measures to cut off the flow of funds to terrorist organisations.
These are certainly useful measures.
In that respect, I think that the report largely hits the right note.
I think it would be slightly overstating the case to view the Internet as the root of all evil or as a safe haven.
It is undoubtedly a space which reflects social trends just as much as real life does, and I do not believe that we should be focusing all our efforts on quelling it once and for all.
We simply will not manage it.
The question, then, is what can we do instead?
We have talked about audiovisual services, and the question which arises here is: why does the European Union not take action if certain channels are broadcasting hate programmes on EU territory that are aimed directly at children?
In one of Hezbollah's programmes, for example, a figure disguised as Mickey Mouse - in whatever form - attacks Jewish settlers.
This is intended to teach small Palestinian children about their history.
It is not the case that a Member State intervened to put an end to this problem.
Instead, the Walt Disney company asserted its rights over Mickey Mouse, and at the end of the series, Mickey Mouse was killed off by a Jewish settler.
This was broadcast on European territory!
Why is Hezbollah still not on the EU's list of terrorist organisations?
We have just had an interesting discussion with Dick Marty on this issue.
I believe that, in general, more building blocks are needed to curb terrorism as a whole.
This must certainly include tackling the roots of terrorism in the countries concerned, for example by creating healthcare systems, infrastructure and education systems.
We should not leave it to terrorist organisations like Hamas in the Gaza Strip or Hezbollah to provide these services, for these havens within society are the very places where these organisations recruit their supporters.
Mr President, I believe that this is a good report and I subscribe almost entirely to the remarks of my chairman and political colleague, Mr Deprez.
But I disagree with him and others on the proper scope of the anti-terrorist laws.
I do not believe it is helpful to criminalise glorification of, or apologia for, terrorism.
I think the term 'justification' is also problematic.
As many of us were earlier discussing with Dick Marty on the subject of terrorist blacklists and asset freezing, the law needs to be both just and effective if it is to remain credible and sustainable and have public support.
There is a profound risk that extending the criminal law as proposed, beyond actions and intentions and into the realm of opinion, commentary, and even fantasy, carries the danger of creating thought-crimes.
This would have a potentially chilling effect on free speech.
If I say I understand that the Kurds in Turkey have felt anger and disaffection at the suppression of their culture, language and identity and denial of their political aspirations, am I justifying PKK bombs?
There is hardly a person in the House - unfortunately, there are maybe a few - who would not glorify Nelson Mandela.
But the ANC committed terrorist acts in fighting the utterly repressive apartheid state.
There are people, now statesmen, who have been honoured guests in this Chamber, who have a past as freedom fighters.
So am I just a woolly liberal, concerned only with free speech?
No, because the law has to be effective.
We already properly criminalise incitement to commit terrorism.
And that gives wide scope to target behaviour and speech that has, as its purpose, the instigation of a terrorist offence.
Last week, the UK's second highest court, the Court of Appeal, quashed the convictions of five men for possession of jihadist material precisely because there was no evidence of intention to encourage terrorism.
The original convictions in this case created resentment among those - mainly young Muslims - who wanted to discuss, debate and criticise the foreign policies of Europe and the United States.
That does not help combat radicalism.
But these cases have also, by their collapse, left the law in a state of confusion and disarray, and that is good for terrorists.
Let us stick to getting convictions on the basis of incitement.
Let us not stray into glorification and apologia.
- (NL) Mr President, I would also like to express my appreciation of the report now before us and also of the Commissioner's words and of what he wants to do.
In my country too, the Netherlands, a lot of attention is being given to radicalisation and its tragic consequences.
We ourselves in the Netherlands were faced with a horrific murder of a Dutch TV producer committed by young people who came from these radicalised circles.
We are only talking about a small group, but what they do can have major consequences.
It is very important that we work together and that every effort is made to track down and isolate groups and individual young people who may turn to terrorist attacks.
However, as others here have said already, the prevention of radicalisation is also vitally important.
The point is to keep the group who may turn to violence as small as possible.
Nor does radicalisation always end in violence.
It is a bad thing in any case if young people feel totally isolated from society and do not want to have anything more to do with it.
In our experience it also comes down to the fact that the policy on tackling radicalisation is directed at local authorities.
Of course it is important to look at what you can do in the prisons and, more generally, in the area of education to look at what you can do to prevent misuse of the Internet.
However, it is still mainly the local authorities who are able to be active in the communities to tackle the causes of radicalisation and to trace the youngsters who are susceptible to it.
I think that the European Union, and the Commissioner in particular, can play an important role in bringing together the experience we have gained in various cities.
Last week our group made a working visit to Rotterdam, a city where a great deal is being done to tackle and prevent radicalisation and to reach groups that are susceptible to it.
It is also important to engage in a broader dialogue with the Muslim communities in our countries.
Some of the young people involved come from those larger communities and if we isolate that large group we will never be able to reach that small group.
It is important, therefore, to enter into the dialogue with the assumption that the vast majority of the Muslim communities who live in our society want nothing to do with what is a perverse interpretation of their faith, and that we invest a great deal in that broad dialogue of my group, this year too, the year of cultural dialogue.
(SV) Thank you Mr President, Commissioner.
The EU needs to show clearly that the fight against terrorism is, both symbolically and practically, a demonstration of solidarity.
More resources are needed to enable Europol to cooperate with our national security services and achieve results.
This is shown, in particular, by the recent unrest following the rekindling of antagonism over the Muhammad cartoons.
As has been said here, the fight against terrorism must always be waged by legal and proportionate means.
The CIA flights in Europe, the use of torture, mock executions and waterboarding, which the CIA now acknowledges did happen, and the establishment of special secret jails must be vigorously condemned.
In these cases, Mr Frattini, the EU should have acted much more firmly than it did.
It is good that the report adopts a broader approach and addresses the factors which contribute to increased support for and renewed recruitment to groups which reject our models of society in favour of violence and sectarianism.
The fact that the perpetrators of the terrible outrages we have witnessed in recent years were born or grew up in Europe is a shrill wake-up call urging us also to look at our own societies with more critical eyes.
We need a dialogue and an honest discussion on our integration and visa policy.
Here we cannot and must not avoid difficult questions.
But, to me, one thing is self-evident.
It is our thinking on what should be the basis of our common legislation.
The current debate on sharia law in Britain shows that good intentions can often be more of a hindrance than a help.
We must also ensure that Community legislation does not jeopardise or set aside important constitutional principles, such as those governing freedom of expression.
The report speaks of introducing a new concept in the Framework Decision: 'justification of terrorism'.
I believe that this is unfortunate.
Not because it is not a good idea to ensure that all Member States have good laws against incitement but because it is difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at a definition which could be applied uniformly and which would not lead to thorny problems of interpretation.
On the one hand, there is the important task of devising ways of combating terrorism and saving lives.
On the other hand, there is the principle of freedom of expression and the concern to maintain a high level of legal certainty in Europe.
It is a question of finding the right balance.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, by the time the fanatics have snuffed out innocent lives and carried out bomb attacks on democratic societies, it is already too late.
For that reason, no effort must be spared, especially - as Commissioner Frattini says - when it comes to prevention.
Dialogue, as the key to tolerance, must be at the forefront of our attention.
However, we also need better police cooperation and exchange of data; indeed, all the tools which can be used both within and beyond the European Union should be reinforced.
I particularly welcome the fact that the Commissioner has drawn attention to the importance of helping victims.
It is not just about tolerance, it is also about practical measures.
Let me stress that there must be surveillance of the preachers of hate: that is a necessity.
However, the information must then be acted on.
Glorification of terrorism is never acceptable, so we need a zero-tolerance strategy towards crimes against our society.
I think it is most regrettable that on an issue which has always been a very serious topic of discussion in this House, the national polemic has once again loomed so large in relation to this report.
(DE) Mr President, I have been asked by fellow Members from the ALDE group how the PPE-DE intends to vote.
Let me say again that the PPE-DE Group supports 95% of what is in the report.
I would also like to underscore that I think it is very sad that both the ALDE representative and the PSE representative, Spanish colleagues, have attacked the PPE-DE today.
I think it is a great pity that domestic issues are preventing us from finding common ground in this Parliament.
Anyone who wants this House as a whole to achieve a major decision tomorrow should please vote for the PPE-DE amendments.
We are not changing anything of the substance of the motion, but we are removing the domestic policy aspect.
Anyone who wants to grasp the outstretched hand of the PPE-DE Group can do so tomorrow.
(DE) Mr President, I am delighted that you have given us leave to speak again, as that has been handled differently in another debate.
Nonetheless, although Mr Pirker and I may not always see eye to eye - we often argue, and do so with great enjoyment and fervour - he is quite right to say that such debates should not be abused for national purposes.
It disrupts everything and it simply leads to false compromises.
I am sure that the Spanish colleagues here in the House will give a different answer.
I simply know from my own experience that this type of thing is very often dragged into the national debate.
I am also getting rather tired of the fact that - not for the first time - we are being used as a ping pong ball between the PPE-DE and the PSE on these matters.
However, I am glad that the Liberals have been able to mediate and are still up to the challenge.
Our colleague from Northern Ireland is unfortunately no longer present.
I find that rather galling because he said something that I view as quite incredible: he said that terrorists do not have the same basic human rights as everyone else.
However, that is precisely what distinguishes us from terrorists: the fact that we regard human rights as universal.
We should never give the impression that this House could ever take a different view.
Mr President, owing to the importance of this debate, I have a question for the PPE-DE Group.
The issue was raised that if the PPE-DE Group was to support the report, it would withdraw, and ask the other groups to withdraw, any element relating to internal Spanish politics.
I would ask the PPE-DE Group's representative which amendment tabled by that group is linked to Spanish politics.
It would be very interesting to know, and then it could be made public which of the amendments of the PPE-DE Group concern internal politics.
Is it the reference to the United Nations in Amendment 1 which they want to delete?
Do they want to delete a reference to the United Nations?
Is that Spanish internal politics?
One has to be coherent.
The only person who is trying to introduce internal politics is Mr Mayor Oreja, who did not even have the courtesy to attend this part-session.
Mr President, I would be extremely grateful if anyone who is supporting the amendments to criminalise glorification could be so kind as to try and answer the points that I raised, which are, first of all, that I fear a chilling effect on free speech and, secondly, that I do not know how they can be made operational.
What is the connection between glorifying an act of terrorism and another terrorist act being committed?
It seems to me that there are legal problems, as was found in the UK Court of Appeal last week, because there is no direct connection between glorification and a new terrorist act, which there obviously is when there is incitement, or encouragement at least.
If you just 'glorify' a terrorist act, then what is the straight-line connection between that and another act being committed?
If you cannot establish that connection, you risk being undercut in the courts and then end up in a much worse position than before you started.
I would be very grateful if anyone who actually supports the criminalisation of glorification or apologia could perhaps educate me, because this is something I do not quite understand.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too believe that this evening's debate has been of considerable political significance.
I also believe that we must jointly come up with a widely shared political solution that will form the subject of a report acceptable to all of humanity or, if not, to a large majority of parliamentary groups.
I have no doubt that today's terrorists are seeking to establish a new form of global dictatorship.
We experienced powerful dictatorships in the last century, but this one is a dictatorship based on violating the primary fundamental right, namely the right to life.
It is clear, in addition, that this strategy, along with violence and hatred, has regrettably become a global strategy.
That is why our reaction must consist not merely of cooperation among police forces and information services, but of a political response to avert and remove the causes that lead to terrorism.
I believe, and many of you have emphasised, that prevention means eradicating hatred and eliminating the reasons for hatred, without ever justifying violence, since the gravest risk we run is to begin justifying violence.
We must eradicate hatred without justifying violence.
Someone spoke of a conflict of civilisations.
In my view, that theory leaves a lot to be desired.
Personally I am not convinced that a clash of civilisations is underway.
I am convinced that an internal conflict is going on within the Islamic world, that is, a conflict between a minority which misappropriates the religious message and the vast majority of Muslims who, I believe, are absolutely peace-loving and want to live in a spirit of peace and tolerance.
If we are to provide a political response, ladies and gentlemen, I think the only option is to strengthen reformist, peace-loving Islam against that minority which is neither reformist nor peace-loving.
All of these are political measures; they are not police or security measures.
I have referred to the rights of victims and I believe that more work is needed in this area.
Victims' rights must be given greater consideration than in the past, so as to offer them practical help which - believe me, I am convinced of this - means not just financial help but in many cases assistance for them or their survivors, for the relatives of victims of attacks and murders, to help them reintegrate into society after the terrible trauma they have suffered.
Another right of victims is not to be left alone after having survived an attack or having lost a relative or loved one.
Someone said that we need to understand the causes of terrorism.
I agree, and have said so myself, but I believe that terrorist groups, organisations and methods must not be given legitimacy by our attempt to understand them.
Understanding is one thing; lending legitimacy is another: there is a fundamental difference.
I should like to recall one last point.
The European Union would play a significant political role in the world, in my opinion, if it could achieve something that has not yet been achieved. That something is to encourage the United Nations to adopt at long last the international convention on the definition of terrorism.
That definition still does not exist, which causes us a number of difficulties outside Europe.
Europe has its own definition of terrorism, but as you know some member countries of the UN General Assembly have still not endorsed either the substance or the procedure of a UN convention on terrorism.
I believe that if Europe really is united in this area, it could do something akin to what we did concerning the moratorium on the death penalty: make the United Nations take a stance on an important, consolidated European position, thereby giving global legitimacy to the response to terrorism.
If terrorism is global, our response must be absolutely firm but likewise global.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to make three comments at the conclusion of this debate.
The first is that if we listen to the Commissioner and then listen to most of the contributors the first thing that really strikes us is that - as regards the analysis of the phenomenon, the seriousness of the threat and the balance that has to be drawn between measures aimed at prevention and those aimed at suppression - there is a great deal of common ground between us all once we start to discuss the operational side of things: what we need to analyse, what we need to prevent and what we need to suppress.
Secondly, and regrettably, I have the feeling that when it comes to certain elements that are more symbolic than anything else we shall not be able tomorrow to reach the consensus that is needed and I would regret this because after having examined the list of amendments it seems to me that most of the differences are symbolic rather than substantive in nature.
The problem is that these symbolic conflicts of interest could be alleviated if the parties decided to make a gesture, something that is not always a defining characteristic of the political groups that make up this Parliament.
Thirdly, there are several comments that I would like to direct at some of those present in this House, especially - and Mr Alvaro feels the same way - with regard to my fellow Member from Ireland, who considers that respect for human rights is not needed in the fight against terrorism. I find that this attitude poses a risk, and a serious one at that, to the values on which our society is based.
There is a certain Head of State, and I heard him talk on the television one day, a European Head of State who said that he would take a knife to the terrorists and do for every last one of them.
Well that particular regime is now one that poisons its opponents, allows its journalists to be murdered and holds elections that may be free but may also be fraudulent. To play with human rights in the fight against terrorism is to run the risk of an unacceptable slide in our democratic societies.
We have also been questioned directly by Mrs Ludford on the problem of apologia for terrorism.
I am unable to respond to her in any great depth but would simply say that I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the terms of which are known to her, and that when I presented my views just now I was basing them on paragraph 10 of the report that was adopted by the committee, which states quite clearly, Mrs Ludford, that the committee, and hence Parliament, calls for open discussions on amending Framework Decision such and such in order to include the justification of terrorism within its scope, and so on.
I was not therefore making any kind of plea, I was simply expressing what had been agreed by the Committee on Civil Liberties; nevertheless, I will respond to her directly.
When I speak of apologia for terrorism, apologia means incitement and I believe that incitement is a criminal offence.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 19 February 2008.
Written Statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (SV) The fight against terrorism must only be fought in a way which is appropriate to an open, democratic and just society.
It is absolutely essential that threats to an open society are countered by the methods of an open society.
We must balance our action and the measures we take by safeguarding human rights and the rule of law and must not resort to measures which jeopardise personal integrity.
I have therefore decided to vote against Mr Deprez's proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists.
, in writing. - (RO) The cooperation between the EU institutions on the fight against terrorism should be perfected, taking into consideration that this phenomenon has increased.
I believe terrorism has become the main enemy of European values, global stability and peace.
If we remember the events of 11 September 2001 or those in Madrid a few years ago, we have the perfect configuration of a picture expressing horror, fear and suffering.
The European institutions should have developed a strategy for becoming acquainted with, reducing and eliminating this phenomenon ever since that time.
It is necessary for us to start a study as thorough as possible in this regard: to show its causes, what keeps the terrorists so fierce and capable of giving up their lives in order to become martyrs, whose martyrs they are, how the recruitment is done, who finances it and how we can intervene in any way to discourage this phenomenon.
Therefore, in order to find out all these things and to control them in the EU's interest, the European institutions should be concerned with drawing up this strategy.
In this way, the EU will give a signal of unity and strength to the entire world.
EU Market access for European Companies (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Guardans CambÃ³, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the EU's strategy to deliver market access for European companies.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, during discussions on the Lisbon Strategy and all it meant for growth and competitiveness in Europe, unfortunately the issue of external trade did not receive the attention it deserved as a substantial part of a strategy for competitiveness, growth and employment within the European Union.
We have now moved on and the European Commission has corrected this situation, it has set things straight and it has clearly positioned external trade, access to foreign markets, as yet another pillar of the structure that must lead to growth and welfare in the European Union.
The export of goods and services is a basic component of competitiveness in our economies, and is thus a factor of employment and wealth in the European Union.
The main export access difficulties arise from non-tariff barriers in particular, rather than from generally recognised tariffs.
The Commission has already carried out a wide-ranging consultation, thereby demonstrating its intentions within the context of its broader strategy for a global Europe, intentions that we support.
This report, in fact, covers a good many of the replies received during the consultation, or some of them at any rate, which the Commission decided not to include at the time.
Globalisation is not an external threat from which we need to be protected.
In my view, it is a huge opportunity to achieve what we could not achieve before, and a larger market is one way of creating wealth, in other words, creating employment and improve the citizens' welfare.
Clearly, and here I am speaking to a certain section of the House, that what this report is calling for is market access, market access that must be enhanced, a strategy that can and must respect the circumstances prevailing in each country.
European leadership in this area respect the legitimate concerns of emerging economies, and must continue to do so.
One of the world's most open economies, however, such as the European model, cannot allow itself to be carried away by certain dogmatisms.
The export of goods and services cannot be subject to unjustifiable barriers, nor can public contracts, and the Commission can and must do more in both these areas.
It can and must improve its instruments in Brussels, in the framework of the EU, through better coordination with the trade promotion bodies in Member States and regions, and with the actual businesses involved.
It is here, Commissioner, that the word subsidiarity ought to be understood in its broadest sense.
It is here that the Commission has a role to play that cannot be played by any other entity, a role that elbows no one out of the way and enhances every one of us, coordinating the work that others already do, perhaps less effectively than the Commission might.
Thus the report sets out a number of specific points, some very specific indeed, which the Commission can improve within the context of its market access strategy.
I do not intend to read them out here, but they are extremely clear and precise, and may be assessed with the same kind of precision.
We are also making an extremely specific request for the Commission to define ad hoc courses of action to defend and improve the presence of SME products in third country markets, since it is these products that encounter most difficulties when they have no protection.
The Commission also can, and must, secure better coordination of resources on the ground without offending sensibilities or excluding anyone.
Each state, each export support body, each trade delegation from a Member State: without offending anyone, the EU trade delegations can strengthen their role in third countries.
There can be no justification for the lack of communication between certain foreign trade actors, whom anyone who has made a visit will know.
Nor can we discard, whenever possible, a genuine multilateral approach with a view to improving standardisation, and the need to improve mechanisms within the WTO framework; all this will prove extremely useful.
I therefore feel that we can all welcome the adoption of this report, presumably by a large majority.
I particularly wish to thank the secretariat of the Committee on International Trade, which helped with the drafting of the report, and the shadow rapporteurs in the various parliamentary groups who tabled amendments and improved the text.
This signals the start of a new political impetus.
It is not just a piece of paper to be approved, framed and hung on the wall.
This is the beginning of a strategy, as the name suggests, and a strategy requires a whole range of measures: these measures must be implemented and we must be able to ask the Commission at a later date to come back to Parliament and explain to us how they have been implemented.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Guardans CambÃ³, and the Committee on International Trade very much indeed for this very constructive report.
It confirms that we share a common vision, both on the importance of a proactive market access strategy for European businesses and workers, and on the basic principles that should underlie this strategy.
The priorities that are set out here - SMEs, barriers to services and investment, public procurement and IPR - are very much my priorities.
That is the same message that the European Council sent last June, and again in response to our progress report last month.
We have built a strong new consensus on the importance of this work.
At the heart of the global Europe strategy that we launched in 2006 was the commitment both to keeping our own markets in Europe open, and also to refocusing our resources on creating new opportunities for European workers and companies in the markets of our main trading partners.
We can do that above all through a successful WTO trade deal, but we can also do it through a new generation of free-trade agreements.
It also means taking a more hard-headed approach to modern trade barriers, and especially non-tariff barriers which operate not at the border, but behind the border.
Europe's workers and companies can compete almost anywhere if they are given a fair opportunity and a level playing field on which to compete.
Our job is to support them and provide them with a platform to do that, which means focusing on the barriers, conditions and discriminatory regulatory practices that operate against them and deny them that fair opportunity to compete and to trade.
The challenge in 2007 has been to put this policy into practice.
In particular, we have focused on strengthening our resources on the ground in our most important markets by creating market access teams that bring together a business, a Member State and Commission staff and experts.
These are the people who really know the markets and who have a feel for the local politics and a clear sense of both what is necessary and what is possible.
This has produced good results.
In the last six months we have scored important successes in South America, Central Asia, South Asia, Japan and Russia.
We have also stepped up our cooperation with the United States on market access issues, which has been instrumental in some of these successes.
We have also introduced an on-line complaint register for EU companies and launched real-time and monthly reporting on market access work.
I therefore mildly disagree with the suggestion in the report that the Commission has not done enough to bring out the full potential of this partnership during the launch phase.
That does not mean either that I consider the collaboration to be perfect or that I feel in the least bit complacent about what we could do differently, and even better, than we are at the moment.
I agree that this new strategy is a dynamic process which requires constant vigilance and constant commitment.
Frankly, it also needs some more high-profile advocates of what we are doing and how we are setting about pursuing our objectives, both in this House and also among the Member States - people who believe in economic openness, but who are also not afraid to speak up for reciprocal market opening, especially amongst those emerging economies whose own growth is being driven by their access to our markets.
That is right, that is fair and that is the principle of international trade that we believe in - that whilst we remain open to others they too should progressively open their markets to us if the principle of international trade is going to be well and properly served.
I agree with the rapporteur when he calls on all stakeholders to participate actively in this partnership.
We are continuing to improve our coordination work on the ground with Member States and industry, but we need these experts to step up as well if we are to achieve our potential.
On the question of resources, I am grateful for the additional staff that the budgetary authorities have allocated to DG Trade.
We will continue to push for more resources for the most important markets in Asia and, for example, in Brazil.
In the mean time we have strengthened our staffing on market access activities in Brussels.
Finally, I also take note of your request to receive an annual report from the Commission.
Along with the regular reporting, I would be pleased to discuss the annual activity report with Parliament.
So, my thanks again to the rapporteur and to Parliament for its engagement in this very important work.
It is vital that we maintain our energy and engagement in 2008 and beyond.
This priority means a lot to me and to my services; it means a lot to our businesses in Europe and for the employment they are able to create for our workers, flowing from increased market access and from the strengthening of world trade that is at the heart of our trade policy strategy for a global Europe.
(Applause)
Rapporteur for approval Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the European Union's Market Access Strategy was initiated in 1996.
The Commission developed a free service that provides the European exporters with an electronic, public, updated register regarding the market access conditions in approximately 100 countries.
In 2007, in the euro zone, trade recorded a surplus of 28.3 billion euros, as compared to a deficit of 9.3 billion euros in 2006.
In 2007, the EU-27 recorded a deficit of 185.7 billion euros, as compared to a deficit of 192.1 billion euros in 2006.
Therefore, at Community level, actions should be taken so that the Member States outside the euro zone would become more competitive.
We consider that the market access will be facilitated by promoting the European Union's values and principles to third countries by promoting open markets, by approaching social standards and environmental standards and by ensuring the protection of intellectual rights.
Investments in research, promotional campaigns to make the available services and information public, improving the Community computer system regarding market access, interconnecting the specific databases and training specialists who would support the European companies should be part of the Commission's partnership with the Member States and the European companies.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the new market access strategy of the Commission should really help to remove barriers in third countries.
It is, therefore, as the Commissioner says, an appropriate addition to the WTO and an important addition to free trade agreements.
I am very pleased with the positive report from Parliament, and would like to thank our rapporteur, Ignasi Guardans CambÃ³, who also managed to set out such clear priorities: better cooperation with European businesses and more support for small and medium-sized enterprises; the help-desk at the Commission but also on the ground in the third countries.
I think that the European Institute in China for small and medium-sized European companies is an excellent Commission initiative.
It is a matter of reciprocity.
We open up our market to third countries and then the markets in those third countries should also be opened up to our European companies, especially in the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil and Russia.
We should therefore give this priority in the market access strategy, with market access teams that will assist European companies in those countries.
This means that we have to put in sufficient personnel to do this, including in those European embassies, as you already said.
European business is the biggest exporter in the world and we have to compete constantly against protectionist measures, even in those third countries.
Set your priorities for the areas that are important: services, public procurement, investments, intellectual property and customs procedures.
I am pleased that you have announced that you will report to us annually and it would be good to discuss the priorities once a year.
You have demonstrated ambition here and that is a precious thing to us.
I really hope that you also show ambition when it comes to adapting the trade defence instruments, the same ambition as you have shown in this strategy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to begin my speech by congratulating the rapporteur on his important work in terms of proposals and analysis.
This Parliament does not vote on explanatory statements, but if it did so on this report, I would vote in favour because it certainly justifies the main proposals for provisions.
Thus I feel able to announce the support of the Socialist Group, with a request that the rapporteur take into account some of the main amendments we have tabled, in due accordance with the ideals of a left-wing group.
Europe certainly is the world's largest goods exporter and its leading service provider.
Moreover, in a globalised context we have a legitimate right to market as many of our products and services as possible, in the markets of emerging countries in this case.
Why not?
It is logical and normal, and it is what our citizens would want.
Thus the proposals put forward in the report and set out in the Commission communication are correct, starting with the prevention of non-tariff barriers, a 'Hydra', as the rapporteur so rightly calls them: a Hydra working behind the scenes, not only preventing European products and services from reaching markets, but also preventing balanced development in those countries and markets.
I am therefore of the opinion that this report is on the right path, for what we must do is secure our Lisbon agenda and strengthen our social model.
We also need to ensure that this model can penetrate the emerging countries with which we wish to trade.
I have no doubt this will be beneficial to both European workers and workers in the other countries.
We place a considerable emphasis on working conditions, security, protection of the environment and, above all, human rights.
Those are our principal amendments.
I must repeat our request that the rapporteur take account of these.
Indeed, how do we actually achieve these goals?
We achieve them through much more intense cooperation - I do not know if it can be called 'enhanced' cooperation, since that creates confusion with institutional provisions in the new Treaty - between the EU, Member States and businesses, starting with support for SMEs.
Congratulations, therefore, and good night.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the sensitivity of this matter and how much attention is paid to it in our respective countries.
The UEN Group is very satisfied with the proposal put forward by Mr Guardans CambÃ³ and the additional work done by the Committee on International Trade.
I would compliment the rapporteur on his analysis and European focus, and consequently his emphasis on the difficulties often caused by the unwarranted obstacles confronting European industry on international markets.
Improving competitiveness means doing whatever is necessary to ensure the success of the Lisbon strategy.
If we are able to give European industry better access to international markets, we will enable companies to grow, invest in know-how and technology, and create more jobs.
This is what many economic sectors in our countries are asking of us.
Various kinds of obstacles impede access to foreign markets by European industry.
These barriers consist of a number of different measures ranging from confused regulations and disincentives to investment or market access, to unfair trading practices, scant regard for intellectual property rights and widespread counterfeiting, which is detrimental to European goods, and, more generally, serious and systematic violations of the WTO rules and other rules governing international trade.
The Commission's communication goes in the right direction and Parliament wishes to support the initiatives it sets out, aimed at improving access to foreign markets.
These include the formation of a stronger strategic partnership between the Commission, maintaining its coordinating role, the Member States, and European Union businesses, with a view to supporting economic operators and especially SMEs wishing to make contact with or export to third countries.
The Commission delegations in certain key countries need a stronger presence.
This should form part of a broader strategy carried out in conjunction with our main trading partners, such as the United States, Japan and Canada; they have the same concerns as ourselves internationally and could join the Union in promoting a multilateral agreement in this field, backing WTO mechanisms that ensure a faster response to any new non-tariff barriers.
Multilateral action, the most effective type of action owing to the number of countries involved but also the most difficult, therefore needs to be accompanied by agreements identifying and resolving the inconsistencies connected with the existence of unwarranted obstacles in third countries.
(SV) To create market access means abolishing tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade around the world.
It is an immensely important priority for the Union's trade policy.
It creates not only business opportunities for European companies but also gives them access to better and cheaper products in other parts of the world. It creates prosperity across the world.
It is also a matter on which I feel there is unaccustomed agreement in the European Parliament.
It is gratifying at a time when protectionism is on the march all around the world.
I therefore also think that the Commission Communication and Mr Guardans CambÃ³'s report are more welcome than at any other time.
They are really very good.
In this discussion I would like to draw attention to another question which we must not ignore - the other side of openness.
I think that they belong together.
European firms also need openness within Europe in order to be competitive on a global basis and make use of the market access which we can create in other countries.
In our globalised world, with ever more companies having global supply chains, our own tariffs can be just as damaging to our successful businesses as those tariffs we oppose in other countries.
I have a concrete proposal for the Commissioner, a proposal which may help a little in resolving this question.
When firms have problems trading within the EU they report them to Solvit, which is an excellent tool for increasing mobility on the internal market.
If a firm has a problem exporting to a country outside the EU, it refers it to the Market Access Database.
That too is immensely important.
Both of these systems provide a basis for negotiations on how trade can be facilitated.
Let us hope that we can also develop either the Market Access Database or Solvit in order to deal with problems which importing firms in the EU may experience.
If we do that, both we ourselves and the rest of the world can continue to move in a direction which is more conducive to free trade.
Then we can show that Europe is taking the lead in opening up markets, both abroad and at home.
(PL) Mr President, the report by Mr Guardans CambÃ³ deals with all the areas involved in strengthening partnership to allow European exporters easier access to third country markets.
Protectionist practices, unfair competition and the erection of bureaucratic barriers often restrict access to those markets.
Small and medium-sized enterprises create the most jobs in Europe but experience particular problems exporting.
Their opportunities are limited due to lack of resources needed for research, new technology, to gain a foothold in those markets and adjust their products and services to consumers.
The report rightly emphasises the need for European, governmental and diplomatic sources to offer meaningful assistance to SMEs.
The European Union should increase its logistic action and offer proper support to make it easier for these entrepreneurs to be active on third country markets.
(EL) Like you, Commissioner, we are particularly concerned about the lack of reciprocal terms of access to the market and the unequal treatment of European products encountered by many partners.
In the textile industry and clothing sector, for instance, the EU applies an average tariff of 9%, which is one of the lowest in the world.
On the other hand, many competitors impose tariffs of up to and above 30% together with a host of non-tariff barriers.
Thus the emerging economies also need to accept, to a certain extent, the principle of reciprocity in concessions in line with their level of development and their competitiveness in a given sector.
The protection of intellectual property rights and geographical indications at global level remains fairly inadequate; it neutralises the competitive advantage of the high added value of European industrial and agricultural products.
The harmonisation of international regulatory models and rules facilitates access to foreign markets and must not render the European regulatory framework of environmental, social, public health and consumer protection more flexible.
Quite the reverse: the object is convergence, but in an upward direction.
Of special importance is the classification of imports according to the relevant specifications and requirements, as well as the search for successful methods for tackling environmental and social dumping.
Finally, I should like to stress that small and medium-sized enterprises must be at the heart of the new market access strategy.
I congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur as well the Commissioner.
We welcome the Commission's initiative on the new market access strategy.
(CS) Commissioner, I, too, am convinced that the Commission delegations and the new market access teams operating in third countries require a considerably stronger mandate.
The Commission should, in my view, reconsider its priorities in the allocation of human resources in the EU delegations and increase the number of delegation staff, especially those operating in China, India, Russia and Brazil.
The Member States should play a more substantial part in contributing to the human and financial resources of these delegations, proportional to their trade interests.
Moreover, the Commission and the Member States should improve cooperation with European chambers of commerce, trade associations and Member State agencies in third countries.
This is fundamental for the exchange of information among delegations, diplomatic missions and European business associations.
This would benefit SMEs in particular.
The main objective of our strategy, however, has to be reciprocity of trade relations, especially for example in China, and more rigorous enforcement of international trade legislation, rather than labelling this enforcement as protectionism.
Mr President, I was interested that the Commissioner was the only one who mentioned the World Trade talks.
Perhaps this is an opportunity to get some information referring to the new opportunities in the markets of our main trading partners that a successful WTO deal would give us.
But you also said, Commissioner, that perhaps a new generation of free-trade agreements might do it.
Are you conceding defeat at the WTO?
Perhaps you could give us some up-to-date information on that, because I think that is a crucial part of this debate.
Could I ask you, also, to clarify some concerns in relation to the current situation on the agriculture part of the WTO?
There are concerns about further concessions being made by the EU on import tariffs on sensitive products, and some large tariff-rate quota increases as being part of the agenda, because there is also the issue of what progress you are making at the WTO on access for non-agricultural goods and services.
I think we need an update, if you can give us that, as part of this debate.
(PL) Mr President, as we take the floor in this debate we wish to draw attention to three issues.
Firstly, it is essential for the European Union to adopt a firm and unambiguous stance in every situation in which the export interests of a Member State are threatened as a result of unfair practices by third countries.
In this connection, we should recognise the stance adopted by the European Union in the case of the embargo preventing Polish meat and agricultural products from accessing the Russian market.
Unfortunately, this stance towards Russia was only adopted after more than a year of restrictions by Russia on Polish exports, and after Poland used its veto to hold up preparations for the EU-Russia agreement.
Secondly, opening up the Union's markets to goods and services from third countries should be governed by the principle of reciprocity.
The Union as a whole should therefore monitor whether exporters from third countries include in their manufacturing costs the contributions to be made to provide for compliance with environmental standards and social security for workers in their countries.
European products will always be beaten by their competitors on the world's markets if the aforementioned costs are not taken into account.
Thirdly, great caution should be exercised when opening up the Union's market for access of agricultural products from third countries.
If the market is opened up fully many sectors of European agriculture will simply disappear, which would threaten Europe's food security.
(PL) Mr President, open economies and markets are features of the contemporary market economy, the economy of the 21st century.
This is a first for the global economy.
Not all economic entities are in a position to deal with competition, however, especially when competition is not always fair, and is dominated by the great and powerful.
Both large and small firms can import, but large firms have more opportunities to develop export. This is because entering new markets requires substantial investment in promotion and in setting up the whole logistical system.
It therefore seems appropriate for SMEs to organise joint action to develop exports, especially to promote the latter.
A certain degree of aid and State support for companies in the area of export promotion should be allowed, notably in the area of know-how.
At WTO level, too, agreement should be reached on the development of trade between SMEs.
Accessibility of information on entities active on the global market is particularly important.
The quality of trade should be improved and priority given to creating equal opportunities for market access.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank you and the honourable Members for what has been a very constructive and useful debate on this excellent report.
I am particularly grateful to the Member who intervened to urge a reassessment of the staffing allocations of Commission delegations in key economies.
I thought this was an excellent proposal, and one that I will have no hesitation at all in communicating to my colleagues.
I could rehearse for you the details of the small number of delegation staff working, for example, on trade matters in China compared to the considerably larger numbers of staff working on what is a very small amount of development aid and cooperation in that country, set alongside the billions that are at stake for Europe in trade.
But I will not; I will simply pocket the suggestion and pass it on.
It is certainly not the case that I am advocating free-trade agreements at the expense of the world trade talks.
Anyone who is familiar with the global Europe trade strategy that we presented in November 2006 will realise that my advocacy of deep, comprehensive free-trade agreements that really contribute to increasing the sum total of world trade, and not simply divert it, has been a feature of our approach alongside our commitment to the WTO talks - the Doha Round.
I can assure the honourable Member that I am continuing to work for their success rather than their failure.
Rumours about further unacceptable or inappropriate concessions on agriculture are unfounded.
Indeed, the only rumours that I have picked up about such unwarranted concessions actually came from the Irish Foreign Minister in the General Affairs Council today.
These rumours seem to be circulating within a relatively small community of interest.
The fact is that on agriculture - and other areas of the Doha talks - we will move as far as it is prudent for us to go in order to contribute to the success of the world trade talks, but ultimately this must be within the limits of the mandate we have been given on the basis of the 2003 CAP reform.
It is true that we have two new negotiating texts that have been presented by negotiating group chairs in recent weeks.
On agriculture, we have a text in which not everything is to our liking, but there is nothing that we cannot handle in that agriculture text or that will push us beyond our mandate.
In the case of non-agricultural market access - industrial goods - the situation, in my view, is not so satisfactory.
There, the new text presented by the chairman has created a greater fluidity in the negotiations, rather than more concrete foundations.
I regret that, but again it is something that we have to work with and negotiate our way through.
These debates would not be so enjoyable if it were not for Mr Schlyter's contributions.
Whenever he intervenes I always feel reinforced in my personal commitment and conviction concerning free trade.
His interventions always reassure me that we are indeed on the right track.
It is not a question of the poor little European Union struggling against the mighty titans amongst the emerging economies, nor is it about a sort of fit of aggressive bullying that has taken over the Commission in the area of trade, in which we seek without consultation or consideration to impose our interests on others.
The fact is that those of us who believe in international trade are seeking balance and we are seeking reciprocity, but we are also seeking mutual advantage.
When we seek openings in the economies of others, we are not doing that in order simply to satisfy ourselves, or to serve our own interests and our own needs.
We are also contributing to the welfare and growth of the economies whose greater opening we are trying to bring about.
Of course, the liberalisation of economies is something that has to be achieved progressively.
It is an incremental process, rather than a big bang or a sudden shock.
The fact is that emerging economies benefit from greater opening.
This means useful competition to stimulate innovation and to spur productivity in those economies, it means lowering the costs of inputs to local industry, it means lower-priced goods for consumers in those emerging economies, and it means bringing capital, technologies, creativity and modern management skills to those emerging economies.
The fact is that this process of opening and integration to the global economy secures the growth and strengthening of those emerging economies to enable their businesses to grow, to create much-needed employment for their workers in these economies, and to generate products and services for export so that they can create and secure a growing share of international trade.
In other words, opening begets opening; trade begets trade.
Our prosperity and our opportunities beget opportunities for those who live and work in those emerging economies.
It is, in other words, a virtuous process that we are talking about, and that is what the market access strategy which our rapporteur has presented such an excellent report on is all about.
In concluding, I would say that when it comes to local procurement it is indeed important to support and encourage the capacity of emerging economies and developing countries to supply their local procurement markets.
However, if this means higher costs for public procurement in those economies, if it means inefficiencies, if it means a lack of transparency, and indeed in some cases corruption in the operation of public procurement, who shoulders the costs of that?
The answer is the very local people, the very local workers and the very local taxpayers in emerging economies and developing countries who can ill afford to shoulder those costs.
That is why it is important to bring openness and transparency to public procurement policies and behaviour in emerging economies.
It is not simply to please and to satisfy the 'poor little' European Union.
rapporteur. - Mr President, there is not much more to say.
First of all, let me thank again all those who have enriched this debate, not just today but ever since the debate started, through their contributions, amendments and even the informal conversations we have had, which has resulted in a final text which is not the work of one rapporteur but of everyone involved.
We mostly shared the diagnosis, and I was very surprised at the tone of some of the comments from the Green corner of this House.
It would be interesting to have the colleague in question go and see the results and consequences of free trade in situ and also to go and explain to a medium-sized enterprise, say near Barcelona where I live, that this was a 'colonial approach'.
I could quote so many companies who are fighting to export, with a great part of their activities depending on exports.
He might like to tell the employees of those factories that they are just acting as European colonisers in trying to enlarge the export market share of the product they are manufacturing, when if China introduces barriers which prevent them from exporting what they are manufacturing it is their jobs which are at stake.
This is not just about big words on big European companies being colonial, it is about something much more real.
Although everyone has the right to portray things as they wish, I must say that the idea of this being a 'colonialist' report really surprised me and might be even be viewed as comic by a lot of exporters in my country.
It is clear, though, that we do, in general, agree on the diagnosis, and as the Commission has said it is something that was started by the Council, was followed up by the Commission and is today being supported by Parliament, which of course puts a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, Commissioner, because we do have a common approach.
Again, let me underline that this is a dynamic process and a fresh strategy, and some elements are indeed new and need to be followed up.
May I quote a point in the report which was underlined by our colleague and which you liked so much: 'We call on the Commission to reprioritise the deployment and eventually to increase the human resources available for European Union delegations, so that more staff are available to start up and ensure the successful functioning of market access teams'.
The same is true, inter alia, of what the report says on SMEs.
There are a lot of new things in this report, and we wish you all the best in implementing them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 19 February 2008.
Written Statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (FR) The competitiveness of European industry needs to be placed at the heart of the Community agenda, for this alone will allow us to create skilled jobs, secure Europe's economic growth, guarantee the survival of the European welfare system and ensure that the EU can remain a major trading power in the 21st century.
To ensure that this competitiveness is maintained we need to establish market access conditions that are fair, equitable and reciprocal.
In fact, the European market is one of the most open and competitive in the world, thanks mainly to the right of free competition, which guarantees open and fair trading within the EU.
Nevertheless, the European Union is still faced with numerous commercial obstacles when it comes to foreign trade, for the markets of Europe's main trading partners do not present the same degree of openness and transparency as the Community market.
We therefore need to take urgent steps to re-establish reciprocal conditions for market access to third countries and, more particularly, to emerging countries, and to combat restrictive commercial practices.
We need to act quickly and firmly to ensure that our SMEs have full and unrestricted access to all markets, especially in the public procurement sector.
Reform of trade protection instruments (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on reform of trade protection instruments.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is my good fortune to be able to respond happily to two subjects in Parliament this evening.
I am very pleased that I made it all the way back from Kiev in order to do so.
So let me start by thanking Parliament for the invitation and the opportunity to make this statement on trade defence.
I would like to thank Parliament for its close interest in this dossier, evidenced by our discussions both in plenary and in the Committee on International Trade.
In 2006, the Commission and the Council agreed on the need for a review of Europe's trade defence instruments.
The intention of this review was to ensure that Europe's vital tools were defending its workers and businesses against unfair trade and were continuing to work as effectively as possible, especially taking into account the dramatic changes in the global economy, where European businesses operate global supply chains, and where the mix of economic interests amongst European businesses is inevitably becoming more and more complex and difficult to judge and to call.
Following our review and public consultation, and with the backing of the College, I worked with my officials on a set of proposals for adjustments to the EU's trade defence rules that would offer real improvements in accessibility, transparency and speed and clarity for businesses.
They would include, for example, greater access to documents, greater assistance for small businesses using the trade defence system and faster provisional measures.
We would also propose to clarify, through the drafting of guidelines, the application of EU rules in two important areas.
First, the considerations for determining what degree of production outside of Europe disqualifies a company from being treated as European for the purposes of our investigations and trade defence assessments.
Second, regarding the considerations that should be used in the Community interest test, which allows us to determine that trade defence action is indeed in the wider economic interest of the European Union - something which, as I say, is becoming increasingly complex and difficult to analyse, where situations are not quite as straightforward and not quite as black and white as they perhaps might appear on the surface, or indeed as was the case in the classic operation of trade defence machinery in the past.
The intention in both these areas is largely to codify established practice, which would create clarity and predictability for businesses and decision-making in contentious cases, which we have had experience of in recent years and which, I suggest, are going to increase, not decrease, in number in the coming years.
Whatever your position on the merits or demerits of anti-dumping, those, I think, are useful things to improve upon and to clarify and to issue guidelines upon, in order to give greater certainty and predictability to those who are appealing for the use of these instruments.
A set of proposals along these lines would be balanced.
It would reflect a middle ground of the debate among all the interested parties and the Member States.
There is no point and no advantage in trying to push the centre of gravity, in the design and operation of our trade defence instruments, to one side or the other in the range of opinions in the European Union that inhabit the subject of trade defence.
It is necessary to devise and to identify a route that takes you, broadly speaking, down the middle.
Although our attempts have often been portrayed by people as an attempt to go to one side or the other, these impressions can only have been formed by people who cannot have seen our preliminary conclusions and proposals, because there is nothing in such a package that weakens our ability to tackle unfair trade, and nothing which fundamentally alters the basis of the operation of our trade defence instruments.
However, it is clear from consultation that this issue is politically sensitive and continues to attract vigorous debate and, I have to say, some disagreement.
A package that balances the different concerns in the debate will not currently, in my view, attract the necessary support, and it is better to build on consensus than seek to reconcile presently irreconcilable viewpoints on what clarification and what reform should take place.
The political environment in which this subject has been discussed is not easy.
Some argue that, at a time when we are pressing partners like China to trade fairly, we must not risk even the perception that the EU will lower its guard on trade defence.
No such motivation, no such intention is present, but, nonetheless, some have argued that even risking the perception would be unwise at this moment.
Furthermore, the rules negotiations in the Doha Round, in particular the chairs' text, have also put the international TDI environment into considerable flux, because of the text's surprising and, frankly, unacceptable content.
I do not think there has been a chairs' text in the history of chairs' texts in the Doha Round that has attracted less support from right across the membership of the WTO than the current chairs' text on rules.
But, above all, our objective has been to strengthen unity on the operation of trade defence instruments in order to make them more workable, and it is not my job as Commissioner to weaken that unity.
The reality is that, as of today, this unity that I would like to see is not sufficiently in evidence amongst our Member States.
That does not mean one side of this debate is right and that the other is wrong, just that both sides need to continue working towards a greater consensus and, frankly, a greater sense of solidarity in the operation of these instruments.
That is what I propose to encourage.
We will continue to consult on the ideas that we have floated and to build agreement by drawing on our experience.
I would finish by making this observation.
The pressures that global economic change is exerting on our trade defence system are here to stay. They are not going to go away; they are actually going to grow.
The pressures are going to become greater.
Our ability to operate the traditional consensus and solidarity is going to become harder, not easier, which makes it all the more important that the role of the Commission grows in navigating our way through the different and competing interests and views that businesses and Member States have on this subject.
I believe that future cases will demonstrate the need for clarity and will demonstrate the need for the sort of guidelines that we have originally drafted.
The questions with which we started this review will still be present in six months, in a year and in two years, and I firmly believe that, in due course, they are going to have to be addressed.
Our challenge is together to find economically and politically credible answers, and the Commission will continue to work with that in mind.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr Mandelson.
When you stood here last, you spoke about the need for a reform of the trade protection instruments.
You spoke with conviction on how globalisation and global supply chains had changed the preconditions for the trade protection instruments and that they therefore needed to be updated in order to remain effective and take account of Community interests.
Everything you said then is still true.
We need a reform of the instruments.
Since then, however, it has proved tremendously difficult to bring about a reform.
The conflicts between European companies and between the Member States are considerable.
But that does not diminish the need for reform, on the contrary.
The fact that everything is so infected and that, in example after example, we see the same battle formations drawn up on the same predictable lines in my opinion shows that we need change.
We need a new focus on the instrument and a consensus which unites us.
Now reform is postponed and looks quite remote.
Certainly that is regretted by others as well as myself.
But to argue about whose fault it was, whether it was the fault of the Member States, whether it was the Commission's fault or which Member States threw a spanner into the works, serves no purpose.
The blame game will not do anyone any good.
For, although the proposal has been halted for the moment, the ideas must not be buried.
We must not forget the matter.
We must continue to debate it and focus on what we are actually agreed on.
I think there is quite a lot.
It is about transparency and openness. It is probably also about clearer rules on how we safeguard the Community interest.
Perhaps even about how to modernise the definition of Community industry.
But that presupposes that we keep the debate alive and continue to debate and make compromises.
I hope that we will do that here in the European Parliament.
I also hope that the Member States and the Commission will keep the debate alive.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his account and also for his honesty in setting out the dilemmas with which he is confronted when he speaks to his colleagues and with the Member States about reforming the trade defence mechanism of the European Union.
That is one thing, and I am also pleased that you are open in saying why you cannot come up with proposals right now, because it is simply very difficult to reach agreement in the European Union about what is the best way forward now.
What the Commissioner also emphasised is that it is important to find a way to build a bridge between those countries that mainly earn their money from trade and those which have to get most of it from production.
I myself come from a trading country, the Netherlands, but I understand very well the concerns that countries like France and Germany, which have a large production base, have about the development of global trade and protection.
For them there is also the need to protect their own industry.
It is thus very important to find that bridge and it is also important that the Commissioner wants to make a particular effort on this.
I think that this is a discussion that we need to have.
We must not be afraid to talk about the need for reform of those trade defence instruments because we are facing rapid changes in the international economy.
What do we need to discuss then?
I specifically say 'discuss', because I do not have all the answers yet either.
We need to discuss transparency in the system, the greater flexibility that is necessary, a better definition of what a European company is, and the social and environmental aspects in terms of determining the interests of the European Community.
These are a number of points that we as Parliament should discuss and on which we should try to come to conclusions that we can then exchange again with the Commissioner.
I think that it is too soon, even from my own group, to come up with very concrete proposals about how this should go.
I am willing to start the discussion about the need for reform and then to think about how we can define a number of areas on which we would like to do more work.
That will take a huge amount of discussion in my group too, just as it will in the Council and the Commission.
Let us give it a try.
I agree with the Commissioner. Whether it takes six months, twelve months or two years, let us at least get the debate going.
We cannot simply ignore the fact that changes are afoot in the world, including in the global economy, and our trade defence system has to be adapted to meet those changes.
That seems to me an important starting point for a discussion and I am pleased that the Commissioner has been so candid about the problems that he himself faces.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, to be quite frank, I am glad that the reform of the trade defence instruments proposed by you has failed.
You tried to push the TDI reform forward by taking up this reform in the Global Europe Strategy.
Even if we assume that this reform would have been useful, it is quite clear that we need to strengthen these instruments where they are going to be beneficial, rather than abolishing them altogether.
However, this latter aim was the purpose of your communication of November 2007.
You bypassed the large majority who were in favour of retaining the existing system, with only a small minority being against its retention and in favour of progressively eroding it.
The way in which the reform project has ground to a halt at Commission level shows that the large majority of Member States and many of your own colleagues considered these proposals to be unacceptable and that they were actually geared towards a small but very vocal lobby.
Who would have benefited from this reform?
Not the European workforce, who are at risk of losing their jobs because major companies have been able to make use of your much-vaunted comparative advantages in the emerging economies.
Not the workers in those countries, who have to endure unacceptable working conditions, and certainly not European businesses - and I speak as an entrepreneur - which conduct their production operations in accordance with the relevant European legislation and have no plans to send their profits soaring by exploiting poor environmental and social standards in certain third countries.
These proposals had nothing to do with fairness and justice in global trade relations and between companies.
In fact, the main beneficiaries would have been the major importers, who are naturally annoyed by any attempt to curb their abusive practices.
The beneficiaries would have been the major wholesalers and distributors who ride roughshod over consumers' interests and who prefer to draw a veil over the fact that consumers are also workers, citizens and taxpayers.
The beneficiaries would be those in the EU whose main concern is their profits, forgetting that the European Union is supposed to be developed, first and foremost, on mutual solidarity and support.
The TDI system that we have in place is not perfect, but it is the one which works best compared with others around the world.
Incidentally, that is not just my opinion; you - the Commission - undertook a study in 2006 which makes this same point.
We should wait and see what happens in terms of developments in the World Trade Organisation before we introduce any new reforms in this area.
Such a reform would have to consider what our trading partners are doing rather than unilaterally giving up any legal mechanisms to protect ourselves from dumping: legal mechanisms, incidentally, which are based on an internationally agreed set of rules.
Regrettably, I must add that I cannot endorse the Commission's conduct in the application of the TDIs in 2007.
Many Member States and other stakeholders have protested that the changes proposed by the Commission were put into effect before the Council and Parliament had the chance to reach an opinion on them.
DG Trade has, on its own initiative, quite simply suspended some of the established principles of interinstitutional cooperation in recent months.
As a result, absolutely no cases have been taken up.
I can only hope, and I would ask you to ensure, that this style of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament does not continue in future.
I would also ask you to bring your key proposals on the framework for the TDIs before the Committee on International Trade and have serious discussions with Parliament before they are put into effect.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this issue has been too much for some people in recent days and weeks.
In the committee, some people nearly had a heart attack when they read the first draft report.
The Commission has halted the initiative because you, Commissioner, were apparently overwhelmed by the task of producing a reform proposal that was capable of securing a majority.
Our parliamentary administration was overwhelmed and put today's debate on the agenda with the nonsensical title 'Commission statement - Reform of trade protection instruments', while the list of speakers says Reform of consumer protection instruments, which is not much better.
Looking at the public gallery, it seems that the members of the public are overwhelmed as well and have taken themselves off to a restaurant or gone home.
Perhaps somebody is at least watching on the Internet, and hopefully, we will maintain an overview here in the Chamber.
I find it most regrettable that the Commission has not managed to produce a reform proposal which could secure a majority in the Council and Parliament.
This is certainly not the right time for this type of reform, but no one here would have anticipated that the reform would fail so miserably.
What is important now?
First of all, will the Commission inform Parliament in good time of its intentions to take up this reform again and involve us at every stage?
Let me draw your attention specifically to the codecision rights under the Lisbon Treaty.
Secondly, will there now be a reform by the back door, without a decision by the Council and Parliament?
Or will you, Commissioner, genuinely - as has just been said - attempt to restore confidence?
The trade defence instruments must be applied according to the current rules and practice.
Thirdly, why are you undertaking staff changes in the relevant department at this particular time?
We will be monitoring the conduct of the Commission and DG Trade very closely in the coming weeks.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you certainly do not have an easy task.
You have one of the most difficult portfolios to deal with.
The area of trade/external trade is one which faces completely new challenges.
We have been talking about globalisation for years, but I think we are only now beginning to understand what it is about.
In your famous speech in Berlin, the Churchill Lecture, you said that Europe is exposed to new challenges and that since the end of the war, the challenges have changed because the frame of reference is no longer Berlin or Paris but Mumbai, Shanghai and the other major cities of the emerging economies.
We share your view. You are absolutely right.
We see this just as you do.
We see the challenges which the European Union must face up to in a new international and global context.
China is real.
China is not just a myth or an image; China has become a reality to all of us and is a symbol of change.
The question is, which conclusions do we draw from this?
You conclude that we must change the instruments.
You conclude that we must face up to the challenges by adapting the trade defence instruments or other areas.
My group has not found the conclusive answer, but we certainly have many more doubts.
As you can hear, these doubts are shared in this House.
We have doubts because these defence instruments have proved their worth.
The defence instruments have a certain flexibility.
They can be interpreted in different ways.
They can take account of the different industry interests, and they can interpret the Community interest in different ways.
The test can be applied in different ways, and no, it is not always perfect.
Incidentally, I know that you have not made many mistakes.
I myself can identify two points where the evaluation was wrong, but I think that will be the case with new instruments as well.
Where are we going then?
You say you would like to continue down this road and you would like to continue the consultations.
You have not yet closed the drawer.
Where should this road take us then?
Where should the consultations take us?
How would you like to conduct the consultations with this House and with the committee responsible?
These are three questions which follow on from what my colleagues have asked.
I would be most grateful for some information from you, as I am receiving e-mails every day.
Are the changes taking place in your DG an indication that you are pursuing the restructuring with a view to your forthcoming communication?
Are the technical changes which are apparently under way in your DG an indicator of this?
Can the non-application of the trade defence instruments in 2007 also be interpreted as an indicator, or is it just coincidence, and other factors are in play?
(FR) Mr President, the Commission has decided to postpone the project for the reform of the trade defence instruments and, Commissioner, I welcome this wise decision, for it will help maintain the fight against unfair competition.
These instruments are indeed an essential part of the international trading system, for they ensure that companies, and more especially SMEs, which are the prime victims of dumping, are able to operate in a fair and stable competitive environment, which in turn ensures a healthy economy.
I would therefore repeat what Mr Verheugen said at a conference on textiles that was held in Milan at the end of last week: 'Trade defence instruments are beneficial for the competitiveness of our industries and can never be considered as instruments of protectionism.'
I believe indeed that this says it all.
These instruments are not a disguised way of protecting Community industry from the free movement of international trade, but rather are intended as a way of improving its competitiveness by re-establishing normal competition conditions, as and when necessary.
It is not therefore by weakening the implementation of these instruments that we will be better able to adapt the European Union's trade policy to a changing global economy.
In fact, quite the contrary, for the interests of the manufacturers would have been diluted and the measures that would have been taken could have indirectly encouraged industrial relocation and the migration of our centres of research and innovation.
Europe has to play the role of protector in today's globalised world.
If we are to stay competitive we must not lower our guard in our dealings with partners but must respect the rules of fair and equitable international trade.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what has just been said demonstrates that your proposal was at the very least controversial.
At the start, however there was no debate to be had.
The Commission had launched an independent study and a public consultation, both of which indicated that there was a broad consensus on the efficiency and stability of the current system.
The only improvements sought by the various parties involved were for greater transparency, greater speed and better access for SMEs.
However, masking this reality, the Commission introduced a reform that will go down in history for the general opposition that it has created.
Trade unions and businesses alike, along with most of the members of the Council, protested against a plan that threatened the Union's capacity to defend itself against unfair trading practices.
The Commission has withdrawn its proposal and I am very pleased about that.
The approach that it favoured was in fact dangerous and had sown seeds of division.
It is worth pointing out that the Commission's role is to ensure solidarity between Member States and to respect the various interests that exist, not to be divisive by playing consumers against workers, or importers against producers.
Commissioner, may I remind you that any project for reform requires two things: it has to take account of the recommendations and results of its own investigations and it has to inform the Members of this House in advance of the precise direction the proposal is to take, especially when it comes to its more controversial aspects.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, in one minute I can only congratulate Mr Mandelson on the decision not to proceed with the review of trade protection instruments.
Imagine that, in a system of raging rivers, there is a series of dams.
The sluices are managed according to common rules.
Is it acceptable to decide to alter one of the dams without anyone else doing the same, simply because some believe that the water will not reach their homes this winter?
To unilaterally alter the rules of the trade protection instruments would be to weaken the dam in order to avoid managing the sluices.
This is not what Europe needs and the Commission did well to pick up on the very clear messages sent to it by this House and also by the trade unions, European industry and most of the Member States.
Free trade will not survive if the rules governing it are broken.
However, these rules must be modernised and must incorporate universal values, such as the protection of decent jobs, the environment and climate and public health.
In this respect, and in no other, Europe must use its political weight and trade strength in bilateral agreements with the world's main producers.
It is only through reciprocal action and modern and universal rules that trade can help improve not only the living conditions of citizens outside Europe, in the world in general, but also the living conditions and survival of European workers and entrepreneurs who want to keep producing and living in and exporting from Europe.
This is what is expected of the Commissioner who represents Europe on the world stage.
Congratulations, Mr Mandelson.
Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson expressed delight that he was here for two debates, and I am quite delighted too, because I would request some clarification on his very useful response in relation to the WTO, and I thank him for the detail contained therein.
He suggests that the rumours about advancing too far on agriculture come from a very small community of interests; I would suggest they (I presume we are speaking of Irish farmers and agri-business) are usually well informed, and I suppose that what I want to get clear before midnight is that they are wrong - I hope they are wrong - and that what you are telling us tonight is fact.
I would also note your comment in relation to the non-agriculture side of the WTO.
You also expressed regret about the text that is there.
My original question is, given your comments about WTO and free trade agreements, are you less confident now than at any other time that you will conclude a deal at the WTO?
It is a bit direct, but an answer would be helpful.
Mr President, we face a dilemma between the free trade we believe in and the fair trade that is violated.
If the fairness is not fulfilled, we have to protect, at least temporarily, those who act in a just way.
I would like to present the position of the Polish Government, which is, at the moment, against the reform, saying that, in the Caspary report, it was mentioned that what we had was enough.
Why is it so?
There is an assumption that some countries have companies based in China, for instance.
And protection would mean that they were favoured more than other companies in the countries of Europe, so this is not fair.
I think that free trade in textiles taught us a lesson in 2005, and I think that now we should approach the new reform in a very wise way.
I hope the Commissioner will make every effort to run it in a good way.
(PL) Mr President, the extent of trade is indicative of the level of economic development.
High exports are a feature of developed economies, but this ought to be a two-way street and imports should flow the other way too.
If the movement is largely one-way, it leads to imbalance, lack of partnership and an increasing gap in the level of development.
It is therefore necessary to establish some kind of principles to help define relevant quality standards and regulations, thus creating stability and partnership in the area of trade.
It is all too often the case that we talk of mutual solidarity and equality, when in fact we are intent on protecting our national interests to the detriment of those we have in common.
It all too often the case, too, that we promote the development of exports and the possibility of investing in certain countries without checking whether democratic principles and human rights are respected there, not to mention the situation regarding environmental requirements, wage levels and social protection.
Trade protection instruments must provide for justice and equal opportunities.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson, thank you for your candid explanation of why you have not been successful in this.
When I listen to some of my fellow Members, I hear that they are pleased that you have not succeeded in reforming the trade defence instruments, and I think that is because they are afraid that you will abolish them.
That is not what I have heard you say, but would it not be much fairer to say that you have perhaps been too ambitious, that you wanted to go too far with the reforms?
I am referring, in particular, to the reform of the balance between the industrial countries and trade interests.
Because this has been unsuccessful, we will not now manage to implement a number of necessary changes in the field of access for small and medium-sized businesses that enjoy widespread support.
Moreover, the necessary changes in connection with transparency, speed, accessibility of documents, which are broadly supported, will not now come in the next two years unfortunately.
Can we find a way to make sure that these changes do come in and that we debate the more far-reaching proposals properly some time?
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, if you are considering a new reform project that is close to the original version, how can you imagine defending before the WTO a policy that penalises dumping when it is practised by foreign companies but accepts it when it benefits European businesses?
The problem is knowing not who produces the goods that are arriving in Europe but rather whether they are being exported under fair and equitable conditions.
We cannot accept that a company claiming to be European, and that practises dumping, would become unchallengeable simply because it is European according to your new definition.
What is more, given that this debate is to be held on a multilateral level, why not be even more visionary and include social and environmental dumping within the scope of the trade defence instruments?
It would serve Europe well, and be greatly to its credit, if it were to be in the vanguard of this campaign.
(PT) Commissioner, further to the question that I asked you previously or the comment that I made previously, I must say that, in terms of Europe, the cases that were pursued in relation to textiles and footwear brought about, particularly in my country, changes that have prevented any unemployment.
However, this was in no way a protectionist-type movement and the companies concerned have moved and relocated their factories outside Europe and are now creating jobs outside and inside Europe.
It was therefore an interesting movement.
However, despite this, it appears that during 2007 no new cases were initiated by the Commission.
Therefore, what I want to ask you is this: was the Commission's intention in not initiating any cases (not Portuguese, but from other countries), in not initiating any anti-dumping or anti-subsidy investigations, to wait for a decision on the review process in hand or was its intention to shelve those cases which it had already started to investigate?
That is my question to you.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am afraid I did not catch the interpretation of all of the last question that was put to me.
I got just the last fragment, which seemed to suggest that we had suspended the operation of the trade defence instruments and that we were no longer initiating or pursuing cases.
I do not quite understand the premise of the question, because any examination of DG Trade's website will be able to yield the information that the Member wants about cases that are currently being initiated and investigated and on which proposals will be brought forward in the ordinary way.
I do not complain about being accused of being unduly ambitious - that is the benchmark for what I do and how I set about my job.
If a Commissioner lacks ambition, then he or she is going to be judged, I think, by pretty low standards.
I am, however, not sufficiently ambitious to embrace straight away my friend Mr Schlyter's proposal of moving from my inability to propose consensual reforms of trade defence instruments against the low cost of production dumping to a new concept of organic or ecological dumping.
I think we will continue to concentrate on the former before we shift our focus to the latter, but I hope he does not take that as a sign of any lack of ambition on my part, only great realism.
Mr Caspary seemed to suggest that he was disappointed that proposals were not being brought forward.
Well, I can understand his disappointment, but I am really not sure that even this Parliament would have shown any greater ability to arrive at a simple consensual view about what reform should take place than the Member States have been able to achieve.
Mr Arif has suggested that my motivation is to play off consumers against workers and to play off importers against producers.
I am not playing anyone off against anyone - it is just that, in the real world, people do have different interests, and they have different viewpoints and different needs.
We do not yet live, I am afraid, in an ideal socialist society, where no one has a different view, no one has a different need and no one has a different interest.
I am afraid that we have to operate in the real world and we have to navigate our way through these interests and needs and arrive at a fair and equitable and acceptable outcome in our attempts to steer these policies forward.
I thought that Ms Mann's understanding of the dilemmas that we face in this policy area was very realistic.
It is not that I was seeking greater flexibility per se.
What I was seeking to do, in approaching this review, was to arrive at a set of trade instruments that were not fundamentally different or changed from those that we have at the moment, but that operated within a framework that was clearly understood, that were clearly predictable and clearly reasonable and balanced in their impact on the range of different businesses, which are trading in increasingly different circumstances in the global economy in the 21st century.
And I make no apology for doing that.
I would just say in conclusion, really in response to Mr Markov: yes it is probably an accurate summing-up that the system of trade defence that we have is not the best, but it is the one we have got.
I think that is a fair description of our system.
The questions that I had to put and that remain to be answered were not whether our system is the best - it probably is not, but it is, nonetheless, the one we have got and it is in reasonable working order.
I had to ask, will it remain workable, in the way that it is now, in the future?
Will it become increasingly controversial and contested amongst European businesses in the future?
Will it fit the changing production models and supply chains of increasing numbers of European businesses that are becoming far more internationalised and that will continue to do so more than ever before?
Those are the questions that I put.
They have not yet been satisfactorily answered, but answers, I think, will remain to be found and we need to continue seeking them.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Article 142)
in writing. - It is ten years since the trade defence instuments were revised.
They need modernising to ensure that they remain relevant to the global commercial enivoronment in which EU business operates.
Open markets benefit everyone and should be our goal, but it is true that trade defence action remains necessary to protect us from unfair trade.
However, in deciding what is unfair trade we must also take into account a wider Community interest than the present rules allow and we must avoid damage to European countries that set up global supply chains.
We must also make sure that the interests of millions of consumers are weighed carefully against the sometimes narrow interests of a few producers.
I hope the Commission will soon find the political environment suitable for it to bring back proposals for reforming our trade defence instruments.

Accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products - Common framework for the marketing of products - Application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State - Safety marking on consumer products (debate)
(FR) The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
report by AndrÃ© Brie, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products - C6-0068/2007 -,
report by Christel Schaldemose, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on a common framework for the marketing of products - C6-0067/2007 -
and the report by Alexander Stubb, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State and repealing Decision 3052/95/CE - C6-0065/2007 -,
as well as the following oral question:
oral question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, concerning safety marking on consumer products - B6-0009/2008).
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, representatives of the Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, the subject matter and legal intricacies of the Regulation on accreditation and market surveillance are complex, and it has all the appearances of a very dry and largely technical instrument.
There can be no doubt, however, that it has highly significant political implications for consumers and for the European economy as a whole.
The problems which prompted the Commission to draft its proposal and which underlie the numerous amendments and decisions adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in the course of its debates are plain for all to see.
I shall confine my remarks to three specific issues.
Firstly, accreditation has not hitherto been regulated on a European scale, although it is practised in most Member States and significantly affects the performance of market-surveillance authorities.
Given the internal market and free movement of goods in the EU, it is extremely important to consumers that the evident differences in the quality and effectiveness of market-surveillance authorities should be harmonised upwards by means of European rules governing accreditation bodies.
To this end, the European Parliament has gone beyond the Commission proposal with a view to imposing distinctly more stringent obligations on these bodies and on the Member States.
The Regulation clearly prohibits the commercialisation of accreditation bodies, stipulates that they must operate on a non-profit basis and must not compete with other bodies and enshrines their independence and their status as public authorities.
Secondly, although the safety and protection of consumers and the environment are regulated by numerous European guidelines and other binding standards, last year's case involving the US toy manufacturer Martell, and not only that case, showed that current practice is unsatisfactory in many instances and, moreover, that there are wide divergences in the enforcement of the rules at Europe's borders and within the European market, surveillance in some cases being inadequate.
There is, of course, a need for changes and improvements to individual directives, such as the Toy Safety Directive.
The main objective of the Commission in its proposal for a regulation, however, was to improve, strengthen and harmonise the system of market surveillance.
The European Parliament not only shared this position but also developed many aspects of it, substantially fleshing out and tightening the obligations on Member States and market-surveillance authorities, including the requirements relating to cooperation with customs authorities.
In our view, that also implied a strict disclosure obligation for the authorities and provisions on public freedom of information.
I am pleased that the Council and the Commission have responded to this concern of Parliament.
Thirdly, I personally believe that Parliament's greatest success and the most significant improvement we have achieved has been the inclusion of consumer goods.
The advantages of this Regulation, which lie in its strictly binding nature, can be combined with the advantages of the General Product Safety Directive, which include highly detailed consumer-protection measures, albeit with minimal binding force.
This was the most difficult area of our discussions and negotiations with the Commission and the Council in both legal and technical terms.
The fruitful outcome was undoubtedly due to the fact that, although the three institutions favoured different approaches, they agreed on the aims of greater protection of consumers and more effective market surveillance.
For this reason I would also like to thank Commissioners Kuneva and Verheugen, the Commission staff and our negotiating partners from the German and Portuguese Presidencies and particularly from the Slovenian Presidency for their intensive, constructive and considerate cooperation.
May I also take this opportunity to record my gratitude to the late Michel Ayral, who was involved in organising most of this cooperation, which makes his recent death an even greater loss for us all.
I can endorse the view of the Presidency that the outcome could scarcely have been achieved by now without the overarching cooperation of the three most recent incumbents of the Presidency.
The legal basis for consumer health and safety, for protection of the environment and for appropriate product quality has been significantly reinforced by this Regulation.
It is up to the Member States and the Commission now to take the opportunities it offers to achieve tangible improvements for consumers.
Let me also express my special thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, Christel Schaldemose und Alexander Stubb, for their exemplary cooperation in the preparation of this package.
Rapporteur. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you all for the fantastic collaboration we have had in connection with the work on this package.
It has been exciting in many ways.
As the shadow rapporteurs know, this has been my first report during my time in Parliament and it has been a good learning experience.
It has also been very challenging to work on three reports and therefore also with other rapporteurs.
It has been exciting!
The fact that we have had three reports that have overlapped in certain areas has ultimately benefited our work, as we now have a coherent piece of legislation for the internal market, which will strengthen this market.
There is considerable discussion concerning better legislation, and although the Commission has undoubtedly scratched its head at times during our negotiations, I would nevertheless venture to say that our work here is an example of a good process.
We have all worked together very effectively and achieved a good result from this.
We have, on the other hand, also had very many meetings to reach this point.
I would like to highlight three things that we have campaigned for from Parliament's side in connection with this framework for the marketing of products; three things that we have worked through and that are important in enabling us now to support the compromise we have reached and be quite satisfied with it.
Firstly, I think that it has been a great victory for consumers that we have strengthened the requirements imposed on enterprises throughout the supply chain.
Everyone who comes into contact with a product will be responsible for ensuring that that product is safe and meets EU requirements.
This applies equally to the manufacturer in China, the importer in Cologne or the distributor in Copenhagen.
This also means quite specifically that an importer will no longer be able to claim that he is not responsible if a product that is imported proves to be dangerous or does not meet EU regulations in general.
Secondly, right at the finishing line we have agreed on how to reinforce the CE marking.
It has been clear right from our very first debate in committee that it has been somewhat difficult to determine how we can solve this problem.
What is the marking exactly?
How can we reinforce controls?
Is it really a credible guarantee for safety at all?
The solution we have arrived at allows us to retain and reinforce the CE marking.
In future Member States will prosecute companies and producers that misuse the CE marking.
At the same time, we will also have strengthened market control, not least as a result of Mr Brie's report.
Overall, this means that we as consumers will in future be able to have much greater confidence in the products that carry the marking.
However - and this is the third point - in the proposal we have also committed the Commission to follow up the functioning of the marking.
The CE marking is not necessarily the solution to all our safety problems within the internal market.
The marking is aimed primarily at organisations and authorities concerned with market surveillance.
Therefore, through this decision we have requested that the Commission carry out an investigation into how the market operates and undertake a thorough assessment of consumer safety markings in general.
The Commission is in the process of carrying out this work and we are very eagerly awaiting the results.
This decision is not legislative in a legal sense, but it does contain a clear political obligation, which will mean that future product legislation will be based on the framework that we have created through the decision.
In concrete terms, this means that when we begin work on the Toy Directive, we will take these definitions and these provisions concerning enterprises and incorporate them in the Toy Directive.
This means that we will actually have a much safer internal market.
I am entirely certain that through this we will improve safety levels within the internal market for the benefit of consumers, and also for the benefit of enterprises.
Thank you to everyone for your collaboration and especially to Mr Stubb and Mr Brie.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I have four minutes, so I would like to make four points.
My first point is not that it is Malcolm Harbour's birthday, but it is, so we should congratulate him.
The first point is a vote of thanks because, where a legislative package such as this one is concerned, there is no way one can push it through alone.
So my first thanks go to Mr Brie and Ms Schaldemose, whom I would almost call my co-rapporteurs.
Working with you has been a lot of fun.
This was a first legislative package for me as well, and has shown that things can work quite well.
I would also like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, especially Ms De Vits, Ms RÃŒhle and Mr Manders.
Working with you has also been a lot of fun.
Then I would like to thank the three Presidencies that have been involved.
The first was Frank Wetzel and the German Presidency.
They did an excellent job.
The second was Fernanda and the Portuguese Presidency.
They too did a fantastic job and then, thirdly, the Slovenians have shown why new Presidencies and small country Presidencies are so fantastic.
You did a great job as well, so thank you very much, Vinka.
I would especially like to thank the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen and Simon Mordue, on the political side, and then on the floor, so to speak, I would like to thank Hans, Liliana and especially Mr Ayral, to whom AndrÃ© has already referred.
Unfortunately, Mr Ayral passed away rather suddenly.
If I had a choice I would call this the Ayral package in tribute to his work, because he was a fantastic European civil servant, of the type we need.
My final thanks go to Luca from the Legal Service, to Patricia from the Secretariat and especially to my assistant Tuomas, who has worked so hard that he has a knee injury.
In other words, his left knee does not mutually recognise his right any more and he is not able to be here today.
He has been the soul behind this whole package.
My second point is to ask what the background is to mutual recognition.
To put it simply, we had the Cassis de Dijon decision in 1979.
Since then we have had 300 court cases to show that mutual recognition does not work.
Seventy-five per cent of goods are harmonised, and twenty-five percent are not.
The harmonised proportion amounts to EUR 1 500 billion, or in other words EUR 1.5 trillion, and the non-harmonised proportion to EUR 500 billion.
Of that EUR 500 billion, there are problems relating to EUR 150 billion.
The Commission tells us that, if mutual recognition worked, our GDP would go up by 1.8%.
The Commission brought forward a good proposal.
Unfortunately, the Member States tried to water it down, but fortunately we in the European Parliament protected the interests of the internal market and pushed through an ambitious package.
The third point is to ask what we did.
What were the procedural matters that we changed?
To put it in simple terms, until now it took a small, medium-sized or large company two to three years to fight a case on mutual recognition in court.
That is not really necessary any more, because we have shifted the burden of proof to the Member States.
Basically, in a procedure lasting 20 to 60 days, the Member State has to provide - and I stress the word - evidence that a particular rule does not apply in another Member State.
So we have shifted the burden of proof.
What I want to say to all small and medium-sized businesses in Europe is that there is no need ever again to fill in a form to apply to enter the market of another country.
No, the goods move freely.
Call us, call me, if you have a problem.
You should not be having to apply.
The fourth and final point I wanted to make is about practical cases, and the areas to which this applies.
The answer is bicycles, scaffolding, fire alarms, bread and plant-based products, and so forth. The principle of mutual recognition applies to a huge market.
So my final point, having said my thanks and given a background to procedural changes and practical cases, is that European firms should never again have to let a product be prevented from entering another country's market.
(Applause)
As entertaining as ever, Mr Stubb!
