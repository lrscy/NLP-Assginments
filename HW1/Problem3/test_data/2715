We often talk in this House of our desire to promote European films, but many are thinking only of their own national film industry and not of their neighbour's, whose films, European films, are not seen in neighbouring regions often enough.
The Commission and the Council as well, must, as a matter of urgency, at last produce a plan to make the European film industry competitive.
This is also a sector in which there is money to be made, as the Americans show us.
Perhaps the powers-that-be will eventually wake up and do more here.
The central deficits are in the distribution and marketing of our films and, of course, the industry is chronically undercapitalised.
I am therefore very glad that we, Parliament, Commission and Council together, have, in the Media-Plus programme above all, got to grips with the twin areas of marketing and distribution and are endeavouring to give help.
I am, of course, also glad that, at the Commissioner's suggestion, the European Investment Bank is also willing to do something about this by making risk capital available for the realisation of audiovisual projects.
I believe, then, that we have given a lot of things a push in this area, but can do still more.
I also find it a good thing that we are achieving tax breaks at the level of the Member States, and that we can do something to enable filmmakers from one country to get resources and help from another.
That, then, is possible.
I think this could also be used in the framework of the i2i initiative to promote investment in the infrastructure of independent cinemas, as we propose in this report.
I believe that the extension of cinemas in economically weaker regions in the framework of the European Structural Fund can be helpful.
There is a lot more that I could say.
I am not entirely in agreement with item 7, in which the call is made for television broadcasters to be obliged to reserve a certain proportion of transmission time for foreign films.
That, of course, meets with great resistance from the broadcasters.
We will discuss that when examining the 'Television without Frontiers' directive and will perhaps find a way through.
Again, congratulations!
Mr President, I have to admit that I envy Mr Vander Taelen; not only does his report contain very meaningful conclusions, thanks to his remarkable knowledge of the film industry, but he also has tremendous vision and has tabled very specific proposals as to what we should do, what policy we should apply in connection with European films.
I think that this is an exemplary report in which the economy and culture are perceived in a highly coherent manner, to the benefit of both.
The committee naturally agreed that European films are an educational and cultural vehicle and have a huge impact on the social and aesthetic values of the European public.
I see it as a noble industry which has nourished generations of cinema goers and to which we have no hesitation in entrusting our children so that they can learn about the past and acquire a penetrating and analytical perception of the society in which we live and intuition about what will happen in the future.
We love European films; we each of us in our own countries love the national films which have marked out our lives, but we all agree that American films are stealing the show.
Consequently, we need to bring about a reversal, to ensure that European films take the place they deserve, and this will only happen if we implement a series of measures, as proposed in the report, all of which, I think, are essential if we really want European films to live up to our expectations in the next decade.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank Mr Vander Taelen for his sterling report.
I fully subscribe to his view that it is sheer madness to think that we produce excellent films in Europe, while only 22% of those end up in cinemas, not to mention the percentage of non-national films that are being shown in the Member States, despite the fact that for people of all ages, film is the ideal medium to get to know each other' s culture.
Why is it that European film attracts such a small audience, while the cinema-viewing public is on the increase?
It seems appropriate to me to commission the European Audiovisual Observatory to carry out an in-depth study into the motives of the film public and its film choices.
Based on this, it would then be possible to use a programme such as Media Plus to support the distribution of the European film in a more focused and effective manner.
In addition, the other media play an important role in the promotion of European film, of course.
Radio and television may devote attention to it, but television in particular could do so in a more structured way by means of a fixed amount, or quota, in other words, of transmission time.
An alternative example might be specific European channels which specialise in one particular field, for example, a pan-European children' s channel which broadcasts high-quality European children' s programmes and children' s films.
Unfortunately, I am not of the same mind as Mr Vander Taelen when he states that it should be compulsory for TV channels to invest a proportion of their turnover in the film industry.
As a Liberal, and also on behalf of my group, that is excessive intervention from the powers that be.
As has been stated before, it seems to me that the European Investment Bank has a role to play in this.
One of the areas in which investments must be made is e-cinema.
Among other things, it will enable producers to make different language versions of their films in a more straight-forward manner, which will certainly benefit children' s films, for example.
After all, although we insist on a sound command of languages here in this House, the supply of adapted language versions would be another excellent way for the citizens of a Member State to get to know the culture of their European fellow citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that the report by Mr Vander Taelen has come just when it is needed.
It reminds me of when we arrived in Parliament two and a half years ago.
I realised that, in the space of two and a half years, by the autumn of 2001, we have gained the commitment of the European Investment Bank, the balance proposed by the Commission for state aid, the recognition of state aid, and now the report by Mr Vander Taelen is telling us that we must circulate films.
That is what I mean when I say it has come just when it is needed.
It has come just at the right moment to give great support to the audiovisual industry and to the cinema tradition, which we must highlight and which I see as a new development.
I would like us to get to grips with this, because we speak a great deal about cultural diversity, but tell me, please, what is cultural diversity if you do not circulate works?
If cultural diversity means to strengthen each specific characteristic within another specific characteristic, we will not gain anything in terms of diversity, in the way that we want to here in Europe.
It is therefore essential and necessary to circulate films.
In order to illustrate how important this is, I would first of all like to thank Mr Vander Taelen, and also to express my regret that one of his amendments, and not everyone agrees on this, since it was not reviewed by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, that one of his amendments, proposing that coercive measures be used to ensure the circulation of films, was not adopted.
We therefore reached an agreement on undertaking a feasibility study into this circulation. That is all very well, it sounds good.
I regret that we did not choose a better way.
And I would like to stress two other aspects of this report.
Firstly, in today' s Europe, we like to say that we have European works.
That is wonderful.
We have criteria to define European works, in terms of production, but we now know that it is film heritage which will also define and which defines European works.
I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur has highlighted the issue of building up our heritage.
We know that the Commission hopes to give us a European Cinematic Heritage Foundation.
We also know that the Council of Europe recently stressed the importance of building up our heritage.
We know very well that this cannot merely be achieved by conserving European films, but, as several of my fellow Members have already said, this comes from providing education on the diversity of European works and on what European works represent for future generations.
I therefore attach great importance to the issue of heritage.
To sum up, I would like to stress one important point, that of new technologies.
New technologies are instruments for the circulation of many things, such as information, knowledge, and cinema.
New technologies have their own linguistic facilities which could be of valuable help in circulating European films.
I shall therefore stress the opportunities that this report could provide in this area.
I have emphasised this issue in my report on the Sixth Framework Programme that we will be voting on in a few days.
However, I believe that new technologies, research into new technologies and digitalisation are all important.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work.
This document gives a clear picture of the difficulties European cinema has been striving painfully to overcome for many years now.
I would like to focus briefly on two of the many points contained in the motion for a resolution which caught my attention.
Firstly, I fully support the call for the funds made available to the film-making industry to be increased.
In effect, considering that the cinema has become an important part of our cultural heritage - cinemas have been more popular than bookshops for many years now in Europe - and given the high potential for employment in this sector, there is no doubt that greater Community financial aid would facilitate its development.
And this is precisely one of the problematic areas.
Without incentives and investment, there is no growth or impetus, and there is no quality either.
Europe has been overrun with film productions which are foreign to our cultural identity and often of dubious quality for too long now.
That is not to question the existence of the opportunity or rather the need for cinema to encourage awareness of diversities, of course, but I do feel that Europe needs to protect and encourage its own film heritage.
If, in addition, we consider the competition which came from television during the 1970s, it is not hard to see why hundreds, thousands of cinemas have been closed for so long.
Secondly, I fully support item 18, which refers explicitly to the restoration and protection of the European film heritage.
We do indeed need to encourage public institutions, local authorities and cultural associations to search for old and short films and to restore film material, thus ensuring that they are preserved and are available to the public.
There are very few film libraries in Europe which are worthy of that name and genuinely properly equipped and efficient.
They often suffer from miserly public contributions from the governments of the Member States.
Well then, the European Union cannot remain insensitive to this additional urgent need if we genuinely want to preserve the past heritage and guarantee the future of cinema.
Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
He sums up very clearly to what an extent the success of a product, film in this instance, is dependent on the promotion of sales through marketing and advertising.
When American production companies set aside 30% of their budgets for marketing, it is not to be wondered at that European products lose in direct competition for customers, when they themselves use only 3 to 6% of their budgets for this purpose.
It follows that European film producers must do more to market their products.
We, as taxpayers, are also entitled to demand that they do so.
One could envisage state support for follow-up projects being made dependent on the filmmakers' efforts at reaching their public.
More subsidies cannot be the solution on their own.
Too much money was spent in the past on films that never reached their public.
Austria spends over EUR 30 million per annum on promoting films.
Taking the number of cinema-goers into account, every ticket to see a film is subsidised to the tune of EUR 1 000.
State promotion of film cannot have this as its objective.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by thanking not only the rapporteur for this initiative, as all of you have done, but also the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has backed his initiative so strongly.
As you may know, the latest Europacinema conference began here in Strasbourg last weekend, and it is continuing through today and tomorrow.
The final panel discussion will be taking place in our rooms tomorrow.
There have been many discussions and many problems to resolve, such as: What is the problem, why is there no internal European market?
In discussing many specific problems, whether to do with nation-states or the subsidy issue, we came up against the same point over and over again, that the distribution system does not work.
We have a European internal market, but it is not accepted that this product, film, can really circulate.
It is at this hurdle that we fall.
Now as always, there is a national logic to film promotion, which also applies to a film's success: if it was not a box-office success at home, it will not be an international one either.
I have to agree with Mr Sichrovsky that an increase in subsidies would not help, but an increased subsidy from the country we both come from would help the market a bit.
It would be wrong to demand that producers should take greater risks.
There are no independent producers.
First, we must promote this market economically, we must engage in business development, so that this market can emerge at all.
Here, too, one of the demands the Culture Committee makes over and over again in many contexts would seem to be appropriate here.
We must endeavour to make business development, whether it originates from large or small enterprises, tax-deductible.
We will support this report not only for reasons of ideology, but also out of wholehearted conviction.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Vander Taelen for the excellent work he has done and for his constructive approach to this report.
Today, we find ourselves faced with a terrible paradox.
Europe produces more films than the United States, and these are often of a very high quality, but the market share of European films has never been this low before, it stands at 22%, whereas films from the United States take 73.7% of the European market.
Furthermore, European films secure only 26% of their box office takings from sources outside the country where they were produced.
These are just some observations.
This is a good report because it does not limit itself to providing an analysis of how things stand.
It tackles the very reasons why the European film industry is weak, namely, its capacity for development and distribution.
In order to render the European film industry more competitive, the rapporteur makes very specific proposals which, in my view, are excellent.
Of course, and I agree with him, we must urgently adopt an ambitious multiannual plan to improve the competitiveness of the European film industry and to strengthen the transnational distribution structures for European films.
We must develop research into digital film distribution and projection techniques; we must promote the creation of a European Heritage Foundation and perform a feasibility study of 'interconnecting' support funds of Member States so as to increase the sources of financing.
Of course, when revising the 'Television Without Frontiers' Directive, we must ensure that we include a requirement for television broadcasters to invest a certain amount in the European film industry, and the obligation to promote and broadcast European films.
This should also be an opportunity for Member States, which do not yet benefit from them, to consider the appropriate fiscal incentives.
I therefore hope that the Commission, as well as the Council, understand the challenges we are faced with, and that they take appropriate action.
Today, we are debating something that is not only a major challenge in terms of the economy, but also something that is an integral part of the European Union, in other words, culture, creation and identity.
That is why this is so urgent.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like the House to know how pleased I am that the Committee which I have the honour of chairing has unanimously, and rightly so, adopted the detailed, comprehensive report of the rapporteur, Mr Vander Taelen.
Without going back over aspects which have already been debated, I would point out here that the rapporteur has provided comprehensive proof, as I said before, that both a cultural problem and an organisational problem exist.
The problems are related.
I feel that the measure tabled by the committee and the decision the House makes tomorrow are so important as to warrant due reflection from the Commissioner and, indeed, a number of proposals and initiatives as well.
As we have said before and will continue to say, there needs to be a substantial cultural element in the integration of Europe, and films play a major, fundamental role in both informing people about cultural diversities and providing authenticity, allowing the message of cinema to be disseminated in all the States.
There is a need for more than just organisation.
That is important and, in my opinion, the report certainly raises basic issues which will lead us to greater organisation and investment than in the past.
What Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said just now is important.
If European film production increases, the number of distribution channels will have to increase too.
That is why the problems are related, and it is therefore our task, our responsibility, the responsibility of Parliament, especially, and of the Commission, in particular, and the Council, to achieve this.
There is nothing we can do to change the current structure of the industry.
When we debate television without frontiers, then we will be able to establish rights and clear guidelines; we will be able to require television companies to distribute, promote and commission European films, but it is imperative that, in cultural terms, we realise that we must make it quite clear that all the European countries must be able to benefit from films.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, Viviane Reding, was unable to join us for this debate because she is in Brussels at the Council meeting of sports ministers, but she asked me to pass on her thanks to Mr Vander Taelen for his excellent report.
This initiative shows that the European Parliament is fully aware of the strategic importance, both economic and cultural, of the European film industry, but also of what hampers the circulation of films and other audiovisual works in the internal market and candidate countries, as several Members have pointed out.
The European Commission, which fully supports the report' s objectives, welcomes its adoption.
The Commission is also pleased that our two institutions share the same viewpoint regarding the need to pursue an ambitious European policy in order to make the European audiovisual industry more competitive.
Several recent initiatives by the Commission in this area are proof of this common approach.
As you are more than aware, the recent Commission communication on certain legal aspects related to cinematographic and other audiovisual works that my colleague, Viviane Reding, presented to the Council on 5 November, tackles the issues of the circulation of E-cinema, the tax regime applied to the industry, the protection of European audiovisual heritage, the classification of works and other problems affecting the circulation of films and other audiovisual works.
The implementation of the measures set out in this communication, combined with the application of the MEDIA Plus programme (2001-2005) and the joint initiative undertaken by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, i2i Audiovisual, should help to significantly improve the situation of European films.
If I may, Mr President, I would like to come back to some points of the motion for a resolution which has been submitted to you.
With regard to the measures that are currently being undertaken, the second point of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to pursue a consistent Community policy on the film industry, particularly as regards the application of its competition policy.
The above-mentioned communication provides the film industry with increased legal certainty by specifying, as part of a constructive and positive approach, the criteria used by the Commission when assessing national support schemes for the film sector under the Treaty' s rules on State funding.
To date, all the national schemes reviewed on this basis have been accepted by the Commission.
Item 5 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, in implementing MEDIA Plus, to draw attention to the Europa Cinemas network of cinemas, and item 6 calls on the Commission to support the 'Shooting Stars' initiative of the organisation European Film Promotion.
These projects are undeniably of value and have received Community support for several years as part of the MEDIA programme.
However, it is important to point out that the actions under the MEDIA programme are subject to calls for proposals and to the principle of fair competition and project selection according to a transparent procedure.
Item 7 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission, when revising the directive, to investigate the desirability and feasibility of imposing new quotas on broadcasters.
The Commission has already launched, pursuant to Article 25(a) of the directive, an independent study to assess the impact of measures for promoting the production and distribution of European television programmes.
This study will also assess, more specifically, the effectiveness of quotas laid down under the directive, compared to other support measures.
Furthermore, at the beginning of 2002, the Commission will undertake a public consultation on this subject.
It will urge all the parties concerned to submit written comments.
The results of the various studies and of the public consultation will provide a significant contribution to the communication on the review of the directive and any proposals for amendments, which the Commission plans to submit to the Council and to the European Parliament towards the end of 2002.
Item 33 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to consider introducing specific European regulations in order to stimulate the development of the film industry in the candidate countries.
This central concern is taken into account as part of the external action of the European audiovisual policy under the heading of enlargement.
Candidate countries are therefore obliged to respect the 'acquis communautaire' where the audiovisual sector is concerned.
As you know, this mainly concerns the 'Television Without Frontiers' Directive.
In addition, they will be able to take part in the MEDIA programme as soon as they have reached a high degree of compatibility with the 'acquis communautaire' .
Furthermore, nine candidate countries were asked to take part in the MEDIA Plus programme.
The aim is for these countries to participate from the beginning of 2002.
Item 26 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Commission to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of 'interconnecting' the existing automatic support funds of the Member States and regions.
It must be reiterated that an assessment was already carried out in 1998 in Birmingham, by the 'Club des Producteurs EuropÃ©ens' .
The working group associated with the Commission came to the following conclusion: the proposed mechanism would, in practice, exclude many Member States who have no automatic support system for production.
As a result, the automatic support funds of the smaller countries would be drained by the more commercially successful countries, in other words, the main producing countries.
Item 27 of the motion for a resolution calls on the Committee to perform a feasibility study of the possibility of setting up a European Promotion Fund.
Council Decision No 2000/821/EC establishing the MEDIA Plus programme already, in its 'Promotion' section, lays down support for promotional activities in favour of European creation, in other words, approximately 8% of the budget.
Lastly, the Commission welcomes the amendment, which was tabled in plenary by the rapporteur, to set up an implementing agency.
The Commission will inform the rapporteur and Parliament about its proposal on this issue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the Commission' s comments on the report by Mr Vander Taelen, who I would again like to thank.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Protection of animals during transport
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0347/2001) by Mr Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission report on the experience acquired by Member States since the implementation of Council Directive 95/29/EC amending Directive 91/628/EEC concerning the protection of animals during transport.
Mr President, I should also like to welcome Commissioner Byrne, who could play a significant role in this field.
A great deal needs to be said about the implementation of Directive 95/29/EC and animal transport.
The lack of adequate supervision, carriers who are slapdash at times and abuse during the export of animals for slaughter outside the EU give rise to much commotion.
In addition, the unlimited transport of animals for slaughter by the EU has made a compelling contribution to the spread of animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth and swine fever.
It is striking that the effects of this are more or less entirely shouldered by the animal farmers.
Abuse during transport and the spreading of animal diseases directly impact on the image, and often the income, of animal farmers, while they are not to blame for these causes.
Consequently, anyone who wants to adopt a pro-active stance in the fight against animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth and swine fever, anyone who is concerned about the difficult position European animal farmers are already in, or anyone who cares about animal welfare, will not put up with a culture of tolerance and chaotic rules for animal transport.
The fact that Parliament has decided to present an initiative proposal to tighten these directives now sends a strong political signal to the Council and the Commission.
After all, next month, the Council will be holding a conference on the European vaccination policy, and in this report, an initial proposal is made for effective prevention of infectious diseases.
Additionally, the Commission will soon table proposals to tighten the rules for animal transport.
This report also reflects Parliament' s great displeasure at the implementation of existing legislation by the Member States and the Commission' s lack of opportunity to notify Member States.
This report mainly aims to identify the key conditions which sound legislation on animal transport must meet.
First of all, there is supervision.
The supervision of animal transport in the European Union must be tailored to European needs by taking the following measures. First of all, 15 EU inspectors should be appointed with the task of submitting annual reports to the Council, the Commission, but also the European Parliament, as well as the parliaments of the Member States.
Secondly, adequate regulations must be put in place for sanctions, both financial and in terms of licences.
The third point concerns the introduction of an adequate European licensing scheme for carriers of animals.
I should like to make the following observations with regard to transport times.
We propose to limit the duration of the transport of animals for slaughter and productive livestock to four hours, or 250 km, with a possible extension to eight hours, provided that the carrier is licensed and the animals can lie down and have a supply of fresh water.
As for animals intended for breeding and sporting purposes, we suggest a transport duration of two 24-hour legs by specialist carriers, provided that the animals have a supply of fresh water and feed.
With regard to possible exceptions, I should like to draw your attention to two problems.
The Commission may grant exemption for areas with few or no slaughterhouses by increasing the said distances and durations by up to 50%.
For small islands, but also for Ireland, and I wish to make a point of highlighting Ireland, transport by ship is subject to a separate arrangement.
Furthermore, the said regions are disproportionately hit by tightened European legislation on food safety, and I would therefore suggest earmarking structural funds for those regions to invest in small, semi-mobile slaughterhouses.
The export refunds for the export of live animals for slaughter should be stopped as soon as possible, but that is only possible if an international discussion is held about the transport of animals for slaughter and by adding this item to the agenda.
With regard to the amendments, I should like to comment as follows. Together with the Liberal Group and the Socialist Group, I have tabled three amendments to enhance the report' s practical implementability.
These concern Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6, which deal, among other things, with temperature, but also a number of other practical points.
I should like to express thanks to Mr Heinz Kindermann and Mr Neil Busk for their very constructive cooperation.
As far as I am concerned, the report could also have been referred to as the Maat-Busk-Kindermann report.
I assume that the Liberal Group will withdraw Amendment No 3 as it is identical to the joint amendment tabled by the PPE-DE, the PSE and the ELDR.
The policy of tolerance and the feel-good factor surrounding the transport of animals must be brought to a halt.
In the EU, literally millions of animals have been killed and destroyed in the last four years as a result of an explosive spreading of animal diseases including foot-and-mouth and swine fever.
Abuse during animal transport and the shocking images of this are an indictment of European culture of which caring about animals and the countryside form an essential part.
The sad truth is that in every single case, it is the animal farmer who ends up footing the bill at a time when meat prices are unacceptably low and consumer prices remain at an all-time high.
Commission and Council, it is time for action, time to choose in favour of the quality of our animals and our countryside.
Mr President, on behalf of the Environment Committee, I welcome Mr Maat's excellent report.
It does not go as far as the Environment Committee would have wished, particularly in relation to the duration of travel - the Environment Committee would have preferred four hours - however, if eight hours is complied with, it will be a really welcome advance in animal welfare.
This is the first realistic report on animal welfare, Mr Maat has done an excellent job and I congratulate him.
My group supports this report.
Although the report does not go far enough in relation to the eight hours, paragraph 1 is extremely important.
The maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for further fattening should be welcomed because animals were being transported long distances over long periods in completely unacceptable conditions.
Another important paragraph is paragraph 20, which calls for an end to the payment of export refunds on the export of live animals to third countries for slaughter.
This is long overdue.
The vast majority of European taxpayers are against the idea of their taxes being used to fund something that they fundamentally disagree with.
The onus is on the Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the rules.
The Commission must take very strong action against any Member States which do not comply.
They must be taken to court and fined.
In relation to the reduced need for long transport, it is extremely important to promote local abattoirs and also the trade in meat.
It makes much more economic sense to have a trade in meat than a trade in live animals, because jobs are then created within the EU.
The same applies to Ireland: it could make a lot more exporting meat than live animals.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by expressing my thanks to Mr Maat.
I think he has approached this subject in a very realistic way, many years of discussions on animal transport mean that, in my view, an emotional approach is no more use to us.
Nobody, when talking about animal transport, means the kitten in the hand luggage on an aircraft, and nobody mentions the little dog on a lead on the Intercity train and certainly not the racehorse in its specialised horsebox on the motorway.
No, in the Maat report we are discussing the well-being of animals on their way to be slaughtered.
Now, I have been in this House for a very long time, and so it is to the Commissioner that I am speaking when I say this: On paper, or so it seems to me, we have produced variations on this theme for years, and we have been constantly demanding more.
All the same, we are still repeatedly shocked by the often intolerable situations revealed in individual cases by the checks, which are far too few and far between.
Better transport conditions are wanted not only, indeed, by campaigners against cruelty to animals, but also by producers and consumers.
In reports and amendments, we demand expert staff, purpose-built vehicles with adequate space for the animals to lie down in, ventilation, supplies of food and water and, for animals for slaughter, journey times limited to a maximum of eight hours.
The proposal to end the payment of export refunds for live animals is one which I find quite crucial and also particularly deserving of support.
There are objections to this, amounting in the final analysis to this being an interference with the market.
Even Jewish ritual slaughter is brought into the argument.
I could smile a little at that, for even that is now possible in the EU.
It would be better to transport the meat afterwards.
Commissioner, I find that a person's weak spot is very often his or her wallet or purse.
More inspection, more controls, high penalties and loss of the licence where offences are found to have been committed, these would bring about more effective improvements for us all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on the Transport of Animals, which is under discussion this evening, has borne out what is repeatedly seen on television: the brutal way that animals are treated, the disregard of limits on journey times, the overloading of vehicles and many other breaches of current regulations on the transport of animals, none of which has been an infrequent occurrence.
This situation is no longer tolerable, and the European public is right to demand speedy measures to remedy it.
I must, though, say quite clearly that European regulations on the transport of animals, when correctly enforced, already guarantee a high degree of protection to animals.
As the Committee highlights in its report, the fundamental problem is that the regulations currently in force are applied only very inadequately in most of the Member States.
Quite apart from the difficulty of transposing the directive into national law, this is attributable above all to Member States' defective control procedures and the far too weak sanctions imposed when breaches are discovered.
Criticism arising out of these problems should therefore be directed mainly at the Member States.
In my opinion, the Community control policy needs a thorough re-think here, as comparable problems exist in other areas of veterinary control.
I would like, though, to enlarge on two further points.
The abolition of export refunds for animals for slaughter, contained in this resolution, was decided on by Parliament in the course of the 2002 Budget procedure and has long been demanded by Social Democrats.
In the past, Parliament has already given financially preferential treatment to meat as opposed to livestock for slaughter in paying export refunds, in order to remove the economic incentive from the export of live animals.
At present, then, only about one-half in export refund is paid for livestock in comparison with meat.
Even that, though, is not yet enough, and export refunds for animals for slaughter should be reduced to zero.
The other point I would like to make is that the proposal for a resolution calls for a maximum transport time of 8 hours for animals intended for slaughter, and that, too, is an old demand from the Social Democrats.
There is to be no general maximum journey time, and prime consideration was given to the situation of remote regions and islands.
Here, too, there will be limited exceptions to the rules on maximum journey time, which we greatly welcome.
In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of the Social Democrat Group, to thank Mr Maat for the constructive work we have done together, and I believe it will continue in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by thanking Mr Maat for his excellent cooperation in connection with this report.
Partly in conjunction with Mr Kindermann, we have prepared quite a few amendments, and this has, in my view, turned out to be an excellent report.
I should also like to thank the Commission which, without hiding anything, has clearly described how the Member States have implemented or, more to the point, failed at all to implement, the many decisions taken in 1991 and 1995.
It is really frightening to see how European ministers sit and take joint decisions about something as important as animal welfare and the transport of animals under satisfactory conditions. They then travel home and totally forget what they have been involved in deciding, that is to say they do not transpose any of these decisions into national legislation.
We could have well done without the huge number of hideous television pictures we have seen of animals suffering in a wide range of appalling situations.
Lorries have been opened, to reveal dead animals inside, with other animals trampling upon them.
That situation is simply unacceptable, and it must be brought to an end now.
It is therefore time to put a stop to our traditional practices of many years in the EU whereby animals are transported from north to south and from east to west.
There is no good reason for doing this.
Animals suffer as a result, and the call must now go out for animals to be slaughtered at the nearest abattoir.
Obviously, we are also obliged to transport animals for breeding purposes from areas which excel in producing such animals to areas which have a need for new animals of this kind.
I therefore look forward to the Commission' s now tabling proposals for common regulations governing the transport of animals, and I repeat: these must not be minimum regulations, but common regulations governing the transport of animals.
Mr President, I welcome this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work.
However, I would first of all like to highlight my concern that the current debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the failure of many Member States to implement existing Community legislation in this area.
The latest Commission report, together with numerous mission reports, has highlighted that there is a serious disregard of animal welfare in some countries.
The Commission must show a much greater willingness to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States which fail to enforce this directive properly.
With respect to journey times, I hope the Commission will follow the recommendations of their scientific advisory committees and propose workable limits that allow businesses to function effectively, whilst maintaining a high standard of animal welfare.
I will be supporting the 8-hour or 500-kilometre limit, and strongly support the view that the climate conditions of each Member State should also be taken into consideration.
However, in areas where these journey times are unrealistic, a temporary dispensation to the maximum 8-hour travelling time should be granted where there are no slaughterhouses within a radius of 500 kilometres.
I am thinking particularly, in the UK, of the islands of Western Scotland, and of other parts of the European Union that are affected adversely in that regard.
Although putting a limit on journey times is an important step forward, the treatment of animals en route, vehicle ventilation, overcrowding, and the definition of space and temperature requirements during transport etc. are equally important issues.
The recent foot-and-mouth crisis provided evidence enough that the unnecessary long-distance transport of animals was a factor in the quick spread of that disease.
I look forward to the Commission's policy plan scheduled for 1 January 2003 aimed at the regionalisation of meat production chains, so as to limit the long-distance transport of live animals in future.
Mr President, the report on the protection of animals during transport has evoked great public interest.
Various associations, but above all individual citizens, have watched attentively to see what steps, if any, Parliament will take to prohibit intolerable conditions in the transport of animals.
The report's concern is with the use of legislation to prevent animals in transit from being endangered or brought to a cruel demise.
Nothing, though, must be left to chance, but there must rather be firm negotiations when the report is elaborated.
Among the European rural model's special features, the expectations of society are a decisive element.
The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved.
An estimated 250 million farm animals a year are transported across the EU.
The people involved have for years vigorously disputed how necessary or pointless this is.
This basic regulation itself contains numerous practical and legal provisions on the transport of animals.
It is clear that national authorities do not act in the same way everywhere, which shows how weak the animal protection clause really is.
There is a lack of seriousness, transparency and honesty in this area.
If, for example, hares living wild in Poland are caught with nets and transported into the EU in containers that are torment to them, just so that people can shoot them for sport as a leisure pursuit, that has nothing to do with sport and even less with the protection of animals.
I would be happy if the Commissioner were able to say that it does not.
At this particular stage of negotiations on the enlargement of Europe, this incident bodes ill for well-regulated agronomy as the basis for protecting Europe's environment and species.
The report before us opts, in this sense, for cooperation rather than confrontation between agriculture and animal protection.
Mr President, animal transport has been put in a bad light by the many infringements which carriers have committed.
These infringements are an indication that, in addition to transport rules, additional attention must be devoted to supervising compliance with these rules.
In the past year, we have had to face yet another disastrous outcome of animal transport, namely the spread of animal diseases.
One now notorious incident of the transport of calves across different Member States cost the lives of 265 000 animals.
One of the conclusions we are drawing from the foot-and-mouth crisis is that agriculture must focus on the regionalisation of production and that the transport of live animals must come to an end.
With this in mind, I give my wholehearted support to the report by Mr Maat.
However, it is beyond me why in his amendments, he wishes to scrap the maximum and minimum temperature requirements inside the means of transport on the strength of the futile argument that everything is fine as long as the truck has mechanical ventilation.
Animal protection groupings will certainly find it difficult to accept this argument.
My amendments have the same objective as those by Mr Maat, except that mine still include the temperature requirements.
I support the call to end the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals for slaughter.
The evasion of European transport and slaughter rules by having animals slaughtered outside the Union under conditions which would be banned in Europe does injustice to the European farmers.
The Commission would like to encourage farmers to produce quality products.
Animal welfare forms an essential part of this quality which extends from farm to fork.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report on a Commission report on the implementation of the directive concerning the protection of animals during transport.
Commissioner, once more in this Parliament we are giving in to the temptation to tell the Commission exactly what it should be presenting us with, in great detail, in the next proposals for a directive they submit to us, to the extent that we are practically doing their job for them.
The rapporteur, Mr Maat, has done a great piece of work.
I trust that the Commission and the Council will take this into account.
Animals must be transported in conditions that are reasonably good; legislation should dictate standards to ensure that this is the case, and the authorities should verify compliance with these standards.
Having said this, I would like to share two thoughts with you: firstly, that conditions should be the same for both long- and short-distance transportation.
We should not demonise the long-distance transportation of animals, because that would lead to distorted competition in the internal market.
And secondly, transportation conditions should also be the same for all animals that are transported, in cases where animals are being taken to the abattoir as in cases where animals are transported to be reared close to, or far away from, their place of birth, or in order to take part in a competition.
These issues are not raised in the report, and I, Commissioner, would personally like to see them included in the next Commission proposals.
On the other hand, I would like to applaud and thank the rapporteur, who put forward an amendment on behalf of my group to delete the references made to temperatures, for it makes no sense to talk about temperatures without also referring to the corresponding relative humidity.
Additionally, from Lapland to the Canary Islands, Europe is a very large continent with a very diverse climate, population density and socio-economic conditions.
Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the importance of transportation in the propagation of epizootic diseases.
This is never related to the length of the journey, but we should be absolutely rigid with regard to standards and compliance with them.
For example, the classical swine fever we had in Spain in 1997 was caused by piglets travelling from Holland.
This can and should be avoided.
Mr President, Mr Maat' s report is excellent and summarises the legitimate and powerful criticism that has to be directed, in the first place, against the Council of Ministers and the Member States.
It is disgraceful that those of us in a civilised and cultivated part of the world, calling itself Europe, should treat animals in the way we do.
Moreover, no one can convince me that it is economically necessary.
Presumably, it is economic madness.
I want first of all to deal with Paragraph 14.
Anyone who drives when drunk loses his driving licence immediately.
How can a driver arrive with a load including dead animals and yet retain both his driving licence and his licence to transport animals?
That is absurd!
Paragraph 20 is about ending the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals.
That is a first small step able, in actual fact, to be taken by the EU.
Mr President, Mr Maat's report is an important tool for thinking globally and acting more locally in agricultural and environmental policy.
Your report, Mr Maat, deserves our full support, as it does not make any compromises to the detriment of animal welfare and again emphatically brings to the light of day deficiencies which have long been well known.
There are particular expectations of the report since the vote in plenary which cut the budget for the export refund regulation.
The agreement with which this met naturally gives grounds for hope that the Maat report will be adopted as a whole, especially as it has made past misdemeanours in animal transport policy particularly apparent.
There are a number of points I would like to make, but time is too short.
Let me perhaps just say in conclusion that checks and supervision must be improved, and the amounts levied in fines must be harmonised and raised to a level that will act as a deterrent for transport businesses.
The same should apply to sanctions imposed on Member States.
We are all acquainted with the problems, the European public is right to be sharply critical of the European institutions and of the fifteen governments.
This report is to be highly valued also from the point of view of enlargement.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, it is high time that action were taken.
Mr President, it is probably indisputable that Europe-wide public opinion is demanding an immediate end to the animal cruelty associated with the transportation of live animals.
The EU has the means to reduce these problems, but lacks the political will to do so.
There exist directives whose purpose is to improve the conditions of animals during the time of transportation.
There is, however, no control over the implementation of these.
Mr Maat's report recognises this situation; it states that the directives issued on transportation are being violated.
It sees problems which arise from the different driving and resting times which apply to the drivers and to the animals being transported.
It pays particular attention to the export of live animals to countries outside the EU, which, of course, always involves the longest journey.
It reminds us that such transportations are a cause of the explosive spread of infectious animal diseases.
The most radical demand is that the Commission is being required to end payments of export aid with regard to animals being transported for slaughter, as from the start of next year.
The Commission must respond to these requirements (which will form the opinion of Parliament) in such a way that the ethical/moral demands of the civilised world regarding respect for life will, in the EU, also be met in the case of animals destined for slaughter.
Mr President, Ireland is committed to working with all Member States and international bodies to achieve higher standards in animal welfare.
Due to our peripheral location and our island status, as Mr Maat has recognised - for which I thank him - we have no realistic alternative to exporting our live cattle by boat, and we need to find export markets for nine out of the ten animals produced on our farms.
While I fully support the general principle of slaughtering animals as close as possible to the point of production, the reality is that many of the export markets available to us demand live animals rather than the processed products and for the foreseeable future the proper functioning of our market will require a balance between the dead meat and the live meat trade.
Regulation 615/98 links all payments of export refunds to compliance with strict animal welfare standards during transport, including full clinical examination of every animal.
We must police and enforce this fully.
The live export incident involving Germany and the Lebanon this summer resulted from the inexperience of the German authorities, as they are infrequent exporters of live animals and had no prior veterinary agreement with the Lebanese.
Hard cases make bad law.
I do not agree with the German agricultural minister's view that export refunds on live cattle can now no longer be justified.
If Europe does not fulfil the requirements of third countries, they will get their supplies from far further afield, with little or no controls and regulation from an animal welfare point of view since there are still no internationally agreed standards on transport.
We have to have the highest possible standards not just in the interest of the animals but also of the producers, who will get a far better price for healthy unstressed animals.
It is true that we must continue to review our standards of protection of animals during transport and each Member State must be willing to police and enforce the law.
However, with over a million tonnes of surplus beef in the EU, export refunds will be required for some time to come and I will not be supporting any proposal to remove them.
Mr President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that cruelty to animals must be stopped.
This already forms the specific ethical basis of European agricultural production.
The Commission must have adequate powers to intervene in the activities of Member States; penalties must be sufficiently severe; and executive measures to correct these matters definitely need to be intensified.
I would like to thank Mr Maat, the rapporteur, for taking the exceptions into consideration.
There exist such things as sparsely populated areas, islands, and long distances, and these areas too must be able to function; in this report they have been taken into consideration in a balanced and even-handed way.
Animal welfare forms part of a greater whole.
The regionalisation of production chains has been the topic of the day and a theme for the future, and it is against this specific background that the aid for transportation of animals for slaughter must be ended.
This will further regionalisation, and the implementation and development of regional chains.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are handling the subject of 'Protection of animals during transport' .
This is a long-running issue, and I unreservedly support the report Mr Maat has presented.
We all know that there are already several directives on this in the European Union, and legislation to transpose it in the Member States.
We are all in favour of comprehensive animal protection and opposed to methods of transport which inflict needless suffering, particularly on animals destined for slaughter.
Were all these positive laws to be transposed and followed up everywhere, this debate would not be necessary.
That is, however, not the case.
Pictures of unacceptable transport conditions provide repeated evidence of this.
We should, though, not lose sight of the fact that there are a few good things to report on this area.
There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection.
The idea of slaughter in the immediate vicinity of the place of origin is also widely being put into practice.
Slaughter as close to the farm as possible is something I greatly support.
Modern methods of preservation make the export of meat even to distant areas thoroughly feasible.
We are right to demand feeding and watering breaks during the transportation of animals.
We will also have to give future consideration to how to minimise stress to the animals when being unloaded or reloaded before and after these breaks.
We could certainly aim to have the vehicles transporting animals to slaughter equipped in such a way that the animals could remain on board the vehicle during short breaks and be provided for there.
Transport, space, the way in which the vehicles are driven, ventilated and heated, loading and unloading procedures have, if they are made suitable, the greatest effect on improving the protection of animals.
This report makes its contribution to that and I ask for it to be supported across this House.
Mr President, during animal transport, animals are merely considered commodities and not living creatures with an intrinsic value.
The Member States should hang their heads in shame for the fact that the supervision of compliance with legislation is so deficient.
I therefore welcome the proposals to step up the supervisory procedures considerably and to tighten the sanctions.
Furthermore, a general time and distance limit should be imposed and far stricter requirements should be prescribed for all trucks.
Improved facilities should not be an alibi for extending driving times under the guise that it is acceptable for transport in 'business class' to take longer.
The use of 'business class' is quite ludicrous considering the sixth-rate treatment animals still receive before they are killed.
Live animals should only have to endure very short spells of transport.
Eight hours is indeed an improvement, but four hours should, in fact, be the absolute maximum.
We must move towards regionalisation of the production chain with small, clean slaughterhouses.
The recent foot-and-mouth crisis has illustrated once again that the stopping and collection places entail irresponsible animal-health risks, and these must therefore be abolished.
Reforms need to be carried out promptly with a view to enlargement.
Across Europe, animals should no longer simply be viewed as objects which are financially lucrative instead of as part of creation.
Mr Maat, many thanks for the sound report.
Mr President, it is a rare occurrence but, this time, I am forced to speak on behalf of my nation.
In fact, the entire Italian beef industry is extremely concerned by the proposal, and not just because of the maximum limits it imposes on travelling time.
Of even more concern to us is the fact that the proposal stipulates that animals for further fattening, which is a completely natural stage of the livestock rearing process, should be subject to the more restrictive measures laid down for animals for slaughter instead of the less restrictive measures laid down for breeding animals, even though the further fattening stage is a natural continuation of the livestock rearing process lasting a few months.
We fully understand the report' s objective, which is to replace the transportation of live animals with that of dead meat as far as possible.
However, our situation is quite out of the ordinary, involving 120 thousand farms and a flourishing processing industry with business activities ranging from slaughter to packing, which would be greatly compromised by such a measure.
Here are some statistics, Mr President, Commissioner: France has a cattle stock of over 20 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 5 million head; Italy has a cattle stock of 7 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 4.5 million head.
Clearly, this consolidated production cycle, which is vital for the economy of our country' s livestock sector, would be completely disrupted by the introduction of a maximum journey time or distance limit. Moreover, there are no scientific grounds for such a limit and it would serve purely exploitative purposes and have consequences which, as I said, would be extremely difficult for the sector as a whole to bear.
It can be seen from this that the sole motive behind any proposal to place an absolute limit on travelling time is actually other countries' desire to strip Italy of a substantial part of its slaughter trade and to take the place of our producers in supplying beef and veal to the Italian market.
This is not the kind of Europe we want!
Mr President, I am pleased to outline to you the Commission's position on Mr Maat' s excellent report.
The subject matter of this report is animal welfare and animal transport in particular.
We all know that this is a very sensitive issue.
I made clear when I presented the original Commission proposal that the views of the Council and Parliament would help shape the proposals which I intend to present early next year.
The report under discussion here today shares most of the objectives of the Commission.
However, there is one key building block missing in the construction of the Commission' s final proposals and that is the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which is expected shortly.
This opinion will provide the Commission with the necessary scientific advice on key issues such as travelling times and loading densities.
On such issues, our actions must be guided by good scientific advice on animal transport conditions.
Let me nonetheless indicate some general impressions on some of the key issues raised in your report.
First of all on travelling time, I was very glad to note that some of the more extreme suggestions, such as a four-hour limit on animal transport, have not been supported in Mr Maat' s report.
The consistent advice to the Commission is that the stress and risk to animals in transport arises primarily from three factors: travelling time, loading and unloading of animals and the conditions in which they are transported - ventilation, humidity, density and so on.
The Commission has already presented proposals for improvements in these areas or will be presenting them shortly.
However there is too much emphasis in some quarters on travelling time.
I consider that a reduction to four hours is simplistic and takes no account of the wider interests involved.
We cannot ignore the interests of the farmers and the meat and livestock industry.
Such a reduction would be viewed as an attack on their livelihoods rather than a genuine contribution to animal welfare.
If we wish to retain their support for improved animal welfare then we must also respect their interests.
I wish to work with them rather than against them and hope that you share this view.
I would now like to turn to the issue of resources.
Your report calls for the number of inspectors in the Food and Veterinary Office engaged on animal welfare to be increased to fourteen, compared with the current figure of four.
The reality is that such an increase could only be achieved at the expense of other priorities, including BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, meat hygiene, residue levels and food safety generally, where the Commission is already over-stretched.
I have consistently refused to make promises on which I cannot deliver.
It would be dishonest to do so, both to this House and to the European public.
You stress the lack of enforcement of the current legislation in Member States.
I fully agree.
Member States must make the effort and provide the resources to ensure better implementation.
It is a point which I have made repeatedly to the Member States in the Agriculture Council.
Judging from the correspondence I receive from Members of Parliament, the best way to achieve better enforcement is through legal proceedings against the Member States.
However it should be pointed out that sometimes it is more effective to work with Member States than against them, so proceedings should be the last resort.
They are, after all, responsible for the on-the-ground implementation of Community legislation.
But let me be clear: where efforts to find solutions through dialogue do not succeed, the Commission will initiate infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned.
In fact, proceedings are under way against several Member States and are under consideration for several more.
Finally, in this respect, I would call on the House to assist the Commission' s efforts in encouraging Member States to take animal welfare more seriously.
In particular I would call on Members to remind your political colleagues in your own Member States of the need to put more efforts and resources into ensuring that the Community provisions on animal welfare are complied with.
Mr Maat, ladies and gentlemen, I will be returning to you shortly with the Commission' s formal proposals.
This will provide you with the opportunity to shape the hard legislation on animal welfare.
I can assure you that Mr Maat' s report will be a major influence on this legislation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
The next item is the vote on requests for urgent procedure pursuant to Rule 112.
Proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Maroc [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163 (CNS)]
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last night the Committee on Fisheries approved the report by our colleague, Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on the restructuring of the Community fisheries sector affected by the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
I would like to say to the House that this report is restricted to regulating the technical aspects relating to the social measures aimed at the many people affected; it is a very sensitive issue from a social, and therefore political, point of view, in the Member States affected by this restructuring.
Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in a position to ask the House to vote in favour of this request for an urgent procedure presented by the Council, so that this proposal can be debated in Council by the Fisheries Ministers at their meeting called for the 27 November.
Mr President, the Committee on Budgets is sympathetic to the needs of our friends in the Committee on Fisheries.
However, a conciliation meeting will be taking place on 21 November and it is not yet agreed between the different institutions how the agreement will be finalised, or indeed in what category it will be finalised.
In the light of a decision by the Budgets Council last week, there is a great deal of confusion on our side as to how we are going to deal with this.
I would ask that we do not treat this as urgent and that it be held over until after the conciliation meeting of 21 November.
Mr President, I wish to support Mr Wynn.
I am glad to see that the Committee on Budgets is taking a responsible approach to this issue because the idea of pushing it through as urgent procedure without debate is unacceptable.
We have to be very careful about how we use European taxpayers' money and we need to look to the future.
A number of years ago in this Parliament it was already being said that Morocco would not agree to another agreement with the EU.
We knew that then and we should have prepared for it.
This situation is not unique, it is going to happen again.
At the moment we are discussing a major agreement with Mauritania.
The day will come when Mauritania will say to the EU that it no longer wants such an agreement.
What are we going to do then?
We really need to address this issue, firstly, in relation to how we arrange our common fisheries policy and, secondly, in relation to how we use public money.
The way this has been rushed through is unacceptable.
This is not a matter for urgent procedure because we have known for many years that this problem was coming.
We need to be extremely careful about how we use European taxpayers' money.
I understand the problems the fishing community has, but we need to be more responsible.
Mr President, I would simply like to say that the Committee on Budgets has taken no decision in this field.
There are plenty of Members, particularly from my group, in the Committee on Budgets who believe that the urgent procedure is perfectly appropriate.
We understand the reasons that the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has been able to give.
We believe that, in this case, a legal basis is necessary and, in any event, from the budgetary point of view, if it is necessary to amend that basis as a result of the negotiation with the Council on the 21 November, it could be done without any problem.
I therefore do not believe that this Parliament' s position would be damaged by accepting the urgent procedure today and voting on the MiguÃ©lez Ramos report, which, furthermore, relates much more to the technical issues in the Commission' s proposal with regard to the restructuring of the fleet than to actual budgetary motivations, which will be the subject of another report.
Mr President, I oppose urgency on a matter of principle, not on a matter of substance.
I am sure we all support a global health fund and President Prodi guaranteed EUR 120 million at the G8 meeting in July.
However, I and many others are extremely disappointed that the Commission has taken until November to come forward with any effective suggestions and now it is asking for urgency, effectively denying the Council and Parliament any time to debate or amend this proposal.
It looks as if we are just going to hand over a cheque and that will be the end of it.
The Commission is also suggesting the funding should be found by taking EUR 60 million from a fishing agreement and EUR 60 million from the EDF.
In its resolution in this House on 25 October this House emphasised that contributions should be new and additional funding, and this is not so.
At the moment it looks as if it is a one-off payment.
I would like to hear the Commission guarantee that a legal base will be found for the sustainable funding of the global health fund after 2000 and submitted as quickly as possible.
I would like an assurance that it will be new money and that Parliament and the Council will be kept fully informed and involved, so that we play a legislative part in this process.
We, as parliamentarians, cannot be treated in this way.
Mr President, there is no point in talking about old money or new money when there is no money!
If we do not get agreement on this matter this year with urgent procedure, there will be no money next year for the Global Health Fund.
I know there are problems about getting EUR 60 million from the EDF but, quite frankly, that is another argument.
If we want EUR 60 million from the general budget, we have to agree to using urgent procedure on this or there will be no money for the Global Health Fund.
This financing issue is indeed directly linked with the subject we were discussing just now.
EUR 50 million will be made available from appropriations that were previously earmarked for fishing agreements.
It is quite evident that this is additional money that was not available beforehand for other external actions.
A further EUR 10 million will be made available from two budget lines with which there have also been implementation difficulties up to now, that is to say the budget lines for Latin America and for Asia.
The money will be implemented here in a concrete way, and there are promising signs that the extra EUR 60 million can be provided from the EDF.
I believe that it really would be a good sign if the European Union could make an early decision on implementing these financial appropriations.
As you know, the donors to the global health fund have promised over USD 1.8 billion, but so far those are just promises.
The European Union would be the first to make a concrete decision on financing.
I therefore ask you to vote for this request for urgent procedure.
We need a legal basis for making a transfer to the global health fund.
This House will naturally be kept informed at all stages.
We will, of course, come back to this several times during the overall budget process.
But if the legal basis could be rapidly decided upon now, and it would be a good legal basis that would enable us to make the transfer, then we would not need to explore any other avenues, because the budget situation would be very clear.
So I ask you to vote for the request for urgent procedure.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to say that we are against recourse to the urgent procedure, for fundamental and for procedural reasons.
The facts are as follows: the Commission has proposed a contribution of EUR 60 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.
We are not against this proposal, but we do not believe that this can be a single contribution, made just once, if this objective is to be fulfilled.
We are arguing for a solid and sustained contribution, not just for one year.
This is why we do not agree with the urgent procedure; we intend to present amendments, which is our right in accordance with the codecision procedure applicable in this field.
The Commission, in asking for the urgent procedure, is doing so in a way which is unacceptable to Parliament, since it deprives us of this essential and irrevocable right.
The Commission announced its contribution to this fund in July; it told us about it some months ago and it announced it publicly in Genoa more than three months ago; and now it wants Parliament to express its opinion on this important issue in just one week.
Mr President, as rapporteur, allow me to explain.
We are talking, then, about three matters, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as discussed by the Committee on Budgets.
We support the Commission' s request for urgent procedure.
This is a matter of exceptional urgency, since many great needs have arisen, especially in Macedonia.
We are also concerned with extending the aid to Bosnia, Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
We nevertheless need a little more time.
To begin with, a proper discussion is needed in the Committee on Budgets.
It is a question of transfers for this year and of budget issues for next year.
We need a little time in which to obtain the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and we need to have a discussion on the whole budget for the Balkans for 2002 in connection with the conciliation prior to the second reading of the budget next week.
We therefore propose voting to apply urgent procedure but also for deciding at the same time to deal with these three matters during the November II part-session in Brussels.
We should, then, be able to have a joint debate on the issues relating to the Balkans, at the same time as dealing with the Lagendijk report on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
Our proposal is therefore in favour of urgent procedure but also of debating the matter during the November II part-session in Brussels.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure) President.
That concludes the vote.
Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2000
The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report for the year 2000.
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the European Court of Auditors, I would like to thank you for inviting me to present the 24th Annual Report of the Court for the 2000 financial year.
As in previous years, this presentation marks the start of the discharge procedure.
The report follows the format used for the past three years, with chapters covering revenue and each of the expenditure areas under the headings of the financial perspectives.
There is an additional chapter this year which marks the development of the Union, which deals with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards.
You will also - as usual - find a chapter dedicated to the Statement of Assurance and, attached to the report, you will find the Court' s observations on the implementation of the sixth, seventh and eight European Development Funds.
The different chapters of the Annual Report address four main concerns.
First, there is an analysis of the budgetary implementation and of the budgetary management practices for each specific financial perspective heading.
Then, you will find the follow-up of observations of the Court in previous Annual and Special Reports.
Thirdly, the specific appraisal in the context of the Statement of Assurance with information per financial perspective heading.
Finally, a new element this year is that the principal findings and recommendations in the Special Reports adopted by the Court since the last discharge are summarised in the chapters according to the wishes of this Parliament.
This means that the Annual Report this year contains all the principal findings and recommendations concerning the implementation of the general budget and the European Development Funds that the Court has published since the last discharge.
You will also find, for the first time - not in the copy of annual report that you have in your hands today, but in the Official Journal version that will come when the official version has been printed, something that Parliament has asked for many years - the text of the Court in one column and the answers of the Commission on the same page so as to make the report, at least in this respect, more user-friendly.
Concerning the budget management for 2000, one particular feature of budget implementation was the emergence of a very large surplus of revenue over expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.6 billion, equivalent to more than 14 % of final payment expenditure.
The main factors which led to this situation were a higher revenue yield than budgeted and - perhaps even more important - lower payments on Structural Measures, in particular those for the 2000-2006 programming period.
The Court recommends that the Commission examine how it can better use the supplementary and amending budget procedure to avoid excessive budget surpluses, in order to avoid distorted revenue positions for the following year caused by the carrying over of surpluses.
The Court, responding to the wishes of the discharge authority, has continued to follow up the observations in previous Annual and Special Reports.
The main purpose of this is to review what action has been taken, principally by the Commission, in response to the observations of the Court, the recommendations of the Council and the resolutions of the European Parliament.
In all of the subjects examined, some action has been taken.
The extent and effectiveness of this action, however, vary considerably.
In general, the Commission, in particular where it agreed with the earlier observations and propositions, has adopted measures designed to respond to them and to improve the situation.
In some cases corrective action has been slow, in others, staff and financial resources allocated have been insufficient to achieve the desired level of improvement.
Effecting improvements in the management and control of complex programmes involving many organisations at different levels is difficult and takes time.
Structural rigidities have often to be overcome, and in the areas of shared or decentralised management, which account for more than 80 % of the general budget, the Commission requires action from others, such as Member States.
Notwithstanding that achieving change can be difficult, the Commission should ensure that it takes all the measures within its power to implement the recommendations of the Court and of this Parliament.
In early 2001, as part of its follow-up work, the Court reviewed progress in the replacement of the former anti-fraud unit (UCLAF) with the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF).
The new arrangements for OLAF provide a more appropriate administrative framework, with greater independence for the Office than its predecessor.
The Court continues to work closely with OLAF.
It has established formal procedures to ensure that the relations between the two organisations are efficient and effective.
It has also established a constructive dialogue with the committee established to supervise the work of OLAF, under the chairmanship of Prof. Delmas-Marty.
The Court has recently prepared an opinion, soon to be published, on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of the Community's financial interests.
This directive is an important step forward in the fight against fraud.
I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Court of Auditors for her impressive work and dedication over the years to make this important directive possible.
With regard to the Statement of Assurance, the Court is of the opinion that the revised accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2000 reflect reliably the Community' s revenue and expenditure for the year and the financial situation at the end of the year.
As far as the legality and regularity of underlying transactions are concerned, the audit of the principal management and control systems applicable to Agriculture and Structural Measures revealed weaknesses in the functioning of control procedures aiming to secure the legality and regularity of the transactions.
The audit of operational expenditure revealed an unacceptable incidence of error affecting the amount of the payments or the reality or the eligibility of the underlying transactions.
In view of the results of its audit work taken together, the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the financial statements are, taken as a whole, legal and regular in respect of revenue, commitments and administrative expenditure but declines to provide this assurance in respect of payments in operational expenditure.
Since the last Annual Report the Court has adopted eighteen Special Reports to be taken into account in the discharge procedure, containing the results of audits which focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the Community' s financial management can be improved.
The results of the Court' s audits indicate significant positive findings.
In the agricultural area the reformed clearance of accounts system and the Integrated Administrative and Control System have contributed to improved management of large amounts of European Union funds.
The Commission' s strategy for dealing with BSE is basically sound.
With regard to Structural Measures, the URBAN Community Initiative has helped the implementation of many urban development projects and has enabled local authorities to access Union funds.
In the external actions area, the work of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo, was found to be both efficient and economical.
The TACIS cross-border co-operation programme is an instrument which has the potential to play a useful role in addressing issues relating to the new eastern border following the next accession.
However, it was also found that major objectives have either not been achieved, or only limited progress had been made.
Further, it was frequently found that there was either insufficient or no evaluation by the Commission of the achievement of the objectives.
The Commission' s reform programme is increasing the focus on results and performance measurement, within a resource allocation framework reflecting predetermined priorities and defined objectives.
The Court' s findings on recent programmes show that the Commission still faces major challenges in this area.
One of the most important issues in the discussion that we had last year here in Parliament, when I presented the Annual Report for 1999, concerned the situation in the Member States.
The results are striking.
The Court has concentrated a large share of its resources on the audit of control systems in Member States as a follow up to this debate.
Persistent weaknesses were found in Member States' checking of community operations concerning programmes where management is shared between the Commission and the Member States.
This was the case for the Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS).
It was also the case for export refunds, and concerning the control regulation for Structural Measures.
Improving the control arrangements in the Member States is central to ensuring the correct use of Union funds.
It is also important if the Court is to place some reliance for its own audit purposes on the checks carried out by the various audit and supervisory services in the Commission, and in the Member States.
I will come back to this specific problem at the end of my speech.
The recast of the Financial Regulation, which is an important element of the Commission reform programme, maybe the first step that was taken, now seeks to clarify and strengthen the provisions relating to methods of implementation of the budget, advance payments, procurement, presentation of the accounts, and the offices.
The introduction of new provisions intended to contribute to the establishment of a coherent legal framework in the field of budgetary execution, based on the primacy of the Financial Regulation, is another important improvement within the recast.
However, as you will see from our Annual Report, some important matters of principle stated in the Court' s opinion on the proposed changes have not been followed, which may lead to serious complexity in financial management.
Regarding enlargement, this year' s Annual Report has a new chapter dealing with pre-accession aid for which a separate financial perspective heading exists from 2000 onwards.
In accordance with Parliament recommendations in its 1999 discharge resolution, the Court has been improving and intensifying the co-operation with the Supreme Audit Institutions of the candidate countries during the past few years.
Furthermore, in liaison with the Supreme Audit Institutions the Court has been intensifying the exchange of information at different levels of national administrations.
The setting-up of national systems of internal control and the external audit of EU funds made available to the candidate countries require closer co-operation between the institutions even before accession.
Enlargement will bring about changes in the way the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice will work.
This is also true for the Court of Auditors and for Parliament.
Today, no one questions the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty to make the Court of Auditors one of the five independent institutions of the Union.
The Nice Treaty will mean substantial organisational changes in the near future, also for the European Court of Auditors, where the Court will have the possibility of establishing an organisational structure in chambers with a more effective decision making, even if we will then consist of 25 Member States.
The Court is actively preparing itself for this challenging reform.
The Court is developing its relations with the Commission' s new Internal Audit Service, with discussions covering a number of areas where we can work together.
The Court is giving high priority to assessing how it will be able to use the work of the Internal Audit Service and the audit capabilities in the Directorates General.
One very promising sign of progress in this field was the conference, under the challenging heading of "Verstehen" held at the initiative of the Internal Auditor, Mr Muis, on Thursday and Friday which Mrs Schreyer and Mrs Theato attended.
I should like to say, as the President of the Court of Auditors, that this initiative might mean an extremely fruitful, concrete and promising step forward in the idea of a single audit system concerning European funds.
The Treaty states clearly that the European Court of Auditors assists the European Parliament and the Council in exercising their powers of control over the implementation of the budget.
Ladies and Gentleman, I am soon to retire as President and Member of the European Court of Auditors.
During my seven years in the Court I have been privileged to contribute to the Court's growing importance, and to the continuous efforts it makes, in collaborating with Parliament and meeting its needs in optimising the assistance it provides.
The Court is addressing the need in its statement of assurance methodology for more information on the nature and causes of the problems affecting the management of Community funds by broadening the range of evidence in support of its conclusions.
The recent reforms in the area of financial management and internal audit will enable the Court to make greater use of the Commission' s work, not least for its work on the Statement of Assurance.
The Court intends to continue to develop specific appraisals for each major area of Community activity as a complement to its Statement of Assurance.
The specific appraisals are now envisaged in the Nice Treaty and are an important tool to help the discharge authority to make appropriate recommendations with a view to improving management.
One of the major tasks of the enlarged European Union will be the collaboration between European and National Supreme Audit Institutions.
This has long been a key preoccupation of this Parliament.
But, as we all know, this co-operation has advanced slowly and Parliament has repeatedly urged the Court to improve the situation.
After having followed progress for a number of years I have arrived at the conclusion that a good result in this respect requires initiatives at a higher level than purely technical co-operation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States and the European Court of Auditors.
I would like to quote a Member of this Parliament, Mr Jacques Santer who pointed out, when he was President of the Commission, the importance of collaboration between the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
It would also be a key factor in the field of Financial Control.
The Supreme Audit Institutions act independently and have a strong collaboration with their respective national parliaments.
So, collaboration between national parliaments and the European Parliament could have a major influence on national audit bodies and the European Court of Auditors, in particular in the matter of financial control.
The way of intergovernmental collaboration in this field is not the most practical route to take since the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Member States are, with the exception of my own country, independent of governments, as they are controlling them.
But maybe the solution can be found in increased cooperation between this Parliament and the national parliaments of the Member States.
Let me finally add one little word.
As parliamentarians in the European Parliament, as Commissioners in the European Commission, also as Auditors in the European Court of Auditors, we have a double role.
We have to fulfil our tasks according to the Treaty; to fulfil them as Commissioners, as Parliamentarians and as Members of the Court of Auditors.
But we also have another role in common. That is always to defend the idea of Europe.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr Karlsson, ladies, gentlemen, and members of the Court of Auditors, this report from the Court of Auditors on the 2000 budget year gives the Commission both encouragement and support; it is particularly supportive of the Commissioner for the Budget.
Let me thank the Court of Auditors, you, Mr Karlsson and the Court's members and staff for the 2000 Report and give especial additional thanks for the special reports, whose very practical recommendations make them very valuable to the Commission in its work.
I would most especially like to express my satisfaction with the Court's practical observations, and with the Court's support for two measures which are of particular concern to me.
One, in the area of foreign policy, has to do with the reconstruction of Kosovo.
The Court of Auditors has examined the accounting procedures and the profitability of the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo and has come to a highly favourable conclusion, reporting that the agency has succeeded in achieving most of the high targets set for it, and that its administration and budget management were highly efficient economically.
I had strongly urged that the 2000 Budget should make available sufficient funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo.
Parliament and, in particular, Mr Bourlanges, whom I would like to mention particularly in his capacity as principal rapporteur on the 2000 Budget, were also very much behind the idea that sufficient funds should be allocated for this purpose.
The good work that was done meant that funds for the agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo could even be increased in the course of the 2000 budget year.
I am sure that Mr Bourlanges will feel, as I do, that it is quite simply very heartening when measures that one has been especially committed to get such a good report from the Court of Auditors.
It goes without saying that this sends an important message to the taxpayers, that money is being invested well in Kosovo, and in an economically efficient way.
I emphasise this for the additional reason that there is a very intense debate going on in the media about the common foreign and security policy, with people asking: where is the European Union? where is the Commission?
Here we have a quite tangible example of a common foreign policy measure and a tangible demonstration of what a good result can be achieved if we all pull together.
The second point about which I would like to speak personally, and on which I wish to express my thanks for the Court's support, is the Financial Regulation.
The recast of the Financial Regulation is a highly comprehensive undertaking, on which the Court of Auditors gave its opinion in quick order and was of great help to the Commission, not only with the adoption of a formal position, but also with the many meetings on technical and administrative matters.
That may perhaps sound a bit arid, but the fact is that the Financial Regulation lays down Budget procedures in exact terms, stipulating who plays what role, who possesses which supervisory powers and whether, for example, there can be rapid redeployments in the Budget, and where they can be made, in order to take account of changes during the budget year.
I am very grateful to the Court of Auditors for making clear how important it is that all financial arrangements in specified sectors conform to Budget principles, or principles of sound budgeting.
I am very grateful to you in this Parliament for the amendments you have proposed even before the summer recess.
I can say quite unequivocally and definitely that the recast proposal gained a great deal in terms of quality as a result.
For its part, the Commission has now done its homework; so too, on this point, has the Court of Auditors; and so too, to a quite broad extent in this area, has Parliament; I therefore believe it is actually high time for Parliament to formally take up its position, so that then the Council, too, can get its homework over and done with in a similarly short time.
Now I also want to consider some areas in which the Court made some highly critical comments.
One case in point is the way in which the Monitoring Regulation for the Structural Funds has been implemented.
It is the Member States who have primary responsibility for monitoring the legality of the use to which Structural Fund resources are put.
It is, however, equally true that the Commission bears overall responsibility for the implementation of the Budget and thus for checking that monitoring regulations are clearly framed and enforceable and that the state of affairs does not come to pass in which more or less any Member State can come up with its own interpretation of the monitoring regulations and act accordingly.
The complaint most frequently levelled at the Structural Funds by the Member States is that the monitoring procedures are so complicated.
This sometimes reaches the point where the conclusion is to say: 'In future, we will have the Structural Funds only as a sort of lump sum transfer.'
The Commission, though, does not, of course, support this as the way forward, and I assume that Parliament does not support it either.
For when funds go out of the European Budget, they do so in order to achieve definite objectives and not as a general settlement.
It is, of course, true that, if we want things to be that way in future, we will have to work at simplifying the regulation in question.
I join with the Court of Auditors in calling for a simpler scheme which, being more easily monitored, would lessen the likelihood of error.
'Complicated procedure' was also the criticism the Court of Auditors laid at the door of the Sapard programme of agricultural aid for the acceding countries.
This afternoon the Commission will be debating the progress reports on the enlargement process as a whole, of which financial control is a very important part, as is the assessment of what progress has been made in the acceding states and of what problems remain to be overcome.
Sapard, though, presents us with the problem of the over EUR 1 billion allocated for 2000 and 2001, of which in fact only EUR 16 million have so far been paid out.
I must accept the Court of Auditors' criticism of what is, of course, a very poor result.
This will also have to be discussed in the Commission, for the complicated procedure must not result in the funds ceasing to be used at all.
When dealing with precise controls in the acceding states, we must, then, find a balance, but not to the detriment of implementation.
Turning to the massive EUR 11.6 billion surplus in the 2000 Budget, the Court of Auditors has explained that a surplus should not be entered in the accounts for the following year, but should, if at all possible in the current budget year, allow the Member States to make reduced payments, which means that the Budget would then be adjusted downwards in the course of the year.
I work on the assumption that the Council and the Finance Ministers would surely give this a favourable reception, but that there has to be more careful consideration of what is the right way forward here.
Of last year's Budget surplus, over EUR 3 billion was the result of increased income, which itself was a consequence of last year's growth figures in fact turning out better than had at first been assumed.
It was, though, only in November that the official figures became available.
Of the surplus, several hundred million euro represent real savings in agriculture as a result of favourable market developments.
I see it as a very positive thing if we do not have to spend money, but whether that is actually the case will not be definitely known until the end of the year.
Those who legislated for the Structural Funds had indeed already foreseen the possible difficulties in implementing the programme in its first year, and it is for that reason that the Interinstitutional Agreement provides for the option of transferring funds to subsequent years.
Let me again make it clear that I do not see it in a negative light if, at the end of the year, or, as the Court has proposed, possibly during the current year, funds can be returned to the Member States due to the money not being required.
I am probably agreeing with certain comments made in this Parliament when I say that the distinction has to be drawn between the money not being needed in order to achieve a given objective, and the money not having been able to be used because of faulty budget management or shortcomings in administration.
That can be properly assessed only when we are no longer talking in the Budget procedure about how much money is being invested, but rather about what objectives we want to achieve.
In this context, I take on board the Court of Auditors' remarks on evaluation and on how important it is in a good Budget procedure.
The Court of Auditors has confirmed the regularity of the accounts, in other words, that the books are in good order, and also of the revenue side of the Budget.
It has also certified the reliability of the commitments and of the administrative outgoings.
It has, however, criticised the excessive incidence of errors in cash movements.
Has the Commission, then, made too few changes in 2000 in order to improve financial management?
Let me, on this point, refer to the Court of Auditors' statement that, in 2000, many steps towards reform had only just started to be taken, and that they will only gradually meet with success.
I cannot, at this juncture, list all the steps we have taken since then, but I will all the same highlight a few of them.
One example is in the personnel field.
Additions have been made to the total personnel complement for financial management, among other things by redeployment within the Commission to reinforce the financial units in the various Directorates-General, and Parliament has made additional posts available for 2001.
The selection procedure for these is at present in progress, and it will result in 250 candidates being put on a list to strengthen the financial and personnel management sectors.
I would like, in addition, to mention the steps we are taking in training and development.
The Commission's reforms as a whole have meant that there is definitely a greater need for training.
A total of 2 800 officials have already been trained in financial management by the Budget Directorate-General and another 1 700 will take part in courses of this sort in the next few months.
The technical assistance offices have also come in for a lot of criticism from us in the past.
There are 126 of them, and 93 will have had their contracts with us cancelled by the end of 2001.
I see this as an important point; it is something that has been achieved through pressure exerted by Parliament, and we will, for example, be continuing with decentralisation in the field of foreign affairs, in order to make greater use of local knowledge in implementing budget decisions.
This afternoon the Commission will be taking decisions about further new management systems and about the networking of national agencies.
A few weeks ago, we adopted a comprehensive package to improve personnel policy.
In the summer, I presented the report on the steps the Commission had either taken, or proposed to the legislature, to combat fraud, ranging from regulations on money laundering via customs measures through to the proposal for a European public prosecutor for financial offences.
There is much to do, but much has already been achieved.
The Commission is not only active in well over 100 States.
It also gives aid following natural catastrophes and gives humanitarian aid in crisis areas and war zones. It is active in many traditional fields, for example in aspects of agriculture, but it also makes funds available for many innovative projects suggested by Parliament.
This may sometimes involve large amounts totalling millions, but sometimes, too, relatively small sums of money.
We link up researchers and the results of their investigations, share in the financing of high-speed railway lines and of student exchange schemes.
This represents a truly broad spectrum of areas of expenditure, and there is nothing rigid about it.
The programmes change, the tasks change and the world changes, so we are all constantly being faced with new challenges, and all the European Union's institutions have to be open to them.
We want to create good European policies, which means learning from mistakes in order to make good measures even better.
The reports of the Court of Auditors are a fundamental support to us in doing this.
So I thank the Court, those of its members who are leaving, those who are continuing to be members of it, and most especially its President.
Mr Karlsson, your presidency has seen the further development of the method for the statement of assurance, and the compilation of a very large number of special reports containing very definite and valuable recommendations.
The understanding of financial management has improved under your presidency and so, I believe, has the institutions' understanding of each other.
For that you have my most especial thanks.
chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Karlsson, today you are presenting your annual report as President of the Court of Auditors, together with those Members of the Court still in office.
This is the last time you will present the report, as you are leaving office, as are a number of other Members of the Court. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the retiring Members of the Court both personally and on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control for the years of excellent and effective cooperation and mutual trust under your presidency, and also under the previous presidency of Professor Friedmann, who is also retiring.
There have occasionally been differences of opinion, but I believe that we have always managed to cooperate well, and we have, above all, performed a control function that has ultimately benefited the taxpayer.
So once again, many thanks.
The Annual Report of the Court before us today also demonstrates that we have made some further progress.
I only want to highlight a couple of points.
The most striking point is the large surplus of own resources: EUR 11.6 million or over 14% of the budget has not been spent.
The finance ministers are, of course, delighted, as this means that they will have to pay less to the EU next year, but we in the Committee on Budgetary Control are concerned to know which of the objectives that we have set ourselves have not been achieved.
I believe that the Commission would be well advised - and I understand from the press that there will be surpluses again this year - to get to work on supplementary and rectifying budgets so that the money available is really spent on achieving objectives.
The complex and cumbersome nature of the legal framework and the extent of the controls therefore involved are also a matter of concern both for the Parliament and for the Court of Auditors, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, for the Commission too.
We need to work to simplify things as a matter of urgency, so that the public can also obtain funding, rather than say, 'It is so complicated.
I do not want any money from the European Union' .
Controls need to be proportionate but also to be effective, to lead to positive outcomes and to have a preventive effect.
My last point is the positive statement of assurance, the SOA.
Anyone looking for concrete figures or percentages in relation to payments will be disappointed.
Once again, the Court has not mentioned any concrete figures.
This House had actually pressed for that.
The Court now wants to bring forward a refined method of producing this positive statement of assurance.
We are more than happy to cooperate on this, but we also have to look and analyse where errors are due to the Member States and where they are the Commission's responsibility.
The Commission is ultimately responsible, and it must accept this responsibility.
I would like to thank you once again, Mr Karlsson, for your excellent cooperation, and I would like to wish all the retiring Members and you personally all the best for the future.
Mr President, I would also like to pass on my best regards to Mr Karlsson, thank him for his presentation and all the work he has done over the past few years.
I hope he will pass on our thanks to his other colleagues who are also leaving.
We must remember that this report is the first report which assesses the first full year of the Prodi Commission - a Commission which, let us remind ourselves, was appointed with the specific remit of radical overhaul and reform of the European Union.
The question we will be asking in our discharge procedure this year is: "Is the Commission delivering on that promise?".
Let us be clear.
If it is not, then the credibility of both the Prodi Commission and of this Parliament is on the line.
It is much too early to assess the success or failure of the Prodi Commission and of Commission reform.
The only question we can ask at this point is whether we are headed in the right direction.
Mr Karlsson, I noted your words last night.
There are a number of hopeful signs in this report.
So, where the Commission has specific responsibility, we do seem to be seeing some positive developments.
As you say, the strategy on BSE is basically sound.
The work of the Agency charged with the reconstruction of Kosovo was efficient and economical.
The reform programme is heading in the right direction.
You have approved the recasting of the financial regulation and the Commission's proposals on financial incentives for top grade officials, although I note that you have some concerns about the Commission's accounting mechanisms.
Perhaps Mrs Schreyer could comment on that.
We are not going to let the Commission off the hook.
There is a large area where the Commission has joint responsibility with the Member States, particularly in the agricultural sector and the structural funds.
The primary responsibility must lie with the Member States.
They are responsible for 85% of the budget.
Here we see some serious structural weaknesses.
In the structural funds, we see problems in the application of regulations at every level.
The CAP accounts for over 40% of the budget and where Member States are responsible there is no improvement.
Heads of stock continue be overstated.
We know that Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have not signed the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests.
We are disappointed, Mr Karlsson, that you did not mention them by name in the report.
Again the Court has failed to give a statement of assurance to the Commission.
As I said last night, this is a complicated and ever-changing procedure and I do not believe the Commission will ever get a statement of assurance.
So the main message, as far as I can see, is that the Commission should keep going.
It is on the right track.
Member States must stop hiding behind the Commission and assume their proper responsibility of protecting EU taxpayers' money.
I too should like to express my appreciation for all the Members of the Court of Auditors who are departing.
It is noticeable again that this year, as the Court of Auditors has already expressed in rather vague terms, there is no Statement of Assurance.
The question arises as to how long this situation can continue like this.
2001 is the first year for which the current Commission shoulders all responsibility.
In my opinion, there should come a day when a positive Statement of Assurance can be made.
I should like to suggest that the Commission sets the year 2000 as a target date.
For each year, an action plan should be drafted in which the Commission outlines its objectives.
We must ensure that the necessary arrangements are then in place for certain Directorates-General, with a margin of error of, say, less than 1%.
As far as the Member States are concerned, we all know that that is where the money is spent.
In my view, the system we are currently using for the agricultural funds is workable: if a Member State spends certain amounts inappropriately, the Commission will need to introduce capping. I should like to see the Commission make proposals for extending this system to include other sectors of the budget, notably the Structural Funds.
Honourable Members of the Court of Auditors, Mr Karlsson, Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I should naturally like to echo the words of thanks which my fellow MEPs have already expressed.
I have started to wade through this tome.
I have to admit that this 24th Annual Report seems superior and that more names are included than before.
In other words, this Annual Report is simply a better read, it has to be said.
It also becomes clear that you are sending out a message, namely an urgent request for simplifying legislation.
Indeed, if legislation were simplified, fewer mistakes would be made, fewer irregularities would occur and this would probably result in less fraud.
When I read what was happening with the own resources and when I saw the results of the database, which gives an overview of all cases of fraud and irregularities established since 1996, amounting to EUR 1.5 billion, I appreciated the significance of what we are doing. On the basis of the Court of Auditors report, the OLAF reports, the work carried out by the rapporteurs and also our own studies, we will need to explain to the European taxpayers how their money is being spent.
I am delighted with the fact that the Annual Report devotes much attention to the role of the Member States.
Indeed, they do not sufficiently inspect the Community programmes which they manage in conjunction with the Commission.
Neither do they fight fraud satisfactorily when they collect their revenue.
The VAT carrousels are a prime example of this.
Finally, as Mrs Morgan has already stated, the Member States fail to implement legislation adequately.
In this connection, I should once again like to haul my own country over the coals.
In the Blak report, Belgium was attacked for not yet having ratified the 1995 agreement.
I have exchanged correspondence in this respect with the President of the Belgian Parliament, and four months ago, I was promised that this agreement would be ratified during the Belgian Presidency.
That has not been done to date.
That is an outright scandal, and I am grateful to the Court of Auditors for once again giving us the necessary ammunition today to ensure that the Belgian government and the Belgian Parliament carry out their tasks at long last.
It is a disgrace which we must continue to denounce in public.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although money is not everything, the way money is handled shows if a policy is successful or not.
Those were the words of a former President of the Court of Auditors, Bernhard Friedmann, and if we take those words as a yardstick for this year's report, then we really have to ask just how successful the Union's policies are in practice.
The report before us summarises what we already know from many other reports: there is still a need for reform in financial management and the way funds are implemented.
There are dramatic shortcomings in many areas, which suggests that financial errors are endemic.
The Commission's tendency to blame irregularities and deficits the Court discovers chiefly on the Member States is unacceptable.
Of course the Member States cannot shake off their own responsibilities, if there are irregularities or fraud in the Member States, the Commission must act accordingly.
The recovery rate, that is the reimbursement of funds that have been lost, is not satisfactory.
It is not acceptable if Member States underperform in the fight against fraud because of lax controls and are then slow to get funds reimbursed as well.
Politically speaking, the Commission has final responsibility for the EU budget and it is accordingly also responsible for efficient implementation of funds and checks.
One of the things mentioned in the Commission's responses on last year's report is that new systems are being introduced which primarily aim to make it easier to check the efficiency of VAT collection in the individual Member States.
Given that significant shortcomings have also been identified in this area, we also have to ask how effective these control mechanisms are.
I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for its successful investigative work and I call on the Commission to take further structural reform actions so that mismanagement and financial errors become a thing of the past.
Mr President, what can I say in two minutes?
Well, first of all and very simply, I shall say goodbye and thank you to President Karlsson.
I shall say goodbye, now that you are leaving us, after giving many years of loyal service, and thank you for the excellent cooperation that you developed with this House and for the quality of this report, which now seems like an impressive aircraft carrier, surrounded by a squadron of special reports.
I shall make three brief comments, as I have very little time.
First of all, I believe that you are right to emphasise that the major problem with the 2000 budget is the massive under-implementation of a number of funds.
Admittedly, Mrs Schreyer is right to say that there are sometimes good reasons for this under-implementation, but generally the budgetary authority feels a sense of frustration and is aware that there are problems related to this under-implementation.
I shall give four examples. The first is the overly complex regulations, the difficulties in managing the project cycle, the poor interaction in execution and control between the Commission and the Member States, and, lastly, the often pernickety control which has the effect of taking away responsibility.
These are the areas we will be focusing on in the discharge.
I have one comment to make on the DAS.
I am pleased to see that the Court of Auditors is keeping a good distance and we must do the same thing with the error rate.
The overall error rate is merely the scientifically dubious aggregation of spot checks, which, whilst interesting, are random.
I do not want everything to hinge on the error rate, which will determine everything.
The Court of Auditors is reassessing this issue.
Parliament must monitor and support this.
My third and final comment relates to the management of surpluses.
In my view, it is a shame that surpluses are systematically reimbursed to Member States.
In fact, economically speaking, this management strategy has a pro-cyclical effect, which is absurd.
We support growth when it is strong, and then, since there is a lack of money, we penalise growth when it is weak.
We should consider other forms of multi-annual regulation from a statutory point of view.
Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus, in this debate, on the Court of Auditors' special report on export refunds.
This is yet another important contribution to our understanding of the vital need to promote a thorough reform of the CAP in areas such as the funding of exports of agricultural products.
Until today, I had never read, in one publication, such a devastating set of facts on the misuse of public funds by the European institutions, some of which are worth highlighting.
EUR 80 million from the Community budget were used to fund supplies to Iraq, in breach of the embargo imposed by the United Nations. Little or none of this money has to date been recovered.
According to statements made by the Russian customs authorities themselves in August 2000, almost 80% of Community subsidies for exports to that country, currently being examined by OLAF, have proved to be fraudulent. It should be remembered that Russia is the main destination for subsidised European exports.
The Community has set up free import agreements with candidate countries, but is still subsidising the export of dairy products to these countries. As a result, we have the classic roundabout scenario already seen in Estonia, in which the Community subsidised butter exports, which were then imported free from customs duties.
The number of supposedly pure-bred cattle whose export the Community has already funded would be enough to give some importer countries, with Mediterranean or desert climates, huge reserves of pure-bred European cattle.
The system of control and monitoring bodies, designed to ensure the veracity of export statements has proved to be a complete fiasco.
The Commission assured us, even in the context of the last budgetary discharge and on the FlÃ©chard procedure, that exports to Russia in particular, were now being properly monitored.
This report by the Court of Auditors categorically disproves the Commission' s words.
Mr President, this is the first time that we have received a report that pertains to a period for which the Prodi Commission is entirely responsible.
Can we draw clear conclusions from it?
No, not really.
That is why my group hopes that the discharge procedure will eventually give us the answer to the following questions: which countries cause most problems, which areas of policy are most problematic and what can be done about this, where does the Commission carry out its tasks and where does it fail to do so, but also where have improvements been made and where has that not been the case?
We can already detect some improvement.
That is partly thanks to the commitment by this European Parliament, but also the Court of Auditors, for which we are very grateful.
However, this is still not enough.
Moreover, it is still not possible to issue a general Statement of Assurance, and the budget surplus is currently at an all-time high.
Progress has thus been made in small ways, but that is not enough to really gain the confidence of the people in Europe.
In the final analysis, that is what we all need to work towards.
Mr President, when I read the Never-Ending Story to my grandchild, Niklas, I think of the Court of Auditors' annual report.
There are an incredible number of problems which crop up again and again, year after year. Lamentable control systems in the Member States, lost income from VAT, bureaucratic and complicated export refund arrangements, farmers who overstate how much land they have, misappropriation of structural funds, fraud involving research funds in the form of over-payment, and long-winded and bureaucratic procedures concerning the EU' s external aid.
It is the same old story every single year.
However, it is now the Member States that are the biggest culprits.
It cannot be said often enough.
The agricultural and structural funds are what cause us problems.
There is a very tough approach this year to the management of the structural funds.
I proposed last year in my discharge report that the Commission should impose fines upon those Member States which offend again and again, and I am extremely pleased that Mrs Schreyer and the Commission have promised to look constructively at this possibility.
Denmark is also mentioned a couple of times in the annual report, and that is a couple of times too many.
There are problems with farmers' overstating how much land they have, and pathetic control systems at quite a few custom houses.
The Danish practice of collecting users' fees for the issue of export refunds has also been found to be illegal.
It is thanks to the Court of Auditors that the Commission has finally realised what is unlawful about this practice.
I am also pleased that we are working on the problems caused through the pile of work involving guarantee payments in Denmark, which are a disaster.
In this area, too, the Commission has been a good and effective partner.
I would also say to Mr Karlsson that I should never in my life have believed that a Dane would end up missing a Swede.
That is, however, the case and, since I, myself, am also leaving Parliament after this parliamentary term, we must set up a club for former Scandinavian MEPs in which we can rhapsodise about the old days.
I think that the children' s book, 'Karlsson-on-the-Roof' was written with you in mind.
Thank you for your fruitful cooperation over seven years.
Mr President, I have a couple of observations to make.
First, we need to recognise that, once again, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance in respect of Commission expenditure.
I want to resist our gradually starting to regard the abnormal as being the norm.
We can perhaps do that in this case, but certainly not outside this area.
If this statement of assurance is procedurally weak, then I expect the Court of Auditors to make a statement to that effect.
Otherwise we must note that there is a weakness in Commission expenditure that needs to be criticised politically speaking.
My second point is that I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for having highlighted the link between today's debate on progress reports in connection with enlargement and the report of the Court of Auditors.
The Court of Auditors has told us that in respect of the new pre-accession instruments there was actually a zero expenditure policy in 2000.
That means that in practice - and the Commission is talking about the first candidate countries acceding in 2004 - we have already wasted 20% of the time available in the financial area.
And that means of course that we will have to work even harder in the coming years in order to implement the pre-accession instruments properly.
My third point is a comment about OLAF.
I was surprised, Mr Karlsson, that your report more or less suggested that by adding a reserve for setting up OLAF, Parliament had affected the independence of that body.
We felt obliged to do this when the Commission - as you know - simply transferred all UCLAF's staff to OLAF, and apparently thought the job was done. And all the more so when we discovered from the OLAF Monitoring Committee for which you have such high regard that OLAF's independence genuinely was at risk.
Now that we have been able to deal with the Commission, and I would specifically like to thank Mrs Schreyer for that, we have a new problem.
This is an area where I believe the Commission should step in, Mrs Schreyer.
The new Berlusconi government is now blocking one of the central posts in the new OLAF.
I would be grateful if we could all pull together on this one.
Mr President, the report of the Court of Auditors is always rather like the starting pistol for the discharge procedure, which we then hope to conclude in the April of the following year, although we do not always succeed.
Now that we have been working off the inherited liabilities for several years, something that has consistently attracted media attention, it now seems to me that we are tackling more systemic problems where it is not so much spectacular individual cases that are at stake, but rather whether systems are flawed in some way.
I would like to address once again three points that arose most often in the debate.
The first one is the high level of unimplemented appropriations.
In the course of the discharge procedure, we will have to ask ourselves whether this is attributable to the caution officials exercise before they will sign something off and spend money, or whether it is to do with overcomplicated rules.
For example, given the many complaints I hear from my constituents and others about all the red tape you have to cope with in dealing with Brussels if you want to get support for something, I fear that I know the answer already.
Although I am willing to accept it if this is clearly refuted, this is still an issue we need to sort out.
The second point is the statement of assurance, which has just been mentioned, and Mr BÃ¶sch has pointed out the dilemma we face.
We need to ask ourselves if there are more reliable instruments or if we are treating this statement of assurance in the same way that the Council does year after year, that is as a kind of weather report that is not binding in any way.
My final point is this: we need to establish whether the Member States' handling of EU money has got worse or whether it is just being scrutinised more carefully now.
If the latter is the case, that would represent some progress and the Commission could be given some credit for that.
But it is the Commission's job to step up pressure on the Member States, and we will be glad to help out.
Before giving the floor back to Mr Karlsson I should like to say to him on behalf of Parliament that we appreciate the fruitful cooperation we have had over the years of his presidency.
We wish you all the very best for the future.
Mr Blak has probably paid you the ultimate compliment by talking about a Dane missing a Swede.
That is like a Scot saying we want England to win at football.
That was a real compliment.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Mr President, on behalf of my outgoing colleagues and myself I would like to assure you that I have never regretted my resignation as much as at this moment.
I wish I could resign every time we met in order to listen to this lovely music.
So thank you very much for all the nice words.
Not least, when I go home to Sweden I shall tell them of these kind words from Denmark.
Thank you, Mr. Blak.
I realise there is a heavy agenda, but I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words.
I shall start with what Mr Kuhne has just said.
It seems that a number of issues have been put behind us and there is a feeling - which I also had yesterday in a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control - that we are now able to address some major issues for the future.
The first is one which underlies the budget surplus problem.
It is not so much the revenue I am thinking of, as the under-utilisation and the under-implementation of funds, which, in turn, has a lot to do with our problems in achieving good management and fighting fraud - namely the over-complexity of Union funds and administration and regulations.
I have had a long discussion on that with the discharge rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, and I feel confident that this problem will be addressed now.
My personal advice to Parliament is to do everything in its power, together with other institutions, to simplify things.
On all the major issues, such as the pre-accession funds, structural funds and export refunds and on the market regulations in agriculture, we have built a mountain of complexity which, if I may for once step into the realm of political judgment, raises the major question of the European citizens' confidence in this Union.
I would say that if I had to choose one of the tasks that Mr Kuhne mentioned as being the most important, it would be: simplify, for heaven's sake!
I wish you every success in that.
I think that this Parliament, together with the Court of Auditors and the other institutions, will in the future manage to increase confidence among European citizens in our great project, which, of course, is the primary goal for all of our institutions.
With that, I thank you once again, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, for your kind words and for this most stimulating and interesting exchange of views.
That concludes this item.
Money laundering
The next item is the report (A5-380/2001) by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering (PE-CONS 3654/2001 - C5-0496/2001 - 1999/0152(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this second directive on money laundering in Europe has a long history.
You know that legislation on money laundering in the Member States of the European Union has its roots not so much in the will of the national legislatures but rather in the fact that back in 1991 the European Union brought in the first money-laundering directive, which acted as a catalyst for a string of national money-laundering laws being adopted.
However, the 1991 directive only set a minimum standard.
This minimum standard provided that drug-related offences should be included in the list of predicate offences, and with regard to professions that were obliged to take part in the fight against money laundering, only banks and providers of financial services were covered by compulsory provisions.
This led to major differences in transposal in Europe.
There were Member States that went well beyond this minimum standard, and other Member States that only implemented the minimum standard.
Back in 1995, the European Parliament's then Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs organised a major hearing on this.
The outcome of that hearing was that the differences in transposal were leading to major problems in combating money laundering in Europe, as cooperation between the Member States was not functioning adequately either.
For us in this House, the result - and there were two reports on this, one in 1996 and the other in 1998 - was that we called on the Commission to bring forward a second directive in order to raise standards in Europe, and in particular to extend the list of predicate offences and the list of professions covered.
At that time we suggested that the professions covered should include dealers in luxury items, casinos, auctioneers and also solicitors, notaries and other providers of legal advice.
The Commission then brought forward its proposal in 1999, but we considered that at least as far as providers of legal advice were concerned, it was not sufficiently sensitive.
As you know, since the Charter of Nice at least, citizens have the right to legal advice and representation, and this is also rooted in various national constitutions.
This can only be effectively guaranteed if those citizens are also in a position to give their legal adviser any information safe in the knowledge that this will be kept confidential and that their legal adviser will not phone the public prosecutor the next day and pass on this information.
That is why Parliament was concerned to preserve this right at first reading, while at the same time effectively combating money laundering in Europe.
This then went into the conciliation procedure, and I believe that the compromise which emerged was a good one.
The Council gave ground on the Member States being allowed, in accordance with their own legal traditions, to let legal advice continue to be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.
On the other hand, Parliament also gave some ground, by not demanding that this arrangement should be made compulsory, but that it should instead be at the discretion of national legislatures.
Article 6(3) therefore gives all Member States the option, depending on their own national legal traditions, of providing for the obligation of professional secrecy to be observed in the area of legal advice.
Exactly the same procedure was followed for other contentious points, and some excellent compromises were reached on those too.
The subject of tipping off, in other words a ban on information given to one's legal adviser being passed on to others, has also been solved by means of a compromise under Article 6(3), that is to say by means of a discretionary arrangement.
The issue of what should be done with information received in this way and which is in the hands of the public prosecutor's office has been left at the discretion of national legislatures.
To put it simply, all the parties involved finally said that they were not 100% satisfied with this compromise, nor was it ideal, but they could live with it.
That is exactly what a good compromise is about, and I would therefore like to recommend to this House that it should accept the proposal that has emerged from the Conciliation Committee, thus making a substantial contribution to strengthening the fight against money laundering in Europe.
Against the background of the present situation, and the need to combat terrorism, this is an important factor.
On the other hand, we have accordingly also managed to ensure that our citizens' fundamental rights have been preserved without any need to interfere with mature national legal traditions which in some cases are of a constitutional nature.
All in all, a good compromise then, please vote for it.
Mr President, I represent a minority.
The new Recital 16 says that there is an obligation to report suspicions "if the legal counsellor is taking part in money laundering activities, the legal advice is provided for money laundering purposes, or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money laundering purposes".
That is going too far.
That is why I am voting against this.
It would destroy the integrity of advice.
It also has a second implication which has not up to now been the case under our existing legislation: in all three cases the legal counsellor or lawyer would be committing a criminal offence.
He would therefore also have to denounce himself.
That is totally unheard of anywhere in the world.
I am fairly sure that even in the Stone Age there was no law saying that.
For some inexplicable reason, the Commission has felt moved for the first time ever in law to adopt a legal provision whereby one must denounce oneself.
I certainly cannot vote for that.
Lessing comes to mind, who said that if enlightenment is only a small light glimmering in the darkness, there is at least still some hope in the world.
You have made the same mistake as with the OLAF legislation, which in the end has even penetrated into Members' offices.
You will be stopped there.
This could not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.
When we were debating the OLAF legislation, I said that the European Union as a whole had had a rush of regulatory blood to the head.
We seem to have a similar phenomenon again here.
I also regard it as a matter for great regret that the legal profession has shown so little backbone on this issue.
Mr President, one of the biggest gaps in the anti-money laundering regime has been that it only applied to financial institutions.
As successive international reports have made clear, lawyers and other professionals become vulnerable to exploitation as unwitting accomplices in the washing of dirty money from criminals and terrorists as banks tighten up, which, I am glad to say, they are at last having to do.
I regard the outcome of the conciliation on this directive as satisfactory if it is interpreted in a common sense way.
That means that lawyers, accountants and tax advisers must, outside a strict definition of legal privilege, report transactions that are suspicious, in other words, that they have reason to believe their client is involved in money laundering.
This is the only feasible interpretation.
There has been a huge amount of hype on this directive aimed at protecting lawyers' vested interests and not, I am afraid to say, individual rights.
This has delayed the finalisation of the directive for an unnecessary six months.
Parliament has not exactly covered itself with glory.
I hope all Member States will declare that they have no intention of invoking the option to exempt lawyers from the ban on tipping off clients that the authorities have been alerted.
We need to make sure that our legal and financial systems are not exploited, rather than concentrating on the position of the lawyers themselves and their own self-interest.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on succeeding in achieving a sensible joint proposal on the more important points of this report in codecision.
However, the Radical Members of the Bonino List will not be able to vote for this report because it has two shortcomings: the first concerns the joint text itself which gives the Member States' the right to use information obtained through proceedings combating money laundering for other types of investigations as well.
This point introduces the danger that, in actual fact, the investigating authorities might use investigations into money laundering to obtain special powers as a way to get round the rules, so to speak, a way to get round the normal protection rights governing information obtained during proceedings on other issues.
The second point on which we have reservations is more general: it is the recommendation that the fight against money laundering should be seen as the priority.
In our opinion, if we are to win the battle, if we are to strike at the profits of criminal organisations, our most urgent priority should be to legalise drugs.
This text was adopted on the wave of events following the attacks of 11 September.
We must not forget that Afghanistan, which we are currently attacking with military force, is responsible for 80% of the world' s opium production.
Well then, maybe a policy of legalising drugs would be a more effective way of reducing the power of the drug barons than pursuing their capital throughout the world.
Mr President, the thorny problem in the text before us is, of course, the balance between the legally recognised obligation of professional secrecy, on the one hand, and, on the other, the duty to pass information which assists the fight against money laundering to the appropriate authorities.
The money-laundering directive imposes a string of obligations on credit and financial institutions, with the result that money launderers have simply switched to other sectors, hence the need to extend the scope of the directive to other professions.
Whilst we of course welcome more stringent measures, they should not lead to a watering down of the obligation of professional secrecy for various professions, and above all for lawyers, notaries and tax consultants.
Mr Rothley is right in saying that the text before us is chipping away at the principle of nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare, no one is bound to incriminate himself.
However, that is the very compromise that we think is workable, and we believe that the need to balance professional secrecy on the one hand and the need to bring criminals to book on the other has been solved in an acceptable way, and we shall therefore be voting in favour of this.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur.
Because of your commitment, we have been able to see off the attack the Council and Commission were making on the fundamental rights and rights to defence of Europe's citizens.
It is not acceptable for defence counsel, solicitors, tax consultants and notaries simply to be turned into part of the public prosecution service.
It is also evident that the battle to maintain rights to defence is not over yet.
The directive still has to be transposed into national legislation, and we must continue to argue that it should not be subject to an excessively narrow interpretation at national level, thus restricting citizens' fundamental rights and rights to defence.
However, I can also assure you that I will be making representations to the appropriate Austrian authorities to make sure that precisely this does not happen.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I welcome very much the agreement which has been reached by Parliament and the Council.
Delegations in the conciliation procedure on the proposal for a second money laundering directive have given their support to this compromise proposal, and the Commission is duly appreciative.
I should like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and also vice-president Provan for co-chairing the conciliation meeting, for their determined efforts to reach an agreement which, as I have said, is very much welcomed by the Commission.
The Commission proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money-laundering directive - which Parliament called for as early as 1995, as was mentioned quite rightly this morning - has raised difficult and sensitive issues of which the Commission is fully aware.
Not least, the involvement of the professions in the anti-money-laundering defences has attracted the attention of many people interested in this subject and, in particular, Members of this Parliament.
The Commission believes that the joint text agreed in the conciliation procedure constitutes a good compromise, taking account of the legitimate concerns of both Parliament and the Council.
The fight against money laundering is an essential aspect of the fight against serious and organised crime.
Since the tragic events of 11 September, it has also become an integral part of the fight against the financing of terrorism.
The proposal before us now, to strengthen the European Union's anti-money-laundering defences, has aroused great interest in the world outside the European Union, not least in the so-called financial action task force which is in the process of updating its 40 recommendations.
So to sum up, I commend the joint text to Parliament and I look forward to the earliest possible adoption and implementation of this important new directive.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Approximation of civil and commercial law
The next item is the report (A5-384/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States [COM(2001) 398 - C5-0471/2001 - 2001/2187(COS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this too is a very important report.
What is it about?
It is about the fact that although the internal market in Europe is becoming ever more integrated, there are also various deficits, as we all know.
The Commission, the Parliament and the Council have been trying for many years to achieve joint legislation, particularly in the field of consumer protection.
In the communication on contract law which the Commission has brought forward, and which is also referred to in this report, the Commission covered in detail the position on the common body of law which already exists in the European Union, and also referred to all the directives already in existence in this field.
However, if you take a closer look at these directives, you will see that they are not always necessarily consistent.
It is quite conceivable for there to be a contract entered into between a purchaser and a vendor in which the purchaser may have to sign three different cancellation statements with different cancellation deadlines, because totally different deadlines are found in different directives, such as the distance-selling directive and other directives.
It is pretty obvious that this does little for consumer protection and is sheer nonsense.
