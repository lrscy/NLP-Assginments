Granting such a patent would be very harmful as far as research and improvements in treatment are concerned.
The decision by the European Patent Office will be tremendously important.
It is in the interests of all the European actors, and their duty too, to ensure that the human genetic code is not patented but is freely available for research and the development of medical treatments.
Finally I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for the kind way in which you received the group of Finnish schoolchildren in April and took the trouble to come and meet them personally in Parliament.
Your friendly and very warm attitude overwhelmed us all and gave these young people the inspiration and encouragement to face their problems.
Mr President, Mrs JÃ¶ns has written an excellent report.
The point has frequently been made in this debate that breast cancer is the most common cause of death in the European Union in women between 35 and 55.
For this reason alone it is a subject deserving all our attention.
It might also be worth mentioning, though, that the age group above this one is badly affected as well.
One of the key points is that in the Member States there are currently still too many differences in the diagnosis, the quality of the treatment and the care of breast cancer and therefore in the chances of survival.
But should it make any difference which country or which area or which hospital you are treated in?
The same is true of diseases affecting men and I refer here in particular to prostate cancer.
It is therefore time for the European Union to adopt a more active approach in the combating of breast cancer in all countries, including the candidate Member States, in order to lift care to a higher level.
The recommendations in the present report give all the relevant starting points.
I am also very pleased with what the Commissioner has said, which demonstrates her positive commitment.
There are already universal screening programmes in operation in a number of Member States.
In the Netherlands there is one such programme for women between 50 and 75.
I recently took part in it myself and I have to say that I find it very reassuring to know that early detection increases the chance of cure.
Another positive element in the combating of breast cancer is that treatment by multidisciplinary teams leads to substantially better results and it seems to me that more attention here to the psychosocial side of the matter is by no means an excessive luxury.
Breast cancer in women is not just a technico-medical matter.
Thirdly, the recording of comparable European data concerning the development of breast cancer is needed.
Such data may be an extra stimulus for more European research, especially into the causes of breast cancer.
Let us be honest: we still know little about the causal factors.
In short, a splendid and very specific report deserving of implementation and the sort of report that merits further discussion in this House.
Mr President, the fact that the European Parliament is addressing today this major, sensitive issue concerning the health of millions of people, millions of women in our continent and throughout the world is due, as we all acknowledge, to the determination and sensitivity of Mrs JÃ¶ns, whom I too would like to thank from the bottom of my heart.
Considering that breast cancer can be cured in 90% of cases if diagnosed early on and properly treated, as is shown, not least, by the figures provided by Mrs JÃ¶ns and by current research; considering that high quality breast screening within the framework of a regional or national programme can reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by as much as 35% for women between the ages of 50 and 69, and that, according to scientific studies recorded, the mortality rate can be reduced by 20% for women between 40 and 49 too, every woman should have access to screening, to treatment and to high quality aftercare, irrespective of where they live, their social position, profession or level of education.
The main important points of Mrs JÃ¶ns' report are precisely an excellent prevention strategy, rapid treatment and appropriate post-operative care.
Thus, the call to the Member States and the Commission - I would like to thank the Commissioner for her words this morning, which were reassuring - to make combating breast cancer a priority in health policy and to develop and implement effective strategies for increasing prevention, with the goal of reducing the average breast cancer mortality rate in the Union by 25% by 2008, is a key point of this report, as is the right for women suffering from breast cancer to be treated by a multidisciplinary team.
It is therefore important for the Member States to develop a wide network of certified multidisciplinary breast units which meet specific quality criteria.
One last point which I want to stress is the importance of research.
The Sixth Framework Programme allocates funds to research: that is all well and good, but we need to insist that these funds for research increase, thanks, not least, to increased commitment from the Member States.
Mr President, first of all, like all of the other speakers, I want to congratulate Mrs JÃ¶ns on her undertaking, on her work and on her excellent report.
Breast cancer, Mr President, is the most common cancer in the European Union.
The report by Mrs JÃ¶ns highlights some very important information and several approaches the Member States would do well to consider.
Both the Public Health Programme 2000-2008 and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research are very appropriate arenas for proceeding with this task of reducing the effects of breast cancer.
Research and gene therapy will also help us.
We must also congratulate and thank the national and international cancer networks for their work, without which it would probably be impossible to make any headway.
However, we must agree on certain things, such as the age at which early detection programmes should begin.
Perhaps we are starting quite late in the day and we need to harmonise this therapy.
It is also important to harmonise the collection of data and to align the situation on the ground and the treatments used.
The disparities as regards the effect of breast cancer among the countries of the European Union and between these countries and the candidate countries are enormous.
It is vital that we work together to harmonise this situation.
Probably the most important aspects are health education, prevention, early detection, self-examination and, of course, mammography screening.
Rapid treatment is essential; there are many women who have few resources at hand in this respect, to teach them how to examine themselves and at what stage in their lives they need to seek treatment.
I therefore believe that it is vital for Mrs JÃ¶ns' work to follow this same path, because each and every one of us will benefit from it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0156/2003) by Mr Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (COM(2002) 377 - C5-0340/2002 - 2002/0141(COD)).
As there are problems with the airlines today, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that I will have to be very strict with time. In order to facilitate the presidency's work, I would therefore ask you to discipline yourselves and to stick strictly to the speaking time you have been allocated.
Mr President, I should like to apologise on behalf of Mr Byrne, who is unable to attend this important debate on healthy food due to previous commitments.
The question of healthy food has given rise to a great deal of interest and that is not unwarranted if we think about the crises that have hit the food industry over recent years.
The specific dossier we are debating today concerns official controls on food of animal origin.
The proposal contains special rules for controls on meat, shellfish, fisheries products and milk and dairy products, but of course the debate focuses on the problem of meat inspections.
The proposed system of official controls which are carried out at the fresh meat production stage has the following characteristics:
First, it is based on scientific data.
The official veterinarian has a central role in the overall supervision and inspection system.
It consists of official controls of the systems applied by the business itself and official inspection activities.
In other words, it concerns both the business and the public authorities.
It has espoused the 'from farm to fork' approach, it addresses both matters relating to health and the treatment of animals and it concerns the frequency and the intensity of official controls, which are dependent on the risks.
I know here that certain Members of the European Parliament will express concern about possible trends towards privatising official controls.
I should like to be absolutely categorical about this; there is no such danger.
The basic responsibility always lies with the public authorities and the objective is for there to be better allocation of the human resources of the public authorities, depending on the risk presented by the businesses, by which we mean their record of compliance with the rules.
Similarly, this system to which I refer, by which I mean official controls, is aligned with the authorities responsible for food legislation in general, especially as regards the question of responsibility, and provision is made for flexibility for small businesses as and where it is needed.
Similarly, I should like at this point to refer to the discussions and concerns of Members of the European Parliament about the required flexibility which small businesses need to have in comparison with large businesses, and to say that provision really is being made here for flexibility in relation to traditional methods of food production, businesses in remote areas and the need for structural changes within the businesses.
To leave the meat area, to which the basic comments I made earlier apply, let us say that the rules relating to shellfish have also been revised on the basis of scientific opinions.
These new rules mainly aim to protect consumers from risks associated with the consumption of these products.
I shall refer to the proposed amendments in my second intervention at the end of the debate, following the Members' comments.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking those who did such an excellent job of helping me with this report - Members in the political groups, the Commission and the Council.
I was pleased to hear the remarks of the Commissioner as well, because they seem to go in the same direction that we wish to take.
The proposal for a regulation is an integral and important part of the overall endeavour to improve food safety within the EU, product quality in third countries exporting to the EU and to establish European food legislation.
Its primary aim is to achieve better protection for consumers in relation to food products of animal origin for human consumption, and, as the Commissioner mentioned, the official veterinarian is at the heart of the system of official controls.
I think that he has the right technical qualifications and this approach is therefore to be welcomed.
The very detailed demands made on official veterinarians will have to lead to changes in study courses in the Member States. They are also necessary to ensure that scientific knowledge can be transposed into practice.
We should however be careful that official veterinarians, who have been carrying out their responsibilities conscientiously for many years, do not have to take more exams as a result of this proposal for a regulation.
The veterinarians are assisted by official auxiliaries in carrying out their inspections.
For this to work successfully, it is important that both groups of people can work independently.
Monitoring bodies that are in some way dependent on the business that is being monitored cannot, with the best will in the world, take an independent decision.
This is why I am firmly rejecting the idea that the establishment's own staff can be used or deployed in inspecting the slaughter of pigs and bovine animals in place of official monitors.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, you have plainly been guided by financial constraints on this point.
We have set out to increase food safety in the EU and with these measures you are going to achieve exactly the opposite, which is why we have to reject them.
We should remember that only precise independent findings through official controls focus more on the new concept of national, and ultimately European, risk analysis and are a key element in risk management.
This is also the basis upon which the effectiveness of the European Food Safety Authority depends.
The situation is different with the mandatory application of food business operators' own controls as an element of strengthening their individual responsibility for the wholesomeness and high quality of their products.
It should therefore be possible, where there is a reduced risk and own controls are taking place, to restrict official controls to checks on the findings of these own controls. This should be a free decision for the competent authority to take and not compulsory.
A risk-based flexible approach in official controls, based on the wholesomeness of the business's products, should always be the most important factor.
This is much better than an approach based on the intensity of production and also serves to strengthen the position of the competent authority.
Things are again different when traditional production methods are used on farms with lower production and in outlying geographical areas.
Here, the possibility of implementing the regulation is often restricted.
Exceptions to the rules should, however, be limited to flexibility in the attendance of an official inspector and the forwarding of information.
A reduction in hygiene levels cannot be accepted under any circumstances.
The concept of 'from stable to table' is an important basis for a high level of food safety.
The effectiveness of the system is dependent upon the quality of information going from the farmer to the shop, but - and I would like particularly to draw your attention to this - also back to the farmer.
This is essentially a new approach, one that requires constant emphasis.
The information should, however, be limited to criteria that are important for inspection of the slaughter and food safety.
Information about medical treatment which does not have food safety implications, for example the administering of iron tablets to piglets, does not have to be provided, reducing the amount of information involved.
I think that the greater inclusion of scientific competence in the food production process guarantees that the necessary information is submitted, which may well turn out to be different in each case.
A contentious issue in the EU until now has always been the number of staff for inspections, particularly in slaughterhouses.
I think that we should ask the Commission to make an objective proposal here along the lines of regions and farms.
I know that it is very difficult, but it cannot be avoided.
I am convinced that the new approach will, in any case, lead to an improvement in food safety in the EU.
I am grateful for the cooperation I have enjoyed, and I thank all of you for your attention.
Mr President, I wish to thank the general rapporteur and the lead committee for their work on this important proposal.
It is essential for the sake of consumers and, indeed, producers and suppliers that we have a sensible regime for the protection of public health.
In relation to fisheries and aquaculture products, there are some very particular challenges.
It may not always be appropriate simply to transpose controls which are designed for farmed animals to fishing and aquaculture products.
For example, some of the issues and challenges relating to fish diseases, dioxin levels and so forth are very specific and require regularly updated and verifiable scientific advice on which to base controls and toxin levels.
Bivalve molluscs by their nature pose particular challenges and perhaps the testing regime for scallops, for example, ought not to be identical to that for mussels or other species.
We have to look to species-specific controls in relation to bivalve molluscs.
The current proposal in relation to toxin levels was based on studies carried out in Canada and Japan on mussels, and the effects on the scallop industry of the type of controls which have been envisaged could be very significant.
We need to look very carefully at ensuring - for the sake of consumers but also those who depend on these industries for their livelihood - that risk-based measures are imposed which are reasonable in relation to the problems involved.
Mr President, Commissioner, the draft regulation before us today is an indispensable and highly important element in, as well as a logical consequence of, the endeavours to improve food safety undertaken in the wake of the various crises which have, I regret to say, affected us in the European food sector
Although, as I am keen to remind you, the European food chain is one of the world's safest, we deemed it necessary to take steps to improve traceability and labelling.
Admittedly, all the decisions taken testify to the European Parliament's political will, but they will bring no benefits if they are not correctly applied.
What is often lacking in terms of food safety, as in many other areas, is effective control over how existing legislation or regulations are applied.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, on the quality of his work in this area, which seeks to set up a rigorous monitoring system for both European and imported products.
We will not reap the full benefits of the new concept developed by the European Commission and often discussed in this field, 'from farm to table', without continuous, adequate monitoring of the food on the market, from when it is produced to when it is consumed.
If we are to restore consumer confidence, consumers must be able to say to themselves, when they buy meat or any other food, that they need have no qualms about believing the information provided on the product label.
Consumers must be able to feel sure that the products they are about to consume are healthy.
To achieve this, as the rapporteur has explained, it is essential to develop independent official inspections and also to increase the responsibility of operators in the sector.
I would highlight here the role of vets and the vital importance of independent inspections.
It is also helpful to show common sense by adopting rules which take into account the size of businesses and do not penalise smallholdings, since this problem occurs with SMEs.
I am pleased, therefore, that some such amendments have been adopted, just as I am pleased that the Commissioner has mentioned the flexibility required.
Obviously, these changes should not be to the detriment of consumer safety.
Effective communication of information and regular updating of lists of accredited establishments will make inspection and coordination between Member States much easier.
I believe that the aim of all this is to restore consumer confidence, and the system should ensure that safer products are placed on the market for each and everyone one of us consumers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by warmly congratulating the German veterinarians.
They have proved outstandingly capable of defending their professional interests.
Let me also thank Mr Schnellhardt.
In a number of respects I do not agree with his approach, but he has worked openly and conducted consultation in a very pleasant manner.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of all German veterinarians.
There is some misinformation about the content of the proposals in circulation.
The question therefore is whether the outcome of the vote today reflects Parliament's views.
To be perfectly clear: I am not speaking now on behalf of my group.
Mr Staes has already described it aptly: the flesh is weak.
To put it in even stronger terms, part of the meat sector is especially weak when it comes to dealing summarily with abuses itself.
Hormones, foreign proteins, water injections, impurities and harmful bacteria - they will all sound familiar to you.
We have collectively made food safety one of the cornerstones of our mandate.
We have succeeded in laying down the general principles of European food safety policy.
We have all decided that the producer has primary responsibility for his products.
That is a clear and good principle.
Today we are taking a decision about the way in which we in Europe organise our system for controlling products of animal origin.
In other words, where are we controlling, what are we controlling, and who is doing the controlling?
In the light of the general food legislation this question seems easy to answer.
The producer ensures that his beef steak, his pork steak and his fillet of chicken are in order and the government takes care of final control.
The Commission also wants to offer meat producers, and in particular the pig and calf farms, the scope under strict conditions to accept their responsibility themselves.
Part of the meat sector is indeed keen to accept responsibility and itself bring abuses to an end.
It is a pity that the rapporteur intends to nullify the opportunity that the Commission's proposal is presenting.
It is of course strange that we first decide to place general responsibility with the producers and that we are now, today, going to reverse it again.
For that reason alone I argue against Amendment No 135.
I understand that the German veterinarians and the British meat inspectors have still to accustom themselves to the idea that the meat sector can take responsibility for itself.
They think that staff of meat farms have no capability or are not in the position to monitor quality.
To be honest we think that we must in any event move away from authoritarian farms unwilling to tolerate any criticism of the quality of their products from their employees.
But separately from that, I ask everyone to think carefully.
The meat sector is a highly regulated and well-controlled sector, but there is no sector that is talked about so often on account of scandals.
The BBC recently showed a documentary about abuses in the Dutch poultry sector.
More government control will unfortunately not help to purge the sector of malpractice.
On the contrary, it will be counterproductive, because it removes responsibility from farms.
I think that we must place the responsibility with the producer in a way that is recognisable for consumers.
I therefore ask you to consider Amendment No 127.
We must remove meat from anonymity, for that is the most effective way of improving safety and quality.
If pork steak or fillet of chicken are placed on the market under a clear brand name, it is of the greatest importance for the producer to handle meat very carefully.
Currently farms that fiddle can carry on regardless, because the consumer has absolutely no idea where his fillet of chicken comes from.
Which means that we keep having complaints and incidents.
Naming and shaming is an extremely effective way of improving food safety and quality.
To be perfectly clear, the individual responsibility of farms does not of course replace public responsibility and public control.
Finally, I should like the meat sector to take a critical look at itself.
We must of course take a critical look at ourselves as well.
Our way of working is not very transparent.
The quantity of amendments is too great and too many of them are simply technical in nature.
It is absurd that today we are voting on the position of the health stamp on the rabbit leg, on the testing of meat from hermaphrodite pigs and on the suitability of the udder for human consumption in the event of brucellosis infection.
If we fail to concentrate on the political outlines, our work can only be judged by the meat sector and the veterinarians themselves.
It is therefore very easy to spread misinformation, but, as this is of no help to the consumer, this is where policy itself comes into play.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must be lavish with my praise of Mr Schnellhardt, rapporteur for this and the two previous reports, for the soundly thought-through piece of work that he has done and that we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support almost 100%.
There are certain small details about which we do not agree, but these are so insignificant that I do not need to list them.
I think you have done some incredibly constructive work on all three of these reports, which are technically difficult and which are incredibly important for everyone in Europe.
The fact is that we normally eat at least three times a day.
Scandals crop up again and again.
As Mrs Corbey said, adding things to meat is the big thing right now.
Water and artificial proteins are injected, as if meat were not protein in itself.
In the light of this, there is only one route to go down, and that is one of total openness in our systems.
When we come across fraud and when labelling and declarations of content are not in accordance with the contents of the package, we must make the public, that is to say the consumers, aware of the fact.
There must be a system of naming and shaming for those businesses that are careless.
In financial terms, the EU is at present in danger of benefiting the 'bad guys' and penalising the 'good guys', and we must be extremely careful not to do this.
I shall appeal once more for complete transparency.
For example, our ordinary food law is extremely transparent.
Let us not therefore be deflected in our course.
There is a lot to be said for the view that the best inspector is the person who is to buy and eat the product.
Clear and focused legislation is needed, because we all know that the real inspections take place on the ground, locally and regionally.
Whatever titles and job descriptions the inspectors may have, they need to be backed by very clear and robust legislation that leaves no one in any doubt as to their authority and rights.
When it comes to small businesses, I must ask that we turn some of our attention to my own report, which will be appearing shortly and which deals with the costs of the inspections.
It is not right to exempt small traditional businesses from the rules governing hygiene.
They must, however, be exempted from unduly high costs.
Mr President, we have a very good report here, thanks in large part to the rapporteur, who leaves us in no doubt that he understands this matter in practice as well as theory.
It has just been said that we have to distinguish between businesses on the basis of size.
I would be cautious about this though, as it is a question of transparency rather than size.
We talk about creating transparency through the 'from stable to table' concept.
Well, small businesses are transparent precisely because consumers understand them and have direct contact with them. If something is wrong, they report it.
Mr Schnellhardt, you write that 'confidence is good, control is better'.
I would agree with this, but nevertheless, confidence has to be discerning.
We have to know in whom we can put our trust.
The big problem is that meat is marketed anonymously and no one actually understands how.
This anonymity is a cover for business deals that are criminal and practices that only just border on legality and of which the consumer would certainly not approve.
We have just heard about water with protein being added to chicken in order to sell something cheap at an expensive price, and protein so subverted that it is not possible to detect the DNA or determine from which species of animal it comes.
These examples show how the ethics in food consumption - if I may use this expression - are being abused as a result of this anonymity and at the cost of the consumer's health.
And that is why it is a question of increasing not just confidence, but legitimate confidence.
This has to do with making consumers more discerning.
Of course, producers do have responsibility, and we have talked here about their individual responsibility, but so do consumers, who have to take responsibility for their health by informing themselves.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the key point in food safety is official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, which is the subject of the Schnellhardt report that we are considering today.
The four annexes to the regulation concern fresh meat, molluscs, fisheries and milk and milk products.
I will just mention the few points that I see as most important.
First of all, regarding primary production, an exception should be entered in the regulation.
I think that primary production of foodstuffs for private use, and the direct supply by the producer of small quantities to the final consumer or local shops and restaurants should be considered as traditional food production which should have specific sales rules.
I therefore support Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Moreover, the competent authorities within each Member State are, in my view, best placed to assess the situation and decide on the restrictions that will best protect consumers.
I also feel it is essential to include the notion of small, traditional establishments in the regulation, allowing sufficient flexibility without endangering or diminishing food safety for consumers.
This notion of the small establishment will ensure the survival of the small abattoirs spread evenly across the territory.
Let us not, therefore, move towards regulations that are too strict and too difficult to implement, which will lead to the closure of local abattoirs.
Maintaining these abattoirs would simplify matters as there would be no need to legislate on maximum distances and times for transporting livestock heads by lorry.
Let us be honest: the only way we are going to make progress is by shortening the food chain.
With this in mind, it is important to compensate the producers and farmers who achieve better results when assessed by granting them a reduction in the costs arising from official controls.
This should not, of course, be done to the detriment of food safety.
The approval of establishments is another difficult question.
Who should be responsible for it?
Should it be at Community level or national level?
Where does subsidiarity fit in?
I prefer the option of dual responsibility, which would oblige the Member States to keep an up to date list of approved establishments, while putting forward their own national regulations on controls.
However, I think it would be counter-productive for the Commission to oblige the Member States to provide the names of the establishments in a single electronic format. It is sufficient for the Member States to exchange lists.
There is also no justification for administrative sanctions for failures to comply with the hygiene principles.
Administrative closures of abattoirs and publishing sanctions are solely the responsibility of the Member States.
The thorny issue of imports of products of animal origin from third countries is effectively dealt with.
The Member States will have a list of approved, inspected and certified establishments, taking into account the hygiene, production and storage rules applied in the third countries.
I am, however, more concerned regarding animal welfare, which should not come before food safety, and regarding the pre-eminent role of the inspecting vet.
I think that official assistant vets should be able to take part in ante mortem inspections in abattoirs.
This is already the case in France and I do not see why this should be questioned.
I support the rapporteur on Amendments Nos 111 to 114 on game, which propose the analysis of residues not resulting from the actual hunting process.
Still on the subject of game, I do, however, have reservations regarding the Commission's proposal, and in particular the presence of aged open fractures.
In principle, if they are aged, these fractures are no longer open, and are therefore healed.
There are no longer any risks in terms of food.
Also, regarding the formation of gas in the gastro-intestinal tract, you will be aware that hunters eviscerate the game immediately as a food safety precaution and I do not see how the inspecting or official vet can therefore monitor the presence of gas in the gastro-intestinal tract.
Regarding the presence of the listed parasites that are dangerous to health, I think that it would be good to attach the list as an annex, in order to prevent difficulties with interpretation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, who has drawn upon his professional background to produce a very technically sound report.
Adequate food controls are important in order to guarantee the greatest possible protection of consumers.
They ensure the safety, for example, of raw meat, game, molluscs, milk and dairy products.
In future, therefore, food producers and processors will have to reveal all the different steps involved in their work.
Details will have to be noted about the feedingstuffs used and the state of health of the animals.
It will then be possible to trace food and its component parts back to the place of origin, in accordance with the transparent production chain.
This is the only way for food authorities to react faster when there is a problem or to detect shortcomings in quality as soon as possible and to remove them.
In the Commission's proposal, it is emphasised that small- and medium-sized enterprises are most affected, and, for them, the new hygiene rules represent a huge burden.
The increase in expenditure will, however, result in a significant increase in food safety for the consumer, provided that the demands on businesses are bearable and affordable.
Against this background, the rapporteur and I have jointly tabled some amendments, which take into consideration the flexibility that is essential for artisanal small businesses without, however, reducing the hygiene requirements.
I think it is important that these artisanal small businesses should be recognised in the definition of the Regulation.
We do have large slaughterhouses in Europe, but we also have a host of small butcher's shops.
That is why there has to be some flexibility to adapt official controls to the size of the business.
Inspecting a large slaughterhouse, in which thousands of animals are slaughtered and processed on a daily basis, is in nature and intensity different to inspecting an artisanal small business, in which fewer animals are processed.
There also has to be flexibility with regard to the frequency of controls on smaller businesses.
We need a rule stipulating when a business is to be inspected and by whom.
An inspection plan from the competent authorities, which has been preceded by a risk analysis, should be sufficient.
Health-based requirements should only be involved if they are actually relevant for people's health.
What I expect from this Regulation is greater individual responsibility for producers and processors.
European consumers will benefit directly from this.
However, I am also very concerned that we, as legislators, should give consideration to the traditional small-business structure in Europe, in order to guarantee that both the production and supply of food is sustainable, adequate and safe, even in the less-populated areas of Europe.
Mr President, this report has been somewhat controversial and the many amendments show that it remains so today.
Food safety is a key priority for consumers and this regulation will lay down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.
Food scares are only too familiar to European Union consumers.
Just a few weeks ago the BBC TV programme Panorama exposed a scandal connected with poultry.
It found that chickens for human consumption have been injected with beef and pork protein.
The programme revealed how processors were pumping chickens full of water in an effort to make them look bigger.
There is still much to be done to protect consumer safety throughout the European Union and in the enlargement countries.
If we want proper European Union rules for the organisation of controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, we need a directive which will promote consumer confidence and prevent scandals from happening.
However, it is widely recognised that these controls are carried out differently in the different Member States.
In some they are carried out by a veterinarian, in others by highly-skilled and qualified meat inspectors.
There is growing concern, of which the rapporteur is very much aware, that the independence of meat inspectors in the UK could be put on the line with this report.
As their representatives have said, at the moment their independence gives them powers which they would not have if they were employed by the firm where they are working.
For example, one meat inspector told me that she would stop a production line if a chicken head had not been cut off properly - something which should be welcomed given the importance of this House places on animal welfare.
Similarly, if there is a problem with the quality of meat, the inspector has the power to stop that piece of meat moving from the production line to the supermarket.
If the inspectors lost their independence and were employed by the firms in which they worked, food safety would go out of the window to increase profit.
This report should be welcomed; but we must recognise the difference between Member States in terms of controls and the importance in the UK of retaining the independence of the meat inspectorate.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his report - one aspect of which has a particular significance for my constituency in Wales - and, as other Members have covered most aspects of the report, I would like to focus on that particular issue.
The report covers animal products other than meat, including aquaculture.
As we have had particular problems in Wales concerning the testing of cockles, this is very important for us at this time.
The harvesting of cockles is a long-standing and much-valued industry in coastal areas of Wales, such as the Burry Inlet and the Welsh Dee.
About 3 000 people are employed directly, mainly small businesses and self-employed people.
However, for two years the major cockle fisheries in these areas have been closed, causing significant hardship and even bankruptcy.
The cause of the closure was the discovery of unidentified toxins during testing, even though not a single case of illness has been reported.
Directive 2002/225/EC allows for either of two different test methods to be used to detect toxins, and the method used in the UK has been seriously questioned in recent months.
As an earlier speaker mentioned, public and producer confidence is essential.
The main issue here, and the one relevant to this report, is that to date there is no standard toxicity test for bivalve safety within the EU.
This has meant that during the period when the cockle beds have been closed in Wales, cockles from other EU countries, which have not been subject to the same tests, could be, and have been, imported into Wales and sold.
The purpose of this report is to improve controls under the food hygiene package, and our first priority is the health of the public.
To do that we need very clear and detailed rules, but there must be a level playing field across Europe, and in this case that means a harmonised and more effective method of testing.
This report will take us in that direction and it is very welcome.
Mr President, I wish to begin with a point of order.
I understand that there is now to be no debate on the Malliori report.
Mrs Malliori's report has been parodied and attacked in some countries, including my own, and we are owed a small debate on it.
I am sorry that is not possible, and I know Mrs Malliori will want to speak about this.
I salute Mr Schnellhardt for his report and diligence.
I agree with almost everything he says.
On the margin, there are some areas - for example the attendance of veterinarians, fallen stock, etc. where there might be too much regulation.
However, when it comes to the inspection of the premises where foodstuffs are being prepared, there must be independent examination.
In my own country audits conducted by our Food Safety Authority have shown frequent evasions and omissions in terms of the way in which food is prepared, specific risk materials are dealt with and other matters are looked at.
We are told that nowadays we can relate everything to safety within the plant, the employees and so on. Who would dare to question the right and power of the employees to report on devious practices within their own plant?
The fact is, as has been referred to in this debate, the preparation of some foodstuffs - as shown, for example, in the Panorama programme - has been quite disgraceful.
I do not believe that employees in those plants would be courageous enough and willing to report these practices to authority.
Therefore, we need independent inspectors; we do not need to remove them from the meat and veal sector.
If we are wise in this regard, we will stick to the principle that beyond the HACCP system there always needs to be independent inspection of last resort.
The consumer demands it, public safety requires it.
Mr President, I should like to compliment the Commission on its proposal and I hope that Parliament will not depart from it too much.
The Commission is demonstrating progressive insight, that is, you can increase the control of food and certainly of meat by placing greater responsibility with the people who have to carry out the control.
On this point I should like to echo the words of our group spokesperson, Mrs GrossetÃªte.
On the basis of Christian Democratic principles you could say that you want to place more individual responsibility where it belongs.
This means that farms that are well organised, that have a good branding system, can do more themselves and that at the same time there must be scope for small enterprises to continue their work.
It also means that the present way of working in poultry meat will have to be extended to veal and pork.
It further means that responsibility as regards the from-the-land-to-the-plate guarantee must be made good and at the same time that no deviations can be tolerated in the so-called INR system.
I do not entirely agree with the rapporteur's position that a veterinarian should have the final decision as to whether or not an animal is safe for the food chain in cases where there is no question of airtight administrative processing.
After all, you cannot see everything on the outside.
I am against Amendment No 135 and in favour of Amendment No 127, and I anticipate the vote with confidence.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, is of course part of a far larger project.
Mr Schnellhardt's education makes him an expert, which is why his reports are extremely sound and often, perhaps, even a little too technical for the layman.
But that probably says more about him than about us!
I would like, therefore, to start by congratulating him on the document we have before us.
We need food safety.
This is something that we are all aware of, and that we support.
This report is even more significant, though, because meat, milk and fish are basic foodstuffs.
Professional controls are of crucial importance here.
To adopt highly comprehensive standards is not enough if, at the same time, we either ignore controls and sanctions or take insufficient notice of them.
Official controls are in the safe hands of veterinarians here and I hope they are duly appreciated, even by the consumer.
Mr President, of course I completely understand that fellow Members coming in to the room might not give much attention to the subject under discussion. I am frequently in the same boat as them.
But if you could at least see to it that the noise level improves, I might even be able to hear myself speak above this terrible din.
I had hoped that you might at least listen to me, Mr President, as Mrs Diamantopoulou is doing.
(The President cut off the speaker and called for quiet in the Chamber)
Thank you, Mr President.
The problem of the size and transparency of businesses has been touched upon many times.
Commissioner, I think that we simply need more flexibility for smaller businesses.
We cannot treat large slaughterhouses like artisanal small businesses.
I would ask you, therefore, to give appropriate consideration to creating the conditions for small- and medium-sized businesses to survive, whilst, at the same time, taking into account the vital matter of consumer protection.
Mr President, I shall try to be very brief and to the point, by omitting any reference to amendments on which we agree and concentrating on the amendments on which there are certain reservations.
Let us start with the question of flexibility for small businesses raised by the last speaker and by numerous other Members of the European Parliament.
We totally agree on the need to safeguard the flexibility of small businesses, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the first and second package of health rules.
I referred in my first intervention to special cases in which flexibility is addressed with particular sensitivity.
Thus, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3, 11, 12 and 138, provided that certain changes are made to their wording.
A new definition of artisanal small businesses, however, as proposed in the amendment, is not considered necessary.
A second basic element to which numerous speakers referred concerns the role of the official veterinarian in abattoirs.
The Commission can support the introduction of flexibility in risk analysis.
I referred to this in my first intervention and this will apply to both large and small businesses.
The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 134, 141 and 142.
Amendments Nos 85 and 86 are not accepted, because we believe that they will restrict flexibility without any justification.
As far as the use of the business's staff to carry out certain control duties is concerned, the Commission expresses its satisfaction because there is agreement with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Point 6 of Amendment No 21 on poultry meat and rabbit meat is not in keeping with the approach which has been adopted for fresh meat, as provided for in Annex I to the proposal.
The proposal in Amendment No 87 to separate production and control responsibilities within the business is considered particularly constructive.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 127, 135, 136, 139 and 140 because they are not in keeping with the line taken by the Committee on the Environment or the line taken by the Commission and the authorities responsible for European feedingstuffs legislation.
I would therefore ask you to re-analyse the content of these amendments and not to proceed to vote for them.
As regards the information which must be provided when animals are slaughtered, the Commission can also agree to allow flexibility.
However, the relevant arrangements must not undermine the system as a whole.
Consequently, Amendments Nos 71, 72, 73, 101, 102, 103 and 107 are not accepted.
Now to the question of marine biotoxins in shellfish.
The Commission text is based on scientific proof.
This applies to the serious risks affecting food safety.
The introduction of excessive flexibility at this point is of no benefit to consumers; consequently, the Commission does not accept Amendment No 6, the first part of Amendment No 122 or Amendment No 123.
Amendments Nos 4, 25 and 70 repeat the requirements already provided for in our proposal for official controls to be carried out on feedingstuffs and food which the Commission submitted last March.
Finally, as regards the recurring question of comitology, the Commission considers that one major issue is its having the possibility to take measures to implement or adjust annexes, so that they can take account of current scientific developments.
I would say that the Commission does, in fact, have a problem with the proposal by the Committee on the Environment proposing that this order be abolished.
Consequently, we do not agree with Amendment No 38 but we do agree with Amendment No 130.
The Commission's position on all the amendments may be obtained from the secretariat.
Mr President, the recommendations on health are some of the most important action points in the White Paper on food safety.
My thanks to Mr Schnellhardt and all the members of this committee who helped with this dossier, which is especially important to producers and consumers.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mrs Malliori would like to make a point of order.
Mr President, I am sorry that, because of the time, we have a change to the agenda and my report will have to be postponed until 3 in the afternoon.
I would ask, citing Rule 145 of the Rules of Procedure and on behalf of my political group, for my report, which is outside the compromise package and concerns labelling, to be voted without debate and would merely ask the Commission to make the relevant statement.
Thank you, Mrs Malliori.
Mr President, I have been approached by several colleagues who are concerned at the level of lobbying outside the entrance to Parliament.
I would like to respectfully request colleagues and those who are lobbying for the signing of the register to allow Members the leeway and the freedom to sign these resolutions without having to go through 'a wall of fire' to get into the Chamber.
I am sorry to have to raise this issue, but it is becoming a bit of a problem for us, and I notice that quite a number of colleagues are concerned about it.
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say this.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, you are completely right, as always.
Mr President, I would like to come back to Mrs Malliori's request.
I spoke on this subject about a week ago, to be exact on the last day of the part-session.
The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday, but not adhered to by Thursday.
I believe it is inaccurate for Mrs Malliori to say that her report is being postponed until this afternoon.
Today's agenda states that the time allocated to all reports - from Mrs JÃ¶ns's through to Mrs Fourtou's - is 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., which gives us until 4.30 p.m. to discuss this report.
If it becomes the accepted thing to request that reports are dealt with without debate in order to be finished by 12 noon on Thursday, then people should say on Monday that a debate is not required when we are adopting the agenda.
Last time, I said that this was a dangerous precedent, and indeed it is one.
We have had two hours for the topical and urgent debate on the reform of the Rules of Procedure taken away from us for nothing, on the grounds that this time was needed for other work, and leaving us with just one hour.
This time should then either be used or given back for the topical and urgent debate.
Mr Posselt spoke against the proposal by Mrs Malliori.
Do you wish to speak on the same issue, Mrs McKenna?
Do you wish to speak in favour of the proposal?
Mr President, on this point I do not mind what we do.
Mrs Malliori would like this to be passed through Parliament today and she has to leave this afternoon.
She is anxious that it should get through under the Greek presidency.
I do not want to be difficult in saying that we would vote against it, but, as Mr Posselt has said, we have to be careful about setting precedents.
As Mrs Malliori has said, the key thing is that we would like from the Commission a clear statement on the labelling.
The Commission has made commitments concerning labelling in other legislation.
We would like a statement from the Commission on this now, regardless of what this Chamber decides on and whether or not we have a debate.
.
Mr President, the rapporteur has today tabled a package of amendments to which both the Council and the Commission can agree.
The Commission would like to thank Mrs Malliori and would ask the honourable Members to support her efforts.
On the question of labelling, the Commission cannot support Amendment No 12, for the following reason: The Commission is of the opinion that if a food has a smoky taste, the consumer should be informed whether the product contains smoke flavourings or has been smoked conventionally.
However, in order to maintain the consistency of our legislative framework, this should be addressed in the Labelling Directive and not in the current proposal.
The Commission is currently developing a proposal for legislation including an amendment to the Labelling Directive so that the term 'smoke flavourings' would have to appear in the list of ingredients if the smoky taste of the food was due to the addition of smoke flavourings.
Thank you, Commissioner.
As there was a speech against the proposal by Mrs Malliori and one in favour, we shall proceed directly to the vote on her proposal in the sense that her report is to be voted on without a debate.
The proposal by Mrs Malliori is approved and her report will be put to the vote without a debate.
Mr President, I have just two points, which are however important because they are questions of principle.
Firstly, in future we should decide on Monday whether a matter is important enough to require debate or not.
On Monday, we scheduled this matter for Thursday afternoon, so why are we cancelling it now?
If it is important, it makes no difference whether it is discussed in the morning or in the afternoon.
Secondly - and this is a crucial point which I last brought up during another debate on a Thursday afternoon - you have, or your predecessor has, just taken a vote which is not permissible.
According to our Rules of Procedure, only the President of Parliament can decide whether to cancel a debate.
It is his decision alone, and there are extremely important reasons for this.
We voted to establish the agenda on Monday and I have to clarify whether or not this decision to change it is the President's.
According to the Rules of Procedure, this decision is his alone, but in this case he has not taken on that responsibility.
(Applause)
We will not debate this any further, Mr Posselt.
In my opinion you have misread the Rules.
The term 'President' applies to the individual who is in the Chair at that time, so it is 'President' or 'Vice-President'.
Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca rightly applied Rule 145.
As to the point about being flexible or rigid, we need to keep some flexibility in our agenda
The next item is the vote.
Report (A5-0179/2003) by Caroline F. Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 as regards the critical uses and export of halons, the export of products and equipment containing chlorofluorocarbons and controls on bromochloromethane (COM(2002) 642 - C5-0554/2002 - 2002/0268(COD))

(Parliament adopted the text)
Report (A5-0156/2003) by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (COM(2002) 377 - C5-0340/2002 - 2002/041(COD))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0122/2003) by Minerva Melpomeni Malliori, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on smoke flavourings used or intended for use in or on foods (COM(2002) 400 - C5-0348/2002 - 2002/0163(COD))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
After the vote:
Mr President, I do apologise, but I would like to stress that the vote was illegal, because minorities are guaranteed the right to freedom of expression.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, on a point of order, I have it on excellent authority that overnight an updated text has been published by the Commission on this most important and key horizontal regulation.
It deals with changes in set-aside, WTO proofing, changes in leasing of land and a whole range of other issues.
We have yet to see this document.
I would like Commissioner Fischler to tell us whether it will affect the outcome of what we are about to vote on today As our Permanent Representatives and agricultural attachÃ©s have just received this document this morning, we have had no chance to consider it.
I can explain this very quickly.
There is no new Commission proposal.
What has been sent out is just a record of what has been discussed so far in the Council's working group, and it does not have any bearing upon the text that we are voting on here.
Mr President, the next vote is on Amendment No 33.
Part 3 of the preamble to this amendment concerns an external source of protection.
The German version of the text reads 'suitable external source of protection' and the original text reads 'qualified external source of protection'.
The two things are not the same, and therefore I should like the German version to be corrected so that it is in line with the original, even though it may not read like good German.
I should also like this point to be recorded in the minutes.
The secretariat tells me that you are correct.
The services were already aware of this and will ensure that all language versions correspond.
Before the vote on the legislative resolution:
Mr President, we have tried to work closely with Mr Cunha and the other rapporteurs to ensure that when we take the final vote on this we comply with Rule 63a of our Rules of Procedure.
The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets state that the figures do comply with the financial perspectives up to 2006.
However, during this vote several amendments have been adopted which have not been assessed.
The assessments are carried out in conjunction with the Commission to ensure that the figures are within the financial perspective.
In the light of the votes on these amendments, could the Commission inform us whether those figures remain within the financial perspective?
If they do, that is fine; if they do not, then the wording needs to be changed from 'do comply' to 'do not comply', for factual reasons if nothing else.
If Commissioner Fischler does not know the answer now, I suggest, if the House agrees with Mr Cunha, that when the assessment is finalised we make sure that the correct wording goes in the final text for the Official Journal.
That seems perfectly reasonable.
Unless there are strong objections, it makes sense to ensure that the text corresponds with what we have decided on.
Mr President, I think that the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets is right.
The purpose of the amendments that we adopted is clearly that ultimately everything should remain within the budget.
I would therefore say that there will be sufficient room for manoeuvre in this matter to amend, shall we say, the wording, should this be necessary, to ensure that this is the case.
Mr President, it is exactly the same point.
Four amendments have been voted which are in addition to what the committee voted.
Our amendments say they are compatible.
Unless we can get an assurance right now that they are, then we need to change the wording to 'not'.
Can I ask you to follow the same procedure?
This will apply to all the other reports on this item and will save me from constantly getting up.
- I am always in favour of preventing you having to jump up and down, so your point has been noted, Mr Wynn.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)

Report (A5-0189/2003) by MarÃ­a RodrÃ­guez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on multifunctional agriculture and the reform of the CAP (2003/2048(INI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, during the debate on the Oostlander report yesterday the rapporteur asked me whether I wanted to submit Amendment No 11 - which was intended as a replacement for paragraph 52 - as an addition to paragraph 52.
I said at the time that I was willing to do so.
Afterwards uncertainty arose about how the text of paragraph 52 would then read once Amendment No 11, again as an addition, had been adopted.
To avoid any misunderstanding therefore, I should like to read out the text of paragraph 52 in English as it would read following adoption of Amendment No 11 as an addition to paragraph 52.
Mr President, I would like to make it clear that, if this is an addition, my group will agree to it.
Mr President, I initially assented to an addition, but since the word 'conditions' has been added here to the added texts, I do not think that this is the proposal that we discussed yesterday.
I am therefore against the submission of this oral amendment.
There seems to be some confusion as to whether this is an oral amendment.
Mr President, it is not an oral amendment!
We shall thus vote on Amendment No 11 as an addition.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution
Mr President, I asked to briefly take the floor to say that I have agreed to the deletions in Articles 10, 17 and 34 and Recital C proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I will shortly table a compromise oral amendment to Amendment No. 32.
Mr President, I therefore propose removing the obligatory aspect of my proposal and at the same time clarifying the content in the following format: 'calls on the Member States to introduce the gender dimension into the broadcasting of sporting competitions'.
Mr President, I apologise for coming back to the same problem.
I certainly do not wish to be difficult.
However, the right to freedom of expression is highly protected.
Even if, for example, the Conference of Presidents decides to deal with a report without debate, this decision can be overturned by 32 Members. Now though, a new procedure is creeping in.
On Monday, we decide to debate a matter on Thursday afternoon and Members assume that this debate is going to take place.
But on Thursday afternoon, a Member says that they do not wish to have the debate because they have to leave. That is what happened last time, and it happened this week too.
The agenda stipulates that, if this happens, just one speaker should be called upon to speak for each group.
But this procedure is not being followed either, and instead, we are referred to a rule which says that the agenda can also be changed on a proposal from the President.
But firstly this was not a proposal from the President, secondly it must remain an exception, thirdly the President gave no reason, and fourthly I have to say that there was no important reason.
When I asked you about it, your answer was simply that we needed 'to keep some flexibility in our agenda'.
This is about the right of freedom of expression, a right guaranteed to minorities.
I would very much like the Bureau to clarify under what conditions the President can propose that a point be taken off an agenda that has been jointly decided by us on Monday, and whether or not he has to give his reasons for doing so.
Otherwise this minority right will be regularly set aside on Thursday afternoons if there happens to be a majority vote in favour of it.
Then we might as well forget all the articles protecting this minority right in the Rules of Procedure, particularly Article 111.
We are not going to agree, Mr Posselt, because I stand by my original interpretation of Rule 145.
However, I am happy to send this to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for its interpretation.
Rule 145 makes it very clear, however, that at any time during a debate the list of speakers may be closed.
We had a proposal from the floor that the President then adopted in his own name and put before the House.
The House then voted in accordance with Rule 145.
I am not going to debate this with you, Mr Posselt, because I want to go for lunch, and I am not going to agree with you.
As I said, I shall refer the matter to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Mr President, regarding the question that Mr Posselt has raised, I would just like to say that I think you acted correctly.
I would, however, prefer to give my opinion on this matter later in view of the votes that still have to be taken.
In the new Rules of Procedure, there is a provision allowing the Council and Commission speaking time to comment on the report after we have heard from the rapporteur.
There seem to be more and more cases now where the rapporteur speaks for five minutes, and then the Council for fifteen minutes and the Commission for ten to fifteen minutes, and often not even really on the subject of the report.
This means that Members themselves are receiving less and less time to discuss it.
I would therefore ask that the speechwriters of the Commission and Council Presidency be told to comply as far as possible with the speaking time of five minutes, with a maximum time of ten minutes.
Otherwise a good provision in our new Rules of Procedure is misused to give lengthy explanations, which often have nothing to do with the report.
I would ask the President, if he agrees with me, to notify both institutions of this.
This is a matter that has been debated in the Conference of Presidents before, and it could be debated in that context again.
All we can do, in terms of the other institutions, is give them an indicative speaking time before debates.
We cannot enforce a speaking time on them.
Mr President, the three times that Mr Posselt stood up I did not respond, but on the fourth occasion I should very much like to do so, because we all know that this is not really a question of how long the debates here last.
Mr Posselt is concerned about whether Strasbourg will remain the meeting place of the European Parliament.
In the first place it seems important to me that the democratically taken decisions of this assembly are respected.
It also seems important to me that those who find it so terribly important that we continue to meet in Strasbourg actually turn up.
As you know, most of the French and German Members are the greatest advocates of this assembly in Strasbourg, but they are not present at the moment.
This is in contrast to those who would like to meet in Brussels.
Mr President, I would like to support Mr Posselt's position in contesting the procedure that was used at the last moment, when a debate was scheduled on the subject.
Whatever the subject and whatever the debate, insofar as a text has to be debated, I find it unacceptable that, simply for reasons of convenience, it should be decided at the last minute that there will be no debate.
This was a question of convenience.
Parliament should not establish agendas and organise the sitting according to the convenience of individuals.
Second point: I think that this shows, once again, that the agenda for Thursday afternoons indicates a clear desire to devoid this sitting of meaning, which is quite unacceptable.
All the reports to be dealt with on Thursday afternoon should be treated with equal dignity.
As there are few reports, so-called less important reports, Parliament empties and the reports, particularly those dealing with human rights, and others, are not subject to any debate worthy of the name for the purpose of establishing positions.
Of course, Mr van Hulten explained the problem very well: a constant desire to violate the Treaty and to prevent Strasbourg's right as a seat of Parliament from being recognised, including on Monday afternoons.
Again, we can clearly see the scheming that is taking place.
As you know, Mrs Gillig, I was not in the Chair when the decision was taken, but I am 100% behind the ruling of the Vice-President in the Chair at the time.
He was applying the Rules.
It is not for the President to judge whether the Rules are wise, but to apply the Rules, and he applied them as they stand.
If there is a dispute about the interpretation of the Rules I am happy to refer that to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
We can debate the wisdom of removing things from the agenda, but the Rules provide for that.
That is all the President did - apply the existing Rules.
Mr President, in my opinion, Mr van Hulten's approach is not the right one.
This does not have to do with those who were in favour of Fridays, but who were never here then. It has to do with those who were not in favour of Fridays but who now treat Thursday in the same way they used to treat Friday, that is, by being absent.
Today, some of the leading players who were not in favour of Fridays have been gone since midday.
We need to finally get through to these people!
.
(PT) This report on the financial participation of employees makes a significant contribution to overcoming the capital versus labour split.
Employees who participate in both the profits and the capital of companies will be more motivated and more productive and consequently the company will be more competitive and profitable.
Furthermore, financial participation contributes to achieving two aims: completing the European social model and increasing employment.
This is a sound report and I have therefore voted in favour of it.
I share the principles stated for funding financial participation models, specifically: participation must be voluntary, schemes must be clear, transparent and simple, unreasonable risks for employees and a pro-cyclical impact linked to fluctuations in the economic climate should be avoided, and schemes must be compatible with worker mobility.
I regret, however, that the European Commission has proposed few solutions for SMEs, since studies need to be carried out on the various forms of participation in SMEs and because alternatives must be considered.
.
(PT) Following recent reports that have called into question the reliability of the controls organised in various Member States, updating the rules on official controls of products of animal origin is crucial, particularly in the case of fresh meat, bivalve molluscs and milk.
I welcome the proposal for a regulation and, of the new rules, I would highlight the role given to veterinarians, the increased intensity and frequency of controls, the sound scientific basis of controls and greater flexibility for small companies.
.
(PT) This proposal for a directive forms part of the process of updating Community legislation on general food hygiene rules, on health policy issues related to the marketing of products of animal origin and on official controls of products of animal origin.
Simplifying bureaucracy and, at the same time, maintaining high standards in this field are of particular importance, since we now have incontrovertible proof that the standards of hygiene presented to the consuming public have not always been uniform or reliable.
The measures recommended in the proposal will consequently enable us to hold all those involved at any stage of the food chain more accountable, allowing for higher levels of consumer confidence, which has been dealt severe blows by recent crises.
We will, therefore, have to promote coherence and transparency when implementing this new legal framework, not forgetting the specific needs of small producers, who tend to be further removed from the places where information is disseminated and changes to legislation are made.
I believe that the European Commission must consider the proposal for an amendment put forward by the rapporteur, focusing on the need to allow States to adapt to the new rules.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
(PT) Authorisation for smoke flavourings in food is at the moment totally deregulated in the European Union - some Member States have restrictions in place and others have no legislation at all in this area.
A definition of legislation was therefore needed, so that the authorisation procedure could be harmonised.
I also welcome the definition of a positive list produced by the European Food Safety Authority and based on the latest scientific knowledge.
It is therefore to be hoped that the precautionary principle - the basis for every European food policy - will also apply whenever a new application for a smoke flavouring is made.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which highlights the importance of clarifying rules in the field of human health.
I therefore agree, in addition to the technical issues, with the rapporteur's suggestion that medical devices should be reclassified.
She proposes a legal framework and that a distinction should be made between medical devices having a pharmacological effect, and others.
Similarly, I agree with the idea that Member States should adopt the measures necessary to ensure that single-use devices are not reused.
Lastly, I decided also to support the report when it states that it is crucial to include explicit provisions on public access to documents.
Distributing and promoting information to the citizens, especially in this field, must be pursued as a priority, in order to ensure both citizen participation and the high level of consumer protection we wish to see.
We are critical of the aforementioned reports on the reform of the common agricultural policy.
In our view, the reports represent an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not match the conditions and needs of modern global society.
As an example, mention might be made of the protectionist demand for 'an overall area-based compensatory payment for rice producers and ? a fixed import duty', together with the emphasis upon the system of import duties and export subsidies as a way of stabilising the internal market in relation to the price fluctuations on the world market.
In comparison, the Commission's proposal appears as a step in the right direction.
We have therefore chosen to vote against these reports in their entirety.
Mr President, the proposals for the reform of the CAP made by Mr Fischler are being driven by the World Trade Organisation, and farmers need to realise that should be their real target.
I am disturbed that the Commissioner shows more concern for trade liberalisation than good farming practice.
EU environmental and food safety laws can form a safety net between farming and the World Trade Organisation.
Farmers need to wake up and stop opposing environmental legislation, such as the nitrates directive, and realise that these laws could protect them against the WTO.
The principle of cross-compliance, which means compliance with environmental and safety laws, is an important part of Parliament's proposals.
The Commission is right to propose making compliance with relevant food safety rules a must for receiving subsidies.
However, it is vital that the same standards apply to imported foodstuffs, otherwise the antibiotics only just banned in the EU could make their way back onto our plates.
Parliament's compromise shows the way forward and contains a substantial shift of money towards rural development.
It accepts modulation while differentiating between advantaged and disadvantaged regions and, therefore, will give better compensation for poorer regions - and this is welcome.
However, we also need to prevent the dumping of CAP-supported goods outside the European Union, which drives down world prices at great cost to the developing world and effectively prevents the most needy farmers from accessing European markets.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Cunha for their hard work.
We in the British Conservative delegation reluctantly took the decision that we were unable to support the recommendations in the Cunha report.
We see the need for reform, and the need for reform for our farmers.
Therefore we cannot support horizontal or partial decoupling and as that was an integral part of Mr Cunha's report, we are unable to support that.
However, we support the Commission in its legislative resolution and want the Council to come to an agreement as soon as it possibly can.
We believe that the Commission's proposals are along the right lines.
I would add that Mr Cunha is an esteemed Member of this House; he is also a personal friend.
However, we believe, and I personally believe, that farmers need security.
Mr Cunha's report would probably mean a second reform and we could not accept it.
We wish to see the progressive deregulation of agriculture, together with a reduction in the size of the agricultural subsidies, and we are therefore voting against this proposal.
The Commission's draft mid-term review was a step in the right direction towards deregulated agriculture benefiting agricultural production.
There are serious defects in the Commission's proposal.
We are opposed to all forms of modulation because they fail to promote rational agriculture.
We also believe that compensation should be linked to the area utilised.
The compromise proposal on which we have now voted would produce locking effects that would be damaging to European agriculture and a retrograde step in the reform process.
Fifty per cent of European farmers are over 55 years old.
The Commission's proposal might be seen more as a good pension proposal for farmers than as a plan for phasing out the policy of subsidies.
No clear ground rules are provided, however, for the eight per cent of European farmers who are under 35 years of age and who are the future of agriculture.
.
(PT) We have voted in favour of rejecting this report because it accepts, albeit in a somewhat watered-down form, the principle of decoupling aid from production, because it does not contain any real proposal for reducing and setting a limit for CAP aid and because, in certain aspects, it makes the original proposal worse.
Furthermore, what it proposes is not a partial decoupling; it is actually a total decoupling of aid for arable crops and for male bovines.
It reiterates the need for obligatory national co-financing for rural development measures and makes what is known as modulation optional, which calls into question not only the principle but also the Community redistribution of savings, and this would damage Portugal.
This proposal for modulation differentiates between cuts to be made for the less-favoured regions and raises the exemption threshold by EUR 2 500, but ignores differences between producers, and mainly penalises the medium-sized rather than the largest producers.
We regret the fact that our proposals have not been adopted, specifically those concerning modulation; doubling the additional amount of aid for farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 and exempting farmers who receive less than EUR 10 000 from cuts, which would be funded to a limit of EUR 100 000 per farmer.
- (FR) Will Parliament be heard?
That is the question that we should ask ourselves today, the day before the Agriculture Summit in Luxembourg.
Having achieved unanimity on agriculture, which should be welcomed, the most important question is whether the Council will be able to grasp the opportunity and incorporate Parliament's position into its plans for the future organisation of the common agricultural policy.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regret that codecision does not apply to agriculture.
If it did, European farmers and consumers would have benefited so much more from the way that mentalities have rapidly changed for the better: towards moving on from costly, wasteful agriculture that destroys the countryside, towards agriculture that respects men and women, their work, the land and the environment.
In short, ecologically responsible agriculture, which the Group of the Greens has always advocated.
This reform of the CAP over 10 years is a commitment to a new type of modern agriculture, which takes into account all of the social, economic and environmental realities of the agricultural profession.
That is the type of agriculture which is the aim of the agreement reached in this House and that can only be welcomed, although it is surprising how different positions were not long ago.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(FR) I voted against the Cunha report, which broadly approves the Fischler proposal, which, disguised as a midway review of Agenda 2000, proposes a radical reform of the CAP based on decoupling and modulation of aid and on eco-conditionality.
I cannot support this reform, which clearly aims to further liberalise agricultural policy, continue to lower the prices of agricultural products and to dissociate farmers' income from what they produce, in order to anticipate the possible requirements of the WTO.
In short, it is organising the destruction of European agriculture and first of all of French agriculture in the name of misguided globalism.
While it should have been aiming for a more stable CAP, increasing the responsibility of those involved, based on profitable prices, this text is going to take agriculture further along the road towards greater concentration, along with a form of State control of an agriculture sector that is condemned either to over productivity, or to becoming simply paid gardening.
I have a great deal of understanding and admiration for the tremendous amount of work that all our rapporteurs have done under Mr Daul's excellent presidency.
I know how difficult it was to obtain majorities for these reports.
I regret therefore that I cannot give Mr Cunha's report my unconditional support, because the proposed solution of partial decoupling would place a considerable burden on the existence of multifunctional agriculture in the less-favoured region of Luxembourg, with very familiar economic, social and environmental consequences.
This is a responsibility that I cannot and do not wish to assume.
Problems with the transfer of payment entitlements will arise whether decoupling is full or partial.
I fear that the proposal which concerns transfer of payment entitlements with leased land will lead to big problems of a financial and legal nature, as well as to unpredictable speculation at the expense of active farms.
The fundamental problems with modulation also remain, even if the percentages of reduction are set at a low level.
Reducing aid through modulation leads to an unreasonable drop in agricultural income.
For our farmers, the figure of EUR 7 500 is too low.
That is why I have tabled an amendment to raise this to EUR 10 000.
Otherwise, practically all of Luxembourg's farmers would suffer losses in income of up to 20%, which would be catastrophic.
(Statement of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (NL) Since industrialisation, food prices have been kept artificially low, which has also enabled industrial wages to remain low.
Since then, farmers have been forced to produce more and more for ever decreasing rewards.
The EU subsidy system was a means of achieving greater economies of scale and increasing production per hectare.
Revenues from taxes go some way towards compensating farmers for their lack of income.
The survival of small-scale farmers and villages in southern Europe has become highly dependent on this subsidy policy.
They therefore regard the current common agricultural policy as the best the EU can offer, even if they would like to see funds allocated more fairly.
They regard every change as a brutal, neoliberal attack.
They are afraid that a new system will only serve as a subsidy on land ownership and land speculation and will not be able to stop the depopulation of the countryside.
In northern Europe, on the other hand, most of the small farmers have already been 'cleared away', and public opinion regards the agricultural funds as a kind of bureaucracy, a waste of money and environmental pollution which must be brought to an end as soon as possible.
I did and do agree with the demand to switch from production subsidies to income guarantees and the protection of the landscape.
The current proposal, however, seems to be primarily aimed at winning over the Americans in the WTO with a view to exporting other EU products.
.
The vast majority of reports we have just voted upon I can support and agree with.
Jeggle and Souchet often cause me little problems but Mr Cunha's report is different.
The current CAP, which has been reformed on many different occasions down the years, has become top-heavy with red tape and bureaucracy, and I rather feel that what we are proposing is to heap more misery on top of what already exists.
What do we have now?
De-coupling, modulation, degressivity and cross-compliance in place of good farming practice and an honest return for honest endeavours.
I sincerely believe that partial de-coupling will prove to be the worst of all worlds and provide no encouragement for the industry in the future, or do anything to streamline the industry or encourage young people to make a career in agriculture.
This will immediately mean more controls and inspections and less time for the farmer to tend his stock.
I will vote against to ensure that in the longer term the Northern Ireland agriculture industry is not destroyed in the name of efficiency.
.
The British Conservatives voted against the Commission proposal as amended, but in favour of the legislative resolution.
We did this, not because we support the contents of Parliament's report, but because it is imperative that Parliament gives an opinion so that Council may proceed to a decision.
Europe's farmers must be given a clear direction for the future.
We support Commissioners Fischler's proposals to reform the CAP and believe it is long overdue.
We are completely behind the plans to decouple payments away from production, and welcome the freeing up of agriculture.
We also believe that the Fischler proposals will ensure the future of European agriculture in an enlarged Europe of 25 Member States.
The proposals as they are in Parliament's text would only confuse and complicate an already over-bureaucratic system, and force agriculture into even further decline.
The Commission reforms will put us in a strong position when we sit around the table at the WTO talks in Cancun.
We hope that Commissioner Fischler sticks to his guns, and pushes ahead with his plans in Luxembourg next week.
We, and European farmers, wish him every success!
There is no doubt that the EU's agricultural aid must be reformed with a view to creating a healthy world market.
Unfortunately, the proposal for reform does not address the issue of export subsidies which, in our opinion, are what it is most important to change and which have the most thoroughly distorting effect upon world markets and upon poor countries' ability to exploit their comparative advantages.
The Commission's proposal does, however, acknowledge the multifunctionality of agriculture and would make increased modulation possible, that is to say increased flexibility when it comes to supporting tasks other than actual food production, such as the conservation of biodiversity and the cultivated landscape, or to taking other types of environmental measure.
It would also make it easier for other reforms to be implemented further down the line.
At the same time, decoupling presents obvious risks of disengagement and resistance to change which would, for example, obstruct the badly needed transition from one generation to the next within the agricultural community.
From these two perspectives, the European Parliament's proposal is therefore a compromise, providing scope for further necessary changes in the future.
Overall, we have therefore chosen, despite many objections, to support the report in the final vote.
The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests.
The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods.
Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens.
The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another.
The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely.
.
We fully support the Commission's original proposal for CAP reform as set out and unamended by the European Parliament, with the exception of Amendments 38 and 99, referring to health and safety.
The CAP must be reformed.
Payments must be subject to mandatory cross-compliance with the environment, rural economy, and animal welfare Directives.
The position adopted by the European Parliament will perpetuate a system which is damaging to the environment, the rural economy and animal welfare, and prejudices high levels of health and safety and harms produce in the developing world.
.
(FR) The principle of decoupling direct aid, whether totally, as the European Commission wishes, or partially, to 'start with', as the Cunha report recommends, is a bad one.
It will make the CAP even more complex and bureaucratic.
We need to completely move away from direct aid to farmers being 'compensatory' for drops in prices and income that have been inflicted on them by previous reforms.
This disconnects the aid from agriculture and therefore renders it unjustifiable in the eyes of taxpayers.
It prevents the COMs, as tools for monitoring and guiding production, from being effective, and weakens Europe's negotiating position at the WTO.
It is true that when the Commission wants to destroy a common policy, it tends to use the strategy of implementing a reform that is so unworkable and unsustainable that it is simply a step towards the complete disappearance of the public policy which it was intended to adapt.
The only point that I am satisfied with is the adoption of my amendment on energy and industrial crops on set-aside land, which should enable the emerging sectors to be consolidated.
.
(PT) Rural development might appear to be a panacea for all the problems and imbalances affecting the various types of agriculture in the EU, but it is also one strand of the strategy to contain CAP spending and to liberalise agricultural markets, in conjunction with enlargement and negotiations at the World Trade Organisation.
The aim of market mechanisms, however, is to bolster prices, and, primarily, income, ignoring the need to resolve existing deep-seated injustices.
Rural development cannot exist without farmers and agricultural production.
The Commission proposal does not increase appropriations for rural development. Instead, it transfers some of the appropriations from the 'markets' pillar, which will mean some of the CAP's costs being renationalised.
The proposals contained in this report are broadly to be welcomed, although they uphold the original framework.
Our vote reflects the improvements the report makes, particularly: the support it provides for less-favoured areas, for young farmers, for women in rural areas, for promoting agricultural production and for increasing the amounts of aid under the various instruments, including our proposal for a EUR 100 increase for compensatory allowances for the less-favoured regions.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mr Olsson on the excellent report he has produced on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000.
I fully support this report, especially with regard to the need to help establish conditions for developing farming in the EU regions that are the weakest and which face the greatest problems.
This will enable us to prevent the exodus of these communities from the countryside, and support the preservation of the landscape and consequently of the environment, whilst attempting to improve the standard of living of the communities in those regions.
I also wish to emphasise that the European Parliament must always support the development of a farming policy that respects the environment, making support a priority only for farmers who comply with Community rules, and for young people wishing to become farmers.
It should be emphasised that this is also a means of promoting employment in Europe.

(PT) This proposal for a regulation for the cereals sector highlights the strategy of the latest CAP reforms: lower prices and the gradual deregulation of the markets.
Compensation for income is only partial, with direct aid covering 50% of the fall in prices.
This strategy promotes the concentration and intensification of production and greater farm size, increasing the desertification of the rural world.
Furthermore, a 45% reduction in cereal prices has led to an increased cost to the budget of EUR 630 million.
We have supported some of the rapporteur's proposals, specifically the inclusion of rye on the list of cereals eligible for intervention and the references made to protecting the Community preference, but we do not accept the principle of decoupling aid from production for the cereals sector.
We also reject the idea of aid for the potato starch sector, which supports huge food corporations from only a few Member States, when what is really needed is regulation and support for potatoes for consumption.
A wide-ranging reform of the CAP has become necessary, guaranteeing similar levels of support and market regulation for Mediterranean produce.
Unless this happens, we will not be able to remedy the profound injustices in the distribution of aid and we will be sending the wrong message to producers in regions and countries with climatic conditions that are more suited to other types of production.
The Commission's proposal follows on from the 1992 revision and abides by the philosophy of reducing intervention prices by 5.9% and partly compensating for these reductions with direct per-hectare aid.
This proposal serves the interests of the wheat trading and processing industries by ensuring they have cheap raw materials.
At the same time, wheat producers' incomes are being reduced, because there is 50% rather than full compensation, prices and compensation remain constant and are not adjusted on the basis of average Community inflation and, finally, with the proposal to abolish monthly increases in the intervention price, the average intervention price is being reduced.
The amendments proposed by the rapporteur of the European Parliament move in a more positive direction than the Commission's proposals, with the exception of the reference to durum wheat which is, however, regulated under another regulation.
In essence, however, they move in the same direction as the Commission's proposal and only differ on quantitative elements, without contesting or proposing measures which reverse the Commission's basic philosophy, and this, despite the correct findings, ultimately renders the report ineffective, the gilding on a policy which favours the interests of the multinationals at the expense of small and medium-sized farmers.

.
(PT) This proposal for a regulation seeks to phase out the common organisation of the market in the dried fodder sector from the 2008/2009 marketing year onwards.
The Commission's reasoning turns on environmental issues, specifically the use of fossil fuel for dehydrating and even the use of irrigation.
Environmental issues can be resolved by other means, however, such as plans to reduce fossil energy, natural predrying in the sun or the use of renewable energies.
Nevertheless, we must view this sector as yet another source of vegetable protein production, in which the European Union has a growing shortage that already stands at 35 million tonnes of soya equivalent.
In other words, the EU is meeting only 23% of its vegetable protein needs.
This situation will be exacerbated after enlargement.
The consequence of losing this form of production is that we have to import, mainly from the USA, two million tonnes of soya meal equivalent, with all the risks of GMO contamination that this entails.
Accordingly, whilst acknowledging the importance of the environmental factor, we agreed with the rapporteur on the need to continue with the present CMO, to strengthen market instruments and to increase total aid to EUR 68 per tonne from the marketing year 2004/2005 onwards.

.
(PT) The rice sector is currently experiencing difficulties as a result of the imbalances triggered by the simultaneous increase in internal production and the rise in imports, due to the preferences and customs reductions of recent years.
This situation is likely to get worse with the fall in customs tariffs resulting from implementation of the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, with the forthcoming WTO round and with the possibilities of 'triangulation' and abuses of inward processing arrangements.
There is, furthermore, a conflict of interest between the producer Member States of the South and the consumer Member States of northern Europe, whose consumers tend to prefer the Indian variety of rice, of which the EU is in short supply.
This proposal for a regulation is unacceptable.
The Commission is proposing a 50% reduction in the basic intervention price to a basic price of EUR 150 per tonne, compensation at a level of 88% of that applied to cereals under previous reforms and a limit on quantity, overlooking the specific characteristics of this monoculture, which is concentrated in areas that have specific characteristics, with no opportunity for alternative production.
The proposal also overlooks the fact that this crop entails some of the highest costs in the farming sector in terms of investment in machinery, equipment and installations, which are mostly custom-made.
This means that forcing rice-growers to change crops would cause them serious financial difficulties.
We have therefore sided with the rapporteur.
. (EL) The objective of the Commission proposal is to diminish Community production and increase imports from third countries.
Rice is cultivated on pathogenic soils in the ?U and Greece for which it is difficult to find an alternative solution.
Thus, we consider unacceptable the quota of 203,000 hectares proposed for Greece, which is less than the previous quota, which we more than covered.
The proposed measures reduce the income of rice producers by increasing the profits of the trading industries, which will buy raw materials at derisory prices, given that the intervention prices will have a proportionate knock-on effect on commercial prices, without compensating for this reduction, despite the Commission's allegations to the contrary, allegations which are groundless, given that the rate of compensation is calculated on the basis of the difference between the intervention price before the revision and the private storage price after the revision.
The rapporteur's amendments, although more positive, are ultimately out of kilter with his objective findings about the state of this sector.
He disagrees with the abolition of intervention, but accepts the drastic 50% reduction in intervention prices, which in essence cancels it out.
He confirms the problem of abundant imports, but does not differentiate from the Commission's quotas.
That is why, and because his proposals exacerbate rather than radically improve the situation, we shall not be voting in favour of the report.

In this proposal for a regulation, the Commission proposes to prolong a reformed dairy quota system until the 2014/15 marketing year, and says nothing about the future.
Pursuing the quota system is crucial to guaranteeing milk production throughout the Union's territory and to ensuring the continuity of producers' income.
The end of the quota system, which is what the large countries producing a surplus would like to see, would mean the liberalisation of the sector, greater concentration of production and a considerable reduction in prices, which would harm in particular small and medium-sized producers from the least productive and less-favoured regions.
Across-the-board quota increases must, therefore, be considered for all countries and practical measures must be adopted to combat the concentration of production, both at regional level and in the hands of a few producers.
Account must be taken, however, of specific situations such the current state of affairs in Portugal, particularly in the outermost region of the Azores, where a quota increase must be guaranteed in order not to penalise a sector that has significant socio-economic ramifications, in a region that faces major structural disadvantages.
.
(DE) I am to a large extent in agreement with the reports on the organisation of the milk market, because the quota arrangements are being retained until 2014 as an instrument to regulate production and guarantee prices, which will give the reliability that is so essential for the continued existence of the family farm and will give farmers the security to enable them to plan accordingly.
However, I am in favour of those proposals on the reports concerning the milk sector that quite rightly point out that it is in the disadvantaged areas in particular that milk production plays a vitally important role, and that for this reason, when deciding on the basis for calculating the milk subsidy, the special situation of individual Member States should be taken into consideration by the differentiated lowering of the intervention price for butter and skimmed milk powder.
In the areas in question an extra EUR 5 per tonne should be paid in subsidies.
I should also like to say, about the agricultural reports overall, that I am not entirely convinced that the compulsion to take action is so great that we should have to shoot all our bolts now, in one go, before the next round of negotiations in Cancun, thereby running the risk of having to make even greater concessions which would lead to the demolition of the common agricultural policy and with it the demise of the small farmer in large parts of Europe.
Finally, the farm budget has been set up until 2013, which is why the budget-policy constraints that we are always hearing about are not present to the extent that is repeatedly asserted by the Commission and even here in Parliament.
. (EL) The proposals for the milk sector perpetuate the unequal treatment of countries such as Greece by keeping quotas at unacceptably low levels, exacerbating their dependency in dairy products and ruining producers with huge coresponsibility levies, due to the unacceptably low quotas allocated to them.
The ?U prefers to strengthen intervention, by withdrawing excess dairy products from oversaturated markets, mainly in the northern countries, than to direct the sums which will be spent on intervention to covering the needs of countries, such as Greece, which cannot meet even half their domestic demand.
It is infuriating that the quota granted in compensation for the reduction in target prices is increased by a larger percentage in the developed and a smaller percentage in the less developed countries.
For example, the proposals make provision for Greece for an increase in the quota of 6 000 - 14 000 tonnes and for 335 000 - 110 000 for Holland.
The country's livestock farming is being condemned to stagnation and the Greeks are obliged to consume imported pasteurised products because fresh milk does not reach the country in time, despite the fact that there is the potential to increase production and meet its requirements.
We call for a fair redistribution of quotas, on the basis of population criteria, consumption requirements and production potential, which is why we shall vote against the reports, which move in a diametrically opposed direction.

(PT) Milk production is of fundamental importance in the less favoured regions.
It is therefore crucial that minimum prices cover labour and production costs and that family farming and land-based undertakings are protected.
The transfer of production rights without land and lower prices, together with the absence of practical measures for regions with specific difficulties (such as the closure of joint milking parlours, the lack of support for the costs of transporting milk in inland or mountainous areas, etc.), have all led to the concentration of production and to thousands of farmers abandoning their land, specifically in Portugal.
We reject the Commission's proposal to reduce target prices by 28% over the next five marketing years.
The lack of measures for combating the concentration of production and speculation on the economic value of milk quotas is unacceptable, as is the fact that no provision is made for updating the level of fat content in order to adjust it to the real average.
We agree with the rapporteur's proposals for intervention prices to be increased with regard to the Commission proposal, for total compensation for price reductions by means of direct payments and especially with the supplementary subsidy of EUR 5 per tonne for the less favoured regions.
We disagree, however, with the proposal to eliminate indicative prices.

(FR) My position in this debate is clear.
First of all, the current CAP is certainly not perfect.
It is costly and at times unfair.
Despite that, it is because of that CAP that agriculture still exists today in Europe.
Secondly, the CAP undoubtedly has to be reformed in order to adapt to the current situation in Europe and worldwide.
It needs to be better targeted towards the objectives of quality, the environment and maintaining rural employment.
What is being proposed, however, which is cleverly disguised in the garments of justice and ecology (in the name of the famous 'decoupling') will inevitably lead to the disappearance of the CAP ten years from now and, in its wake, to the disappearance of real, diversified and self-sufficient European agriculture.
This is why I cannot accept the proposals that have been put to us.
.
(PT) More has been said today than ever before about multifunctionality in agriculture, particularly in the context of the current CAP reform.
It even appears that many people have only now discovered agriculture's multifunctional nature.
Farm production has always entailed positive externalities for the development of the rural world, contributing to job creation, to the development of other upstream economic activities, to regional planning, the preservation of the environment, the landscape and the cultural heritage.
There must therefore be policies that promote an extensive and tightly-knit network of small and medium-sized family farms and the development of local and regional markets.
This CAP, even with its reforms, clearly bears the greatest responsibility for destroying multifunctionality in agriculture, through the gradual liberalisation of farm markets.
We therefore agree with the rapporteur, who states that rather than 'declarations of intent' what are needed are concrete measures relating to the CAP, which the Commission's proposals for reforming the CAP fail to provide.
We support the rapporteur's proposals but regret the fact that she was not more ambitious.

(PT) I congratulate Mrs Rodriguez Ramos on her excellent report on multifunctionality in farming and the reform of the CAP. I fully support this report, in particular with regard to calling for a European agricultural policy that also takes account of the multiple functions of farming, specifically maintaining the rural population, regional planning and the preservation of the environment, the landscape and the cultural heritage, also introducing the concept of territorial cohesion.
I also wish to underline that the European Parliament prides itself on its action to ensure respect for Europe's diversity, which means that where farming is concerned, we have a duty also to consider the non-commercial aspects in order to achieve the harmonious development of the European Union.
My initial comment on the new agricultural policy announced by Commissioner Fischler on 10 July 2002 was: 'An appropriate break with the past, but not a solution for the victims by a long chalk'.
The reform was announced as a reward for quality and food safety, aimed at better protection of the consumer and the environment.
Maintaining and improving the countryside would be less dependent on chasing after ever more intensive production.
My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, has always striven to achieve just such a reversal.
Agricultural organisations and farmers' representatives in the European Parliament were furious.
This is understandable, as there is unfortunately a major risk of more large groups of farmers going out of business.
Not only the small farmers in France, Spain and Greece, but even the bigger farmers in the Netherlands, who are currently highly dependent on the money they have borrowed from the banks.
Compared with the amount of work and money they have invested, their income is disappointing, and that income may drop even further for some.
Farmers can only get socio-economic security if we have the courage to break away from the logic of the free market and instead are rewarded for countryside management, environmental protection and healthy food.
Otherwise there will still be pressure to supply food even more cheaply than the Americans and other competitors outside the EU by further intensification, further exploitation of the soil and export subsidies.
.
(PT) I believe that multifunctionality in farming must have a place in the process of reforming the CAP, and I think that the Council and the Commission must accept this idea.
The social, environmental and territorial effects of farming have not, in fact, been given the attention they deserve by the Community institutions, whose farming policies have largely focused on qualitative and economic issues.
It would only be fair to emphasise that the hard-to-measure public goods and positive externalities that result from conventional farming far exceed its direct economic benefits.
It is therefore right that particular attention should be paid to the rural population, that practical measures falling outside the sphere of rural development should be adopted and that the preservation of farming should be encouraged and supported, given the importance at local level of farms.
Production must also be geared towards sustainable and high-quality development.
I also agree with the rapporteur's view that the need to deal with the unpredictable swings of competition in a market in the process of being liberalised must be compatible with the crucial presence of a sufficient number of farmers to ensure proper countryside management.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
The June Movement opposes the EU's massive agricultural aid, which discriminates against the developing countries, the new EU countries, the environment and ecological interests.
The consumer pays twice: he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods.
Even if extensive farming and ecological interests were to go and be given slightly better conditions, it would still be unfair to third countries, the new EU countries and EU citizens.
The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a redistribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another.
The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I should like to make the following comments about the Oostlander report. We have agreed to this report, because it would be a way of bringing Turkey closer to European standards.
However, we attach importance to the conclusion that this report should not automatically be the start of anything.
With regard to Turkey's possible accession to the European Union, many members of our group do not share the view that it should join the European Union, although naturally we would like to have close and friendly relations with it as a partner.
To that extent we believe it is important to state, having given our agreement to the Oostlander report, that, if and when it comes to a decision on Turkey's membership of the European Union, it will be up to individuals to decide freely, that any such decision lies in the future, and that our agreement to the Oostlander report in no way forms a preliminary decision anticipating any such decision that may be taken in the future.
Mr President, several of us have voted against the resolution on Mr Oostlander's report.
We have many reasons for this, both due to fundamental considerations, and to the very divisive and negative feeling that has governed most of the votes today.
Fundamentally, we think that Turkey has its place in the European Union, as it has had a place for several decades in the Council of Europe.
However, Turkey needs to comply with specific conditions.
The resolution says this, but does so badly, and the conditions are wrong.
It thus interferes in Turkish law, on the one hand.
On the other hand, there is a serious omission in that it does not clearly state the right of the Kurdish people to self determination, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.
This is what we wish to highlight by our negative vote.
We chose to vote in favour of the report, despite the rejection of our proposal to delete the wording to the effect that 'the political values of the European Union are chiefly based on the Judaeo-Christian and humanist culture of Europe'.
We do not like the wording, but because the rest of the report is constructive, we chose to vote in favour of it.
.
(FR) We voted against the Oostlander report on Turkey's application for membership, even though the rapporteur demonstrated some desire to moderate the usual positions of the Council and the Commission.
It appears, therefore, that the message from the grassroots is beginning to influence some MEPs to some extent.
In particular, the report seems to have a good appreciation of the immense amount of work that remains to be done in order to establish values similar to those of the European Union, not only in Turkey's State superstructures (which would involve dismantling the authoritarian State), but also throughout its population.
Ultimately, the Oostlander report does not, however, dare to break the taboo, and continues to give the impression that, by the end of 2004, we will be able to think about actually beginning accession negotiations with Turkey, if it makes efforts to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria between now and then.
We think that we should be more realistic, and not underestimate the profound differences between Turkey and Europe.
In any case, we ask that the people not be once again presented with a fait accompli and that they be consulted before any negotiations are begun.
.
(FR) The Oostlander report is just like a Russian doll: it has secret agendas hidden inside.
So who can understand Parliament's vote in favour of it today?
Some voted in favour to acknowledge the facelift that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy had given it in order to reduce its initial harshness.
Others voted in favour in order not to give a negative signal to Turkey and instantly dismiss its accession.
Others voted positively in order to support the demand for a Europe based on Judaeo-Christian roots, a debate that is currently raging in the Convention.
It is this demand that the socialists tried to remove through Amendment No 12 which was rejected by 172 votes to 162.
The confusion of the implicit questions put to MEPs and the loss of Amendment No 12 led me to vote against this report.
I refer to my speech on 4 June in plenary: 'If paragraph 3, which invokes European values essentially based on the Judaeo-Christian culture is not amended, it will be a slap in the face for a country with a Muslim government but with a fundamentally secular tradition.
We would consider it to be unacceptable, the return of old demons and the interference of religion in politics'.
.
(PT) We do not endorse the content of various points or phrases contained in the resolution including, amongst other aspects, its reference to what it calls the 'Judaeo-Christian and humanist culture of Europe' or to Turkey's commitments to NATO.
The resolution details a set of extremely important issues, such as the ban on the activities of various political organisations, the issue of the amnesty granted to political prisoners, the practice of torture and other forms of violence and repression, the army's control of political life in the country and the military occupation of northern Cyprus and Turkey's failure to apply the UN resolutions there.
Only the day before yesterday, my parliamentary group drew up an initiative on the situation in Turkey, in which various human rights organisations were involved.
One of the main ideas expressed in the initiative is that - despite the individual changes to the constitution and to legislation that these organisations have welcomed, although in practice some have not really been applied - we must not soften our condemnation of the violence and arbitrary behaviour by the Turkish authorities, and we must step up our solidarity with all those who resist and fight.
For our part, we shall continue to support all initiatives of this type.
.
(FR) I abstained.
I welcome the strong questions raised in the report and I congratulate my colleague Mr Oostlander on the quality of his work.
In Turkey. fundamental rights and individual freedoms do not comply with the requirements of the European Union.
There is still a great deal of work to be done in order for the country to become truly democratic.
It is equally important for Turkey to face its history, particularly by publicly acknowledging the genocide suffered by the Armenians.
I abstained on this report because it does not raise the issue of Europe's borders and does not propose an alternative to Turkey's membership, the consequences of which are not dealt with.
In opposing this membership, I am not rejecting Turkey.
On the contrary, I propose creating an area of preferential relations, which would help it in its economic and social development and would support the steps taken to create a stable democracy.
.
British Labour Euro MPs have supported this resolution because we believe it is essential to recognise the reforms achieved by the Turkish Government, and to give a positive signal of encouragement for further change on their path towards accession in to the European Union.
However, we condemn the reference to one particular religious tradition within the resolution, because we believe this is inconsistent with the multi-ethnic, multi-faith society which is the reality for all of our countries.
In addition, we want to put on record what we believe are misrepresentations in some of the text.
First, in relation to recital D and paragraph 24, we should recognise that there are a range of electoral systems used in the different European countries, and in fact around one-quarter of current MPs in Turkey are from Kurdish origin.
Second, in relation to paragraph 3, whilst reiterating our strong desire on progress in relation to Cyprus, we point out that this has never been made a direct precondition for Turkish EU accession - and it is wrong to change that in this resolution.
On paragraph 19, our understanding is that the Loizidou case has now been resolved - and this should be welcomed.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(EL) The members of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report on the accession of Turkey to the ?U because we believe that it will not benefit the workers and the people of Turkey in general; it will only benefit the Turkish plutocracy and the EU.
Many believe that the accession of Turkey will contribute towards its democratisation.
That belief led to customs union, to its being proclaimed a candidate country, but not to democratisation.
The repression of its people continued, with the gaols full of political detainees in inhumane conditions.
Arrests, torture and murder continue.
The muzzling of political opposition extends to banning parties such as the Turkish Communist Party and HADEP.
DEHAP is about to be banned.
The army continues to play a sovereign role and there is the daily threat of a coup d'Ã©tat.
Its militia continue to occupy 37% of Cyprus.
The rapporteur does indeed recognise much of the above, but he welcomes the government for its good intentions and proposes speeding up the financing of Turkey with EU taxpayers' money, which will most probably be used to reinforce the repressive mechanisms.
We condemn the hypocritical policy of the ?U, which is based above all on serving big interests and we stand by those fighting, under harsh conditions, for democracy, peace and social progress in Turkey, certain that radical change will come as their fight develops.
.
(FR) After enlargement to the East, Turkey becoming a member of the Union will complete the economic and social ruining of our nations.
Our farmers, having suffered competition from Polish agriculture, will not survive competition from Turkey, which will be the main beneficiary of the CAP.
The last of our industries that have not already relocated to the East will move to Turkey, where the cost of labour is even lower than in Eastern Europe.
Under the provisions of the European Treaties, particularly the Schengen and Maastricht treaties, 70 million Turks (100 million in twenty years' time), will be able to come and swell the numbers of immigrants in our countries, thus completing the collapse of our social welfare systems, which are primarily aimed at our compatriots on the lowest incomes.
Our people are aware of these obvious facts, but their leaders are not.
If there is no referendum, the European elections next year will be the opportunity for our compatriots to say no to an Asian country, Turkey, entering Europe.
There are at least two good reasons in principle, if not more, for the French delegation from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to vote against this report.
The first reason concerns the perspective on which it is based: the planned accession of Turkey to the European Union.
Turkey is heir to a great civilisation.
However, as it is culturally different from a Judaeo-Christian and humanist Europe, geographically situated (95%) in Asia Minor and does not belong to the Indo-European family, I do not think there is any reason for Turkey to join the Union.
Yes to cooperation with the EU, no to membership!
The second reason is the European Union's obligation to respect the national sovereignty of third countries.
It is perfectly clear that this extreme report constitutes blatant interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign State.
By what right, however, and based on what moral standards can the European Union judge and at times condemn Turkey?
Who are we to stigmatise, for example, the disproportionate role of the army, which 'slows down Turkey's development towards a democratic and pluralist system'?
This report, which is contemptuous towards the Turkish people, is very bad for Europe as a whole.
A new party surprisingly came to power in Turkey last year.
Thanks to the 10 percent threshold for obtaining representation in Parliament, this party immediately won a majority, and only one other party remained, that of the more or less social democratic followers of AtatÃŒrk.
The new premier, Erdogan, has been depicted as an extremist in the past and has been disenfranchised.
He is now regarded as the leader of the Muslim Democrats, which is supposed to be roughly the same as Christian Democrats in other countries.
You would expect a new governing party like this to take a critical view of the fact that Turkey has a considerable number of political prisoners, that parties are banned, that the army retains much power and that the very large Kurdish population group still does not have normal rights to government, education, the administration of justice, employment and media in their own language.
Up to now this government has also refused to acknowledge these problems and seems not to be doing very much about them.
It is therefore good that Turkey cannot enter into preliminary negotiations about EU membership without conditions, on the basis of the illusion that everything will automatically be better then.
The report could have been clearer and stronger, but I support the idea that Turkey will be able to join once it has become a democracy.
.
(FR) I abstained in the final vote on the report on Turkey's application for membership of the European Union.
I think that the European Union's strategy in response to Turkey's application for membership, since the decision in Helsinki in 1999 granting it the status of a candidate country, is unrealistic.
Every year the European Parliament examines the progress made by Turkey towards accession, when that accession is not a current issue.
The accession negotiations have not begun and we do not yet know the timetable for them.
It is the Heads of State and Government who will decide when they meet at the European Council in December 2004, based on an evaluation report on the situation in Turkey, if a timetable should be set for beginning accession negotiations.
I cannot, therefore, see why the European Parliament is today taking yet another position on this issue and I did not therefore wish to associate myself with it.
.
(PT) According to the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, the aim of the open method of coordination is 'to disseminate best practice and ensure greater convergence towards the main EU goals'.
The way in which OMC has been applied, however, reveals certain weaknesses.
Hence the need for clarification, specifically in defining the matters to which it should apply; in mobilising all national players to ensure that participation in the process is not wholly confined to a small elite; in coordinating it with other Community instruments, making this method a complement to legislation and not 'alternative legislation in disguise'.
This is why we should give our support to the recommendation to include in the future Constitutional Treaty an article specifically relating to OMC, defining its form and procedures.
I also welcome the call for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to be consulted on issues that fall within its sphere of competence and I recognise the merit of the European Commission's drawing up a study on the effectiveness of the method.
The proposed measures will certainly help to improve OMC and I have therefore voted in favour of this excellent report.
.
(FR) I challenge anyone to understand, when reading the Smet report, exactly what 'open coordination procedure' means.
This is not the rapporteur's fault as the Convention itself, which had considered including a definition of this working method in its text for a European constitution, eventually gave up due to the difficulties in doing so (Article I-14 of the current draft).
It was the Lisbon Council, in March 2000, that launched this expression, but with a definition that was too vague.
The intention is, however, quite clear: it is about establishing flexible coordination to enable governments to establish links, exchange their experiences and to set general guidelines if necessary, but to then remain flexible in applying them.
Unfortunately, at this point the interpretations diverge.
We think that this method should be developed as an alternative to the rigid harmonisations within the scope of the Treaty.
The 'integrationists', on the other hand, want to use it to erode national powers and even tighten up the procedure by making it into a type of top-down planning method, along with restrictive calculated indicators.
There is a complete lack of understanding.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of the report, and welcome the initiative by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I agree with the rapporteur when (in response to the views put forward by the Convention's four working groups) she calls for the open method of coordination to be defined more clearly and to be included in the Treaty.
Each national report must indicate how representatives of civil society, including the social partners, and local, regional and national authorities, including the Parliament, have been consulted.
I have always stood up for and emphasised the importance of the irreplaceable role at local level of national parliaments and communities (specifically those that are involved or targeted) in forming and expressing the 'Community will', because this does not correspond to a federalist vision of a supposed 'European will'.
It is instead the result of a 'desire to understand', a composition of disparate interests, a convergence of values and aims.
Sharing best practices, which forms part of the open method of coordination, is, therefore, an approach that needs to be improved, developed and extended to other areas, because of the useful effect it has had on employment policies.
This approach could lead to genuine convergence and could benefit everyone, without entailing the more or less imposed nature of legislation.
Lastly, I have also supported the suggestion to ask the Commission to draw up a study on the method's effectiveness.
Mr President, we have just approved the Fraisse report on women in top-level sport.
I am, however, somewhat concerned about what we voted on in paragraph 10, in which we call on the European Union to provide financial support for the operation of the European Women and Sport network, as I was under the impression that this was a private organisation of which a nephew of Mrs Fraisse is the chairman or at least plays a major role.
In my opinion it is not right that Mrs Fraisse does not disclose these interests.
Before something like this is done by the Commission, I would like us to establish whether any of this is true, because we do not believe that this is a particularly important organisation.
Although the text does not state clearly whether it is a private organisation or not, we looked into this, and this is apparently indeed the case.
I actually think this is unfair.
Various Members of this Parliament had questions on this, but we did not place this on the agenda in the plenary session for reasons of discretion.
I would nevertheless like all this to be investigated.
.
(PT) Sport is a sector in which major inequalities between men and women still exist.
I therefore agree with this report and support the initiatives intended to reduce unequal treatment in terms of the income, financial resources and vocational retraining of top-level athletes.
Women's participation must be promoted in positions of leadership, in technical and medical teams and on refereeing and adjudication boards.
Particular attention must be paid to the effects of sport on athletes' health, to preventing and combating sexual abuse and harassment and to increasing media coverage of women's sport.
Sport in schools is clearly in decline.
The role of physical and sports education must be emphasised and included in suitable training for teachers and measures must be adopted to enable women to practise sports in their spare time and develop opportunities for practising at their workplace.
Lastly, women's participation in sport must be promoted in Community programmes and actions, and the appropriate human and financial resources must be provided, as well as the necessary mechanisms for monitoring and following up these actions.
This week the European Parliament is voting on two reports by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Seldom have I seen such a big difference in quality between reports from one committee.
The report on breast cancer in the European Union is excellent, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has therefore voted in favour of this.
The report on women in sport states that sport is an expression of the right to equality and the freedom of all women.
The European Commission is being asked to set up a 'women and sport' unit; television stations would have to undertake to broadcast more women's sports, and they are even calling for sport in the workplace to be regulated in collective labour agreements!
Women's sport is very good, but that does not make it a fundamental right.
Sport seems to me to be something that people simply have to do and not something that should be imposed by the European Parliament.
The ELDR Group has therefore voted against this report.
.
