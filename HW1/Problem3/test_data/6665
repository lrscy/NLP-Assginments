We would ask you to vote on the oral amendment proposed by Mr Lewandowski instead of our report.
This will guarantee that Parliament, that plenary today also accepts the Joint Declaration by the Council and Parliament guaranteeing budgetary rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr BÃ¶ge rightly pointed out that it would have been better, more reasonable, more intelligent and wiser, if we could have passed in good time the resolution which has just been adopted.
I would like to point out that the failure of this to happen was not attributable to a lack of good will on the part of the Presidency.
I shall pass on our common regret, the regret of the House and of the Presidency, to the three capitals with which we had to negotiate up to five minutes ago.
Â Â  â Mr President, on Rule 5 (3) of the Rules of Procedure in connection with the Van Orden report, I welcome the fact that the trilogue was successful and that Bulgaria and Romania did not become hostage to a tug of war between the Council and Parliament.
As regards Amendment 5, I find it outrageous that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is turning individual support from individual members of our group for this Amendment 5 to the Van Orden report into a proposal tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I see a certain political manipulation in this and would like to expressly emphasise that this proposal has been individually supported by my national delegation.
I thank our group and our chairman for respecting and admitting the different stances with respect to the Kozloduj nuclear power station.
Â Â  The Presidency does not understand what your point of order consists of.
Â Â  â The intervention on a point of order was made because an amendment to the Van Orden report on Bulgaria â on which we are about to vote â has been moved in the name of the PPE-DE Group, whereas this amendment was supported only by individual members of our group, including my delegation.
I wanted to point that out before the report was put to the vote.
Â Â  Mr Salafranca, I hope that your point of order is more intelligible.
Â Â  I hope so too, Mr President, and I believe that when I explain it, it will be easy to understand, particularly for somebody as intelligent as yourself.
Mr President, I simply wished to say that, in view of the oral amendment we have just voted for on the BÃ¶ge/DÃŒhrkop report, Amendments 2 relating to the favourable opinion by Mr Van Orden and the one by MrÂ Moscovici, presented by our political group, no longer make any sense, and I wished to say before the vote that we are going to withdraw them because they are not compatible with what we have just voted for.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrsÂ Stenzel, I wish to raise another point of order, for the sake of clarification.
The proposal on the date for shutting down the Kozloduj nuclear power station was not submitted by us in error.
I am perfectly aware that not everyone in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the same view as certain of that groupâs Austrian members, as far as fulfilling the protocol on Kozloduj is concerned.
I am not that naive.
However, I do not want a procedural error â one that was obviously made in the secretariat â to compromise this important position.
I again expressly thank individual members for their initiative in supporting this proposal concerning the timely shutdown of Kozloduj.
Â Â  I would like to make it clear that the amendment in question exists and is presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and other Members.
Â Â  Mr President, at the request of the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, we would like to add the word âillegalâ before the word âloggingâ in the last line of this amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, I have an oral amendment that applies to four amendments.
In MrÂ Moscovici and Mr Van Ordenâs reports, and also in the recommendations, we want to have a reference to the exchange of letters between you and the President of the Commission on the full association of the European Parliament in the forthcoming process over the next 20 months concerning safeguard clauses.
The original amendment is not precise enough with regard to the eventual postponement.
Therefore, in those four places I propose to replace the amendment with a new text, which I will read only once, but which can be referred to in the other three instances.
The new text will read: â... having regard to the exchange of letters between the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission on the full association of the European Parliament with any consideration of activation of one of the safeguard clauses on the Treaty of Accessionâ.
That will apply to all four texts.
Â Â  Mr President, in accordance with Article 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls for a postponement of the vote on assentfor Bulgaria.
I shall explain it very simply.
We have two different situations: Bulgaria and Romania.
With regard to Bulgaria, we believe that there are still issues to resolve and that, since we are talking about a 2007 accession, we do not think it useful to vote today.
The Verts/ALE Group in the European Parliament solemnly declares that it is in favour of accession, that it does not wish to vote against, but that, as regards assent, it can only say yes or no or not take part in the vote.
As we do not wish to vote no, however, and as we state that, given the nuclear energy situation in Bulgaria, for instance, we cannot vote yes today, we simply ask for the vote on assent to be postponed. We also ask that firstly, according to the clauses of the agreement with the Commission, a progress report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs be drafted to allow a vote on assent to take place at the beginning of 2006, one year prior to accession.
Â Â  According to our Rules of Procedure, having heard the arguments of the proposer, one Member can speak in favour and another against.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to request that, if the Verts/ALE Group makes a similar request on Romania, the vote as to whether we delay be taken by roll call.
Â Â  We must apply the Rules of Procedure.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance knows what it must do.
They are grown-ups.
Mr Swoboda has the floor to speak in favour.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to speak out against this proposal on behalf of my group.
It must have escaped Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is this very debate that we have had â and in very great depth âwith the Council and the Commission over recent weeks.
What we have achieved, as Mr Wiersma's proposal shows and with the assent of this Parliament, is this: according to the assurances of the Commission and the Council â I should like to mention both and also to thank Commission Rehn, we shall be fully involved in further consultations and in the possible application of the clause which should allow this accession to be postponed.
I should like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Lagendijk.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, if you had spoken with him more closely, you would have realised how much hard work we, and Mr Brok, have put into this, thereby reaching a positive result.
That is why I wish to vote against this motion.
Â Â  Mr Nassauer will take the floor to speak against.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know of nobody of any standing in this House who would not be in favour of us welcoming Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union.
I do, however, know of a great many Members who â for the reasons MrÂ Cohn-Bendit has spelled out â are loath to take a decision on this matter today.
Delaying todayâs decision would therefore be an eminently sensible move, as it would allow us to indicate that although we are still very much in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU, we wish to wait for the Commissionâs next progress report before we actually take a final decision on the matter.
This would be one way of addressing many of the concerns that have been voiced, without giving rise to doubts about our basic willingness and determination to welcome these countries into the EU.
I therefore have every sympathy with MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs views.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the rapporteur on Bulgaria, I would be very much against any delay in the assent procedure.
We have overcome the interinstitutional problem concerning the budget.
Safeguard clauses have been built into the Accession Treaty.
There is no good reason to delay giving our assent.
I believe that it would be irresponsible on the part of this House to have any delay today.
I call upon the House to vote in favour of assent.
Â Â  Mr President, I move the same revised amendment as I proposed earlier on Mr Van Ordenâs report.
This is the same text that I want to put into the recommendation.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thought that you had understood the point of order I presented previously to call for the withdrawal of Amendments 2 to this favourable opinion and to the favourable opinion by Mr Moscovici.
Â Â  Alright, Mr Salafranca, it has been withdrawn and there is no need to vote on it.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the same text that we adopted in the Van Orden recommendation and report.
We will be repeating the same text in the two votes on the Moscovici report and recommendation.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would call for the vote on the accession of Romania to be adjourned in accordance with Rule 170(4).
The House has just voted in favour of the resolution by an overwhelming majority, yet if Members actually read this resolution, they will discover that, although the progress made by Romania on economic matters has been admirable, progress on political issues, such as freedom of the press and corruption, has been such that noÂ one can claim that Romania could join the EU in its present state, at least not if we are to believe everything we have written in our own report.
It has frequently been said before â and we repeat it now â that we are in favour of accession and that we have faith in the new government.
The question we must ask, however, is why we should give the benefit of the doubt to a country experiencing such fundamental problems with democracy as corruption and a failure to protect the freedom of the press.
No country can overcome problems of this kind in a hurry.
We are therefore proposing that ...
It was suggested during our group meeting that Members will be required to vote either in favour or against during the vote, with abstentions not being allowed, as is the case in an assent procedure.
I would ask the President whether it is possible to abstain from voting in an assent procedure, as previously Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure only allowed Members to vote in favour or against in such instances.
We would also like the Bureau to explain the electoral legislation to us.
Â Â  This voting procedure provides for the possibility of voting in favour, voting against, abstaining or not participating in the vote.
Mr Wurtz has the floor to speak against the proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are some genuine shortcomings in Romania with regard to human rights and the fight against corruption.
The authorities have undertaken commitments in this area and it is obviously necessary, in my view, to impose strict controls over their implementation.
I believe, however, that the justifications given for such a postponement in voting do not rest on that point, since exactly the same request was heard with regard to Bulgaria, which is in a different situation.
That is the reason why my group wishes to focus attention on one of the consequences of a possible delay.
It would lead, against our will, to the cancellation of the signature of the Accession Treaty, which is scheduled for 25 April.
We would therefore send, against our will, a message to Romaniaâs people, the consequences of which would be extremely dangerous.
That is why my group, by a very large majority, does not support the call for a postponement, and will vote in favour of assent.
Â Â  Mr Voggenhuber will take the floor to speak in favour of the proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us, for the first time in the EUâs history, voting on whether to welcome a country into the EU 20Â months before the planned accession date â a country, moreover, in which serious violations of human rights and democratic standards are committed, as became apparent from yesterdayâs debate.
There can be no question that proceedings would be initiated under ArticleÂ 7 against any EU Member State that violated democratic standards and human rights to such an extent, and this should be obvious to everyone today.
The vast majority of Members of this House, myself included, will be glad to see Bulgaria and Romania join the EU, and eagerly await the day when they will be able to do so.
There is, however, no good reason why Romania should be given 20Â months before the date of its accession, especially since this would be the first time such a thing has happened in the EUâs history, and would have the effect of removing the pressure that negotiations bring to bear on the country.
We should take steps to prevent such serious violations of democracy and human rights.
France is in the process of taking a decision on the Constitution.
We must not send out a message that ...
Â Â  Mr President, would it be possible for the secretariat to remind Mr Cohn-Bendit that it was the European Parliament that recommended 2007 as the entry date for Romania, and therefore now is the time to activate that recommendation?
Â Â  . Mr President, I indeed believe that at a time when the people of France are debating the Constitutional Treaty, the signal to send out is not one of scepticism with regard to enlargement.
Enlargement of the European Union is not a constraint.
It is a project.
It is a common desire.
And it is for that reason in particular that, today, we must vote.
I believe that that does not justify a postponement.
Let everyone reach a decision in line with his or her beliefs, for or against, but surely not in favour of a postponement.
There is, however, another argument, which is very powerful.
I have heard many Members say during the debates that they fear that our Parliament will be signing a blank cheque today or giving its last word on the matter.
As a matter of fact, we have had, through an exchange of letters between yourself, Mr President, the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission, every guarantee that our Parliament will be fully involved in all of the future decisions to be taken, and we know that there is the possibility of invoking the safeguard clause.
I therefore believe that all Members can vote today both with knowledge of the facts and with full peace of mind, because this Parliament will play its full role in the procedure that will follow between now and 1 January 2007.
I therefore call, in turn, for the rejection of this postponement.
Â Â  Mr President, I should merely like to point out that it is customary for voting time to end at 1.30Â p.m., as we all, of course, have guests and must attend to the publicâs needs.
Â Â  My apologies, MrÂ President.
I have risen to speak on the basis of RuleÂ 160, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the vote on a number of amendments be taken by roll call.
We had, however, agreed that we would go along with the compromise reached with the other groups.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will therefore vote against these amendments, even though we do agree on certain points of substance.
Â Â  . 'The ALDE group tabled an amendment to the 2006 calendar which would have ended all plenary sessions at lunchtime on Thursdays and started the Brussels sessions at 10.30 on the Wednesday.
The purpose of this was to ease Members' travelÂ from Strasbourg and to suppress the fag-endÂ Thursday afternoon sessions.
Unfortunately, this amendment was deemed inadmissible by the authorities.'
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have long supported attempts to ensure that the European Parliament has only one official seat, and that it should be in Brussels.
The costs to the taxpayer of the Strasbourg seat is estimated at around Â£150 million per annum.
This is a gross waste of public funds.
British taxpayers deserve to have value for money.
Our proposal to delete Strasbourg days does not imply that we wish to reduce our hours of work but to carry out our work where it is most effective and cost efficient, namely in Brussels.
The costs of having to support parliamentary operations in both Strasbourg and Brussels have now become indefensible, and we will continue to campaign to have Parliament sit only in Brussels in future.
Â Â  . My vote in favour of the proposed calendar, which keeps the periods of plenary sessions in line with the demands of high-quality parliamentary work expected of an institution such as the European Parliament, does not alter my view that parliamentary work, and the costs associated with it, must be streamlined, not least by adopting Brussels as the sole, permanent seat.
Â Â  . The process of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania must be accompanied by a realistic evaluation of the financial implications, as in previous rounds of enlargement.
Otherwise, enlargement will become an exercise in reducing the levels of prosperity and development enjoyed by the Unionâs Member States.
Accurate evaluation is not a selfish gesture on the part of those already in the Union, but an example of an institution behaving responsibly.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I offer a welcome to the citizens of Bulgaria, who with this vote see the culmination of their desire to join the European Union.
In addition to congratulating the citizens and their current government, which has achieved this result, I should like to recall the major commitment made by previous administrations, particularly the government of Ivan Kostov, which started negotiations with the European Union in the early, most difficult days.
Lastly, I hope that the pensioners of Bulgaria, together with the younger generation, can build a better world together with all of us in the European Union.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, along with my fellow Members, I have voted against the reports on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, but for clarityâs sake, I should like to say that we very much consider Bulgaria and Romania to be European countries that have their rightful place in our European cultural community and, moreover, that we feel something of a debt of honour towards them for their decades of suffering under Communist dictatorship.
We are therefore convinced that â unlike Turkey, for example â both Bulgaria and Romania will be welcome in our political community before long.
Our friendship with Romania and our sympathy for Romania and Bulgaria should not prompt us to sign a blank cheque.
We have to have the courage to say â and that explains why we voted this way â that unfortunately, in very many areas, including political and economic areas, Romania and Bulgaria are not yet ready for full membership.
Â Â  . I welcome the European Parliament Vote to give assent to Bulgarian membership of the EU, but insist that the Bulgarian authorities must continue down the path of judicial reform, as any weakening will result in a reconsideration of the European Parliament position.
Â Â  . The process of Bulgariaâs accession, which is subject to an individual assessment, is moving ahead at the expected rate.
The country does not yet meet the criteria to begin the application process.
Not surprisingly, we are still a long way off being able to say that Bulgaria fulfils the necessary conditions for EU membership.
There are reforms to be carried out, there are habits that take time to acquire and there is an adaptation process which is legislative and which must be completed in such a way that the Union will not lose its character and that Bulgaria will not become incapable of honouring its new obligations in the future.
That said, as things stand, everything points to the conditions being fulfilled within the timeframe laid down.
We must therefore welcome the fact that this further step on the road to enlargement has been taken.
Â Â  . Given the fact that insufficient progress was made in comparison with the progress made by the 15 enlargement States on 1Â MayÂ 2004, Bulgariaâs plan to join the EU on that date was postponed.
It is now clear, however, that Bulgaria has made significant efforts to fulfil Community criteria and to move closer to the Union in political, economic and social terms.
I should like to highlight the progress that has been made on a political and budgetary level, which will provide stability for the remainder of Bulgariaâs path to European standards â a journey that will neither be short nor easy.
Against this backdrop, the European Council of 17Â DecemberÂ 2004 decided in favour of Bulgariaâs accession on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
The Commission took a similar decision on 22Â FebruaryÂ 2005, having issued regular reports on how the process was progressing.
Parliament should follow suit.
Of course, the accession to the Union of a country such as Bulgaria will inevitably entail costs, which will hopefully be backed up by increasingly effective commitment to internal cohesion, and, most importantly, by Bulgaria enhancing its own ability to interact with and relate to the world â in other words, greater diversity.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of AmendmentÂ 5 on the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant on behalf of the delegation from the Austrian Peopleâs Party, and not on behalf of the European Peopleâs Party.
Â Â  .â The Communist Party of Greece is against the EU because it is a union of capitalist states which safeguards the interests of big business and better conditions for it to compete with the other imperialist centres.
From this point of view, it is also against the accession of Bulgaria, the objective of which is to annex it, plunder its wealth and its economy, exploit the workers and turn it into a NATO satellite, in order to serve its aggressive policy.
We note the particularly onerous terms laid down for the accession of Bulgaria to the ÎU.
Already the pre-accession procedure and the process of restoring capitalism have resulted in worsening unemployment, starvation wages of EUR 61 a month, inflation, poverty and drastic cuts in social services, with painful consequences for the working and grass-roots classes in the country and, on the other hand, increased profits for Euro-unifying big business.
The Communist Party of Greece expresses its solidarity with the working class and the people of Bulgaria in their fight against the anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU and the political agents of big business.
Â Â  . The Right and the Social Democrats in Parliament and beyond continue to seek to impose neoliberal capitalism on countries applying to join the European Union.
The example of Bulgaria speaks for itself.
Parliament âpraisesâ the so-called âstructural reformsâ within the framework of the âmarketâ and capitalist âcompetitionâ, which are deemed to have taken place in Bulgaria.
It expresses its âsatisfactionâ with the âenlargement of the private sectorâ and the âprogress made in liberalising vital industriesâ.
What is more, it âcallsâ for the introduction of âgreater flexibility in the labour marketâ and for the pace of privatisation to be kept up.
Why all of these words?
The entire accession process has been characterised by other requirements that we feel are unacceptable, such as discrimination as regards the movement of workers and equal access to Community funding, and the existence of unilateral safeguard clauses that can be activated against the interests of these countries, and only these countries.
The enlargement is moving ahead within a political and financial framework that does not take account of Portugalâs interests, nor the needs of those countries applying to join.
Whilst we are fiercely opposed to the manner in which the enlargement is taking place, we have no objection to the accession of new Member States, provided that this is indeed the will of the people and that Portuguese interests are safeguarded.
Â Â  . It seems clear that Bulgaria will be in a position to join the EU on 1Â January 2007, in line with the decisions taken by the other European institutions.
I therefore feel that Parliament should add its opinion to those already delivered and publicly declare itself in favour of that countryâs accession.
Aside from this point of principle, it is clear that there are some gaps that must be securely plugged, particularly as regards the legal and policing systems, in order to improve efficiency in fighting crime and to provide for the increased transparency and procedural safeguards that are essential under the rule of law.
At this preparatory stage, it is also important to attach special importance to the rights of ethnic minorities and the need to guarantee their identity, and to protect the most fragile and most vulnerable sections in society, such as children and the elderly, especially in a changing society.
I voted in favour, in the expectation that Bulgaria can soon join the 25 in an ever bigger and ever more plural Europe.
Â Â  . The CSU Members of the European Parliament are of the firm belief that Romania should become a member of the EU.
At the same time, however, the CSU has always maintained that countries must meet certain criteria before they join the EU.
We are opposed to these criteria being watered down in any way, and we do not believe it is currently possible to carry out a final assessment of whether they have been met.
The Commissionâs latest progress reports confirm that Romania has a great deal of ground to cover before it meets the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law.
Another matter of some concern to the CSU is the safeguarding of Parliamentâs rights, which are enshrined in the Treaties.
This applies in particular to its budgetary rights, which we have now learnt will be respected.
In our opinion, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report.
The fact that we are still 20Â months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay.
For all the above reasons, the CSU Members cannot at this time vote in favour of Romania joining the European Union.
Â Â  . We continue to abstain, just as we did on the occasion of the last EU enlargement, with the exception of Cyprus, on whose accession we voted in favour, by way of a protest against Turkeyâs unacceptable occupation of the north of the island.
We are not in principle opposed to the accession of new Member States, provided that this is the will of the people and that it does not undermine Portuguese interests.
The fact is that, although we do not know the feelings of the Romanian people, accession gives rise to expectations, following enormous demands and impositions that we feel are unacceptable, not least structural reforms leading to privatisations, which have had a negative impact on peopleâs lives.
The new demands that various Members of this House have attempted to introduce strike us as excessive and unacceptable.
The truth, however, is that demands are already in place, such as derogations with regard to freedom of movement of workers.
Furthermore, we also disagree with the scant financial resources made available, especially for farming.
Lastly, we also disagree with the proposals, currently under negotiation, on the new financial perspectives, which do not take account of countries in difficulty, such as Portugal, nor the needs of the countries seeking to join the EU.
Â Â  . Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin has not followed the instructions of her group President, Daniel Cohn Bendit, calling for a verdict in favour of the postponement of the European Parliamentâs vote on the accession of Romania.
She judges that her vote is in no sense a blank check for Romania.
On the contrary, the vote must encourage this future Member State to work twice as hard and to accelerate reforms, particularly in the fight against corruption, the defence of civil rights, the protection of ethnic minorities and the control of borders.
She points out that this will be the first time â owing to a proposal made by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and accepted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs â that the European Parliament will be fully involved in the decision process, particularly if the safeguard clause is implemented â a clause which consists of pushing back accession by one year, if either of the two countries is not ready by 2007.
Finally, Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin is delighted that the final report voted in plenary contains her amendments:
-calling for the adoption of clear and forward-thinking provisions on coexistence in order to avoid the release of genetically modified varieties;
-stressing the European Parliamentâs concern about the Rosia Montana project, and calling for full environmental impact assessments to be conducted.
Â Â  . Assessing whether a country has fulfilled the criteria for EU accession must be done on a case-by-case basis, even if one country happens to join at the same time as another.
This must not, however, disguise the most important factor on the road to accession, namely that the criteria to be met must be realistic.
This is the only way in which we can ensure that the EU â including all of its Member States â and the applicant country derive all of the potential benefits of accession.
For this to happen â and I must stress this point â the assessment must take place at the right time, using objective and realistic criteria.
As such, I welcome the fact that accession can be postponed, should it prove necessary, not that I wish that to happen.
For reasons of internal politics, Romania has begun its reform process later than would have been in its interests.
The impetus with which the reforms are now being carried out gives us the hope and the belief that the adaptation can take place within the timeframe set by both parties.
Â Â  . Romaniaâs accession to the EU has been in the pipeline since 1995.
The negotiations that have taken place and the efforts made by the Romanian authorities have led to significant changes in the country in recent years.
Accordingly, the Council decided in December 2004 to conclude negotiations, with a view to accession in 2007.
Nevertheless, I wish to point out the concerns raised at the time of the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne (A5-0103/2004), around one year ago.
I highlighted serious problems, not least the absence of the rule of law, high levels of corruption, no press freedom and the lack of an independent judiciary.
These factors meant that Romania could not join the EU along with the other new Eastern European Member States in 2004.
I support this motion for a resolution because, among the concerns that it raises about this country are concerns that I share.
The EUâs doors are open to Romania, but the country must realise that there is an urgent need to find workable solutions to the most serious problems.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . Today, I voted against Romaniaâs request to join the EU, and I have to say that I did so with great regret.
After all, the new government is displaying enormous political commitment and has made clear in a very short space of time what it stands for.
That is good news.
All that remains to be done is to convert this commitment into concrete actions whose effects can be measured, because it is the results that matter.
Everything seems to suggest that Romania has a great deal left to do in the areas of corruption, protection of minorities, competition, state support and the environment, and yet this House has been asked to deliver its verdict no fewer than 20 months ahead of accession.
This is unheard of, and the logic of it escapes me completely.
At a time when the EU enjoys little support and its legitimacy is fragile, it is important that the European institutions should keep to the agreements they have made.
I am not opposed to Romaniaâs accession.
Romania Europe and will become a member of the European Union.
What I do want though, is for accession to take place on the basis of what we have agreed on in the past.
Â Â  . Owing to the lack of progress under its previous socialist Government, Romania is still finding it very difficult to be ready in time for EU accession in 2007.
The situation in the areas of corruption and administrative and legal stability in particular is a cause of major concern.
It seems entirely possible to me that in due course there will have to be a yearâs delay.
The European Parliament has been placed in the impossible position of pronouncing judgment 20 months before accession.
At the moment however we can see that the new government is putting the required reforms into practice on schedule and also that the European Commission, as recently in the case of Croatia, takes a strict line in its assessment of candidate members.
I am therefore prepared to give both the Romanian Government and the European Commission the benefit of the doubt.
I hope that progress continues as at present, because only in that case will I be able to continue giving my support to the accession of Romania in 2007.
Â Â  .
Parliament always monitors the situation in countries that formally declare an interest in becoming an EU Member State, and it has naturally done this in the case of Romania.
It should be stressed that Romania has been monitored especially closely in light of the delicate situation in the country and the consequent slow progress of accession negotiations.
Romania has in recent years worked hard and has adopted important measures.
Hopefully, further solutions can be implemented in the pursuit of Romaniaâs objective to become a member of the EU.
To this end, a number of reports have been drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, including that of Mr Moscovici (A6-0077/2005).
The newly-elected Romanian Government also deserves clear words and signs of encouragement.
After a number of postponements and Romaniaâs failure to be one of the ten countries that joined last year, I have no doubt that, if it meets the remaining criteria, Romania will, along with Bulgaria, be one of the next countries to join the EU.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, also with regard to the vote in favour of Romaniaâs entry into the European Union, I offer the Romanian citizens and their government my compliments and congratulations and say how pleased I am at this important step towards a better future.
In particular, I must emphasise how important it is that all the citizens in Romania, elderly pensioners as well as the young, should strive alongside the governments to make tangible progress for the sake of their collective well-being, instead of confining themselves to making plenty of promises that are followed by few tangible results, as many governments in Europe and throughout the world do.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted today against the recommendation for Romanian membership, for the following reasons.
It is plainly obvious from all the reports that Romania still essentially fails to meet the conditions of membership.
It is unfortunate that we have not decided to postpone making the decision.
Given the situation, I have no other choice but to vote against, although in principle I warmly support Romanian membership.
I vehemently object, however, to the clearance sale of membership conditions that Parliament has agreed to today through its recommendation.
Adherence to the criteria that have been jointly agreed and once again put to the citizens of Europe in talks on enlargement should be a normal gesture, not anything exceptional or remarkable.
Unless we keep to our agreed principles, we will drift into a situation in which we betray the tenets of representational democracy and drastically reduce our chances of keeping to agreements in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to explain my positive vote on Romania.
I have the impression that certain people have taken a whole nation hostage, because they have been more respectful of their own domestic political situation, indeed of the respective institutional issues that we were experiencing, whilst what we should be doing is supporting Romaniaâs efforts towards achieving democracy.
These efforts will be made easier with Europe, which must play a very great role.
I should next like to say to the Romanian people that, within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a large number of Members take their side and support the efforts to establish a genuine Christian Democracy in Romania.
I should like to pay tribute to the instigator of Christian Democracy in Romania, Cornelia Coposu, who, after the revolution, founded this party.
I should like to say that the accession of Romania will be a remarkable cultural enrichment for Europe.
Â Â  . It is my firm belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.
Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply.
The Council has refused to adjust the Financial Perspective, even though the Interinstitutional Agreement requires this to be done in the event of enlargement.
I regard this as an unacceptable encroachment upon Parliamentâs budgetary rights.
The Commissionâs latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law.
It would be premature to take a decision on the matter at this time, in view of the fact that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, as well as of the collapse of the trilogue on adjustments to the Financial Perspective.
It would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report.
The fact that we are still 20Â months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay.
I regret that I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.
Â Â  . I reaffirm my belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.

I regret that I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.
Â Â  . I do not believe that the purpose of the European Union has ever been to remain an exclusive club of the rich.
I am in favour of future enlargements.
The evidence points to Bulgaria and Romania having their place in the Union.
I deplore, however, the way in which governments, particularly those of Chirac, Blair, Schroeder and the like, deal with these issues.
Grandiose speeches and closed wallets seem to be the motto.
We have just experienced an enlargement without prior deepening.
Now, certain Member States want to impose new enlargements on us with less money for the European budget.
I have nevertheless voted yes, so as not to mix up my protests with those of the opponents of enlargement.
Â Â  We support Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession to the EU in principle.
It is a natural consequence of the enlargement by 10 Member States that occurred in May 2004.
Extended cooperation â properly implemented â can favour economic development, democracy and human rights in Europe.
At the same time, we must not close our eyes to the major problems that enlargement may entail if the candidate countries are not well prepared.
MrÂ Moscoviciâs and MrÂ VanÂ Ordenâs reports confirm how great the problems are.
According to the Commissionâs and the European Parliamentâs benevolent assessments, only the political criterion is being fulfilled.
The economic or administrative criterion has not been fully complied with, but is expected to be so by 1Â January 2007.
An important objection to the resolutions comes from the Committee on Agriculture, which points out that the costs of Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs EU membership have not been taken into account in the EUâs long-term budget for 2007-2013.
This needs to be remedied.
The process of negotiation and of adjustment to the EU has been going on for approximately eight years, which means that Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs membership is more or less a .
At the same time, it is important that the process of adjustment be allowed to continue.
If, however, these countries are not seen to fulfil the requirements, the Council must not hesitate to use the protection clause to postpone EU entry by a year.
Â Â  . Neither of the two candidate countries has made the expected progress in implementing the .
The issue of womenâs rights has been neglected during the accession negotiations, whether with regard to the labour market, participation in social processes or violence against women.
Improvements in the situation of children leave a great deal to be desired, particularly in Romania.
I believe that human rights and humanitarian issues such as these are more important than problems relating to the EUâs institutional framework, for example the question of Parliamentâs budgetary rights, even though it was only when Parliament had made certain that these rights would be fully respected that a last-minute compromise was reached.
Furthermore, as I have already stated on several occasions, I do not feel able to vote in favour of another enlargement until the Constitution has entered into force.
It is for these reasons that I will vote against Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU, particularly since we are still 20Â months away from 2007, the envisaged date of accession.
Â Â  . We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.
Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply.

I regret that we do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.
Â Â  . French representatives of the Independence and Democracy Group have voted against the Van Orden and Moscovici reports for several reasons, which have to do with their implications for Bulgaria and Romania, member countries of the International Francophone Agency, and long-standing friends of France.
We think too much of them to make them fall prey to the Eurocratic trap, which promises much, offers little and takes the most important thing â sovereignty.
The Soviet-style âlimited sovereigntyâ imposed by the EU is, moreover, resisted by some prominent citizens of these countries, who refuse to see their nation bribed by EU subsidies, and who call for the support of our no vote.
It will be possible, outside the iron collar of the EU, to achieve with them a Greater Europe founded on cooperation. This cooperation will be tailored to the interests of each participant, in serving the freedom of the people.
On the other hand, Romania and Bulgariaâs entry ensures an unbroken territorial line towards Turkey, which favours the latterâs accession.
This would complete the EUâs development as a culturally divided agglomerate, which is powerless, if not politically enslaved.
This vote does not, therefore, deny the European character of Bulgaria and Romania, which have always been European countries.
Â Â  . I have felt inclined to vote against further enlargement, not because of the question of whether Romania is ready for accession, but because of the fact that I do not feel that the EU is itself ready for further enlargement.
This is evident from the current impasses in decision-making and the suspicious attitude of various âoldâ Member States towards ânewâ Member States on matters such as the services directive.
In consequence new Member States have insufficient opportunity to benefit fully from the Internal Market.
Unbridled pursuit of enlargement without deepening will lead to administrative impotence and possibly even to an implosion.
This does no one any good, especially not the candidate Member States, which have in recent years had to compromise enormously to meet the admission criteria.
I express the ardent wish that with the acceptance of the constitutional treaty, administrative decisiveness and economic absorption will increase such that it is justified for both the EU and new candidate Member States to work together on further enlargement.
Simply offering a juicy carrot and ultimately fobbing these countries off will lead to great dissatisfaction and given the objectives of political stability and economic prosperity that cannot ever be the intention.
Â Â  .
It was with grave misgivings that I voted for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, because the reports about corruption in Romania in particular give me no reassurance about the suitability of this country for membership of the European Union.
The way in which the Council decided on the financing of accession for these two countries, only recognising the budgetary authority of the European Parliament at the last moment, also detracts from the need to decide on the accession of these countries 20 months in advance.
It is the geopolitical benefits of the accession of these countries that are the deciding factor for me however.
In addition, the European Union has held out the prospect of membership for many years and fundamental changes have been made in the legislation.
It is unclear what negative reactions a refusal of membership of the European Union would provoke.
The accession treaties also contain safeguard clauses that can be used to postpone accession.
All this has brought me to a cautious âyesâ.
Â Â  . Bulgaria and Romania are members of the European family of nations, and so their future lies in membership of the European Union.
Before they can join the EU, however, they must meet set criteria.
Since the collapse of communism, both Bulgaria and Romania have made efforts towards reform, and these efforts should be acknowledged.
At the same time, however, the Commissionâs regular progress reports make it clear that both Bulgaria and Romania still have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet these accession criteria, and much work remains to be done, particularly with regard to the thorny issues of the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law.
The reform process must continue, and it must be concluded before accession.
In the interests of both parties, the two candidate countries should be given longer to implement the Copenhagen criteria.
In view of these considerations, it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the next progress report has been presented, instead of committing ourselves today.
Much to my regret, therefore, I do not feel able to vote in favour of accession at this time.
Â Â  . I believe that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.
Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria.
As MEPs, we must ensure that the two countries comply with these criteria.
Our constituents expect nothing less.
The Commissionâs latest progress reports confirm that both countries have a great deal of ground to cover before they meet the accession criteria, in particular with regard to the fight against corruption and the establishment of a judiciary operating under the rule of law.

This is not due to any failings on the part of this House.
Â Â  . We endorse Bulgariaâs accession to the EU.
Portugal is well aware of the benefits of its own accession, and should be among those Member States that best appreciate the advantages of accession and that support it most strongly.
Â Â  . We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.
Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply.

Given that both countries are still a remarkably long way from meeting the accession criteria, and in view of the fact that we are still 20Â months away from the envisaged date of accession, I do not feel able at this time to vote in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU.
Â Â  . I, like my British Conservative colleagues, support Romanian and Bulgarian accession and regret the 11th-hour attempts by some Members to deny assent to those countries on the grounds of interinstitutional wranglings and budgetary considerations, now resolved anyway.
Although the delay of 20 months between our assent and eventual accession on 1 January 2007 is ludicrously long, it is too late to have this debate now and our position on this should have been made clear earlier.
I am reassured by the commitment of President Basescu's new government in Romania that corruption will be considered a threat to national security and aggressively prosecuted. Furthermore, the commitment given to plenary by Commissioner Rehn that our Parliament will be fully involved in the unlikely decision of activating the safeguard clause to delay accession by one year.
Not giving our assent now would send all the wrong signals to the people and governments of Romania and Bulgaria and would be a grave mistake, and I welcome both countries in the EU.
Â Â  . We reaffirm our belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU.
Before this takes place, though, they must meet certain criteria, which must continue to apply.

Â Â  Mr President, although, like most of my fellow Members, I am in favour of the EU including Romania and Bulgaria, and of their becoming full members of it, I do believe that this should happen in due course and according to the rules.
This is why I abstained from voting on both of the reports, as it is my belief that the countries have not yet achieved compliance with the criteria we established.
This is, in fact, a general problem, as Member States are failing to comply with the Stability Pact criteria, and the conditions being applied to Turkey differ from those we actually agreed on.
Croatia has to meet far more rigorous standards, whereas advance approval is now to be granted to Bulgaria and Romania.
I believe that we are neither predictable nor consistent enough, and it is for this reason that I abstained from voting.
Â Â  .
In its common position, the Council has made a number of amendments to Parliamentâs position at first reading and as such there has been a clear departure from the Commissionâs original position.
Consensus appears to have been reached on the aims of improving working conditions, precluding market disruptions â in light of the discrepancy between working conditions in different countries â and improving road safety, hence the need for realistic and workable checks on working time.
The Council found that there were serious practical problems standing in the way of across-the-board implementation â or at least the extent of implementation that the Commission would like to see â of roadside checking for compliance with the working time directive.
The purpose is therefore to strike a difficult balance between, on the one hand, complying with standards on working conditions and driving and rest times (in its biennial reports on the implementation of Regulation (EEC) 3820/85, the Commission has noted a steady rise in the number of infringements) and, on the other hand, the adoption of workable and realistic checking mechanisms.
The rapporteur sought convergence with the Council common position, and as such I endorse the report.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this second reading despite some differences of opinion on certain aspects of the new directive establishing design requirements for energy-using products.
We believe that it is crucial to invest in making the most efficient use of energy and in informing consumers, whilst ensuring that the new legislation does not overburden small businesses with costs.
The directive covers everyday objects, such as hairdryers, washing machines and computers, which are responsible for around 40% of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.
Cars are not covered here, since there is already special legislation covering them.
The report contains important proposals to safeguard micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the consumer.
We shall see the Councilâs position.
Â Â  . I welcome the main objective of the proposal before us, which is to ensure the free movement of certain energy-using consumer products, to improve their environmental performance and to help reduce their energy consumption.
Proposals of this nature must be realistic, so that a good proposal does not become unworkable or onerous for the industry, and this aspect is safeguarded.
It is crucial that proposals to improve environmental and energy quality be balanced.
Â Â  . The purpose of this recommendation for a second reading is to set design requirements for energy-using products throughout their life cycle, the main aim being to reduce the adverse impact of such products on the environment.
This is an issue of major importance and Parliament accordingly tabled a range of important amendments at first reading, including amendments on conformity assessment of products, eco-design requirements that must be met, setting up a credible and effective market monitoring system, support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and informing consumers.
In its common position, the Commission and the Council adopted some of the amendments put forward by Parliament, thus leaving behind significant concerns in this area.
I support the rapporteurâs proposal, which is in my view realistic and stands a reasonable chance of being implemented.
Examples of this include the clarification of concepts such as importer and manufacturer, the suggestion that surveillance must be tighter, whilst concern is shown for SMEs and some leeway is provided for adapting standards to the specific characteristics of the Member States.
I voted in favour of the new amendments, which, in the name of balance, reinstate the previous positions held by Parliament.
Â Â  . The gradual growth and development of maritime transport offers a number of benefits, including environmental ones.
It must also, however, be accompanied by constant commitment to reducing the adverse effects on the environment that will always arise.
Accordingly, and taking account of the interests and concerns opportunely raised by Portugal, I feel that I am in a position to vote in favour of this directive.
Â Â  . The rapporteurâs proposal is in keeping with Parliamentâs original position at first reading.
According to the amendments tabled by Parliament, shipping emissions would be reduced by 80% by comparison with the year 2000, whereas the Councilâs position would only serve to reduce them by 10%.
Among the proposals tabled, I should like to highlight the rapporteurâs point that progress must be made in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the role that the EU could play in making that happen.
The United States, Canada and Mexico have all sought to tighten up IMO agreements and the EU, especially given the recent accidents that it has had, can and must take action in this area.
I also welcome the rapporteurâs suggestion of promoting the development of environmental technology by creating a market for it.
The suggestions put forward in this area provide a more effective solution to protecting human health and the environment.
Â Â  . I voted as I did on the amendments before us because I share the concerns â and the aims â of this proposal for a directive aimed at bringing in sufficient harmonisation to develop the internal market, whilst complying with the rules on public health protection.
Â Â  . The report before us highlights the danger to public health of the use of certain substances, as raw materials or as intermediary materials.
Following experiments of various kinds, toluene and trichlorobenzene have been categorised as chemicals that pose a serious risk to public health.
The aim of the Commissionâs proposal, which the rapporteur, by making only one amendment, calls on us to support, is to restrict the use not only of toluene and trichlorobenzene, but also of preparations that contain them.
The EU has always been concerned with these issues, which are of major importance to the lives of its citizens, pursuant to Article 93 of the EC Treaty.
Given the evident benefits of adopting the proposal in terms of protecting European citizensâ health, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The 2006 budget concludes the 2000-2006 budget âplanningâ.
With a sum of less than EUR 120 billion, it remains 20 times smaller than the US budget, for a Europe that is seeking an American-style constitution, without having the means, nor even the desire, for 450 million men and women to change their lives.
Within this budget can be found a litany of limited budgetary themes: leftovers to recover, minimal loans for the Balkans, mosquito nets required for children struck by malaria, the financial application of the CAP reform, chatter on the development of the countryside without country people, the paltry funds allocated to fishing, and so on.
It is a budgetary strategy lacking in originality, because it serves an absence of ideas.
In pursuit of the Millennium Development Objectives, for instance, the budgetary authorities do not consider new customs duty technology, which, if made deductible, would allow an African country exporting in bulk to benefit from drawing rights on importing countries, which would be equal to the sum of customs duties sustained.
In 2006, as always, budgetary imagination is not high on the agenda in Brussels.
Â Â  . The 2006 budget has assumed strategic importance within the aim of sustaining dynamic growth in Europe, because it is the last of the current financial perspectives and therefore constitutes a strategic framework within which Parliament will decide its priorities for 2007-2013.
2006 is set to be a key year also in terms of meeting the goals of restoring dynamic and sustainable growth and providing for more and better jobs.
Europe will face enormous challenges in 2006.
Quite apart from the need to meet the financial needs of a Union of 25, the EU must ensure that the institutional and political adjustments arising from the new Constitutional Treaty proceed as efficiently as possible.
These challenges must therefore be underpinned by coherent, well coordinated and adequately financed actions, and the 2006 budget must play a central role in meeting them.
The challenges set by 2005/2006 are not confined to consolidating enlargement and the new Treaty, however.
The EU must also take decisions on various ongoing accession processes, reinforce its role on the international stage and launch new measures to reinvigorate the Lisbon Strategy.
Once again, these goals require the necessary resources to put them into practice and sustain them.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has voted against the proposals on social legislation relating to road transport and on minimum conditions for the implementation of this legislation.
Both contain extensive detailed regulations, which do not necessarily increase road safety.
Moreover, we believe that issues concerning social legislation need to be dealt with in the individual Member States and thus are not issues to which the EU should apply itself.
Â Â  . On the occasion of Mr Markovâs report, I wish to protest against the state of European legislation, which is notoriously inadequate (both in terms of working time, and working conditions and pay) in properly ensuring road safety for all.
The European Union has chosen a method that sets possible limits for working time and a few minimum social rules.
It does, however, offer the possibility of better regulations in certain Member States.
In reality, however, this system causes social dumping, as the free competition of services leads to carriers from countries where there is a better social framework being penalised.
As a result, the pursuit of competitiveness exerts pressure, in terms of the deterioration of working conditions and pay in these countries, and this is not acceptable.
The European Union ought to have instituted a different process, of upward harmonisation, by a system of progressive social convergence.
This strategy ought to have inextricably linked the creation of a base level (one that is more favourable than that used at present) and the obligation for a progressive reconciliation towards the highest level.
This is not what is planned, and the situation arising from European legislation cannot be accepted.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report because, in the vote on various amendments, we achieved a range of solutions that satisfy the specific interests of an outlying country in relation to the major centres of production and consumption, and that was achieved without undermining security requirements.
Furthermore, it is the workers who benefit most from this, because it provides for flexibility, which is in their interests.
Â Â  . I welcome the expected final adoption of the proposal, which is to abrogate Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 3820/85 and replace it with a new one, aimed at clarifying, simplifying and updating the current regulation.
The overall objective is to avoid different individual interpretations, which in the past have led to legal action.
In addition, the obligations of employees and employers have been laid down more clearly, with the primary aim of ensuring that they are able to be enforced more effectively.
The rapporteur has once again shown that he is working towards the Council Common Position and in so doing has sped up the process of adopting this important piece of legislation.
Important amendments will enter into force regarding compulsory daily rest periods and the maximum number of driving hours.
Additionally, a legal framework under which Member States may impose penalties on Member States found guilty of serious breaches.
This will hopefully meet the primary objective of improving road safety.
I should also like to echo the rapporteurâs wish to foster a climate of fair competition, in which the social interests of those involved in road transport are protected.
As for the amendments, I voted for the balanced proposals that take into account the particular needs and interests of the more outlying countries such as Portugal.
Â Â  . The EPLP welcomes the directive on drivers hours.
We believe they will make a major contribution to road safety.
We had however reservations about amendment 11 concerning the express delivery industry.
While recognising that there may be a problem in some countries we feel that the solution being proposed is unworkable and so could bring the directive into dispute.
Accordingly we chose to abstain on that amendment.
Â Â  . We voted against the joint resolution on the spring European Council, because the positions that we hold were not taken on board and because the proposals that we tabled were not accepted.
Among these proposals, I should like to highlight the following:
- Takes note of the European Council's agreement on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact; considers this as an implicit admission of the fact that the 1997 Stability and Growth Pact produced negative consequences for employment, public investment and real convergence and prolongs the stagnation of the European economy; considers, therefore, that it is essential to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact;
- Strongly criticises the fact that the âstructural reformsâ will be taken into account in budgetary assessments, as this will lead to perverse anti-social incentives for Member States to dismantle social security and the welfare state in order to avoid being penalised in the event of excessive deficit;
- Highlights the Council's statement that the current draft of the directive on services in the internal market 'does not fully meet the requirements' to preserve the European Social Model, but regrets that the Council did not seize the opportunity to reject this draft in total.
- Considers that the fight against income inequalities and the promotion of real convergence should be at the top of the EUÂŽs economic and social agenda.
Â Â  . The European Council held last March was the occasion for a new demonstration of hypocrisy by the leaders of the European Union, panicked at the idea of a victory for the ânoâ vote in the French referendum.
In spite of the soothing discussions, the Bolkestein directive was neither thoroughly reviewed nor withdrawn.
It continues along its normal legislative path, with just one concession: the Council of Ministers will attempt to find a consensus.
We are made to think it is a great diplomatic victory when it is no more and no less than the application of a 40-year-old method, the âLuxembourg compromiseâ.
The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, that harmful budgetary constraint, is also window-dressing.
The negotiation of the European Constitution could have provided the opportunity for in-depth reform of the Maastricht criteria, which make scarcely any economic sense. It could also have provided the opportunity to force the European Central Bank to support employment and growth as a matter of priority.
Nothing has been done.
In its place, we have these paltry finishing touches, whilst the Pact continues to have the effect of amplifying, indeed of provoking, the economic and social difficulties of our countries.
These manoeuvres are absurd.
They will not trick those who, in increasingly large numbers, reject the development of the Europe of Brussels.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative MEP colleagues have abstained on this vote because of our strong disappointment with the outcome of the European Council on 22-23 March.
We remain supportive of the President of the Commission's commitment to fundamental economic reform in Europe, but believe his efforts have been badly served by the decisions of Heads of State and Government at the March European Council.
The attempt to dilute the Services Directive for short-term political considerations has undermined the reform agenda and inhibits attempts to improve Europe's competitiveness.
The changes put forward to the Stability and Growth Pact demonstrates that political factors are outweighing economic considerations, making the Pact increasingly less credible.
We welcome some aspects of the Presidency Conclusions, including the commitment to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol and also the Motion's strong words against lifting the arms embargo on China.
We also welcome the increased sense of urgency in preparing for a possible flu pandemic.
Â Â  . Contrary to what was asserted, in France, by supporters of the European Constitution, Mr Chirac did not obtain the withdrawal of the Bolkestein directive in Brussels on 23 March.
In its official record, the European Council declares that the directive will not be withdrawn, indeed pointing out that it must remain on the European agenda, since the Growth and Jobs Strategy implies the opening up of the services market.
This lie is not, however, the first to be uttered by the hypocrites of the yes camp.
Mr Bolkestein himself pointed it out: until this year, neither Mr Chirac nor MrÂ Raffarin had voiced the least reserve on his directive, which was approved by the French Commissioners, the socialist Pascal Lamy and the Chirac supporter Michel Barnier.
Mr Bolkestein, with good reason, did nothing but carry out a decision taken in 2005 during the Lisbon Summit, where France was represented by Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin.
This directive is, however, only an outline of what awaits us if the European Constitution is adopted.
Articles 144, 145 and 148 of the text are clear.
Did you like the Bolkestein directive?
You will love the European Constitution.
By voting no on 29 May, the people of France will be defending their jobs and their social rights.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the resolution on the March Council Summit.
Given that growth currently stands at a meagre 1.7%, and employment at 63% rather than 70%, new priorities were urgently needed for the Lisbon process.
SMEs, which are responsible for generating 80% of jobs and 70% of apprenticeships, will be the most likely to benefit from the new focus on growth and employment.
Accusations of neo-liberalism are misguided, as the aim is create more and better jobs, not to introduce lower standards, and to reinforce the European social model by means of investment in human capital, modern social protection and greater involvement of social partners.
The European Youth Pact, with its objectives of long-term integration into the labour market, improved general and vocational education and increased mobility for young people, is particularly important in this respect.
The Active Ageing campaign is of key significance for older people, as the experience, skills and productivity these workers have gained deserve greater recognition.
Action must be taken that enable them to stay in employment for longer and to take greater advantage of education and training opportunities, and overall improvements must be made to the way our senior citizens are integrated into society.
I am counting on specific solutions being proposed that provide responses to the Commissionâs Green Paper on the demographic situation in the EU.
Â Â  . â The reform of the Stability Pact and the midterm review of the Lisbon Strategy are the two whips which will be used more intensively against the peoples, especially young people.
A new anti-grass roots assault is being prepared.
The reformed Stability Pact does not revise the objectives of the anti-grass roots policy against the workers.
On the contrary, arm-in-arm with the Lisbon Strategy, greater impetus is being given to big business and the demands of the Franco-German axis are being satisfied.
The decisions on poorer pension systems, the abolition of collective agreements, the generalisation of part-time and temporary work, the liberalisation of working times, the reduction in state aid, the reduction in subsidies, full liberalisation of the market with more privatisation, drastic cuts in employers' social security contributions and the generalisation of private insurance are a fact, the direct repercussions of which are wage and pension cuts and more poverty and unemployment.
In particular, the European Youth Pact and the promotion of training and lifelong learning mean lifelong illiteracy and flexibility for the convenience of big business.
The way forward for the peoples and young people is resistance and disobedience to the anti-grass roots decisions of the European Council.
Â Â  . Although I have voted in favour of this resolution, I must say that I am somewhat disillusioned by the conclusions of the European Council of 22 and 23Â MarchÂ 2005.
Both the review of the Lisbon Strategy and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact display a lack of ambition.
Public finances require greater streamlining and investments must be more efficient; what they do not need is further debt.
It is also true, however, that the Lisbon Strategy needed a review, in order to make it more realistic and more geared towards genuine competitiveness.
Jobs are not created by decree, but by means of a healthy economy, and it cannot be said that the Union has been moving purposefully in that direction.
Â Â  . It appears, at first glance, that the Brussels European Council will be inextricably associated with the review of the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, which underwent amendments following numerous cases of non-compliance.
Although these amendments are far-removed from the excessive rigidity that characterised the previous version, it is also essential that they avoid any vagueness, because otherwise they might have a negative impact on the euroâs credibility internationally and on the stability of Member Statesâ public finances.
A further relevant aspect that the Council focused on was the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, in light of the lack of success at this mid-term stage.
I feel that the Strategy has been a victim of its own ambition and of the vague, almost bombastic nature of some of the targets that were set, without their being pegged to a properly laid out and workable timetable.
More realism is needed, to go with the ambition.
In spite of some reservations with regard to parts of the Services Directive, particularly the announcement and the exaggerated defence of the so-called country of origin principle, I believe that it contains some highly positive aspects that we should adopt and put into practice at European level.
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as I feel that it clearly identifies and criticises the most significant effects of the Councilâs proposals.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on regional integration in the Western Balkans.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank Parliament, and the rapporteur Mr Samuelsen, for the forward-looking resolution on the Western Balkans and for the commitment of Parliament and of its Foreign Affairs Committee to the region.
Currently, most of the countries in the Western Balkans are making tangible progress in their relations with the EU.
Yet, many issues still need to be addressed and progress consolidated and reinforced.
The years 2005 and 2006 will be crucial for the Western Balkans in relation to the European Union.
We are at a real watershed.
We have to overcome certain short-term issues to be able to focus on long-term economic and social development.
The most critical immediate issues concern the conclusion of the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia â ICTY â and the settlement of the future status of Kosovo.
As a former Member of the European Parliament, I have always been proud of the strong record of this House in advocating respect for human rights and related international obligations, as well as in supporting the multilateral system based on the United Nations.
This is why I particularly welcome Parliamentâs views in paragraphs 37 and 46, where full cooperation with ICTY, the Hague Tribunal, is underlined.
This support for human rights, the rule of law and UN-based multilateralism is the reason why the European Union has made cooperation with ICTY a condition in its relations with the countries in the region.
This autumn, probably in November, the Commission will present the enlargement package and report in more detail on the progress made by the countries in the region.
Let me now take the opportunity to sketch out where we stand today as regards these countries.
Looking at Albania, I share the concern expressed in Parliamentâs resolution on the political climate, particularly in the context of this summerâs parliamentary elections.
I have recently written to Prime Minister Nano to underline that the Commission will only be able to propose the conclusion of negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement if the parliamentary elections this summer are conducted in accordance with international standards.
Tangible achievements must also be made in fighting corruption and organised crime.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is actively tackling the priorities we identified in the feasibility report in late 2003.
Once the country achieves significant progress in all priority areas, we can recommend opening negotiations on the Stabilisation and Accession Agreement.
I hope to be able to do so next month.
On ICTY cooperation, there is significant progress, and the trend must be reinforced to lead to full cooperation.
For the opening of SAA negotiations, the police reform is a particularly important condition for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The High Representative and the Union have been instrumental in advancing stability and reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I believe, however, that the country is ready to assume more responsibility for its own future.
With responsible and democratically accountable authorities in place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I foresee a smooth and gradual phasing-out of the Office of the High Representative.
As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, it is indeed time to move from the era of Dayton to the era of Brussels.
I was disappointed that Croatia was not able to ensure full cooperation with the ICTY by mid-March.
As you know, in December the European Council decided that accession negotiations could only be opened on 17 March, if there was full cooperation with the Hague Tribunal.
This concerns the willingness and ability of the state structures in Croatia to comply with the rule of law and international obligations.
Croatia must now demonstrate that it is fully cooperating with the ICTY.
Let me be clear. Croatiaâs future is in the European Union.
Through the adoption of the negotiating framework, the EU has done what is necessary to start the negotiations.
The EU is ready, once Croatia is ready.
Let me turn to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
President Barroso and I met Prime Minister BuÄkovski in February when he handed over the countryâs replies to the Commissionâs questionnaire.
My services are currently analysing the 13 000 pages â 45 kg â of replies.
We expect the government to make further progress in its reform agenda, to strengthen the rule of law and to implement the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
I am concerned about the OSCE reports on the repetition of irregularities in the latest municipal elections.
The authorities must now react decisively and ensure that future elections can take place in full compliance with international standards.
Depending on the political development, on the progress in legal, political and economic reforms and on the technical quality of the replies, we aim to adopt the opinion by the end of this year.
Yesterday the Commission took a positive decision on the Feasibility Study for Serbia and Montenegro.
We now consider the country to be sufficiently prepared to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.
We need to treat countries equally at equal stages; we must use the same yardstick at the same stage for each country.
Negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement is very different from negotiating accession to the Union.
We will demand more as Serbia and Montenegro moves forward in the process.
To reach this stage Serbia and Montenegro had to make special efforts.
I welcome the agreement concluded last week on the Constitutional Charter, which ensures the legitimacy of the State Union Parliament.
I am pleased that the country has finally made significant progress in cooperating with the Hague Tribunal.
So far this year, a dozen persons indicted for war crimes have boarded the plane to The Hague.
Efforts should be reinforced until none of the remaining indictees is still at large.
Accession negotiations proper cannot even be considered until the country has achieved full cooperation with ICTY.
With the tenth anniversary of Srebrenica approaching in July, Radovan KaradziÄ and Ratko MladiÄ must be brought to justice.
This is the beginning of the European road for Serbia and Montenegro.
The country has achieved a great deal over the past few years.
Now it is time to move on, time to reward significant progress, and time to show the citizens of Serbia and Montenegro that meeting critical international obligations brings them closer to the European Union.
Kosovo will be high on the agenda in the months to come, with the standards review coming up in mid-2005, likely to be followed by discussions on Kosovoâs future status.
We are focusing on helping the Kosovo authorities to make progress on implementing UN standards, especially the rule of law and the rights of minorities.
Once the status has been settled, we will continue to support Kosovoâs progress towards European integration.
The Commission plans to present a Communication next week on âA European Future for Kosovoâ.
It will give a clear signal to the leaders and people of Kosovo that the EU is fully committed to their European future.
We also expect the Kosovan leaders to show a constructive attitude, including meeting Serbian leaders who have stretched out a hand to them.
Belgrade also needs to work constructively to settle the issue.
In the Feasibility Study for Serbia and Montenegro, we made it clear to Belgrade that the countryâs EU aspirations are linked to a successful resolution of Kosovoâs status.
To sum up, although there are difficulties and pitfalls on the Western Balkansâ road to Europe, most countries are currently making steady progress.
Those countries struggling to reform antiquated economies, and to build modern societies based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, have, at the same time, to deal with the legacy of war.
In this context I would like to highlight the importance of regional cooperation.
Good neighbourly relations and regional economic cooperation are the very essence of the European Union.
They are the catalyst for stability, reconciliation and normalising political relations.
This is a major challenge to the countries of the region and to the European Union.
It is a tall order, but I am confident that we are on the right track.
The less we need to focus on stability and security, the more we can channel our resources to economic and social development, which is rightly underlined in the Samuelsen report.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EU foreign policy ought to focus on South East Europe, and the EU ought to take consistent measures to finish what it started in the mid-1990s.
To date, however, such measures have been thin on the ground.
The aim behind this report was to allow us to exert a certain amount of pressure on the Council and the Commission, and today we have learnt that this course of action has proved successful, at least at this stage of the game.
I was glad to hear the Commissioner say a few moments ago that the Commission now, at long last, plans to present a communication on Kosovo, and MrÂ Schmit also said that the Council would try to ensure that the increased interest in this region would be backed up by action.
At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves what action the countries themselves are taking.
The two previous speakers have already referred to the need for Albania to ensure at long last that the forthcoming elections are conducted properly and that the results are not manipulated in any way.
The Albanian Government must also take the business of governance seriously once and for all, by combating corruption and implementing legislation.
We are all aware that Macedonia must press on with the Aarhus process in order to enable its Albanians, who make up 25% of the population as a whole, to feel as though they are on an equal footing with other citizens.
Until this happens, it will be impossible for Macedonia to act as a stabilising force in the region.
The Commission and the Council have for some considerable time needed to bring pressure to bear on local politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina to amend the Dayton Agreement in such a way that a functioning community can be established.
The country will never be able to join the European Union in its current state.
There is still too little cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, and not enough refugees have yet returned to .
Turning to Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, the confederation between Serbia and Montenegro is still far from robust, and a decision should be taken in the near future as to whether it should remain in existence or be dissolved.
Belgrade and Pristina must work together under the auspices of the UN and the EU to find a solution to the Kosovo issue as quickly as possible, and there is no reason why such a solution should not be found, given that all the countries concerned wish to join the European Union.
I hope that Croatia will be able to persuade the monitoring mission that it is cooperating fully.
All the above-mentioned countries are facing enormous problems with regard to their judicial systems and the fight against corruption, and they also lack administrative capacity.
We must take steps to help them in this respect, and indeed we should help all these countries in a more committed and coherent fashion.
We should provide them with access to pre-accession instruments so that they develop functioning national economies and functioning democracies.
If this happens, everyone will benefit, especially the young people in the countries in question.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU.
There can be no question that something resembling enlargement fatigue has set in, both among the Members of this House â including some of those who voted in favour â and among the public.
It has been a particularly challenging task of late to discuss the next rounds of enlargement, but the Council, the Commission and Parliament must work together to explain to the public that this is the only way in which this region can be stabilised.
We must also make it clear that negative developments in these countries lead to an increased risk of various problems such as cross-border crime, corruption or renewed outbreaks of ethnic conflicts, and that this risk can be averted only if the countries have a clear prospect of European integration.
I am extremely grateful to the Presidency and the Commission for having emphasised this point today.
Our attention must now be focused firmly on this region, particularly in view of the decisions we have taken today, and I am grateful to the Council for having found a solution aimed at helping Croatia.
This solution involves close monitoring of the steps taken by the country with a view to handing Gotovina over to the Hague Tribunal, and I hope that both parties will set about adopting it without delay, as this would enable us to open negotiations with Croatia in the near future.
Croatia made a great deal of progress under previous governments, and there is a real chance that the present government could act as a beacon or a driving force â depending on which analogy you prefer â for the rest of the region.
Any agreement we reach with Croatia should therefore not be seen as an attack on Serbia or any other country, as it would be intended to benefit the region as a whole.
Of course, I am sure that we would all be delighted if Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo were to join together in perfect harmony to form one country.
Given everything that has happened, however, particularly as far as Kosovo is concerned, this is highly unlikely.
I am therefore of the opinion that a way should be found in which these countries â or at any rate Kosovo â can gain independence whilst still maintaining their existing historical and ethnic links.
Regardless of whether the Community of Independent States is taken as a model or whether another form of cooperation is established, I would ask the Council and the Commission to be as imaginative as possible when working on this task, as it is essential that we come up with a serious solution to the problem of Serbia and Montenegro, as well as to that of Kosovo, before the end of 2006.
I can assure you that this House will be right behind you if the proposals you put forward are good ones.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is true that there are still many problems in this region.
That has also been emphasised by the speakers from the Council and the Commission, and I should like to thank them for the accounts they have given.
It is also true, however, that this region has a good deal in prospect, including in terms of its integration into the Europe we have today.
I should like to cite an example from Denmark.
The latest enlargement of Europe was a real eye-opener for a great many Danes who came to see Europe in a new light: not just as an economic club for the rich, but as a political club that was based upon a number of common values and that could be a driving force in the development of democracies and security.
Recently, we have seen how one of the Danish parties that plays a crucial role in the EU debate, namely the Socialist Peopleâs Party, has changed from being eurosceptic to being europhile.
Moreover, they have quite clearly done this in the light of the development we saw involving enlargement.
The next major challenge is this particular region, and, as we have recently seen, there are still of course problems in Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro, Kosovo and Croatia, with accession negotiations having had to be postponed.
What is important, however, is to insist that these countries have prospects in terms of Europe, for it is those prospects that can be the very driving force they need.
Moreover, we in the rest of Europe very much need to show that what we have here is a key area for European cooperation.
We are entering an exciting year. It will be a year in which we shall of course â and hopefully as quickly as possible â have found a positive settlement with regard to Croatia.
It will no doubt also be the year in which we can come closer to solving the problem surrounding FYROMâs or Macedoniaâs name, and it will also hopefully be a year in which we come closer to settling the matter of Kosovoâs future status.
I should also like to take this opportunity to say thank you for your cooperation in connection with the resolution and its preparation.
It has become a useful tool that will help maintain not only the pressure and momentum that are now hopefully part of developments, but also the commitment that the EU must demonstrate if a solution is to be found to the regionâs problems.
We can then get the process seriously under way, and matters will make sense to all the parties involved and appear to be going somewhere.
Â Â  . â It has been stressed by various speakers in this debate and also in various reports and pronouncements by the Commission and the Council. The countries of the Western Balkans are future members of the European Union, but in the present social climate that is easier said than done.
We heard it in the debate this morning about Romania and Mr Swoboda has referred to it: there is a certain enlargement fatigue.
I am very afraid that this enlargement fatigue will in particular have repercussions on our Balkan policy.
I remain convinced that â however unpopular it may be and I emphasise it here once more â the European Union needs a Balkan strategy.
Yesterday the International Commission for the Balkans, whose membership includes a good many interesting and expert people, published a report. I quote from that report.
It is about the Western Balkans. âThe wars may be over but the smell of violence is still hanging in the air.â
If you travel round the Balkans, in whatever country it may be, then is the situation and that means that the EU simply cannot afford to think that it is not very convenient for us for the moment, let us let these countries be for now.
In this new strategy, in this strategy for the Balkans aimed at membership, two factors are important.
Firstly â although it is patently obvious, I will say it again â the social and economic development in the region at the moment is disastrous and that is the main source of instability.
With high unemployment rates it is virtually impossible for young people leaving school here to build a future locally.
This leads to additional criminality, uncertainty and instability, and that should not be what we want.
If the European Union is good at anything, it is in the fostering of economic ties between these countries and between them and the European Union.
A second element that we must not abandon is the adherence to the basic conditions with regard to human rights and minority rights.
Although we as Balkan spokespersons were divided amongst ourselves about this in respect of Croatia, it has already been proven in my view that the adherence by the Council to cooperation with the Hague Tribunal as a condition for the start of negotiations has positive effects in both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.
I am glad and my compliments to the Council that it stood firm on cooperation with the Tribunal.
Then the matter that concerns us all: Kosovo.
I have just been there and am convinced that the report about the standards and what has happened so far will come as a matter of course.
I am completely confident that this debate about status will be held.
In that debate, Europe, whether it likes it or not, must take the lead because we have the root in our hands.
We have the reward for Serbia and Kosovo in our own hands.
This debate about the independence of Kosovo must be conducted under all kinds of conditions that are clear even now: no separation, no cooperation with Albania or Macedonia and respect for the Serbian minority.
To do nothing and look away, though, to act as if it is too difficult for Europe to deal with the Balkans at the moment, that is an approach that we cannot afford.
Doing nothing will lead to an intolerable and dangerous situation.
Let us not inflict this on ourselves and the countries of the Balkans!
Â Â  . In the 1990s we thought we could solve the problems in former Yugoslavia by setting up protectorates, sending external administrators and soldiers there and forcing refugees to return to areas where there was now a different ethnic majority.
This American model leads to stagnation.
It forces the people there back into the role of under-age children.
They are going to bide their time until these foreign busybodies have left.
The alternative to this stagnation is that we seek a peaceful, democratic way from the bottom up by taking seriously how the people in Kosovo, Montenegro, the separate entities in Bosnia or the two large language areas in Macedonia itself for example see their future and what they want to call themselves.
States and population groups that opposed each other in the 1990s still reject domination by their neighbours but they do want to cooperate with open borders.
An early start to the negotiations on accession to the European Union, starting with Croatia and Macedonia, can contribute to this.
Europe must now without prejudice seek the real solutions together with all concerned.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina is a time bomb waiting to go off!
Clear language on the part of EUFOR, the European Unionâs military mission in that country.
Nearly ten years after Dayton the former warring parties are continuing their ethnic struggle unabated in the political arena.
By no means did the ad hoc delegation of this Parliament gain a comforting picture of the present situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo and Mostar last week, but it was certainly a realistic one.
This underlines once more the usefulness of the EUFOR mission locally.
You might expect a conciliatory contribution from the religious communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Representatives of Council, Commission and EUFOR reported the opposite.
I would like to urge Council and Commission to keep reminding the church authorities and the of their great responsibility in this regard.
The recent arrest of Bosnians in Chechnya is an ominous sign. It illustrates the danger of religious extremism for which EUFOR sources were seeking our attention.
A moving part of the visit of the ad hoc delegation to Sarajevo was an inspection of minefields.
Council and Commission, only the clearance of these fields of death can make the transition to a peaceful existence possible.
So please invest extra in the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this way!
Â Â  Mr President, we all know only too well that recent years have brought great sadness to the Balkans region and to the many people who lost family and loved ones as a result of the wars there.
The final phase of this war resulted in the NATO attack on Kosovo and the collapse of the regime.
I very much support the policies of the European Union, which have been put in place to help to rebuild the economies of the Western Balkans region.
The European Union is right in the most part to treat the Balkans area as a single region.
Politically, this is a very sensitive issue in terms of the future relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkans.
The European Union is, of course, the single largest contributor of economic aid to the Balkans region at this time.
Monies are being used to improve basic infrastructures in the field of transport, environment, energy and telecommunications.
European Union support is also being directed towards improving the efficiency of public institutions, focusing in particular on the judiciary, police forces and public administration.
That does not mean, however, that the European Union is not critical of political developments in the Balkans region.
The European Union is still demanding that war suspects be handed over to the international war tribunal in The Hague.
However, there have been many very positive developments in the Balkan region in recent times.
I welcome the American Governmentâs decision to withdraw its troops from Bosnia and hand over peacekeeping control to European Union forces.
It is clear that there is broad political stability in the region.
We know that we must keep a very close eye on political developments in that region and I support what is known as the stabilisation and association process.
I am in favour of these countries becoming members of the European Union if they comply with the Copenhagen criteria in terms of respecting the rule of law and promoting human rights.
The European Union as a political entity knows and will meet its obligations in this regard.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Western Balkans have always been the testing ground for trying out the efficacy of the European Union's external action.
European policy to date has been typified by its fragmentary character, scattered actions, lack of coordination and the fact that it is out of step with the development potential of the area.
As I see it, the challenges for shaping a more productive European policy in relation to the Western Balkans are:
First, to build measures to further trust, social cohesion and security.
Secondly, to link European support for and the European prospects of the Balkans to strict terms of political adjustment, administrative reform and justice.
Thirdly, to prepare an advanced and cohesive strategic plan for the development of the Balkans, with the intermediate objective of integrated and sustainable growth and the final objective of convergence with the European Union.
The plan will articulate the priorities of each country, seek out areas of cooperation and mutual benefit, lay down priorities and lines of action, set out and quantify requirements in basic sectors and make provision for resources to implement it.
Fourthly, to support regional economic integration, with the focus on cross-border infrastructures and the trans-European networks.
Fifthly, to invigorate regional cooperation policy by establishing a structured political dialogue, in accordance with the precedent of the European Conference on Central and Eastern European Counties prior to their accession.
Finally, Mr Samuelsen's amendment and other similar amendments concerning the name of the FYROM are, to my mind, unacceptable for the reasons set out in the joint declaration by the New Democracy parliamentary group, a copy of which has been sent to all the members of the European Parliament.
As a minimum sign of institutional and political responsibility, I consider that all the members of the European Parliament and of the other institutions of the European Union should use the official names, the United Nations names, as Commissioner Rehn in fact did.
Â Â  â Mr President, the initiative by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposing amendments on the question of the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and calling for the country to be recognised by the European Union with its constitutional name force me to take a stand from the outset on this issue alone.
I wish to state in the most categorical terms that this initiative directly conflicts with the resolutions passed by the UN and the decisions taken by the European Union and its institutions, including the European Parliament.
This is an initiative which flies in the face of every notion of solidarity with a Member State of the European Union, with Greece, which is one of the parties participating in the negotiating process under way within the framework of the UN to find a mutually acceptable and dignified solution, an honourable and logical compromise.
When all of us, including them, have denounced the unilateral action of the United States in connection with the recognition of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, they come along today to confirm and accept the unilateral action by the United States of America, recognising the FYROM with its constitutional name.
This stand creates a real problem, when today we should be debating and should be helping to shape a joint, integrated European strategy for the major challenges and dangers of renewed confrontation and instability in the area of the Western Balkans.
This would indeed be an important contribution to the defence of European interests and to the strengthening of the European prospects of the countries in the area.
Conflict and war in the Balkans should make us all more careful, more responsible and more realistic.
Greece has succeeded in assimilating the lessons of the recent history of conflict in the Balkans and has proven, with peace and cooperation initiatives, to be a stabilising factor.
It is the first European country when it comes to investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, investments which have created more than 20Â 000 jobs.
It has demonstrated a real sense of responsibility, realism and a willingness to compromise at the UN in order to resolve the problem of the name and find a logical compromise which leaves both countries' dignity intact.
That is why I call on my honourable friends in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the rapporteur, Mr Samuelsen, to withdraw their amendments, at least for the time being, just as I call on the President-in-Office of the Council and the Member of the Commission to take a stand on this issue.
Â Â  (Thank you Mr President.
I wish to speak about the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from the geo-strategic aspect of the process of the enlargement of the European Union towards the southeast.
Its geographical position in the unstable Balkan region is extremely important for the European Union, especially in a situation where the constitutional status of neighbouring Kosovo has not been finalised and is witness to sensitive constitutional reform being carried out on the basis of the Ohrid framework agreement.
The framework agreement is a constitutional documentation of the principle of cultural diversity.
In it the majority national group of Slavonic Macedonians express how they will at all levels, from national to local, subscribe to sharing power with the minority national group of Albanian Macedonians.
The importance of the agreement for the stability of the situation must therefore be measured by the criteria of a civilisational turning point.
Reform of the fundamental societal relations is progressing parallel to economic reform.
In order for it to continue, the country needs a clear prospect of establishing closer relations with the European Union, and our help in consolidating its new identity.
And a part of this is the question posed by rapporteur Samuelsen: âHas the time not come for the European Union to consider recognising it by its constitutional name â the Republic of Macedonia?â
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, there can be no question that all of the nations and ethnic groups in the Balkans that are pinning their hopes on the EU after a long history of suffering are European.
On closer inspection, however, it unfortunately becomes apparent that âold boy networksâ still operate in many of these Balkan states.
The promised reforms often exist only on paper, and for this former members of the are mainly to blame.
Virtually no serious efforts are being made to stop corruption, and the gap between rich and poor is growing.
The illiteracy rate is rising in some areas, and the situation of minorities, in particular the Roma, leaves much to be desired.
Elections are manipulated by means of bribes and sometimes even violence.
All the EU institutions should take a much closer look at what is really going on, and they must not allow members of the âold boy networksâ to pull the wool over their eyes.
I believe that we should take our time and examine the situation in more depth before we agree to countries joining the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, contrary to what these documents claim, Croatia does not belong to the Western Balkans.
It is a Central European country, and the only one, apart from Switzerland and Liechtenstein, that does not yet belong to the EU.
Given that it meets the criteria, we should open negotiations with it at once.
In the real Balkans, however, there is still more than enough to do.
A constitutional reform must take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to transform it into a strong federation of three nations with equal rights, and LordÂ Ashdownâs dictatorship must be brought to an end.
Before the end of the year, Kosovo must be presented with a clear roadmap to independence, albeit with conditions attached.
Any other approach would be devoid of any basis in reality.
Serbia and Montenegro must allow thorough monitoring of their compliance with human rights.
In this respect, I am somewhat concerned that the decision taken this week by the Commission rested rather too much on misapprehensions.
As far as Macedonia is concerned, the name issue must finally be settled, and, much as I respect the Greek Members, I would call on them to abandon their narrow-minded way of thinking on this matter.
In Germany, Franconia is a part of Bavaria, and we also have Frankfurt, yet noÂ one would ever suggest that France must instead start calling itself the Republic of Paris, because it might otherwise make territorial claims to Frankfurt or Franconia.
We are in the 21st century now, and there is no longer any place for such nonsense.
We must make it clear exactly where the EUâs boundaries lie.
MrÂ Langen belongs to the ranks of those who repeatedly point out that the EU would be overstretching itself if it allowed Turkey to join, yet South East Europe is quite clearly European.
We must focus our energies on stabilising South East Europe and Croatia, which is a Central European country that has as little reason to be called part of the Balkans as does the beautiful Bohemian town of Kaden an der Eger, or as do Munich or Altenkirchen in Siegerland.
Croatia belongs to Central Europe, and it must be integrated into Europe.
This would also stabilise the neighbouring Balkans.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to continue where my esteemed colleague Posselt left off.
I agree with the numerous reports deriving from the resolution, and I will therefore support it.
However, in the resolution I miss the important emphasis that the establishment of peace itself does not yet signify a resolution of the complex and fundamental issues of coexistence for the peoples of that region.
It would be highly erroneous for us to form the impression that we now have fully formed democratic states in that region, and that with them and the EU everything should be about rapid modernisation and integration with the EU.
In my opinion the EU should take more initiative and responsibility to ensure that the fundamental status of certain states in that region is settled by peaceful means, without the use of force, by agreement and, most importantly, on a more permanent basis.
For instance, the unreformed Dayton Agreement represents a hindrance for the development of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the status of Kosovo must be settled, the majority of Serbs and Montenegrins wish to live in independent countries, and so on. I think these are fundamental issues that deserve a more fundamental response than we are able to give at this moment.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when speaking of the Balkans, we cannot think of a stable arrangement except within the European Union.
European integration can only be achieved, however, if there is a great impetus from the people.
In the Balkans this must also result from a political truth and reconciliation process, alongside the criminal proceedings at the Court in the Hague â which is certainly important but by itself cannot ensure that everybody is aware of who did what in the war of the early 1990s.
The scenario that we are dealing with today may represent a restoration of the situation in which violence broke out and in which victims and persecutors can now confront each other.
Such profound confrontations are the only way to turn the page so that nobody can return to it.
This is a necessary step in building a democracy, because it implies mutual respect and trust.
The Union is in need of great determination directed towards the future and must not remain imprisoned by the past.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there is not a lot that can be said in two minutes, especially if the subject is as big a one as that of the Western Balkans.
I therefore intend to mention a few things that are common to all the countries in the region and to our attitude towards them.
The Western Balkans is an area affected not only by war and destruction but also by 50 years of Communism.
We who have experienced a war know how easy it is to start one and how difficult it is to bring it to an end.
We who have experienced Communism also know how long a period is required to build up democracy.
In all of these countries that we are talking about today, there is some sort of division: in Croatia, between the democratic and non-democratic forces, in Bosnia between the federation and the Republika Srpska, and in Serbia and Montenegro between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians.
When we engage in discussions with these countries and impose various requirements, we must keep this in mind and try to help the democratic forces that exist in the Western Balkans but that are not always as strong or even as authentic as we believe.
When we talk, for example, about those accused of war crimes in Republika Srpska or Serbia queuing to come to The Hague, there are not many in this Parliament who know that those people and their families are given a lot of money from the authorities for doing so.
When we talk about Macedonia voluntarily participating in the negotiations concerning its change of name, there are not many in this Parliament who know that that is only a part of the truth, for only Greek representatives are present at the negotiations and not Macedonian representatives able to put forward their views on the matter.
I also wish to emphasise that all the decisions of this Parliament are interpreted and analysed carefully by both the negative and positive forces in the region.
We therefore need to be extremely careful about the signals we send out to the people of these countries, irrespective of whether we are talking about the demands for the return of refugees to Kosovo, Macedoniaâs change of name or Croatiaâs future membership of the EU.
Whatever we do, we must support those fighting for peaceful and democratic development and impose sanctions upon those obstructing such development.
Â Â  Mr President, I was in Bosnia-Herzegovina recently and saw the successful start of EUFOR, the EU peacekeeping mission.
Bitter enmities remain between the countryâs Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian groups.
In spite of the fact that up to 10Â 000 people are implicated in war crimes, only 34Â public indictments have been made.
The road to Brussels cannot be journeyed until respect for the EUâs standards of justice is achieved.
That is why the European Parliament is right today to insist on full cooperation with the ICTY by Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.
Today Europe invests 25 times more money and 50 times more troops per capita in Kosovo than in Afghanistan.
It is in the EUâs economic, as well as political, interest to integrate the Western Balkans, and it is their historic destiny.
The prospect of EU enlargement helped the countries of Eastern Europe to transform.
We have to hope and work to ensure that it is the same for the countries of south-east Europe, so that they can join us as well in this Parliament and in our Union.
Â Â  . First of all I should like to congratulate Parliament for having taken the initiative in holding this debate.
In actual fact, as the Commissioner and I have both emphasised, the situation in the Western Balkans is of vital interest to the European Union.
I note that we do not, in fact, have any major alternative to the European perspective.
The European perspective is the only tool that we have in order to convince these countries to change, to undertake reforms, to find the way to Europe â which means, first of all, the way to European values â and to find the way to reconciliation.
It is not absurd to tell these countries to find the way to reconciliation, because we ourselves set an example of such reconciliation sixty years ago.
I believe, therefore, that so-called âenlargement fatigueâ is a fact, and that people are questioning these constant movements towards enlargement, towards new accessions.
However, we must explain to them that it is in the interests of every one of us to achieve peace, stability and economic development in this region.
Someone referred to the record rates of endemic unemployment in Kosovo and Bosnia.
We are confronted by a situation which at first glance seems impossible to resolve.
Why is there unemployment?
There is unemployment because there is no economic development. There is no economic development because there is no private investment and there is no private investment because there is neither confidence nor security: no one wants to invest in regions where the future and development are uncertain.
We therefore have a fundamental mission: to consolidate security, to provide security and to convince the people that their future lies in security, in reconciliation, and in respect for minority rights.
I believe that this is how we can release a positive dynamic, which is first of all an economic dynamic.
In fact, as long as there is no economic recovery in this region we shall not really have a stable peace.
This is an important mission for the European Union.
Once again I should like to thank Parliament for having realised and pointed out the fact that there is a need for urgent action in this region, by means of all the avenues which have been mentioned and described.
Finally, I agree that there is a risk of extremism.
Here in Europe we have a possible focus of radical extremism, in particular Islamic extremism.
In this respect too, we must ensure prevention, and the only way of ensuring prevention is via dialogue. We must demonstrate that this part of Europe belongs to Europe, that it shares European values, even if it also includes people of the Muslim faith.
I believe, therefore, that what we are doing today is sending an important signal, and we must continue to send that signal throughout the years to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to join Minister Schmit in congratulating Parliament on taking the initiative to hold this debate.
It is extremely important that you hold this debate at this critical moment to help keep the Western Balkans on the agenda of the European Union and of the international community, both of which have quite a number of other issues to tackle.
It is important, therefore, that we discuss the Western Balkans and try to improve our policies in that region.
One of the issues raised by several speakers in this debate was enlargement fatigue and I think this is a very serious challenge.
We must bring the peoples of the European Union along with us on our road to enlargement.
Our next steps, therefore, must be gradual and carefully and prudently managed.
It is also important to underline that enlargement is in itself a security policy.
The legal and political reforms, as well as the economic development stimulated by the EU perspective, will reduce instability and conflict, for instance in the Western Balkans.
We need to have a dialogue and explain this point to our citizens to ensure that the future of the Western Balkans is not held hostage by unwarranted fears.
I shall try to provide answers to two questions specifically raised here, the first concerning the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the second a question regarding the constitutional complexity of Serbia and Montenegro.
As regards the name issue, the Commission supports the efforts of the United Nations for a mutually agreeable solution to the name issue between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
We hope that the recent proposals by the UN facilitator, Mr Nimetz, will contribute to this objective.
A solution to this bilateral issue would clearly contribute to regional stability in the Western Balkans at a delicate moment.
Concerning Serbia and Montenegro, the Commission has deliberately developed a twin-track approach in response to the complex structure of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.
This allows both republics and the State Union to make progress in their respective areas of competence.
The State Union is mainly responsible for foreign policy and security issues, while the republics are responsible for most aspects of economic policy and trade relations.
Thanks to this twin-track approach we have recently been able to sign the bilateral trade agreement in textiles with Serbia, which is important for investment and employment in that republic.
We will report on the progress of Serbia and Montenegro through this approach in the Commissionâs annual report on the stabilisation and association process this autumn.
The constitutional framework should be respected but at the same time should not hinder the countryâs progress on its European road, if it meets other conditions for pre-accession and later perhaps accession.
Finally, one of the biggest challenges we face in refining our policies on the Western Balkans and bringing the countries closer to the European Union is the weakness of the states in this region.
They are chiefly weak states.
If the state cannot ensure that the basic daily needs of its population are met, it certainly cannot rise to European standards.
It is as simple as that.
We must, therefore, find better ways of building institutions in the region, such as the approach to building Member States rightly advocated by the report of the International Commission on the Balkans, which was published yesterday.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Samuelsen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Parliament, and I very much look forward to working with you for stability, progress and prosperity in the Western Balkans.
Â Â  I have received one motion for a resolution to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103 of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- A6-0062/2005 by MrÂ Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Communities â 2003 [8412/2004 â 2004/2172(INI)],
- A6-0072/2005 by MrÂ Kuhne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy [2004/2167(INI)].
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, the aim of our annual report is to set out a proposal regarding the ways in which cooperation between the Council and Parliament, or between the Commission and Parliament, could be altered and improved.
This is particularly important in view of the fact that we are currently in the first year of a new parliamentary term.
We are well aware that the main responsibility for the foreign, security and defence policy rests with the executive.
Parliamentâs role in this respect is largely confined to the exercising of control, although its budgetary powers allow it to exert a certain amount of influence.
Particularly as far as the latter are concerned, it would be useful if the Commission and the Council could avoid presenting Parliament with in the future, and involve it at an earlier stage of proceedings.
It should not be the case that Parliament is only informed after the event; instead, it should be involved in the planning and development of strategies, in order to ensure that consideration is given to its wishes.
This would then make matters simpler for all parties concerned, as we would already have identified an approach that would allow us to make good progress.
This House believes that it is important for the same priorities to apply in foreign policy as have done to date.
There is an old saying that war is the failure of politics, and it is true that war should always be a last resort.
This is why we believe that it is essential to strengthen the preventive aspect of our foreign policy, and to ensure that our prevention and crisis management capabilities are greatly extended.
This is the same line as that followed by the European Union as a whole, as prevention is clearly identified as an objective in the draft Constitution.
We should make our position on this matter quite clear, not only to gain public support, but also to develop strategic positions.
This leads us to very practical considerations regarding the question of where our priorities should lie.
The answer must be the Middle East conflict, as a result of which we are cooperating more closely with the Americans, the Russians and the UN within the Quartet.
The aim of this cooperation is not only to provide support to the Palestinians and Israelis and to bring about peace, but also to gain better control over cover-up activities for terrorism in the broadest sense, which is in fact our second main priority.
The solidarity provisions in the Constitutional Treaty relating to mutual assistance are also of major importance in this respect, and we must ask ourselves how the European Union can use a combination of new instruments to respond to external and internal security threats, and how we can make further progress in this field.
We must ensure that priority is given to matters relating to the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, for example in Iran and North Korea, if we are to succeed in gaining any credibility at all where this issue is concerned.
We must also ensure, however, that greater space is given to this instrument in the neighbourhood policy of the European Union, which is after all a security concept in itself, as it creates links between countries in order to ensure that they never wage war against each other again.
At the same time, we must ensure that we move on from the traditional model of neighbourhood policy that we have pursued in recent years.
The European Unionâs capacity to act also depends on its borders, and so we must ensure that neighbouring countries, which we wish to have on our side and are important to us, and which we wish to help in developing and stabilising democracy, are offered an alternative to full membership, whether this be called a European Economic Area Plus or given another name.
We must find a multilateral starting point of this kind in order to ensure that we can provide countries such as Ukraine with an answer now, and not in 15 or 20Â yearsâ time, when they ask us how they can improve.
We hope that the Council and the Commission will be more imaginative in this respect, and not rely on tried and tested political methods, as they frequently have in the past.
The Commissioner is in fact adopting a new approach by seeking to find such a starting point.
There are two final issues I should like to touch upon.
I am delighted that the vast majority of Members are in favour of upholding the arms embargo against China until the country improves its human rights record and stops adopting laws that legitimise war.
We must reach an agreement on this issue before transatlantic relations are put at risk.
Multilateral approaches, as adopted in our relations with the United States, should be complemented by a partnership that follows clearly defined objectives and is aimed at setting up a transatlantic marketplace by 2015.
I should like to make it quite clear to those Members who tabled amendments that I support the proposals by various groups to call for the European Union to be given a seat in the Security Council, and I say so speaking particularly as a German.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by considering two different scenarios.
When we discussed this issue in committee, MrÂ Ilves asked what would happen if another terrorist attack on the same scale as the Madrid bombings were to take place in an EU Member State, and if, in the aftermath of such an attack, it were to emerge that the security services in another Member State had been aware that preparations were underway for the attack, but had been unable to inform the authorities in the country in question.
In all likelihood, this would trigger a real crisis of legitimacy for the European Union.
I will now move on to my second example.
The European Union has taken command of the NATO-led troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This is the first time that the European Union has had an opportunity to prove that it is capable of conducting security policy in this area, and to gain practical experience in such matters.
I know from talking to my constituents that many people believe that the EU would be delivered from evil, as it were,Â if it kept its involvement in other peopleâs business to a minimum.
This kind of attitude can turn out to be fatally flawed, and the European Union does in fact need a security strategy.
It is for this reason that the vast majority of committee members welcomed the document which was drafted by JavierÂ Solana during his term in office, and which the committee has continued to work on.
We also welcomed the support shown by the governments of the Member States for the document.
There are, however, a number of issues that must be given particular consideration, as they reveal the unique nature of the European Security Strategy.
The first of these is the need to understand security problems and their many and diverse possible causes, which include human rights violations, poverty and disease, in a broad context, and not to reduce the Strategy to its military aspects.
The Security Strategy is primarily a political concept, and as such transcends military considerations.
The second issue is the need for a commitment to international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
The third issue relates to the need to strengthen international order by means of effective multilateral structures and to safeguard citizensâ fundamental rights within the EU, whilst taking all measures necessary to combat terrorist threats.
In view of these factors, we should not be ashamed to say that the European Union does indeed wish to acquire military decision-making structures and capabilities.
The greatest benefit of the Security Strategy is that it enables us to tailor the combination of civilian and military crisis management capabilities to each individual situation.
Opposition to this approach came from two deeply opposed camps within the committee; on the one hand, some members find it impossible to envisage the European Union as anything other than a subsidiary of NATO, whereas on the other hand some members condemn militarisation in the shape of new organisational forms and capacities.
Both of these camps represent polar opposites, yet what they have in common is that they use their arguments to oppose and campaign against the European Constitution.
In spite of this opposition, however, a broad consensus was reached within the committee in favour of the Security Strategy, which involves the establishment of various instruments such as a situation centre, a civilian/military planning cell and the setting up of battle groups or the Defence Agency.
These are not alternatives to NATO, and indeed most EU Member States are also NATO Member States.
Instead, they provide the European Union with new options it has not had in the past.
This is the only way it can become an equal partner, for example of countries on the other side of the Atlantic like the United States.
A great deal remains to be done, however; for example, we still have no coherent plan of how civilian crisis management forces should be organised.
There is a lack of permanent air transport capacity and of permanently available deployable troops, as well as of adequate communications and reconnaissance capacities.
The aim of this report is to ensure that the European Parliament â also in view of what MrÂ Brok said in his introductory speech â can exert an influence on the future development and practical implementation of the European Security Strategy within the framework of dialogue with the Council.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I should like to thank, and also congratulate, Parliament, and especially the two rapporteurs, for the work they have accomplished, and for the ambitious but also realistic approach which they have developed in these two reports.
Somewhere you quote two figures, the 60% and 70% of support which, according to public opinion, is given to the development of a common foreign and security policy.
This is probably one of the areas which receive the highest level of support, according to public opinion.
You are the representatives of the European citizens, and that means that this policy can only be developed together with the citizens, which also means together with your support, in the dialogue, as the rapporteur Mr Kuhne has just said.
The European Council adopted the European Security Strategy on 11 December 2003.
The fifteen months which have passed since then obviously do not allow us to draw up a complete and exhaustive report on its implementation, but they do at least enable us to evaluate the impact which the strategy has already had, and to discuss the path we need to follow in its future application.
The year 2004 was a crucial year for the political development of the Union, whose ambitions and responsibilities in the world have been increasing.
The citizens of the Union, like their international partners, have also been demanding a stronger presence for Europe on the international scene.
The Union has responded to this appeal by trying to pursue a more active, more consistent and more effective foreign policy based, in particular, on the principles of the United Nations Charter.
The European Union is a player on the world stage, and it is based on political, economic and other achievements.
The fact that the âEuropean modelâ that we talk about so much in the context of the European Constitution is highly thought of throughout the world is something that gives us cause for satisfaction, but it should also be, for us Europeans, a strong motive force encouraging us to do more.
The European Security Strategy to some extent sets out the broad guidelines for the day-to-day running of our common foreign and security policy.
It defines the challenges and threats which we have to face, as well as the tools that we need to use to tackle the problems.
Reference has been made to the war on terrorism.
This is certainly one of the crucial problems.
We have put in place a certain number of mechanisms, and more intensive cooperation between Europol and Eurojust.
Therefore the war on terrorism is a good illustration of the fact that the concept of security does not consist solely of a foreign-policy dimension, a military dimension, but that it goes much further than that.
There is also a development dimension, and a dimension of defending and promoting human rights.
There is also, of course, a dimension which is concerned with solving major conflicts, in particular the conflict in the Middle East, not forgetting a presence in the regions which we spoke about earlier, in particular Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the Western Balkans.
Taking into account the principal threats identified in this strategy, in December 2003 the European Council adopted an EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and this constitutes a supplementary measure.
This is also an area in which Europe has shown that it knows how to act, particularly in relation to Iran.
I believe that in doing this we have achieved an important milestone in the quest to find political solutions to questions which are extremely sensitive and at the same time extremely dangerous to international peace.
The European Security Strategy is based on the idea that most problems can only be solved in a multilateral context.
On this point too we agree with the two rapporteurs.
The European Union clearly needs to pursue its objectives in this multilateral context, in partnership with all those involved, in particular with the United Nations.
Consequently, it is in the European Unionâs own interests to see the UN, the multilateral system, strengthened.
We must support the Secretary-Generalâs efforts to modernise the UN system and to make it more effective.
The reform of the United Nations is actually a very important aspect of the European Unionâs security policy and a very important aspect of its foreign policy.
I congratulate Mr Brok on what he has said on this subject, especially in connection with one particular point.
I shall just mention briefly the importance of the transatlantic partnership, since it is only a few weeks ago that we held a debate on that subject here in Parliament.
This partnership has also been relaunched, in particular since the visit of President Bush to Brussels, and we must ensure that this relaunching is followed up.
We have many interests in common â I would go so far as to say an enormous number of interests.
We have an enormous number of opportunities for greater cooperation, but on an equal footing.
We, together with the Americans, can find solutions to major problems, in particular, as has already been mentioned, to one priority problem, namely the conflict in the Middle East.
The European Union is also busy developing its economic, political and cultural cooperation with its traditional principal partners such as the United States and Canada, but also with partners such as Russia and Japan.
I believe that cooperation with Russia, despite the problems, is important to the European Union and to stability and peace in our continent.
Having said that, I should also mention that there are also new players on the world scene, such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa.
There are also regional bodies, such as the African Union, with which we held talks a few days ago with a view, as the Commission has said, to strengthening our policy towards Africa, the objective being to promote peace and development â two things which are closely connected â on that continent, which is particularly close to the European Union
The strategy also serves to further our relationship with other neighbours to the East and South.
We have just held a debate on the Balkans.
The Euro-Mediterranean partnership and European policy on neighbouring regions are of fundamental importance in promoting stability in the countries concerned, but they are also in our own interests, both economic and political.
I remember precisely what was said.
It is not enough to close our eyes in the hope of avoiding contamination by the problems.
The problems of these countries very quickly become our problems, either through uncontrolled, illegal immigration or through terrorism or the threat of terrorism.
The importance of human rights from the security point of view also lies at the heart of solving the conflicts, and this aspect has been particularly emphasised by the latest report by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Without respect for human rights there can be neither development nor peace.
It was in this spirit that the High Representative recently appointed a personal representative for human rights, with the aim of improving the consistency and effectiveness of our policy in this area within the CFSP.
As far as the more military aspect is concerned, the strategy suggests that the European Union needs to be more operational in the various areas where it has to play a role.
We must provide solutions to the conflicts.
We must act, and we must play a more active role in maintaining and restoring peace.
We must ensure better consistency between the civil and the military aspects.
We must, first of all, have an approach which is based on the prevention of conflicts.
In this context, it is important that 7 000 European soldiers are currently deployed, under the flag of the European Union, with the task of safeguarding peace and encouraging the pursuit of reforms and of reconciliation.
We have discussed, in particular, the subject of the Balkans, but the European Union has also accepted responsibility for major operations elsewhere, for example in the Southern Caucasus, in Africa and in Afghanistan.
Significant progress has been made in the area of military capacities.
The first of the thirteen tactical units has been created as part of the European Rapid Reaction Force.
The European Union has also set up the European Defence Agency in order to rationalise the costs linked to defence purchases and in order to increase the quality and the quantity of the military capacities at the disposal of European States.
Cooperation between civilian and military circles has been raised to a higher operational level, in particular by the creation of a civil-military cell.
All these measures should enable the Union to increase its crisis-management capacities so as to be able to deal successfully with the complex security crises of the 21st century.
Cooperation with NATO has been highlighted in particular.
I believe that we need to think about developing the âBerlin plusâ provisions in a spirit of partnership rather than a spirit of submission.
I think that, in this respect too, the role of the European Union is very important.
Thus the European foreign and security policy has strengthened its consistency and its operational capacities, but we cannot afford to relax our efforts.
We need institutional back-up, clear commitments, particularly as regards solidarity in the face of potential threats, and greater visibility of the European Union on the international scene.
In this respect I think that the future Constitution, once again, will lead to considerable progress in the development of the CFSP and of our policy on external security.
The creation of an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs is a major innovation which will allow greater coherence in the Unionâs external relations.
The fact that the Minister in question will chair the External Relations Council will provide the coherence which we are all so anxious to ensure, and it will also give us greater visibility and at the same time better continuity.
Another important aspect which I should just like to mention â and I know it is something close to the heart of Mr Brok among others â is the creation of the European External Action Service, the practical details of which are still under discussion.
The Luxembourg Presidency is paying close attention to the progress achieved in setting up this European External Action Service, and to the views of the European Parliament on this subject.
We do not want the creation of this service to dismantle surreptitiously certain Community mechanisms by giving preference to intergovernmental mechanisms.
This service was designed to signal major progress in the conduct and implementation of the Unionâs foreign policy, in particular in the form of greater effectiveness, greater coherence, an increased presence of the European Union, and the better use of all the resources available.
We want the institutional rules and respective powers to be observed.
The national diplomatic services must become more widely involved.
We must make them, as it were, more European, but without producing a sort of renationalisation or intergovernmentalisation of what currently operates in accordance with Community rules.
That is the broad outline of what we are defending in creating this service.
I should like to say a final word about the information aspect.
I believe that the current Presidency, like previous presidencies, wants to have an exchange of views with the European Parliament about the major options and important dates in relation to foreign policy.
We want to have this dialogue, and it is important, as I said at the beginning of this speech.
On behalf of this Presidency, I can give an undertaking that efforts will continue in this direction and that there will be the contacts and the meetings which you want to see happen in order to achieve precisely this kind of coherent common foreign and security policy, which will have the real support of all the people involved and all the institutions of the Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members and rapporteurs, let me start by thanking you most warmly for your weighty and even-handed reports, most of which leave little to be desired where clarity is concerned.
I would like to pick up three specific things that enhance Europeâs global role.
One of them is effective multilateralism.
I see this as being beyond doubt the right response to our being ever more closely connected internationally.
This year, 2005, will be decisive in terms of reform and the reinforcement of multilateralism, of international law, and, in particular, of the United Nations.
The UN Summit in September will take the latest report by its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, as a basis for essential decision-making in this area.
I believe it to be essential that Europe should make a contribution to this debate on reform.
This is an area in which it has a leadership role, one that it must actually play.
It is for that reason that the Commission is currently engaged in producing detailed proposals on the issues to which I have referred.
As you will be aware, I am currently pressing for the EU to have a seat on the UN Security Council.
The details of how this will work out are a matter for discussion, but what matters is that the EU should, in important international bodies, carry the weight that is rightly its due.
As Mr Schmit has just said, multilateralism can be effective only if it is founded upon a strong transatlantic partnership.
Effective solutions to the worldâs problems can be found only if the United States of America and Europe are really singing from the same hymn sheet.
President Bushâs visit to Brussels clearly showed that the United States of America is very much aware of the ever-expanding and ever more important role of the EU.
It is with this ever-broader agenda that our common structures must be able to cope, while at the same time remaining flexible.
The Commission is currently examining whether, and if so to what extent, our institutions need to amend the New Transatlantic Agenda.
What emerges from our deliberations will then form a contribution to the EU-US Summit in June.
I believe â as do others, both individuals and groups, in this House â that closer relations between it and the US Congress are essential in this regard.
The reports rightly reflect the fact that Europeâs foreign policy is already underpinned by a comprehensive concept of security.
I believe that guaranteeing Europeâs security is not just about defence policy or military operations; today, above all, it has to do with conflict prevention, with civilian crisis management and common policies on trade, the economy, energy, justice, health and the environment.
The European Security Strategy already takes account of these complex potential threats.
The Commission is making an important contribution, not least to its implementation, in our day-to-day close relations with third countries and, most recently, also through various communications, not only on such issues as anti-terrorism and improved civil protection, but also in terms of the reform of development policy, concerning which we, in the Commission, put out important communications yesterday.
