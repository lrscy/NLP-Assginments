Other women are at risk of the same sentence of death by stoning, especially Mrs Lawal in the state of Katsina.
The application of Sharia law affects women in particular, especially poorer women.
These arbitrary judicial proceedings and the sentences passed on these women are contrary to the fundamental rights recognised under the international conventions ratified by Nigeria.
We must denounce this selective judicial system which considers adultery a crime, which allows the men to walk free while the women are condemned, even if they are the victims of rape.
Parliament must insist that the Nigerian Government prohibit any death sentence from being executed and institute proceedings before the constitutional court on the application of Sharia law.
The Nigerian Government must abide by the international conventions on human rights which it has signed, as tangible proof of its intention to institute a process of democratisation and the rule of law, guarantee economic and social dialogue and foster dialogue between communities.
We call on the Council, the Commission and the co-presidents of the ACP to use every political and commercial means at their disposal to ensure that the Nigerian Government applies and abides by these conventions and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights.
Mr President, when democratic procedures were restored in Nigeria and the country's constitution was adopted in 1999, how could we have imagined the events which took place two or three years later? The ethnic, religious and political infighting which has cost thousands of people their lives, and the restoration of Islamic or Sharia law in the 12 states of the country in which there is a Muslim majority.
World public opinion was shocked recently by the sentences of death by stoning passed on women accused of adultery while, under this extremely fair law, the men of course get off scot-free.
The international outcry and the action taken by the European Parliament, civil society and the media may have saved their lives at the eleventh hour, but the issue of violations of women's rights and blatant discrimination on the basis of sex remains.
And the case of Amina Lawal, sentenced by the Islamic court in Bakori, is still pending.
But the Islamic courts and the interpretation of Sharia law apart, there are other examples of the unequal, unfair and inhumane treatment of women, such as sexual mutilation - around 60% of women in Nigeria are estimated to have suffered this gruesome practice - or the recognised right of men to mistreat women with impunity or the organised trafficking in and sexual exploitation of women.
We need to send a very strong message on all these points to the federal government of Nigeria from this House today, calling on it to ensure that the country's courts operate in accordance with international law on human rights and the Charter of Human Rights, which has even been included in Nigeria's constitution.
Above all, we must make clear not just to the Nigerian government, but anywhere else where Sharia law applies, that the best defence against intolerance is to strengthen the secular aspects of the state and legitimate democratic order.
We also need to send out a message that no religious or other tradition or practice can take precedence over respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law.
At the same time, we call on the European Commission, in the run up to the elections in Nigeria in 2003, to provide any technical assistance Nigeria may need in order to strengthen its legal and democratic structures and for lawyers and the police to be educated within the framework of the Cotonou agreement and the resolutions passed by the Joint ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Mr President, Nigeria has ratified a number of international conventions on human rights, in particular the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.
Despite this, however, here we are once again discussing the violation of women's rights, pointing out that the death penalty still exists in Nigeria, declaring that current practice and the countless regulations contained in the new codes of criminal procedure of the Sharia continue to further the severe violation of human rights, even to the point of enforcing the death penalty.
We, together with many men and women of democratic countries, have roused ourselves to action, and that is what saved the lives of Safiya and of Hafsatu, but, despite this victory, the Islamic court in Bakori has condemned another woman, Mrs Amina Lawal, to being stoned to death.
Now, I do not feel we can continue - although we must do so - to discuss these massacres.
We must demand that Nigeria, which is preparing for democratic elections and must therefore be supported by the European Union, not merely - as has been mentioned in the context of the Cotonou Agreement - consolidate pluralist democracy and social and economic justice, but that it put an end to these violations too.
I feel that we can no longer be content with just discussing the ongoing violations and waiting for something to happen.
We must be more resolute and take action using all the tools available to us.
Mr President, the European Union, as we all know, is unwavering in its strict opposition to the death penalty. In countries where the death penalty still exists we call for recourse to this practice to be gradually eliminated and insist that it be applied in accordance with minimum standards.
We are all in the habit of lobbying for moratoria.
We are all particularly worried, both in the Union and the Commission, by the cruelty of the punishments and executions practised in application of Sharia law in a number of countries.
A hanging in January of this year put an end to a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in Nigeria.
We were involved in Union representations to the Nigerian authorities on this issue in February.
We also intervened on several fronts in the case of Safiya Hussaini, especially when President Prodi launched a direct appeal to President Obasanjo.
We are currently closely monitoring the case of Amina Lawal, mentioned by Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Ghilardotti, which has now gone to appeal.
Now with regard to the impact of all this on relations between the European Union and Nigeria, the framework for which is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement.
One of the fundamental elements of this agreement is respect for human rights and, in this context, equality between men and women is one aspect of the same issue.
We welcome the fact that the Nigerian minister of justice has officially declared that the federal states must revise their criminal legislation in order to exclude punishments which fly in the face of the civil rights guaranteed under the Nigerian constitution.
The federal government would also appear to be worried by the incompatibility between the penal application of Sharia law and the international conventions signed by Nigeria.
We have funded a Nigerian study into Sharia law which indicates that Sharia law is poorly drafted and does in fact contradict other federal laws.
It is also applied in a somewhat incoherent manner because judges are inadequately trained.
We feel that the solution for the time being is still to be found in dialogue, especially on Nigeria's compliance with its undertakings within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement.
As you and we both know, this agreement makes provision for procedures which can be applied if human rights are not respected.
This is the point we need to evaluate together so that we can exert the necessary pressure but avoid imposing sanctions on all the federal states of Nigeria indiscriminately or compromising the creation of an environment conducive to change because it is this change which will, in fact, be the outcome of our collective pressure and efforts.
Mr President, the European Parliament plays an undeniable leading role in the peace process in Central America.
It is now time to talk about the recent situation in Guatemala, six years after the conclusion of the peace agreements, in 1996.
The time has come for Parliament to add its voice to those of other human rights defenders, trade unionists and religious leaders working with the indigenous communities to ensure that these peace programmes move forwards and do not stagnate.
It is vital that the Guatemalan government finalises the legislative reforms arising from the peace agreements, that the judicial authority consolidates its independence and its capacity to pursue and to prosecute those responsible for the wars and the breaches against human rights that have taken place before and after the peace agreements were concluded.
For this reason, the European Parliament sends a message of support to the Guatemalan people and to their Government, to encourage them to continue in their struggle, to guarantee respect for human rights, the Rule of Law and the independence of the judiciary.
It is vital that these agreements, which have been so successful not only in Guatemala but also in other countries in Central America, reach a satisfactory conclusion.
This means that governments must commit themselves to continue pursuing and punishing criminals, which can only be done by respecting and strengthening the independence of the judiciary.
This is this essence of the message of support that we want to send from Parliament to the Guatemalan people, to those who are fighting for their freedom and to their political authorities.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we can see that human rights are still a current issue; today, we are talking about human rights in a Central American country close to our hearts, at a time, furthermore, when the International Criminal Court is finally being established.
A few days ago I read an article, written by a Central American liberal, that I believe is relevant today. He said that Central America is an area of natural disasters, situated on a fault line, that every now and then knocks down cities and buries entire populations.
It seems, however, that the region is also under threat from another kind of fault, one of moral order, where impunity appears to protect certain heartless individuals.
A 2001 report by Transparency International, a German NGO that monitors and condemns government corruption worldwide, states that Guatemala is in a situation in which the democratic system is discredited to the point where its institutions are in danger.
We in this House today condemn human rights violations in Guatemala, which are on the increase and, as Mr PomÃ©s has just pointed out, affect workers, journalists and politicians, amongst others. We regret the abuses committed by certain economic agents, who see nothing wrong in using arms trafficking, drugs trafficking, money laundering and even kidnapping to increase their wealth.
We in this House would ask the Guatemalan government to monitor and sanction clandestine groups, to guarantee citizens' safety and to allow justice to be done, by investigating crimes that have been committed for some time now.
Impunity will only be brought to an end when the judiciary is independent and free, when international pressure is increased and when punishment is universal so that crimes do not go unpunished. In this way, democracy will also be strengthened.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my Group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I support all those members who have previously spoken to condemn human rights violations in Guatemala; to request that the peace and reconciliation agreements be respected; to request that the crimes and atrocities committed during the dictatorship should be brought before the Courts and to condemn the atrocities that are still being committed, especially by so-called 'clandestine' groups, who murder, torture, and violate human rights.
However, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a very specific condemnation with regard to an issue that appears very peculiar to many Latin American countries, such as Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and other countries that are still living under a colonial regime.
There is a white Creole minority that continues to dominate and marginalise millions of indigenous people who, in spite of being the majority, are completely ignored by the State.
These States are not democratic and, in order to maintain the traditional privileges of ownership, they dominate and marginalise the indigenous minorities, and create dictatorial regimes that torture and murder if these minorities should dare to rebel.
In this way, this minority controls the judiciary, ownership, the police and the army, and I believe that, in these Latin American countries, until there is genuine democracy - as has happened in South Africa - until the indigenous minorities have power and until they are truly able to create their own State for themselves, there will be no solution to this problem of human rights violations in these countries.
On many occasions I compare countries that are very close to our own - the Spanish states in particular - with African countries: these are very often in a state of poverty and have dictatorial regimes, but one day they will become democratic regimes governed by the previously marginalised majority.
In Latin America the problem is much worse and we have to be aware of this in order for Europe to be able to help in the construction of truly democratic regimes, governed by the majority.
Commissioner, I must confess that I have found this week quite tiring, because of all these evenings we have spent discussing the lack of respect for human rights.
I am not talking about being tired of having to deal with this subject, but about being tired at the lack of results, despite constant pressure from this Parliament.
Many hopes were raised when the Guatemala and El Salvador agreements were signed in 1996.
We have been talking about the need for dialogue in Colombia.
The problem, and the issue that we must deal with here in Parliament today, is that these agreements have not been honoured, and it is this factor that is frustrating the hopes of the majority of the population in places such as Guatemala, where, as Mr Nogueira rightly stated - a large proportion of the population is indigenous.
I believe that the best way of remembering Monsignor Gerardi, the author and person responsible for this extraordinary document of historical clarification, which should today be the guide for the majority of Guatemalan judges talking about crimes committed during the civil war, is to demand that agreements be honoured, for there to be true agrarian reform, which has not taken place to date, for there to be respect for the large majority of the Guatemalan people - a respect that currently does not exist, because these people continue to live in abject poverty - for there to be an end to the increasing violence against the people and their representatives, defenders of human rights, farm-workers' representatives, trade unionists, religious leaders and people involved with the rights of the majority of the population.
Unfortunately, until now the majority of human rights have not been respected in Guatemala.
For this reason, I believe that what we should be calling for is for the European Union, with all of its available resources, to use its influence so that these agreements, to which it contributed so much, are honoured.
Mr President, we share the concerns of the members who have tabled this resolution on serious setbacks in Guatemala in basic areas such as protection for human rights, the administration of justice and proper management of public affairs.
We, like you, are most concerned at the increase in cases of intimidation in Guatemala, not just against human rights protesters but also against representatives of civil society, political leaders and members of non-governmental organisations and the clergy.
Consequently, the Commission's main priorities as regards relations with Guatemala are as follows: first, to support the application of the 1996 peace agreements and then to encourage the modernisation of the state and set the management of public affairs on a firmer footing.
These priorities are set against a background of wholesale implementation of the recommendations set out in the Commission report on historic clarification which Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez referred to and which is of crucial importance.
In this respect - and in line with the resolution on human rights in Guatemala which you adopted last June - the Commission has decided to take additional measures.
First, during the course of political dialogue, the Commission and the Member States of the Union regularly and tirelessly remind the Guatemalan authorities and local public institutions of the importance of discouraging any form of violence and of systematically examining any obstacles to respect for human rights and the rule of law.
Then, in a joint declaration published at the end of the meeting of an advisory group on Guatemala held in Washington in February, the Commission and the Member States insisted on the need for much more consistent progress in the peace process than has been seen recently.
We are calling - and we shall continue to call - on the government of Guatemala to take regular, consistent measures to follow up the conclusions and commitments made in the advisory group.
That is the first measure.
The second measure is to exert pressure on the government of Guatemala, within the framework of our cooperation, to comply with the 1996 peace agreements; as you know, we are funding specific initiatives in this area, especially measures to reinforce and modernise the national constabulary.
The purpose of this programme is to encourage the Guatemalan authorities to take the measures needed to prevent any undermining of the rule of law and step up efforts to make the country much more democratic and fair.
This initiative will be relayed over coming months in a new programme of cooperation for the benefit of the judicial system in Guatemala.
Between 2002 and 2006, which is the time scale for the Union's cooperation strategy with Guatemala, we intend to step up action on human rights and the fight against intimidation and impunity.
Guatemala is, almost by chance, one of the main beneficiaries of the European initiative on democracy and human rights for the period from 2002 to 2004, when we shall be concentrating on proper management of public affairs, the rights of the indigenous populations, the death penalty and the fight against impunity, the very points which the parliamentarians themselves identified a while back.
Mr President, the situation around the entrance to the Channel Tunnel has been chaotic for months.
Since last November, rail-freight services at FrÃ©thun, near Calais, have been severely disrupted by the illegal activities of migrants.
I have already raised this matter on two occasions on the floor of this House, on 4 February and 11 March, and our urgency resolution reflects the desperate seriousness of the continuing crisis.
On 19 March, the French government replied to initial queries from the European Commission, stating that immediate steps had been taken to carry out new security work at FrÃ©thun and to provide 24-hour police coverage.
However, on 27 March, along with some 150 parliamentarians, rail-freight operators, officials, police, media and others, but with the noticeable absence of any British or French government ministers, I visited the rail-freight terminal at FrÃ©thun.
We were amazed to see illegal migrants clambering all over trains in broad daylight before our very eyes.
The situation was clearly out of hand and it has got no better, in spite of undertakings by SNCF to achieve a normal service from 2 April.
Only this last Tuesday, some 100 migrants broke out of a freight train at Dollands Moor in Folkestone.
This train had apparently waited virtually unguarded at Calais for 24 hours.
This situation is unacceptable.
Besides the human tragedy in the situation, I am concerned that British businesses and some 8 000 jobs are directly at risk, as a result of the state of affairs, including in my own area of the East of England.
There are also very serious environmental and other consequences.
It makes a mockery of the idea of the free movement of goods across the European Union.
Given the lack of action by the British and French governments on Tuesday, I took a deputation to meet the European Commission: Lord Berkeley, Chairman of the Rail Freight Group and Mr Alan Roberts, a constituent of mine from Hertfordshire, whose family rail-freight organising business has been very hard hit by the crisis at FrÃ©thun, went with me to see Commissioner Bolkestein.
He was very sympathetic and expressed frustration at the lack of government action.
I now implore the Commission to take the necessary further action, including legal action against the French government, as a matter of urgency.
Businesses require urgent financial assistance in order to be able to continue trading, as well as compensation in the longer term for the losses that they have sustained because of the lack of effective action by the French and the British authorities.
Mr President, the desperate situation at FrÃ©thun, which I have also visited, demands a response on two fronts.
The rail-freight operators and dependent businesses want a response which concentrates on the immediate and long-standing need for sufficient security to keep the freight moving.
They are perfectly justified.
Businesses should not be the fall-guys of government failure to cope with asylum-seekers.
Businesses need fences at FrÃ©thun, but that is also crucial to stop migrants dying.
That is the responsibility of the SNCF and French government.
I am shocked that the Socialist Group refused to put that in the motion.
I call on them, especially British Labour MEPs, to back Amendment No 2 on this point.
Amendment No 6 by the Socialist Group is hopelessly weak, letting governments off the hook.
Businesses adversely affected also need finance and they need immediate support and compensation from the two governments.
I will also be shocked if Labour MEPs vote against that.
Amendment No 1 is an ELDR Group amendment, which calls for the strengthening of the current inadequate intervention powers of the Commission to clear obstructions to the free movement of goods.
I am told the Conservatives are reluctant to support this, but I hope it is not true.
The second response required in the Calais area is to address the asylum question in a humane and practical way.
My group cannot support Amendment No 5 by the Socialist Group because it attributes the situation at FrÃ©thun purely to pressure people feel to migrate from their home countries.
Obviously that is the broad context, which is why the resolution in a paragraph I drafted says the long-term solution must be found in a concerted, European asylum policy.
There is also stress on the need for a sensitive humanitarian approach.
In the immediate future, the British and French governments must reach a practical agreement to process asylum claims on-site at the Sangatte centre, not close it - that would be counterproductive.
But the Socialist Group amendment, probably deliberately, ignores the responsibility of the SNCF and the government to deal with the asylum pressures.
This is unacceptable.
The rail-freight operators are on the brink of collapse.
Eight thousand workers could be out of a job.
I urge support for the motion and for Amendments Nos 1 to 4.
Mr President, I am not speaking as one of the authors of the motion, because the Group of the Greens does not support this compromise proposal.
What exactly are we talking about here?
Are we talking about Eurotunnel's loss of earnings and the disruption to traffic under the Channel or are we talking about what should be the subject of this afternoon's debate, human rights and, in this particular instance, the rights and the human tragedy of the Sangatte refugees?
The refugees in Sangatte are not illegal immigrants.
They are living in a centre opened by the French government, managed by the Red Cross and subsidised by the French state.
The refugees are Kosovars, Kurds and, nowadays, mainly Afghans.
All the people who feature in today's headlines are flooding into Sangatte.
If we want to talk about human rights, then let us do so and stop talking about money and the safety of traffic under the Channel.
There is something obscene about confusing the two.
This centre was opened thanks to important work by the associations who wanted to respond to the emergency, and to close it would be a humanitarian catastrophe.
We know what Calais and Sangatte are like without the centre.
We have seen the refugees risking their lives to get to Great Britain, wandering the streets of Calais with their children in the pouring rain, with the associations doing their best to get food to them every day.
Is that really the sort of situation we want to revert to in a debate on human rights?
Frankly, this debate has got off to a very poor start, which is why the Greens do not support this motion and call on their fellow members to do likewise, because there is something improper about it.
The Group of the Greens, having taken the view that the French Government was demonstrating a measure of bad faith regarding the right of these people to demand asylum in France, supported the publication of a document, in collaboration with the associations, which is in huge demand among the refugees in Sangatte.
What does this document say?
It simply tells the refugees how to demand asylum in France and what rights asylum seekers have in France.
This is the road we should be going down, obviously in the long term, with our sights set on a European refugee statute, in order to deal with this situation.
Mr President, today we face real problems as a result of the massive influx of families of refugees arriving with toddlers and babies in tow to seek asylum.
This situation is caused by the distress of thousands of refugees and displaced persons, who have had to leave countries in which they are politically, economically or socially oppressed and in which wars and conflicts are raging, often against their will and sometimes at the cost of their life.
We need proper refugee centres, otherwise it is all down to the local authorities and they can no longer cope.
They do not have the human resources, infrastructure or funds needed to respond to this distress.
So what we have to do is find a satisfactory long-term response to these problems and adopt a humane approach in terms of asylum and immigration policy.
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these problems.
We cannot continue to bury our head in the sand.
That way we are heading for a catastrophe.
If serious problems persist at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel despite the joint efforts of the French and British governments to stop refugees trying to cross illegally, it is because we have no joint asylum policy at European level.
Every country in the European Union is affected because the difficulties we face stem from the fact that we have no harmonised asylum procedures in Europe.
We therefore need to adopt a package of measures to implement a European asylum policy post haste.
We need to all join forces and examine the problems facing us.
The European Union needs to demonstrate its determination to take fast decisions on various instruments, on minimum standards in refugee centres and on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status in the spirit, lest we forget, of the Tampere European Council.
Mr President, my constituents in south-east England will be delighted that this House has found the time to discuss the repeated closures of the Channel Tunnel.
Very few people outside my region appreciate the seriousness of the situation.
The regular stoppage of freight transport is now reaching crisis proportions.
Businesses are unable to ship their produce, the transport infrastructure of the southern English counties is clogged, the single market is violated as the circulation of goods is impeded, the police forces of Kent and Sussex are over-stretched and the influx of illegal migrants is placing a serious burden on local authorities and their ratepayers.
It is all very well to demand greater security at the Calais-FrÃ©thun freight terminal but this is to address the symptoms of the problem, not the cause.
If we are serious about bringing the situation under control, we must stand back and ask the question: what is making tens of thousands of people so desperate to get out of France?
France after all is not a country that persecutes its citizens.
On the contrary, it is one of the oldest and freest democracies in the world.
In short, it is hardly a country from which we would reasonably expect people to claim political asylum and yet, night after night, hundreds of people are risking their lives in order to enter Britain through the Channel Tunnel.
The British Government must take primary responsibility for this state of affairs.
The chief difference between Britain and France in this field is that when an asylum claim in the United Kingdom is refused, deportation almost never follows.
Consequently, and quite understandably, illegal migrants are determined to reach the one EU State from which they know they will almost certainly not be repatriated.
As long as this state of affairs continues, there will be a limitless supply of young people in the Sangatte camp seeking by any means to cross the Channel.
This is an international problem, but it has an essentially domestic solution.
The British Government must amend its approach to asylum.
It must cease to entertain asylum claims when the last point of embarkation is a manifestly safe State, such as France.
Doing so will reduce the pressure, not only on the Channel Tunnel, but by extension on France's eastern borders as fewer migrants seek to make the journey.
Without urgent action from the British Government, the strain on the south-east can only become heavier.
Mr President, I am speaking in a debate on human rights - although you would have found that difficult to believe if you had been listening closely to the compassionate words of Mr Hannan.
It is a human rights issue that we are discussing here.
It is not an easy one and nobody should suggest it is.
It has not just become urgent because of the economic effect on business or on the freight industry, for which I have great sympathy.
It is a very serious and distressing situation which does nobody any great credit.
It has concerned, as others have said, large numbers of people and governments - both in France, the UK and other countries - and local authorities.
It is one that my committee in Parliament has also discussed on more than one occasion.
People could go back and search for different reasons why there are numbers of people there.
I reject the very simplistic and inhumane proposals from Mr Hannan.
It is a situation that has worsened over recent years and the problem is much more extensive than he implied.
But just as Parliament must protect business and the freight industry, so Europe - but not exclusively the United Kingdom or France - has a duty to care for and protect those seeking refuge.
These are desperate people.
Some have fled in fear of their lives, and we should be able to offer them sanctuary and give them every opportunity to put their claim for asylum.
This is what the Dublin Convention, which we sought to review earlier this week in the Marinho report, is all about.
We need a Dublin Convention that enables asylum-seekers to feel safe and secure, to put their claim for asylum in the first EU country which they reach.
Earlier in the week the other side of the House tabled amendments suggesting that they should be informed of their rights in any language, not necessarily a language that they understand.
That is not the way, and it explains why sometimes people move to another country.
It is not a question of who supports which amendment and who does not.
I personally have no problem with Amendment No 2, which I was questioned about earlier.
We have to get the system working for the sake of all of the people who are moving around Europe.
We have to make it safe and working for the industries.
We need to work towards a common European asylum system.
Without that, Europe will not function and we will be coming back to these issues over and over again.
We need to have a common European asylum system throughout the Member States that is understood and that works.
I and my colleagues on this side of House and some others will be working consistently for that in the months ahead.
Mr President, two months ago we held a debate in this Chamber on obstacles to traffic in the Channel Tunnel caused by the presence of numerous refugees on the French side trying to cross to Great Britain, apparently in order to seek asylum there.
But, as this first debate was lacking, to say the least, our Conference of Presidents decided, in its wisdom, to arrange a second debate today on the same subject.
Unfortunately, to judge by the motion which is to be put to the vote, this debate will be just as unsatisfactory as the first.
Without repeating everything I said on the subject two months ago, especially on the vanity of a harmonised asylum policy supposed to resolve all these problems, I shall merely point out that the simple truth has yet to be stated anywhere.
At present, the life of the French population in the region is being ruined, economic activity is being disrupted at the expense of our British neighbours, the railway companies are collapsing under the weight of unwarranted security costs and all because of total negligence on the part of the French Government, which lets illegal immigrants congregate in public, 90% of whom have no right to stay and should be sent home.
If we fail to react to this new form of immigration, the situation will soon get out of hand and become uncontrollable.
To top it all, on Tuesday the House adopted a text which helps enormously in resolving the problem.
I refer to the Council regulation establishing the criteria for determining the Member States responsible for examining asylum applications, which was the subject of the Marinho report.
The state responsible is of course the state of initial entry.
And Article 12, which we adopted, stipulates and I quote, that the 'Member State which has knowingly tolerated the unlawful presence on its territory of a third-country national for more than two months shall be responsible for examining the asylum application'.
So in this case, it is not Great Britain, it is in fact France which is entirely responsible and the least we can do is to say so clearly in our resolution.
Mr President, the Commission is obviously aware that repeated incursions by illegal immigrants into the transport installations between Calais in France and the United Kingdom are creating problems for security, the proper functioning of the rail transport network and freight traffic.
This phenomenon, and I think the various interventions illustrated this, is the result of a combination of fairly complex factors and, in my eyes at least, demonstrates yet again that the Union needs a common immigration and asylum policy now more than ever.
I agree with Mrs Ludford and Mrs Roure here.
This being the case, the Commission has, for its part, already taken the relevant initiatives by submitting, to the Council and Parliament, all the proposals needed in order to ensure some sort of equal treatment between the Member States on what are obviously difficult issues.
As far as political asylum is concerned, the aim of the Commission proposals is to create a fair, efficient and fast European asylum system.
We proposed a Council directive on asylum procedures in September 2000.
As you know, several Member States are opposed to binding deadlines for completing procedures.
So we shall be submitting a revised proposal within the next few weeks, as instructed by the Laeken European Council.
Parliament is due to vote within the next fortnight on a proposal for a directive submitted by the Commission a year ago in order to harmonise the conditions under which asylum seekers are kept.
The Council may reach a political agreement on this Spanish Presidency priority within the next few weeks.
Of course, it would also help if Parliament took a stand.
Another proposal for a directive adopted last September is designed to harmonise the definition of refugees and people in need of international protection and should be negotiated between now and 2003.
The main purpose of all these proposals is to reduce what we might call pressure differentials between the Member States which motivate what it the bureaucrats have been agreed to call secondary movements due to de facto and de jure differences in asylum law.
These initiatives all aim to guarantee that everyone who needs it has access to protection - and that appears to apply to a great many people in this case - in accordance with all the terms of the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.
Finally, the Commission has also proposed a regulation on responsibility for examining asylum applications which includes, as Mr Berthu has just reminded us, a clause stating that a Member State which has knowingly tolerated the unlawful presence on its territory of a third-country national for more than two months is responsible for examining their asylum application.
Negotiations on this subject are still under way, even though Parliament has also worked on them, and should be concluded during the Danish Presidency.
So we are still drafting this text, Mr Berthu.
The Commission subscribes fully to the objective of developing a global approach to the management of migratory phenomena, including their external dimension.
This is one of the objectives of the common asylum and immigration policy laid down by the Tampere European Council.
We shall be discussing the matter in general and the fight against illegal immigration in particular in Luxembourg next Monday and shall be launching an in-depth debate on the connection between development and immigration.
As far as the fight against illegal immigration is concerned, the Council adopted an action plan on 28 February, broadly based on our proposal and highlighting the importance of cooperation with countries of origin and transit.
The fight against trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration gangs are obviously one priority and should be backed up by assistance for victims willing to help prosecute traffickers.
And we intend to launch a very broad consultation procedure on this aspect of a global immigration policy very soon on the basis of the Green Paper on the policy to repatriate illegal residents which the Commission adopted yesterday.
Finally, and this testifies to the complexity of the matter, we are preparing a communication on guidelines on the integrated management of external borders.
As for the specific responsibility of hauliers, this is regulated by the Schengen Agreement and defined in a directive designed to harmonise the sanctions which apply here.
Nonetheless, we are aware of the fact that there is more to the problem than that and we have taken various initiatives to sit down and discuss the matter with the industry, administrations and humanitarian organisations.
Finally, as regards the specific situation at the SNCF FrÃ©thun terminal, we have made representations to the French authorities under Community legislation, asking them to take any measures needed to guarantee the free movement of rail freight.
The French authorities have told us that work to secure the FrÃ©thun site has almost been completed and that work to extend the enclosure, install video cameras and various other devices is being completed.
They have promised to complete the programme of work in time for traffic to get back to normal, pre-October 2001 conditions by June 2002.
We have also been assured that security staff numbers have been increased on the SNCF site.
At the Transport Council on 26 March, the Commission, basically following a number of parliamentary interventions, put this item on the Council's agenda so that the two ministers in question could state their opinion, and that is a euphemism I do not use lightly.
On this occasion, the two delegations, the French and the British, intimated that they had agreed on the measures to be taken to ensure that traffic returns to normal under normal safety conditions.
Armed with this agreement, the Commission now considers that it is up to them, given that the Commission has performed its duty of vigilance, to take any measures needed to guarantee the free movement of goods.
You will notice that I refrained from addressing this aspect of the question, important as it is, before I had addressed aspects of asylum and immigration policy, which are of course the core points here.
Mr President, a society that calls itself civilised, such as European society, which prides itself on its defence of human rights, cannot remain impassive when faced with the situation of many millions of children worldwide who are denied the rights we claim we want to defend; children condemned to death by AIDS or malnutrition, or through a lack of medical care, or who are destined to live in absolutely wretched conditions.
It is true that the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Action Plan approved at the 1990 World Summit attempt to guarantee that children are able to exercise their fundamental rights, but unfortunately, there has been no improvement at all in the situation, and children continue to be the main victims of poverty and underdevelopment, amongst other things.
The statistics speak for themselves, and we should not forget that behind each of these figures hides the face of a child, whose eyes are pleading for our help.
For this reason, the special session of the UN General Assembly on Children, which is about to take place, should result in a firm commitment to transform the obligations arising from the Convention on the Rights of the Child into real action, establishing control mechanisms to supervise the extent to which these obligations are complied with, especially with regard to the fight against abuse, exploitation and violence to which children are subjected and to guarantee children the right to education.
But also, and above all, the Assembly should lead to a commitment to adopt more coherent and more generous development cooperation policies and policies to combat poverty, in order to guarantee every child's fundamental right to decent living conditions.
And, since the family is the fundamental unit of society and bears the main responsibility for protecting and raising children and the monitoring of their development, it is crucial that we also promote family assistance policies that contribute to the creation of the human environment that is essential to a child's development and to his or her being able, in the future, to become a useful member of the community to which he or she belongs.
Parliament must give a clear mandate to the European Union in this direction.
Therefore, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would ask this House to support the joint resolution we are debating and the amendments we have tabled and which were already part of the text that this Parliament approved in July 2001 for this very sitting of the United Nations, which should have taken place in September; because, with this vote, we will make the cause of children our own, the cause of the European Parliament and the cause of the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to emphasise the child's and children's need for community.
It is family and relatives who, in the most basic way, can give children the home, and the childhood and adolescence, which they naturally require.
I therefore wish also to emphasise how important it is for the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats to be adopted in the European Parliament.
With reference to a resolution from 5 July 2001, we would emphasise that children are the first victims of the breakdown of family life.
We would also point to UNICEF's splendid draft final document emphasising that the family is the basic unit of society and bears the main responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children.
We also want to underline what we said in the European Parliament last year, namely that a world fit for children must also be a world fit for the family.
The breakdown of the family and of family life are among the greatest and most serious challenges and threats faced by Europe.
In my own country, Sweden, a leader of the country's third largest political party openly pronounced the words, 'Death to the family' to the Swedish general public.
The European Parliament has a quite different view and instead emphasises the family as the basic unit for providing love and care to the next generation.
As we did in 2001, we can highlight these values.
It is a message to the world that even so-called modern Europe still realises that the family is the basic unit in which love is given to the next generation.
More than ever, we need the family and the appreciation of its importance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, children are worth their weight in gold.
This is an expression mostly used by parents and grandparents, but we should henceforth also use this expression when we discuss the policy.
Just as two-way communication has been established between parents and children, such communication must also be established between children and the policy in all areas.
In this connection, particular attention should be paid to the fact that children have changed a great deal over the past few years. This is due to the fact that families no longer necessarily live together and the division of roles is no longer self-evident.
The traditional family is no longer the norm.
Children want to belong 100%, the age aspect is no longer an issue.
It is a message which policy-makers must take to heart.
Children must be treated as fully-fledged partners in the decision-making process.
It is up to the policy to provide adequate procedures and consultative bodies in this respect.
It would be of particular importance if the European Parliament were to take an initiative to offer children from the Member States, and also from third countries, a forum in the buildings of the European Parliament.
Mr President, the special session of the UN General Assembly on Children will be an excellent opportunity to take stock of the progress made since 1989, when the declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child was made, and should bring the states face to face with their responsibilities in terms of abiding by their undertakings.
In this sense, I am delighted that the resolution proposes creating mechanisms designed to control governments' compliance with these undertakings in the future.
I hope that this sitting will not be just another meeting.
Children's rights are flouted every day throughout the world, with access being denied to medical care and education, child soldiers, sexual exploitation, crimes against children, trafficking, child labour and malnutrition.
Not to mention the particular type of discrimination to which little girls are prey in numerous countries; my fellow Member referred earlier to genital mutilation.
Finally, children are the first to suffer in war situations and from poverty and social exclusion.
Even in our own countries within the European Union, how many children fail to receive the care to which they are entitled or an environment in which they can flourish, quite simply because their parents are poor, socially excluded or immigrants with no papers?
It is time the international community reiterated its undertaking to put the welfare of children throughout the world at the top of the agenda.
Putting this undertaking into practice means spending money.
I believe it also means promoting women's rights as the sine qua non to advancing children's rights.
Europe has a very important part to play.
It needs to develop partnerships between European institutions and associations, NGOs, governments and associations in candidate countries.
We also need to involve children in certain decision-making processes at appropriate levels.
Finally, I would add that we need to be much more coherent in our ambitions.
Insisting that candidate countries, where children already face severe difficulties, reduce public spending, which includes health and education, seems to me to be incompatible with improving the rights of the child.
Mr President, the Commission too is impatient to see a specific international agenda on the child adopted for the next decade, based on specific measures agreed by our leaders at the special session of the UN General Assembly next month.
Our action plan covers four major causes for concern: health, education, protection of childhood and AIDS/HIV, all of which receive special attention under development cooperation.
The Commission feels that assistance and protection for vulnerable children should be set against the wider context of the fight against poverty and hence within the framework of the Community's development cooperation.
Children, from this point of view, are an important target group for external aid, especially in sectoral policies such as education and health.
As far as education is concerned, we recently adopted a communication on education and training as part of the bid to reduce poverty in developing countries.
This communication recommends improving the quantity and quality of the education aid we give these countries and reiterates, as many of you have just done, the importance of a rights-based approach.
As far as children involved in armed conflicts are concerned, aid is granted under a number of programmes managed by the Commission, especially the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
In addition, the promotion of children's rights was one of the priorities for allocating resources in 2001 and has been integrated into funding planned for 2002 to 2004.
Finally, we are also making children a horizontal priority in terms of action under humanitarian aid.
This takes the form of specific projects, action to protect children deployed inside the Union and research conducted with a view to improving the humanitarian response of the international community.
Our actions are in keeping with the wishes which you have just expressed and cover various dimensions of the Union's internal and external policy.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 this evening.
The next item is the joint debate of the following five motions for resolutions:
(B5-0204/2002) by Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Angola;
(B5-0217/2002) by Cunha and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Angola;
(B5-0220/2002) by Isler BÃ©guin and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Angola;
(B5-0226/2002) by Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on Angola;
(B5-0230/2002) by Miranda, Ainardi, Vinci and Cossutta, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Angola.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again Angola warrants the attention of the European Parliament.
Today, it is for happier reasons than those behind our last discussion of Angola in this House.
The entire international community, and especially the European Union, must make it clear that we expect all parties to do everything they can to ensure that this peace process is definitive and irreversible.
The Angolan government has done well to cease all military offensives and Unita's political leaders and military command have acted properly.
All concerned have demonstrated the ability to enter into dialogue, which is to be emphasised and applauded.
It is crucial now to lay the foundations for a shared democratic life.
Military units must be disbanded and the State administration must be extended to cover the whole country.
Unita must be integrated into democratic life.
Conditions must be established for the democratic rule of law to take root, respecting the rights of the opposition, press freedom, increasing the transparency of public authorities, fighting against corruption and influence peddling, combating poverty and social exclusion and promoting the country's development in an environment of peace.
Those who were previously dedicated to war must be reintegrated into normal civilian life and all those who were forced to flee their native areas by the violence of the civil war must be returned to their homes.
As soon as the necessary conditions are in place, elections must be scheduled.
I also wish to call on all parties to commit themselves to ensuring that the situation of the Portuguese children who disappeared months ago is quickly cleared up.
The key word, therefore, is to stimulate: to stimulate the good faith of all parties and to trust in the ability and the determination of the Angolan people.
So that, even thousands of kilometres away, they hear our voice in Luanda!
The very best of luck, Angola!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, life in Angola has smacked of caricature, a caricature of a country which brutal decolonisation left high and dry, of an African country torn apart by endless civil conflict between fratricidal factions and of a civilian population wracked by poverty and sorrow, scratching a living on land overflowing with oil and tramping barefoot over diamond mines.
However, having been reduced to a pathetic caricature of a country, with its people living a life of hell on earth, hope came to this long-suffering nation the day after the Unita rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was shot to death.
The new dialogue, set up immediately between the government and Unita representatives and born of a common will to restore peace, has the support of the entire international community.
This promises to be a turning point in Angola's history.
Angola could become a model of national reconciliation, normalisation and return to the rule of law.
In a word, it could bring its people back to life.
Angola has acquired the resources and is making the efforts needed to reunite its people and remould its society.
Nature has given this country sufficient resources and wealth to deliver it from need and give it the best conditions of life on earth.
It is by counting on us and on action by the entire international community, especially multiple support from the Union, that Angola will be able to assure itself of a future.
The Union can no longer use the excuse of danger from armed forces and can now send food aid to the starving population.
There is no country more in need or more willing to follow the democratic rules and respect for human rights suggested by the European Union.
What better example than our European history to avoid the horrors of neo-colonialism in Angola and lead the country, in transparency and independence, towards sustainable economic development and the emancipation of its people.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by awarding the Sakharov Prize recently to the Angolan archbishop, Zacarias Kamuenho, the European Parliament wished to support the struggle of all those who were working for peace in Angola, against the implacable logic of violence and war.
We could scarcely have imagined at that time that events would move on at such a pace that, today, great expectations for peace and reconciliation have appeared in that long-suffering country.
The award of that Prize certainly helped to strengthen the spirit of peace and the demands for peace to be achieved that were made to everyone following the death of Unita's leader.
Angola is now emerging from that tragic category of countries that have come to be known as 'war-torn countries', and is embarking on a period of building a lasting peace.
All humanity must welcome this, particularly those who love Angola and who feel infinite pity for the indescribable suffering of its people, who, for decades, have been the victims of a bloody conflict between the two factions fighting for power.
All of those who make up the anonymous population of Angola are, quite simply, heroes and martyrs!
This extraordinary people now has the right to peace, to freedom, to democracy and to progress.
It has the right to bread and freedom; it has the right to the future.
Only in this way will the enormous hopes raised by decolonisation and by independence finally be fulfilled.
The international community must, now more than ever, demonstrate moral and material solidarity with the Angolan people.
There are thousands and thousands of children abandoned and missing.
On this point we must also demand the truth about the young lives of two Portuguese citizens who were killed recently in a brutal ambush, an event that is shrouded in mystery.
Angola has thousands and thousands of mutilated people and millions of displaced people.
They are all hoping for a solution to their tragedy.
The return of peace and the reconstruction of Angola will have to address this situation, which is a genuine human disaster.
Peace and democracy will only truly be achieved in Angola when the monopoly of power is brought to an end and the diversity of political opinion can be expressed without hesitation or fear, when power is made truly democratic and when there is a fair and equitable distribution of resources.
We must be at once optimistic and prudent.
We must be optimistic because Angola is now heading in the right direction; prudent and vigilant in order to ensure that there is no change of mind or backsliding.
We are surprised, in particular, that the voices of prestigious independent intellectual, religious and political figures should have been so discreet.
In fact, unless civil society comes fully to the fore in Angola, everything could become more fragile, limited and uncertain.
In any event, it is time to say: long live Angola!
Mr President, like all the Members who have just spoken, the Commission welcomes the news of the long overdue ceasefire between the Angolan armed forces and Unita.
The declaration by the Angolan Government giving Unita a bone fide role on the political stage and time to reorganise is, in our view, a step in the right direction.
We are encouraging the two sides to take measures to involve representatives of the whole of Angolan civil society, including the clergy, who have played an active role here, as Mr Lage has just pointed out, in discussions to bring about national reconciliation and sustainable peace.
As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, to which Mr Miranda referred, we are providing important humanitarian aid to displaced people inside Angola and constantly calling on the government to take additional measures to help get emergency aid to zones which, for the moment, are still accessible.
We are also encouraging the government to include the extension of humanitarian aid to the entire country in its negotiations with Unita as a matter of urgency.
We are well aware of the fact that the presence of land- and antipersonnel mines is a huge obstacle to humanitarian aid convoys, to the return of displaced people and to various recovery operations.
From this point of view, it is by improving safety on the ground that we shall be able to start using specialist organisations in mine-clearing operations, for which serious financial resources have already been earmarked.
As far as political rights are concerned, we are calling on the Angolan Government to strengthen democracy by improving human rights and freedom of the press as a sine qua non to the restoration of lasting peace.
Basic political rights, freedom of movement, constitutional reform, electoral reform, a census - all predicated on the ceasefire - will all determine whether or not free and fair elections are held in the future.
We are prepared to support the organisation of elections as soon as local conditions allow.
The strategy in the long term is currently being discussed both with the government and civil society and at Commission and Union level.
We are endeavouring, with this strategy, to forge very close, very permanent and very coherent links between aid, rehabilitation and development, which are the three problems we have to cope with.
We need to release important financial resources to help the return of displaced persons, including under micro projects, and to restore agricultural means of production and livestock structures so that social and economic life can gradually resume in the zones affected by the conflict.
We all know from experience that zones which have been prey to conflict and mined as these have are very delicate zones when it comes to development operations.
We will of course continue to provide aid for health and education and to strengthen the capabilities of the provincial administrations because, in the final analysis, they will be the ones in charge of setting up and maintaining structures, systems and the social and local fabric.
Finally, we also welcome news of the Angolan Government's stated intention to organise an international conference on reconstructing the country.
We stand by our conviction that all sections of society must be taken into account in the reconstruction project which is to be presented and which - subject to examination of course - we are prepared to continue to support.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the joint debate of the following three motions for resolutions:
(B5-0218/2002) by FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on flooding in Santa Cruz in Tenerife;
(B5-0231/2002) by Marset Campos and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on torrential rain in Tenerife and climate change;
(B5-0237/2002) by Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on torrential rain in Tenerife and Eastern Spain and climate change.
Mr President, on 31 March, in the space of two hours, 224 litres/m2 of rain fell on Santa Cruz de Tenerife, in the Canary Islands; a violent downpour which caused a great deal of destruction.
Such climate changes were also seen in the Autonomous Community of Valencia, causing a great deal of destruction to districts such as la Marina and la Safor.
The local community, European neighbours, the fire brigade, medical services, the police, the regional government and the Spanish Government all lent their support.
I think that Parliament needs to be sensitive to this loss of both human life and over 400 homes, and ask the Commission to provide economic assistance, to provide European support for the Canary Islands and the Autonomous Community of Valencia, which have both suffered the devastating effects of the climate change that has been affecting the Mediterranean region recently and, on this particular occasion, the Canary Islands.
Therefore, we would ask the Commission to show solidarity and we ask the Commissioner what can be done in this regard.
For example, large infrastructures under development in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, created under the Urban programme, have been destroyed, and they need to be rebuilt.
Budgets will clearly have to be revised because everything that had been done - in this case using Community contributions - has been lost.
We have the sad task of having to pass on our sincere condolences to the families of victims who died in the floods and of all those who were injured but next, and in order to provide for all eventualities, we also need to adopt the appropriate means to demonstrate, in real figures from the budget, the solidarity of all Europeans with the suffering caused to families, goods and infrastructures in these two Spanish regions.
Mr President, I think that Mr PomÃ©s has explained the situation: torrential rain in the Canaries and in south-eastern Spain, which has caused a great deal of damage, especially in the town of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where eight people died and 400 homes were lost, with many cars and much private property being destroyed.
From the Community point of view, the most striking feature, naturally, is this issue of climate change, which we addressed in our joint motion for a resolution, and the need to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, in the aim of stopping climate change from causing the damage it is causing at the moment, which could get even worse.
We need to take into account the fact that competition in local building and construction work is undertaken on a local, regional and national scale.
The relevance of this from the Community point of view is that the European Union was generous enough to make a large financial contribution to the Urban plan in the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife itself.
The issue now, without questioning whether these funds were used properly, or whether they took due account of environmental considerations, is that we are clearly failing to see that urban development in island regions such as the Canaries, and in other outermost regions, has resulted in what we could call abusive land use, without taking other considerations into account.
Perhaps the lesson we can learn from this type of occurrence is that the European Union now has a wealth of knowledge on building in areas that are exposed to potentially catastrophic torrential rain, not only in Spain, but also in France, the UK, Germany, practically throughout the Community, in fact.
Although we must not forget that this issue fundamentally falls within national competence, this is an area in which the European Union could contribute to the well-being of all of its citizens by making use of these experiences and in seeing how its assistance to projects such as the Urban projects can be more effectively implemented.
For this reason, in dealing with, for example, the Urban plan for a specific population, we should not confine ourselves to what might be called purely ornamental external characteristics, but should also look at the impact that this type of plan would have on the situation as a whole.
In concrete terms, the town of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is built on steep riverbanks that have been blocked off, yet construction has continued due to demographic pressure and the need to use the land.
It would probably have been useful, in studies carried out prior to the Urban plan being set in motion, for this other type of consequence to have been taken into account.
It is always, of course, much easier to talk with the benefit of hindsight and we cannot undo what has been done, but given that the Urban plan is still in force and that the European Union can have learnt from this situation, I would ask the services of the Commission to take this opportunity to consider how community aid could have prevented this kind of catastrophe and how this could be used as an example for other kinds of project in the future.
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my sympathy to those who were affected.
Anyone who has seen the effects of flood damage, as we have in many regions throughout the European Union, will know how devastating it can be, not only to infrastructure but to life and indeed to roads and buildings, as the previous speaker mentioned.
But we must also look at the further-reaching effects.
People say that floods happen and they cannot be controlled.
I want to look further, at the whole situation of climate change, which cannot be overlooked, either in the short or the long term.
We must increase our efforts, not only to achieve agreement, but to encourage those who do not and are not prepared to cooperate with the European Union.
We saw the effects after Kyoto, with certain large nations deciding not to support the position taken by the European Union.
I would urge many of these major nations to support what the European Union is trying to achieve regarding climate change, to improve the situation.
We must also make clear that we are prepared to condemn those large nations that believe they can do whatever they want to do, without any thought to the effects on others.
It is not only the United States - which is the prime mover in this - there are other countries such as Australia, and countries in Eastern Europe, where this problem needs to be tackled.
Their position is deplorable.
We must ask the question how long can we continue to allow people to disturb the rainforests and destroy the balance that has existed for so long.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to remind you that the outermost regions of the EU are located in areas where the inhabitants live in the shadow of cyclones from the Caribbean and violent storms coming in from the oceans, and for this reason we should not be surprised that some natural disasters will take place in these areas from time to time, such as the one which occurred recently in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, where, fortunately, some of us who are Members of Parliament happen to live.
Unfortunately, on 31 March, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, one of the capitals of the Canary Islands, which is an outermost region of the European Union and an Objective 1 region, some of whose works are being carried out under the Urban initiative - as has just been pointed out - suffered a natural disaster on a huge scale.
In only two hours, heavy rainfall of more than 200 litres/m2 flooded the capital.
Thousands of citizens, hundreds of homes and business premises, thousands of vehicles and a large proportion of public infrastructure were affected by the devastating consequences of this storm.
The saddest fact, however, is that eight people died as a direct result.
In addition to this tragic human loss there was a huge amount of material loss, estimated at more than EUR 100 million.
For this reason, a public campaign was launched to repair the damage caused and to make Santa Cruz de Tenerife a town fit for habitation once more.
Fortunately, Santa Cruz is recovering, thanks to solidarity and to collective efforts, and trusts in the official support of the public authorities of the Canary Islands.
However, we think that the Commission should adopt a series of measures in cooperation with the aforementioned authorities to make an exceptional contribution to alleviate the damage caused and, in this way, the citizens of the Canary Islands can feel that European institutions are close to them at this time of need.
This also applies to similar occurrences that have happened in the Autonomous Community of Valencia.
Mr President, like you, the Commission was shocked at the damage caused by the torrential rain which hit the Canary Islands and Alicante on 31 March; we sympathise with the families bereaved by the disaster and deeply regret the damage caused.
I can confirm, on behalf of the Commission, that we intend to apply every means available under regional policy, agricultural policy and rural development policy in order to help reconstruct the areas damaged and restore production.
As far as regional policy between 2000 and 2006 is concerned, the damaged areas in both the Canaries and the region of Alicante are eligible for Objective 1 aid under the Structural Funds and the Commission and, as you said, the Spanish authorities will consider whether resources available under ERDF programmes can be reallocated in order to reconstruct infrastructure damaged by the torrential rain within the ERDF monitoring committees.
As regards rural development policy, which is cofinanced under the EAGGF-Guidance in the Objective 1 region, the integrated operational programme for the Canary Islands on preserving the countryside and the agricultural economy includes action to prevent and correct soil erosion and work to prevent possible damage and restore and regenerate ecosystems.
The Community funds this measure to the tune of over EUR 20 million and, again under rural development policy for the community of Valencia, the integrated operational programme includes a forestry measure which makes provision for reforestation following natural disasters and preventive instruments.
The Community provides over EUR 13 million for this and, as with the ERDF, it is up to the Spanish authorities to restructure their priorities within their programming budget as and where necessary in order to deal with the consequences of this disaster.
On the aspect of the subject addressed by Mr Medina Ortega, these flash floods are, unfortunately, quite a frequent phenomenon in the Mediterranean and in coastal regions, which is why we and the Member States have developed several specific projects on the subject, the results of which will allow us to decide if guidelines on reducing these floods need to be introduced under Community action programmes.
Generally speaking, and with the scientific information currently available, no connection can be established between this sort of inclement weather and climate change.
However, we consider that climate change is the most serious ecological threat we have to face and, as such, the agreements brokered in Bonn and Marrakech are successful additions to the multilateral approach to the fight against climate change.
As one speaker has just reminded us, this progress has given the Union and third countries the technical parameters needed in order to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. As you know, the Council of Ministers of the Union took the decision to ratify the protocol at the beginning of March and we shall all do our best to ensure that the ratification acts are filed by 1 June, i.e. before the world summit on sustainable development, as a symbol of the leadership which the Union has demonstrated here and in the run-up to the Johannesburg summit.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended until 5.30 p.m. pending the vote)
.
I have previously stated in this House how vital the Channel Tunnel link is to industry in Scotland and to the viability of Eurocentral at Motherwell as the northernmost end of a trans-European network.
We must get the tunnel open again as a matter of urgency.
This resolution could be even stronger but I give it my hearty backing.
I did not want to say anything on this point, but rather on the agenda, in order to address an appeal to the bureau and to the Conference of Presidents concerning the use we make of our sittings.
On Tuesday, Mr President, Question Time was omitted because we had such a full agenda, which was actually contrary to the Treaties and to the Rules of Procedure.
Yesterday, Wednesday, Questions to the Council were cut by 35 minutes because the agenda was so full up.
We have had a less tight agenda today and are finishing as early as 5.36 p.m.
I wish to ask that the sittings be organised better.
We are no less numerous today than at the earlier part-sessions, when Thursday's sitting went on until 6.30 p.m., or fewer in number than we used to be on Fridays - or maybe perhaps we are -- and there are no fewer of us here today than there will be tomorrow, which is Friday.
So I ask for better use to be made of Thursday afternoons than hitherto and for action on the principle that those who leave have only themselves to blame.
The Conference of Presidents gave me discretion as regards the organisation of Tuesday's agenda in the light of the availability of Mr Solana prior to his departure for Madrid.
The House appreciated, notwithstanding the consequences you describe, that this was the appropriate political choice at the time.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 11 April 2002
The next item is the order of business
Mr President, with regard to my report which has just been mentioned, I would ask, since it has been adopted unanimously, both by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and since it deals purely with a change of legal base which Parliament - in the form of a unanimouse decision by the two committees - has not agreed to, I would ask that it be voted on tomorrow without the need for a debate this evening, a debate in which I will probably be the only speaker.
I would therefore ask that it be removed from the agenda and that we proceed directly to the vote tomorrow in order to save time, both for the President and for all the other Members.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
It is a great pleasure for me to appear in this House to inform you of two issues which are related for obvious reasons.
On the one hand, the Fifth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference which took place in Valencia yesterday and the day before yesterday, and on the other, the current situation in the Middle East, the latest events and the efforts being made to put the peace process back on track.
If you will allow me, I will begin by describing the contribution I believe this ministerial meeting has made and then end with some comments on the situation in the Middle East.
I would firstly like to say that we all had doubts about whether or not this Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting would be able to take place, for obvious reasons: the situation in the Middle East presented enormous uncertainties and serious risks and, at certain moments, many people doubted whether this meeting could even take place.
I therefore believe that the fact that we have been able to hold it is a success in itself.
As well as holding the meeting, the fact that we have been able to achieve conclusions which enjoyed the consensus of all the parties present was also a success.
You know that the delegations from Syria and Lebanon finally decided not to attend in order not to come into contact with the Israeli delegation, but the other countries of the Mediterranean did attend and the twenty-five of us reached a consensus on approving an action plan, a programme in such sensitive areas as justice and internal affairs as well as a programme to guide dialogue between cultures and civilisations.
I believe that this - which has been the subject of much work both prior to and during the conference - is also a notable success in itself.
I would also like to stress that practically all the Member States of the Barcelona Process attended at ministerial level and there was therefore an extremely high level of attendance and decision-making capacity, for which I am grateful to the countries of the South and the East of the Mediterranean as well as all my colleagues in the European Union.
As I have said, there has been solid previous work. If this had not been the case, given the enormous difficulties and tensions in the Middle East, we would not have been able to hold this conference and nor would it have borne fruit.
I am referring to documents such as the establishment of priorities by the Presidency, the Commission's communication, the action lines, the guidelines of the recent General Affairs Council and all the documents and contributions of the countries of the South and the East of the Mediterranean.
I would, however, also like, in particular, to refer to the report by the European Parliament, which furthermore was produced by a Spanish Member, Mr Esteve.
It is a wonderful report which I value very highly.
We have accepted many of its proposals; we are going to try our best to incorporate more of them, since we believe they are all worthy of consideration.
I would therefore like to say that everything we have achieved and approved in Valencia - I insist, by consensus - is not only the result of this desire for agreement, but also of everybody's contributions.
It is the first time - I will talk about this later - that, following the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, documents of this nature have been approved by everybody, and not only as mere Presidency declarations of conclusions following a series of debates.
In this context, I would also like to stress - and I will return to this later - that we have approved the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
I believe that this is a great step forward: it is an idea of the European Parliament which we have accepted and which we believe to be enormously important.
In any event, in the international situation resulting from 11 September and for a European Union on the point of the greatest enlargement in its history, which will practically double its current number of Members, I believe there is no doubt that the Mediterranean is becoming our strategic border, a region where we have to build an area of shared peace, stability, development and prosperity, an area in which the dialogue and cooperation between cultures and civilisations which the Barcelona Declaration calls for is possible.
Like all processes, the Barcelona Process is being built step by step.
If we look back, we have travelled a long way since Barcelona, and proof of this lies in the fact that we have signed eleven of the twelve association agreements we intended to reach with the countries of the South.
In Valencia we signed the agreement with Algeria. The agreement with Lebanon has been reached and it only remains for it to be signed.
All the rest have been signed and many are in force.
Despite all of this, however, this progress, though important, is not sufficient.
The Barcelona Process, the very approach and existence of which is of irreplaceable value, requires new political impetus, a kind of navigation chart which is able to take the Barcelona objectives from paper to reality.
The Valencia action plan, the joint justice and internal affairs programme and the programme on dialogue between cultures and civilisations respond to this challenge, to this ambition to give the Barcelona Process new political impetus, which we all thought was languishing.
I must insist that we have approved all of this by consensus at the Fifth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference.
This means not only maintaining the process's potential for transformation, but also providing innovations both in terms of form and basis.
I have already spoken of the form: it is the first political document adopted jointly by the partners in the process at a ministerial conference. This endows the action plan and the other documents I have mentioned with the status of Euro-Mediterranean contracts, of shared projects and commitments.
I would like to reiterate this message: the Barcelona Process, the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue is not something that is addressed by the Fifteen to the Twelve, but rather it belongs to the Twenty-seven, and we want it to increasingly become something experienced and accepted by the Twenty-seven.
The basis of the documents has also had the potential for transformation, because they conform to a series of principles which we believe must inspire the transformation of the process and propose a series of important initiatives which, as a whole, have the potential to produce a qualitative improvement in the construction of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
What are these principles?
I just referred to one of them: the principle of co-ownership.
Also the principle of visibility: that the process is perceived as such by the governments but also by the respective civil societies. The principle of capillarity: that it be communicated to all the players present.
And also other principles, such as that of structuring, that of credibility, that of efficiency or that of the realisation of the process.
The realisation of the process requires initiatives.
Obviously, to explain it completely would require a reading of the action plan, which is very exhaustive, but, while each and every one of these initiatives is very important, I would like to summarise by highlighting those which seem to me at the moment to be of the greatest political significance in the three chapters of the process: in the political and institutional chapter, in the economic and financial chapter and in the social, cultural and human chapter.
In the political and institutional chapter, I would like to highlight the greater democratisation of the process, by means of the proposal to create a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which we must try to implement as soon as possible.
Also by means of the implementation of new mechanisms for political dialogue and cooperation between the Twenty-seven, including issues such as security and defence policy, which I believe is very important, or terrorism - which I will refer to in a moment - or the promotion of human rights.
Measures are also adopted for the creation of trust and partnership.
As I have said, terrorism is included for the first time on the Barcelona agenda, which I feel is absolutely essential at the moment for obvious reasons.
And it is also envisaged that the plan will for the first time be subject - being a specific action plan approved by everybody - to monitoring and an assessment of compliance at the next Sixth Ministerial Conference in Barcelona, which I believe will make it more credible.
Turning to the economic and financial chapter, the Valencia action plan confirms the objective of creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010. To this end, we must conclude every one of the association agreements that I have already mentioned and also complete the South-South integration.
It is extremely important that progress be made towards free trade areas in the South and we have therefore welcomed and given all our support - not only political but also technical, thanks to the Commission - to the Agadir Process initiated by Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan.
We all know that, in order for the Euro-Mediterranean process to be a success, it is necessary to guarantee the economic and, therefore, social and political development of the countries of the South.
This requires, amongst other things, but very importantly all the same, the appropriate channelling of investment flows, and therefore the plan takes up one of the main priorities of the Presidency, that is, to promote the creation of a new financial instrument, which begins to function as a strengthened facility within the European Investment Bank, in order to support infrastructure works and in order to fundamentally support the private sector.
Then we have laid down that, within one year, if possible, the decision will be taken to convert this improved facility into a Bank, a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank, with capital potentially open to other countries or even institutions and which, in any event, will allow greater financial resources to be directed towards the region.
The plan also takes up the conclusions and decisions adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean trade and industry ministerial meetings in Toledo and Malaga respectively.
In the commercial field it includes a series of measures to facilitate investments and implement the liberalisation of services.
In the industrial field it includes provisions to promote legislative harmonisation in order to facilitate the integration of our partners, promote innovation and access to new technologies and increase the role of the private sector in the construction of the Euro-Mediterranean association.
I would also like to make a particular reference in this chapter to the measures intended to stimulate investment in infrastructures and the interconnection of the transport, telecommunications and energy networks of our Mediterranean partners with the trans-European networks, and, in this regard, I would like to thank the Commission once again for the enormous and very positive work it has done.
In this field I would also like to stress the European Union's will to facilitate the incorporation of the Mediterranean partners into the Galileo satellite navigation network.
Finally, with regard to the social, cultural and human chapter, the Presidency has tried to respond to the challenges posed by such important issues as immigration, dialogue between cultures and civilisations or the participation by the different players from civil society in Euro-Mediterranean construction, incorporating a series of measures into the action plan of which I would like to highlight the following: firstly, the adoption of a framework document, which I mentioned earlier, on justice and internal affairs, which deals, for example, with such important issues as the fight against drugs, the fight against organised crime, the fight against terrorism, treatment of migratory flows and the movement of persons, etc. This has also led us to adopt the decision in Valencia to convene a Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on migration.
The decision has also been taken to create a foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilisations and to promote cultural, intellectual and social exchanges.
It is a project shared by everybody and it must therefore be a response to the challenges in this field, a concrete response, also the adoption of an action plan, which can be channelled by means of the foundation or by some other method, so that the dialogue between cultures and civilisations focuses on three areas which we believe to be fundamental: youth, education and the media.
We have also decided to extend the Tempus programme to the Mediterranean partners, which would allow for the development of cooperation between universities on the two sides of the Mediterranean and, very importantly, the incorporation into the university world of the two sides of the Mediterranean as players in the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
There is also a call to develop decentralised cooperation between Mediterranean cities and regions and the adoption of conclusions which stem from those of the civil forum which took place in Valencia prior to the Ministerial Summit.
In summary, we are facing a new stage; if you like, a new phase in the Barcelona Process.
We are facing a relaunch of the Barcelona Process despite the difficulties resulting from the Middle East conflict, which I believe demonstrates something essential: the Barcelona Process's enormous capacity for resistance.
The Barcelona Process has demonstrated that it is able to resist the Middle East conflict, and this brings me to a new conclusion: Barcelona was a wonderful idea in 1995, the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue was and still is a wonderful idea and, if we had not adopted it at that time, we would have had to adopt it now.
Naturally, Mr President, over these two days, with the presence of Arab countries, amongst them all those directly involved in the Middle East conflict, and Israel and the European Union, it was absolutely essential that we dedicated a good proportion of the sittings to the debate on the situation in the Middle East.
Valencia has helped us to evaluate and debate this situation, and it has taken place - despite the enormous current tensions and emotions - within the framework of a debate which at times was genuinely constructive, which has demonstrated the parties' desire for peace and I believe it can be of use to the whole process.
We are all aware of the situation on the ground.
We are witnessing an unprecedented level of violence, with a horrendous number of victims.
Despite the calm of recent hours and days, the events of recent weeks have been truly horrific.
There have been terrible terrorist attacks, which we would like to condemn once again, without reservation or hesitation.
There has been - and there still is - the Israeli occupation of cities controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and in this regard I would like to repeat our demand for an immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops.
We all know that there can be no military solution to the conflict and that the only route is negotiation within the framework of a political perspective and that therefore a ceasefire is also urgently required.
Given the events of recent days, I believe that we are all very aware that there is a serious risk of the destruction and dismantling of the Palestinian National Authority, of its short- and medium-term capacity to be the seed for a future Palestinian State, and I would therefore call once again for an immediate end to the confinement of President Arafat.
I would also like to say on behalf of the international community that we welcome the condemnation by the Palestinian leadership and by President Arafat himself of the terrorist acts.
I would also like to express my serious concern about the humanitarian crisis.
It is absolutely essential that medical and assistance organisations can carry out their tasks.
A very important meeting is taking place today in Oslo which must specify what we must do to deal with the most urgent and immediate needs from a humanitarian point of view, and also what we can do for the reconstruction - not just physical, but also institutional - of the territories and of the Palestinian Authority.
Over the coming days, when it appears that the withdrawal has begun - with all the issues this involves - we will clearly see the consequences of the military attacks.
Jenin is undoubtedly a dramatic example.
It is essential to know what has happened and its true extent, that the United Nations has the necessary support - of course I believe they can count on the full support of the European Union - to carry out an impartial international investigation.
I would also like to mention that, given the events, there is a very serious risk of regional destabilisation.
There is serious concern about the violence on the southern border of Lebanon.
We have made direct representations - the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, the troika - to the Lebanese authorities and the other countries so that they may make every possible effort to prevent attacks on Israel from their territory.
I must point out that they share that concern and I am aware that they are taking measures.
I would also like to mention another very important point: it is very regrettable that the consular representations of our countries cannot carry out their duties owing to the constant obstacles presented by the Israeli army in the occupied territories.
Certain new possibilities are beginning to emerge, certain controls are being relaxed, but the situation is still unsustainable and completely unacceptable.
Our consular representatives must have complete freedom to access the territories, to attend to their respective nationals and to observe the humanitarian situation in those territories.
We have made representations both in Tel Aviv, as the troika, and, as Presidency, to the Israeli Ambassador in Spain.
Furthermore, the consuls in Jerusalem have held many contacts with the Israeli army authorities and, for the moment, some progress is being made, although I believe that it is clearly insufficient.
We must send a very strong and clear message in this regard.
I would now like to refer very briefly to the efforts we have made over recent weeks.
The European Union is always firmly committed to helping to resolve the problem in the region.
At the Barcelona European Council we insisted on dealing with both the security and the political and economic aspects, as inseparable and interdependent elements of the same process.
We cannot attach more importance to some than to others.
They must run in parallel.
And the foundations for a solution to the conflict were repeated in Barcelona: the resolutions of the Security Council, essentially Resolutions Nos 242, 338 and 1397; the principles of the Madrid Conference, and in particular the principle of land for peace; the principles of the Oslo Agreements and all subsequent agreements, which would allow the two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security.
We have therefore firmly supported the peace initiatives such as the Saudi plan, which was supported by the Summit of the Arab League in Beirut and which presented the possibility of normalising relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders and a fair solution to the problem of refugees on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.
I believe that that support was demonstrated by the presence of the Spanish Prime Minister, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, and the High Representative at the inauguration of the Beirut Summit.
We also held an extraordinary General Affairs Council as a result of the seriousness of the crisis.
We wanted to send a clear message of concern, but also of involvement by the European Union given the events.
We decided to send the Presidency and the High Representative to the region to talk to the parties at the highest level in order to demand an immediate ceasefire, the application of United Nations Resolutions Nos 1397 and 1402 and a return to negotiations on a political agreement.
I believe that we had to do so and we did, highlighting through action the essential need for an involvement on the ground by the international community.
As is well known, that mission met with many difficulties, and it was impossible for us to visit President Arafat given the opposition of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Sharon.
I must say that that attitude has changed.
At this moment - and this is why Mr Solana is not here today - both Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos are visiting the region - and I did not go precisely so that I could be here - and they intend to visit President Arafat and if possible the other leaders in the region.
With regard to this will on the part of the international community to be involved, I would like to mention another event to which I attach great importance: the meeting in Madrid of the so-called Quartet, that is, the United States, the Russian Federation, the United Nations and the European Union at the highest diplomatic level: Secretary of State Powell, the Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Annan, and Mr Solana and myself, on behalf of the European Union.
I believe this reflects something that we in the European Union have always advocated: the international community's involvement must be based on the greatest possible degree of unity in its actions and positions, because we are all aware that there can be no solution without the United States, but that neither can there be a solution with the United States alone.
And to maintain the unity of the whole international community on the basis of common positions seems to me extremely important.
As you know, we issued a public declaration establishing a common position on the conflict and supporting Secretary of State Powell's mission to the region.
It also stated the desire for the Quartet to continue to monitor the situation in the Middle East by means of regular consultations at the highest level and for the special envoys to continue with their efforts on the ground.
They are doing so and they are doing it very well.
In this regard I would like to mention the representative of the Russian Federation, Mr Vdovin, the representative of the European Union, Mr Moratinos, the current representative of the United States, Mr Zinni, and - I would like to say this very clearly here today - the special representative of the United Nations, Mr Larsen, who are doing fantastic work.
With regard to the continuation of meetings of the Quartet at the highest level, I believe we will be able to convene one in the coming days to review the situation once again and to continue with the progress on political initiatives.
In that Madrid Declaration we expressly asked for immediate compliance with Resolution No 1402, as demanded by Resolution 1403, and therefore an immediate ceasefire, an immediate withdrawal from Palestinian cities, including Bethlehem and Ramallah and in particular the general headquarters of President Arafat.
In this Declaration, Israel was urged to cease the military operations, to comply with international humanitarian principles, to allow full and unhindered access for humanitarian organisations and services, to refrain from the excessive use of force and to make every possible effort to guarantee the protection of civilians.
This declaration also urges President Arafat, however, as the recognised and elected leader of the Palestinians, to immediately make the greatest possible effort to stop the terrorist attacks against innocent Israelis, to use all the weight of his political authority to convince the Palestinian people that attacks against Israelis must end completely and immediately, to authorise his representatives to renew, immediately, the security coordination with Israel and he is also urged to act decisively and to take every measure he can to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure, including its funding, and to stop the incitement to violence or the justification of certain types of attack.
This declaration does not say this, but I want to say it: the suicide bombers are terrorists, they are not martyrs, and this must be repeated constantly.
Returning to the declaration, terrorism is immoral and illegal, it has seriously damaged the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians and it must be condemned, as Security Council Resolution 1373 clearly states.
Finally, we express our joint will to help the parties to apply their agreements, such as the Tenet Security Plan and the Mitchell recommendations, including the mediation of an impartial mechanism, as agreed by the parties.
Within the Union, various scenarios have been discussed in view of the current situation.
We have lent all our political weight to diplomatic efforts, which range from Presidency declarations and contacts with all the parties involved, to supporting General Zinni's mission a few weeks ago and of course supporting the mission to the region by the American Secretary of State, Mr Powell, and also our visits on the ground, such as the one that is taking place today.
The possibility has also been raised of implementing measures to put pressure on Israel, such as suspending the Association Agreement, and I am perfectly aware of the position expressed by this Parliament.
Last week, at the last General Affairs Council, it was considered appropriate to await the results of the mission by Secretary of State Powell, which I will mention in a moment, and at the moment what I can say is that all options remain open.
The tour by Secretary of State Powell has yielded more positive and useful results than would appear at first sight, and I believe this will become evident over the coming days.
A new perspective has been opened up by establishing a timetable for withdrawal, but it is clear that there are unacceptable exceptions.
One is the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and another is the general headquarters of President Arafat.
On the first issue, a solution is still being sought.
There is close contact between all the parties involved and, in particular, with the Vatican, which I hope will bear fruit.
And on the second issue, we are continuing with all our efforts, and the visit by Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos today to a large extent has the objective of finding a solution which will lead to an end to the siege, which would allow for a ceasefire.
We are all also awaiting the coming visit of the Director of the CIA, Mr Tenet, accompanied by General Zinni, which may also be extremely useful on the ground.
If we manage to resolve these problems - and we are applying all our efforts to this - and achieve the withdrawal of troops, an effective ceasefire and, therefore, an end to terrorist activities, we can begin to create the conditions for progressing towards a peace conference.
A peace conference cannot start from nothing.
It must be a closing peace conference which takes account of everything that has been achieved until now, which does not once again reopen everything that was agreed in Madrid or in Oslo or what has been agreed over recent years. It cannot reopen the issue of international legality which is clearly defined by the Security Council Resolutions.
It must be something which really leads to a definitive peace and which must therefore be as effective as possible.
I believe that this effectiveness is only possible if it has the full support and participation of all the important players in the international community and, without doubt, the European Union.
I hope that a meeting of the Quartet will take place very soon, in which we can analyse all these elements and continue to contribute new ideas and new efforts so that, in the end, Palestinians, Israelis, the Arab world in general, can offer themselves and future generations the prospect of peace, co-existence, stability and prosperity which for very many years has been denied them.
(Applause)
Mr President, some may find it unrealistic to speak about the Barcelona Process when the Middle East is in flames - and that view is not entirely unfounded.
Yet as Minister PiquÃ© said, it confirms, at once the need for the Barcelona enterprise, and its resilience.
The fact that we were able to hold the meeting in Valencia in the present circumstances has been a tribute not only to the vision that took shape in Barcelona in 1995, but also to the remarkable work of the Spanish Presidency.
Let us focus just for a moment on the achievements of Valencia: firstly, agreement on an excellent action plan to show the way forward for the coming months; secondly, the signing of the Association Agreement with Algeria bringing us very close to the completion of the grid of Agreements - we have now negotiated 11 out of 12.
I hope Syria will be ready to return to real negotiations soon, and that the EU Member States will speed up the ratification of the Agreements that have been signed so far.
Frankly it is slightly embarrassing when we express to our colleagues in the south of the Mediterranean, our enthusiasm for completing negotiation on these agreements and then it takes months or years to ratify them.
I hope that we can have a little more parliamentary dynamism on behalf of the Member States.
Much remains to be done.
The prosperity gap between the north and south of the Mediterranean is not diminishing.
40 million new jobs need to be created in the coming decade just to keep employment levels where they are now.
Economic reforms will help achieve the growth and investment needed for this purpose, and the gradual creation of a true EuroMed internal market will create many new opportunities.
This is what the economic pillar of the Barcelona Process is all about.
There is also a broader point.
Failure to close the gap in living standards, failure to increase growth and to alleviate poverty to the south of the Mediterranean is bound to nurture extremism there.
It will also nurture extremism in Europe: the sort of extremism of which we have only recently witnessed such a grubby and shameful manifestation.
To achieve these goals, we need to deepen the South-South relationship.
There was good news at Valencia from the four countries involved in the Agadir Process that an agreement between them should be signed very soon.
We also need to overcome non-tariff obstacles to trade and integration.
The Valencia meeting endorsed decisions taken by Trade Ministers at Toledo on extending the pan-European origin system to the Mediterranean partners, on setting up a Working Group on regional integration, and on liberalising trade in services.
We also agreed to step up our financial cooperation.
Some progress has already been made but I am anxious to make a good deal more.
The ratio of payments to commitments in the MEDA programme improved from 26% for the 1995-1999 period, to 37.6 % in 2000 and to 53.1% in 2001.
So, we have reached about twice the figure we had in the second half of the 1990's but we have to do better still.
Last December we adopted new country and regional strategy programmes for the years 2002 to 2004 which provide a more focused and stable framework for our financial cooperation.
In this context I also welcome the agreement to create a reinforced EIB lending facility for the region and congratulate the Council Presidency on the great leadership they have shown in that area, which should enable us to get more help to the private sector in the countries to the south of the Mediterranean.
On the third chapter of Barcelona, we reached agreement on a programme of cooperation on justice, on the fight against drugs, on organised crime and terrorism, and on co-operation on issues relating to migration.
That was a significant success because these are all difficult and sensitive issues.
Finally, in Valencia, we discussed the dialogue of cultures and civilisations.
As you know the Commission has taken a number of initiatives in this area, including a proposal to create a Euro-Med Foundation.
Unfortunately we met some reluctance among the Member States to make the EUR 1 million contributions we requested from each of them.
I have heard huge enthusiasm from all quarters for deepening the dialogue between cultures, but apparently, for some people, EUR 1 million is too high a price to pay at the moment.
There is agreement in principle on this issue, which I welcome, but the Member States must make this modest financial commitment if the Foundation is to get off the ground.
(Applause)
I should like to turn now to the situation in the Middle East, which overshadowed our meeting in Valencia.
European public opinion has been profoundly shocked by the unfolding tragedy.
I have utterly condemned suicide bombings and terrorist acts, and I do it here again without any qualification whatsoever.
Encouraging children or young people to strap dynamite to themselves and to set out to kill others while killing themselves is deeply wicked.
And failure to discourage this is quite simply inexcusable.
(Applause)
I have also been deeply disturbed, however, by the reports coming out of the West Bank of the behaviour of the Israeli Defence Forces.
There are reports, which must be thoroughly investigated, that they have sometimes shown - I am picking my words extremely diplomatically - a disregard for civilian life, and they have certainly disregarded UN and International Committee of the Red Cross appeals to be allowed to carry out their humanitarian duties.
Israel, as a democratic country, as a pluralist society which believes in the rule of law, should meet international standards of behaviour without equivocation and without 'ifs' or 'buts'.
That is what it means to be a democratic society; that is what the rule of law means.
(Applause)
I want to make four points:
First of all, Full Withdrawal: We regret that the Powell mission did not yield immediate results in terms either of a ceasefire or of an immediate withdrawal.
I recognise, however, the huge commitment that Secretary Powell put into the mission and that the mission was perhaps rather more successful than some critics have suggested.
I continue to be concerned about reactions in the Arab world in the face of this stalled situation.
I repeat my strong support for the UN-led fact-finding mission to Jenin.
It would not be in Israel's interest to leave unanswered the allegations which have been made.
We want to see the mission make effective and rapid progress and we call for active cooperation from all the parties involved.
(Applause)
Everybody who knows Mr Ahtisari and the other members of the mission, will know of their total integrity and I hope that there will not be any doubts cast on that, as doubts have been cast on the role performed by Mr Larsen who is a great international public servant.
(Applause)
Secondly, Full Access: With regard to the humanitarian situation there must be full and unhindered access to the affected areas, particularly refugee camps, to provide urgently-needed relief ...
Sorry, Commissioner, but would the colleague who is responsible for that phone please remove it, and would colleagues please switch off mobile telephones.
. I must say that I am totally opposed to capital punishment but I think the only thing which raises questions about it..
Could I advise you, Commissioner, not to lose your head on this one.
Could I ask the security staff to ensure that the doors are closed so that we can hear our debate.
I suspect that one of the less agreeable aspects of European civilisation is being debated outside!
(Laughter and loud applause)
When in Europe we occasionally give other people lectures about human rights and civil liberties, we should sometimes bear that in mind.
I want to repeat that I am choosing these words with considerable care.
Our commitment to consolidate the Palestinian Authority and to reconstruction, will need to be integrated within a wider political process including sufficient guarantees from both parties in the conflict that our efforts will not be wasted or destroyed.
You cannot rebuild the Palestinian Authority in a political vacuum.
(Applause)
Mr Peres told us yesterday that he supported a flourishing and modern Palestinian Authority.
Some may think that Israel has found a strange way to express that support in recent weeks.
But I hope that Mr Peres speaks for the Israeli Government, and that we will see his expressed view reflected in Israel's attitude towards the aspiration to create a Palestinian State, and Israel's actions in the Palestinian territories.
Even if it is still too early to assess the full extent of damage that has been inflicted, it is clear that there is also going to be a need for major reconstruction and rehabilitation work.
The assessment of the need, which has only just begun, is urgent.
It is already clear, however, that even short term needs will run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
I expect that tomorrow's meeting of the international donor community in Oslo, the so-called Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, will help us to quantify the damages and begin to prepare a co-ordinated response by donors.
I would just like to repeat what I have said already.
To those who talk about Marshall aid for the Middle East, Marshall aid for the Palestinian territories, I say 'fine'.
The important point about Marshall aid, however, was that it began when the bombing had stopped.
In my last point I would like to refer to full rehabilitation of Palestinian structures: There is also the need to fill the administrative and security vacuum in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal.
The alternative is chaos and anarchy, which is not in anyone's interest.
I must repeat my grave concern about the destruction of the basic structures of the Palestinian Authority and military operations against Arafat.
This weakens the powers of Palestinian Authority to enforce the rule of law, to rein in terrorists and to avert suicide bombings.
It plays into the hands of, and increases support among the Palestinian population for extremist groups such as Hamas.
The fight against terrorism cannot be used as a justification for the destruction of basic infrastructure of the Palestinian Authority.
(Applause)
I am also very concerned at the breakdown of general law and order.
We have seen horrible events such as lynchings in the last few days.
This must stop.
It is only likely to stop, however, when Palestinians regain control in their areas.
Israeli military actions have not just targeted the security apparatus of the Palestinian Authority, they have systematically inflicted damage on civil infrastructure which has no security role whatsoever.
What is the security objective of destroying the Ministries of Education, Finance, Agriculture, the Land Registry?
(Applause)
Why destroy the Central Statistics Bureau, or the Palestinian Legislative Council?
This must be of great concern to the members of this House .
Palestinians will have to rebuild large parts of their administration without which daily life cannot function in an orderly fashion.
The Commission is committed to supporting and rebuilding these structures.
But our resources are already stretched to the limits.
Once the needs assessment is done, we will come back to Parliament to inform you of the financial implications and to ask for your help in providing an appropriate response from the European Union.
But, I repeat, you will have to ask us at that moment what the political context is in which we are seeking to rebuild what has been torn down.
I have lost count of the number of debates that I have taken part in on the Middle East over the last two and a half years.
It is fair to say that in each debate the news has been grimmer then in the preceding debate.
I just pray that one day I take part in a debate when things are getting better.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the applause just then for Commissioner Patten has made clear that we must never let a situation stop us talking to each other, even when it is highly dramatic and seems almost an expression of desperation.
For if we stop talking to each other, it is only the weapons that will be left to speak.
That this debate on the Mediterranean dialogue should be held here today, is important, and I would like to express from the heart my gratitude to the Spanish Presidency of the Council for the commitment they have shown.
Despite the shocking events in the Middle East, the Mediterranean dialogue has probably never been as necessary as it is today, for we face today the great danger of a real clash of civilisations breaking out.
It will do that once our own heads become the places where we wall the cultures off from one another.
That is why our task, in these days and in the future, must be to carry on this dialogue between cultures.
That must be right at the top of our agenda.
What now shocks me is to hear, on the one hand, that it is proposed to establish a foundation for dialogue between cultures, which we welcome, but on the other that the million euro - obviously not a very substantial amount - may well not be made available.
If we sign documents that then lose their value, then when we leave the conference, the conferences will have no value either!
So I ask the Spanish Presidency and the Commission to ensure that the money required will also be made available, so that we can bring this dialogue about.
In these weeks and months, looking forward to the enlargement of the European Union, our gaze is directed principally towards the East, but it is important that we turn our eyes southwards, as the perils there are probably far greater than our problems in Eastern Europe.
If it is the case that the distance from Algeria's capital Algiers to Paris is shorter than that from Paris to Warsaw, then this must make it clear to us in geographical terms that the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East are of great significance to Europeans like us.
We advocate a real partnership for us with the Mediterranean, with the countries of North Africa, and with the Middle East - both political and strategic, economic and financial, social and cultural.
Of course it is important to combat terrorism, and that is a struggle we all support.
We must not, though, reduce our dialogue with the Arab and Islamic world to simply fighting terrorism; it must, rather, be a dialogue that includes all the political, economic, financial and cultural issues.
That is why we have so much more to do in those areas than we have done in the past.
(Applause)
Of course it is important that we should have a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly.
That is what we have called for.
We would, though, be failing in our responsibility as Europeans and as a Parliament if we believed that the creation of such an institution would mean that all our tasks had been completed.
On the contrary, what matters is that we make a reality of our solemn declarations.
After visiting Israel a number of times, I visited many states in the Arab world, and I have the impression that these countries will be able to live in security, freedom and democracy only if we really do manage to create jobs there.
As the Commissioner said, 40 million jobs are needed around the Mediterranean. If they are not created, then the young people will carry on getting into boats, and - as is estimated - 7 000 people from Morocco alone will lose their lives in the attempt to reach Spain or Portugal across the Mediterranean.
That is why development in these countries must be a success.
Above all, we must help with the privatisation of their economy and help give private enterprises a chance to use that to create jobs.
As education is one of the most important prerequisites for human development, and above all for the actualisation of human rights, illiteracy in the states of North Africa must be done away with.
Turning to the Middle East, the seriousness and complexity of this area of concern has meant that these issues have been the subject of in-depth discussions in our group as well, but we start by saying that the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth must come to an end.
If things carry on like that, there will never be peace in the Middle East.
That is why it is so important that the Israeli troops should withdraw now.
At the same time, though, we declare it to be criminal to talk young people into strapping self-detonating devices to themselves in order to kill both themselves and others as well.
That is why we must make demands equally of both sides, of the Israelis as much as of the Palestinians.
We must also not lose sight of the fact that our American friends cannot be peacemakers on their own.
The Americans will of course have to make a major contribution, but, for various reasons, the Palestinians trust us Europeans more than they do our American friends.
This, then, is another reason - Israel is of course one, but this is another - why we have to take on important responsibilities in the region.
Israel does, thank God, also have some very credible representatives.
Yesterday in the Conference of Presidents, we had talks with Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset, and I have to tell you that this conversation gave me renewed hope, because Israel also has political figures who put reconciliation first rather than conflict and military action.
We urge the parties involved - the Palestinians, the Israelis, the world community - onward to redouble their efforts so that peace may at last reign in the Middle East, so that we Europeans may also have a good future with the countries around the Mediterranean, and so that Israel and Palestine may be able to live within secure borders.
That alone will serve the cause of human rights in the Middle East.
(Applause)
Mr President, at a time like this we Europeans who are working together here must remind ourselves of the fundamental elements that unite us, and we must remember that we are working for a united, democratic Europe which combats racism and xenophobia.
Let us remember what President Mitterrand said in his last speech in this House: 'Le nacionalisme c'est la guerre'.
This is an essential principle of our co-existence which we must state loud and clear today.
Furthermore, Mr President, I believe - and I address this to my respected friend, Shimon Peres, who said yesterday in Madrid that he was worried about the growth in anti-Semitism in Europe - that we also all have to be concerned about the demonstrations of intolerance we are seeing on our continent.
All we European democrats, all we European citizens must combat this blight, this cancer which has caused so much misery throughout our history.
(Applause)
Having said this, Mr President, I would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak with Mr Burg, President of the Knesset, today.
We have held a frank and tough debate in our group with our Labour colleague, Mr Burg, and we hope that President Abu AlÃ¡ can come here to speak to us very soon.
Here we have to build bridges towards peace in the Middle East.
Turning to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that, with regard to the Euromed Conference, you know that we share your objectives.
You have said that it was a wonderful idea, but you failed to mention that the idea was not an orphan, but that the last Spanish Presidency started it.
Perhaps you could convey a compliment to Mr Solana, who is not here, and thus treat him as you would like him to treat his successor.
In any event, what the President-in-Office of the Council has said today contains one essential idea: a network of association agreements is being created little by little, the agreement with Algeria has just been signed, and that is very positive.
The problem is - and I also address this to the President-in-Office of the Council - that no notice has been taken of what Parliament said in its last resolution, because we are everybody's friend and we want to be partners and associates of all the countries of the Mediterranean.
That is the fundamental principle and when we have two associates who are in conflict with each other, the least we can say to one associate is: 'Do not keep them in such a stranglehold and let them breathe a bit'.
It is an absolutely fundamental principle. That is why we are asking for the Association Council to be convened.
The Secretary of State, Mr de Miguel, stated very enthusiastically in this House that the Spanish Presidency maintained this principle.
I would like to know if he still maintains this principle.
We also said other things: we are in favour of an intervention force, we are in favour of blocking arms exports.
These are ideas which I believe the Council should develop, because it makes no sense to come to Parliament to complain that our diplomats are being treated badly and then say that all options are open.
We must be a bit more decisive.
I agree with the pertinent observations of the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, when he states clearly that in Jenin there is a human and historic responsibility to shed light on what has happened, and that Mr Ahtisaari is a completely honourable person like the other Members and we cannot allow vetoes, not because they are European, but because we are all subject to the principles and under the aegis of the United Nations.
We are also willing to work on the reconstruction of the Palestinian infrastructure, but we do not understand why it has been destroyed.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that it will not be destroyed again.
Our partners must give us guarantees.
We believe that it is absolutely essential to obey and respect the authority of the United Nations.
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that we are clearly in favour of the Quartet plus the Arab League - and Europe must play an important role here, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - carrying out their work on achieving a Madrid II, which is essential.
And then, if we create a foundation that works, this could be very useful, but now the objectives should focus not on creating new foundations but on achieving a peace conference with European participation, with everybody's participation, which may work.
(Applause)
Mr President, civilisation is no longer present in the Middle East.
I wish to echo Mr Patten's words: Israel is going far beyond the boundaries of what is legitimate in combating terrorism, and the Palestinians are not doing anything like enough to prevent the terrible suicide bombers.
We must bring civilisation back to the area.
We must have the rule of law and not the rule of power, with the former replacing the latter.
That is the principle upon which EU cooperation is based, and something could be learned from this in the Middle East.
The first step must be to give the UN group the opportunity to investigate the atrocities that have taken place there.
It is shocking that Israel's leaders have denied the three high-ranking people access to the area.
We are talking here about a former Finnish president, the former president of the International Red Cross and the former High Commissioner for Refugees.
Israel must not be given special treatment.
It must accept that everyone should be treated equally and that there should be equality under the law.
According to the Speaker of the Knesset, with whom I had the opportunity to speak yesterday, 65% of Israel's population support Sharon but, at the same time, 80% support the Saudi Arabian peace proposal.
That is paradoxical, in my view.
We see peace agreements between Egypt and Israel and between Jordan and Israel.
There is, then, the possibility of peace in the area and, here in Europe, we must therefore preserve optimism and hope.
What can we do?
I believe that, as we called for in our resolution, we must have human rights representatives present to see to it that human rights are respected by both parties.
Again, it is a question of ensuring that the rule of law replaces the rule of power.
Human rights organisations must be there to monitor the situation.
At the same time, we must have an international peace-keeping force put in place in the Palestinian region. It is immaterial whether it be the UN, NATO, the EU or the United States, but it must be there to create peace.
A guarantee must be given to the international community and, at the same time, Israel must not see this as a hostile act.
There is a need for a new peace conference, but there is also a need for new people to take part in this.
As a very highly regarded Jew in Denmark said to me: 'There are two idiots in the region at the moment. One is Sharon, and the other is Arafat'.
The rule of law must return to the area.
That is the message from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. It must be possible for those of us in Europe who are friends of Israel to criticise the Israeli Government, and it must be possible for citizens of Denmark, which is a true and genuine friend of Israel, to criticise without being attacked for being anti-Semitic.
Finally, I wish to assure Commissioner Patten that the ELDR Group will come up with the money when it is asked to do so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do have the vague impression that, on the one hand, we are all right and that, on the other hand, we are all hypocrites.
We say either that Israel is not doing enough or that it is doing too much, which is true.
We say the Palestinians are not doing enough, which is also true.
What about us though? Are we doing enough?
I am asking a very simple question.
At Barcelona, we decided to grant development aid, not 0.7% of GDP, as is needed, nor 1%, which is closer to what is required? instead we decided to grant 0.39%!
And now we are discussing the need to create 40 million jobs in North Africa, and more than 150 million throughout the world.
Are we not hypocrites?
Are we not people who make speeches, but, when it comes to adjusting our budgets, we think of ourselves first and only of others later?
Is that not the truth?
I would therefore like to ask this question: are we doing enough?
Let us now turn to the problem of Israel.
The international community clearly agreed to the State of Israel in the wake of the barbaric events of the Holocaust.
This was both fair and unfair.
The international community spoke out for justice and injustice at the same time.
The time has come to ensure justice is done and to make up for the injustice.
In order to make up for the injustice, the UN must now declare the Palestinian State by formal vote, in the same way as it declared the State of Israel by formal vote.
This would make up for the injustice and ensure justice is done.
We can do this immediately.
Secondly, when considering peace, we must ask who can achieve peace?
We say that the State of Israel is a democratic country.
This is true.
I think that the Palestinian Authority is a social structure in which the democratic process is underway, but there is still much for it to do.
However, we are aware that, in democratic elections, it is not almost the most democratic candidates that receive the greatest number of votes.
The elections in Europe have shown us this.
(Applause)
On this basis, therefore, how can we reassure the Israeli people so that they can finally free themselves of Ariel Sharon?
There is only one solution that will bring about peace and that is for Israel to finally have a government which, once again, desires peace, which is not the case of the current government, which, whilst claiming to provide greater security for Israel, is bringing more death and insecurity upon the Israeli people.
To achieve peace, we must do more.
Avraham Burg asked why we do not guarantee the integrity of Israeli territory by allowing Israel to join NATO, for example?
And why not?
This is one option.
Another option is for NATO to guarantee the integrity of the Palestinian State declared by the UN as soon as possible.
Given the situation, these two States currently are unable to guarantee the security of the other, to guarantee the hope of the other.
It is up to us, the international community, to think how to guarantee the security of both.
Two States, both have peace, both have security.
Are we doing enough?
Have we really finished with all our contradictions?
Let us stop saying, on the one hand, that we are all Israelis, or, on the other hand, that we are all Palestinians.
We are neither Israelis nor Palestinians.
We are Europeans who wish to fight for the right to live in a State that belongs to the Israelis and to the Palestinians.
We are all Israeli-Palestinians or Palestinian-Israelis.
We must grasp this once and for all.
And if we manage to think like that, well, in fact, we can think that if Mr Sharon has committed crimes against humanity, or war crimes - I cannot say and it is not up to me to decide - we now have an international tribunal in The Hague.
From the events in Sabra and Chatila to what has just happened in Jenin, those responsible for the massacres must now be brought before the court of international justice.
(Applause)
Those who welcome this must also welcome the fact that those in Palestine who are responsible for sending young people to massacre Israelis will also be brought before the international tribunal in The Hague.
This applies to both sides.
(Applause)
If we continue to debate the issue in this way, we will be credible.
I shall conclude by saying that I support a UN-led international fact-finding mission to investigate events in Jenin, and I ask all those who, today, are in favour of this, bearing in mind that the State of Israel is a democratic country, why then did they refuse an international fact-finding mission being sent to Algeria, when Algeria is not nearly as democratic as Israel is today.
We have one set of rules but two ways of applying them.
This is what I am saying.
We are hypocrites, we are in favour of something when it suits us, and against it when it does not.
When we have put our own house in order, this is when the world will believe that we are credible.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, yesterday, with 18 other Members of the European Parliament from six different parliamentary groups, I was in the refugee camp in Jenin.
Last night, as we were leaving Jerusalem, when we found out that Ariel Sharon was opposed to a fact-finding mission to the Jenin camp, despite the fact that this mission would be UN-led and made up of such figures as the former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the former High Commissioner for Refugees, we immediately understood the reason behind the new challenge that the Israeli prime minister had placed before the international community.
A third of the town of Jenin, which last month still had a population of 15 000 inhabitants, is in ruins.
Buildings have been blown apart, families gather together in the parts of blocks of flats which are still standing, seeing what remains of their houses collapse around them.
In one part of the camp, a huge area stretched before us, where, just last month, dozens of three- or four-storey blocks of flats stood. All that is left of these are the ends of the metal scaffolding sticking out of the ground.
It is difficult to know exactly how many bodies are buried in the rubble beneath your feet.
A total of 47 bodies have been recovered from the debris so far. This figure will, unfortunately, have to be revised when a proper search can be conducted.
The accounts given by inhabitants, backed up by shreds of evidence, are horrifying.
Many of the soldiers, who surrounded the camp on 2 April, showed no pity for the civilian population, regardless of whether they were children, the elderly, the disabled or the injured.
We heard of some shocking examples of this totally unacceptable attitude when we met the medical staff of the camp hospital who gave detailed accounts of the awful events.
They told us that at 3 p.m. on 4 April, the army surrounded the hospital with 22 tanks.
They said that they were told to stay where they were.
The Israeli army general, himself a doctor, said that if an ambulance moved, they would fire.
They opened fire on the Red Cross, which was trying to gain entry to the camp.
The doctors told us that they were not allowed to save the injured survivors.
A doctor, who asked for news of his mother, was told that she was injured and could not be seen.
She was later found riddled with bullets.
On the same day, the tanks attacked the hospital and destroyed an oxygen reserve.
A doctor told us that to stop an injured man bleeding, whose throat had been pierced by a bullet, the only thing they had to hand was wire.
They begged the soldiers to allow them to treat him.
The doctor shouted that he would lose his arm and the soldier replied that he might as well lose his life.
They took away the injured man and two other people, having waited for six hours in the sun.
We do not know what happened to them.
A young man came to the hospital to collect medicine for his mother.
When he entered the hospital, a tank fired, injuring him.
A nurse tried to pull him inside and was told that if she touched him, she would be killed.
Then a soldier killed the injured man before calling the nurse forward to come and recover his body.
There is a name for this sort of violence. It bears all the hallmarks of war crimes.
This has nothing to do with the legitimate defence of the security of Israel.
This is the reason why Ariel Sharon is now trying to do everything possible to prevent a UN-led committee from finding out the truth.
On the front page of this morning's Jerusalem Post, an Israeli official is reported to have said that 'we are a sovereign country, we do not have to accept this type of command.
It is better for us to suffer a few days of poor publicity than to live with the consequences of a biased report.'
The conclusion that we should reach, in my view, is that the international community must, first and foremost, remind these people of the difference between a sovereign country and an occupied territory. Then, we must make them understand beyond a shadow of a doubt that the age of impunity is over.
There will no longer be just a few difficult days to get through.
Sooner or later, Mr Sharon will have to explain his actions.
Yes, it is time to react much more firmly.
We must react, because if we fail to do so, we risk collusion with the unacceptable.
We must react, it is all the more important to do so because Jenin is not an isolated case.
We must ascertain what happened in all the towns which were re-occupied, particularly Nablus where further atrocities cannot be ignored.
We must react, because impunity encourages arrogance.
Many of our counterparts - Palestinian but also Israeli - including a Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, Mrs Chazan - have told us that they fear a possible attack on Mr Arafat's headquarters.
Furthermore, what consequences will result from the arrest of Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian commander and MP?
The situation in Bethlehem is still unresolved, although discussions are underway.
Ariel Sharon has also announced the stepping-up of military operations in Gaza.
He also stated that he did not contemplate the evacuation of any settlements.
Yes, we must react, without waiting for a response - which is, unfortunately, hardly likely - from the United States, whose President is insulting the Palestinians and is making himself look stupid by depicting Mr Sharon as a man of peace.
To respond and shoulder our responsibilities, must, I think, for us MEPs mean, apart from sending urgently needed relief, making an unwavering commitment to send the peacekeeping force, not to wage war but to contribute to peace.
And this also means bringing to bear as much pressure as possible in the spirit of the resolution that we adopted two weeks ago on the members of the Council who are blocking the necessary revision of EU-Israel relations.
And lastly, we must respond and shoulder our responsibilities, Mr President, as Europe's Parliament, something which directly depends on us.
In this respect, I wish to repeat an appeal made to us by Abu Ala, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
He said that it is in times of crisis that you find out who your friends are and that he will gladly receive an official delegation from Parliament as well as our President.
In my view, the time has come to respond to this invitation and, at the same time, return the visit of Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset.
We shall therefore clearly show that we are not criticising Israel but that we condemn Mr Sharon.
What we want is a lasting peace with justice and dignity, because, for the first time since 1948, this prospect is being held out by all the Arab countries.
It is an historic opportunity which we must not allow to pass by.
It would be to Europe's credit if it made every effort to save this unique hope.
Mr President, in many ways we have become so desensitised to the violence that takes place around the world that what happened in Jenin, what has happened with the suicide bombers in Israel, has seemed to pass us by completely.
The reality is, of course, that we must try and find solutions and work towards them.
But let us remember, first and foremost, that we are dealing with human beings.
Let us put into context the sanctity and the blessedness of each single, individual human life.
When you look at the situation from that reality, finding a solution or a compromise is not difficult, because despite what some speakers have said, it is not love of one's country or nationalism that causes war violence; it is lack of respect, lack of tolerance of differing viewpoints and of diversity within our society.
This is what causes violence and conflict.
The only real solution to the problems in Israel, Palestine and the whole Middle East region, is to bring the combatants together.
You must make peace with your enemy, not with your friend.
There is no point in us saying that we support Israel or Palestine.
There is no point in the Americans saying "we support the Israelis in what they are doing" or "we are calling on them to be more moderate in their response."
Unless the Israelis and the Palestinians sit down together and work out their problems, nothing we do or say can be more effective than what they can achieve themselves.
The difficulty, however lies in bringing them together.
Each side must give up something.
Each side must reduce its own bargaining position or its own ultimate goal, by some degree, because, in a peace process, there can be no outright winners, nor outright losers either.
As rightly as we condemn all forms of violence, as rightly as we condemn the episodes that have taken place in Jenin, in the Church of the Nativity around Bethlehem, and the suicide bombers in the cafes and restaurants in Israel, we must also be willing and aware in order to assist in bringing the people together.
The only way that can be done is by taking them out of the area of conflict and bringing them into dialogue, giving them the support and the strength and the backbone that they need, not only to convince themselves that peace is achievable and that harmony can be achieved between the peoples of Israel and Palestine, but also that they will be given full support from the European Union and each of its Member States to achieve that.
Let us put our hands on our hearts and commit ourselves to peace, to justice, but, most importantly of all, to humanity.
Mr President, in this Parliament and the other European institutions, it is constantly emphasised that the European Union is, and should be, a community of values.
I can fully endorse this view.
Consequently, anti-Semitic statements simply do not belong in our European Community.
The escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, however, has resulted in statements of precisely this kind and has led to an upsurge in completely reprehensible expressions of anti-Semitism.
This is unworthy of Europe, which is, after all, the continent of the Holocaust.
Where in the EU Member States does political decency begin and end?
This is not really a theoretical question in this day and age.
In a recently published Spanish magazine, the name of the Israeli Prime Minister was adorned with a swastika and the face of this government leader was distorted into a pig's head with yarmulke.
I really imagined myself to be back in the days of the notorious Nazi poisoner, Julius Streicher.
During the Euromed Conference in Valencia, the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Shimon Peres, rightly condemned anti-Semitic excesses in Europe.
Prior to the Euromed Summit, the Association Agreement between Algeria and the European Union was signed.
At this ceremony, the Algerian President, Mr Bouteflika, called the Palestinian suicide bombers 'martyrs' and justified their terrorist acts as 'legitimate resistance'.
With this, he immediately undermined the objective of 'fighting terrorism', a prominent section of the Association Agreement.
If the European Union wants to be an acceptable interlocutor for the State of Israel too, then it should resolutely turn its back on all expressions of anti-Semitism and terrorism, now and in future.
I thank both Mr Pique I Camps and Mr Patten for their clear condemnation of terrorism in the Middle East.
I would ask those colleagues who wish to protest to do so in silence and allow the speaker to continue.
Mr President, anyone who has a heart, especially someone who is French, cannot fail to be saddened and deeply moved by what is happening in the Middle East, in these holy places, which were protected by France for many centuries.
It is not just the veritable challenge to God represented by the eruption of violence at the birthplace of Jesus that appears to be pre-apocalyptic.
France and Europe have been absent since they bowed down to the orders of the United States, represented by Mr Solana, the former NATO Secretary-General. This can only be condemned.
Domine dona nobis pacem.
[Grant us peace, Lord].
Thank you, Mr President, in this Parliament one can always choose when one speaks and this is surely not the best time, but in any event, Mr President, I would ask that we return to the debate, since the important thing is Valencia and the situation in the Middle East.
(Interruption by the President)
Thank you, Mr President, I should begin by thanking the Presidency for its support, which ensured that Parliament was represented in Valencia by an unusually large delegation in which there was room for representatives of Parliament's five largest groups.
I believe that the presence of Parliament's delegation was justified insofar as it was able to witness in situ the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency to hold and manage, often against the odds but always with skill, a meeting which was very complicated given the very tense situation in the region in question.
I also believe I can safely say that the presence of Parliament has been useful, that it will have contributed in some way to the success, within the Valencia action plan, of certain proposals which stem from resolutions and parliamentary debates in this House.
Within the political context, the commitment to respect human rights and to cooperate in the fight against terrorism seem to me to be a very important advance, and these are issues which for the first time are clearly laid out in the conclusions of a meeting of this nature.
Equally important are the decisions which imply an insistence on progress with liberalisation in the Mediterranean region and we hope that the Association Agreement with Lebanon will be signed during the current Presidency.
In fact, Mr President, I believe that we should explicitly welcome the presence of the delegation from Libya, a country which clearly plays an important role in the region and throughout the whole continent.
This process of opening up markets must be accompanied by clear Community support through an increase in investments in the region, as Commissioner Patten pointed out, contributing in particular to the development of infrastructures.
Furthermore, we should welcome the statement that there is a need to hold an open and in-depth debate on the organisation of migratory flows and their management on both sides of the Mediterranean.
We in the European Parliament must continue to insist on the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank and meanwhile, we must monitor and demand the support of the institutions involved - and in this regard I am sure we can count on the cooperation of the European Commission - in order to comply with the commitment to double the funds of the EIB in the region until 2006.
The support of the Conference for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly seems to me very significant and I am sure that we will be able to dedicate our work in the next parliamentary forum in Bari in June to debating its launch, which must be a crucial element in the institutionalisation of the Barcelona Process.
And in this same respect, we must applaud the creation of a foundation which promotes dialogue between cultures and civilisations, which my group has repeatedly called for.
In summary, and in spite of the circumstances, I insist that in Valencia we have been able to confirm that the revitalisation of the Barcelona Process, six years after its launch, represents a strategic option for the future for the European Union and for each of its Member States and all of its democratic expressions, because I believe that the attempts at party politics, such as that made by the President of the Socialist Group, have no place here.
It goes without saying that at the moment, the achievement of a stable and secure Mediterranean area is threatened by the situation in the Middle East.
Without saying any more, I would like, Mr President, to end with a double appeal to this House.
Firstly that, despite all the tragedy, we continue with our efforts towards peace, and secondly, increase the internal dialogue in this House in order to ensure that the positions of the European Parliament are the result of a broad consensus, because that is the only way, through unity, that Parliament's voice can be heard and that it can contribute to the peace process we all want to see.
Mr President, I agree that Valencia was a success - and I agree with Mr PiquÃ© that the very fact the meeting took place was an achievement.
I had the honour of being the leader of the European Parliament delegation, and I have to say that the debate at the Conference was fierce and there were some very difficult moments, but the agreement on the action plan and - called for, of course, by the European Parliament - the endorsement of the idea of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Foundation for intercultural dialogue are certainly achievements: on the basis of all this, we can say that, despite the tragic situation in the Middle East, it may well be possible for things to go a little better after Valencia.
In any case, the foundations have been laid for reinvigoration of the cooperation process in the Mediterranean region.
As I see it, Israel has many enemies to defeat before it can live in security and peace.
As has already been said, the greatest of these enemies is certainly anti-Semitism, and we, the European Union and the European Parliament, are at the forefront of the battle against this terrible scourge that has been striking even just recently, here, in our Member States, with shameful attacks.
Another enemy is terrorism, and here too we are right behind Israel in combating all forms of terrorism, including the - appalling - series of suicide attacks.
There is a certain amount of ambiguity regarding this point in certain Arab parties and countries, with people saying that the fight against Nazi Fascism in Europe was a rebellion too.
It is true that it was a rebellion but I would point out - apart from the fact that the comparison is inappropriate - that resistance to Nazi Fascism never involved attacks on civilians: killing civilians is not a form of martyrdom - as has been said - it is terrorism.
Israel's third enemy is certainly the refusal hitherto of many countries to recognise its existence or to maintain appropriate relations with the country.
The Saudi peace plan represents a considerable opportunity from this point of view.
Israel's fourth enemy - I would like to point out - is its - great - mistrust of the European Union.
If ever there may have been some explanation for this mistrust in the past, it is now totally unacceptable; there is absolutely no reason for it.
It is precisely in the European Union and its principles and policies that Israel has a friend and ally: in refusing to accept this friendship and support, the Israeli Government is making a huge mistake.
Lastly, another enemy of Israel - and this is my personal opinion - is the Sharon Government and its policies: both its symbolic and its practical actions.
The Israeli people have a clear responsibility to assess the damage done by Mr Sharon's transformation of the justified fight against terrorism into the disproportionate, excessive use of force, by his dissemination of the idea that it is possible to defeat terrorism and break out of the crisis using military force, by the way he has treated the representative of the Palestinian National Authority as if he were the leader of the terrorists, imprisoning him and then accusing him of doing nothing to stop the terrorism, by his failure to acknowledge the objective of two States and two peoples, by his failure to specify a clear date for withdrawal from all the occupied territories.
These are all positions of the Sharon Government which have placed Israel in difficulties, and they certainly do nothing to further the advent of peace or - consequently - a secure future for Israel.
Finally, Israel's security does not depend on the number of tanks occupying the territory but on the undertaking of the international community, and Madrid - the quartet, as Mr PiquÃ© said - is the most important development.
This new opportunity now exists and must be used to initiate - as Javier Solana said - fresh, brief talks that will lead to a peace that is stable and lasting for both the Palestinian and the Israeli people and for the entire Mediterranean region as well.
We must do something to give the young people of the region the hope, at last, of a future of peace and security.
Mr President, it seems natural to me on beginning an assessment of the Valencia Conference and the situation in the Middle East to point out a particularly significant coincidence; firstly, I would stress the extent to which the Barcelona Process is justified at this point in time, and at the same time acknowledge that the situation in the Middle East is worse than it has been for many years.
As you know, I have often advocated that the Barcelona Process can and must aid the peace process as far as possible and that it is desirable for the Middle East conflict to slow down the Barcelona Process as little as possible.
But it is clear today that the state of affairs is extremely difficult and painful.
The mere fact that the action plan has been adopted in this extremely difficult situation demonstrates the extent to which the justification for the relaunch of the Barcelona Process has become well-founded.
I believe that the approval of the plan covers the objectives we had set.
Firstly because it sets a priority which is repeatedly justified and secondly because it is based on the model action plan, in a concrete form.
The operative approaches taken, as has been said previously, promote the defence of human rights, development, work, dialogue, peace and democracy.
Furthermore, we have done so by means of important instruments such as the Foundation, the decision not to give up on the Bank, an open Bank, a Bank which allows for co-ownership, the creation of a parliamentary assembly which as well as being useful combines two characteristics: firstly, that it is a proposal by Parliament and secondly, that it is a genuinely parliamentary proposal, and it is therefore of particular interest to us.
As has already been said, I am very pleased that Parliament's delegation was present: eight representatives, and I believe that this presence and the consideration that has been given to Parliament's report in Valencia are positive but, Mr President, I will return to the beginning: the conflict and tragedy in the Middle East affect everybody and everything.
The fact that at this point the structures of the Palestinian National Authority have been destroyed, Arafat is confined, there is an occupation, there are serious humanitarian problems, which, at the same time, the Israeli Government is doing absolutely nothing about, and is ignoring every law and every agreement, and that the European Union cannot impose any solution, is an extremely serious situation.
I am naturally very pleased that Mr Solana is in Palestine today and that yesterday and the day before in Valencia both delegations sat down at least for a time at the same table and I believe that the action plan is a crucial contribution to peace but, I insist, the Security Council Resolutions have not been complied with, and this Parliament cannot see how the Council of the European Union can implement the measures that have been adopted.
I am referring to the embargo, to the Association Agreement with Israel, but also to the importance of the United States in relation to this issue, and the extent to which Parliament, and the European Union, is pursuing its efforts.
Mr President, all of this simply prevents us from expressing satisfaction, which for various reasons could be justified.
Mr President, I travelled with Mr Watts and others to Jenin yesterday.
I have been in Palestine dozens of times since 1968 and have seen countless bombed Palestinian houses.
I thought I was immune, but Jenin was worse than I had imagined.
Mr Larsson is entirely right.
Jenin can be called Palestine's ground zero.
Jenin can also be called a new Deir Yassin. It was of course there that Sharon's political forefathers within Irgun murdered as many as 250 Palestinian civilians in April 1948, an act that was the signal for the mass flight of Palestinians that lies behind the whole problem.
It was the intention on that occasion too to cause the Palestinians to flee, and there is a lot to be said for the view that that is also the intention on this occasion.
The aim is to try to frighten the Palestinians into moving and to force them to flee.
Those who still remain are to be put in prison.
Last Sunday, the New York Times reported that a Berlin Wall is to be built around the whole of the West Bank.
This is not to be a wall between Israel and Palestine, but a wall around the whole of the West Bank so that the whole area becomes one large concentration camp.
When we were there the other night, 12 Palestinians were evicted from 12 flats in the middle of the city.
According to the newspaper Ha'aretz, this is a phase in the strategy of surrounding the Old Town with Jewish outposts.
The Jerusalem Post says of Knesset member Ben Elon that 'he promises Jewish continuity in Jerusalem'.
If we were to exchange the word 'Jewish' for 'white', 'Swedish', 'Christian' or any other ethnic or national designation, everyone would shout 'racism!'.
Why are Mr Patten and Mr Pique I Camps so incredibly cautious?
Certainly, they said a lot of good things, but why not look the truth in the eye and realise that the Israeli policy of occupation is the same kind of policy which eventually led to the boycotting of South Africa.
It is the same kind of policy that finally led to the intervention in Kosovo to rescue the Kosovan Albanians.
Israel must therefore be treated in the same way as we treated Milosevic's Serbia and apartheid in South Africa.
The Sharon regime must be isolated.
Happily, there are many who realise this.
One hundred and twenty researchers have published a letter in the Guardian, demanding that Israel be barred from cooperating on research with the EU.
The Swedish and British Medical Associations have proposed that the Israeli Medical Association be excluded from the World Medical Association, and the football organisation FIFA is to adopt a position on Israel's exclusion at the beginning of May.
