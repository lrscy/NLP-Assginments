In addition, it is stated in the annex and the appendix to the Protocol that vessels must comply with the reporting requirements of the previous fishing year in order to obtain a licence.
On this basis, therefore, the amendment is not necessary.
Finally, on amendment 7, I would like to make it clear that, given the previous criticism put forward by both the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament itself of the Commission's financial management of the external fisheries agreements, the Commission finds it hard to understand this amendment, which, in essence, is no different to the mechanism found under the modified Fourth Protocol and does not make it possible for the Commission to manage the under-utilised fishing opportunities in the best possible way.
Therefore, taking the financial responsibility of the Commission into consideration, the Commission cannot accept this amendment.
In conclusion, let me thank Parliament and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur for their constructive engagement on this important fight.
- (NL) Madam President, it is unlikely I will need all of the five minutes allocated to me.
What the Commissioner said in this introductory speech was clear.
The main focus of the report, which is largely the work of my predecessor Mr Maat, is the objective of fisheries policy in general - sustainable fishery, in other words - and, although the term 'sustainable' is clear, its meaning is also obvious from what Mr Borg said a moment ago and from what is stipulated in the agreement and the protocol.
The main objective of the partnership agreement with Greenland is to strengthen relations between it and the EU.
Cooperation based on mutual trust is called for, now more than ever.
After all, we have all known for some time that the fishing industry is facing drastic changes in the next few years.
Due to the reduction in fish stocks and migrating fish stocks - mainly caused by marine warming, cod being a case in point - but also due to the prescribed reduction of catch quotas, the fishing industry will need to operate differently.
This has been made clear to the sector, and the sector, having itself also come to realise this, is increasingly taking appropriate action.
To many fishermen, this represents a drastic change in their business operations.
New business operations must, in future, eventually - by which I mean in the longer term - lead to an improvement in the fish yield, in other words, to sustainable fishing, where the catches from the sea are proportionate to the production and where, moreover, the industry's impact on the marine environment is minimised.
According to the report, fishermen must become managers of the sea, rather than merely hunting fishing grounds and fish stocks.
This requires cooperation, not only mutually, and by that I mean among Member States, but also with partners such as Greenland, particularly with a view to improving the production chain in the longer term.
As rapporteur, I note that the Commission is committed to this, as also is the Commissioner in particular, and I note that our Committee on Fisheries has come to the same conclusion.
I am grateful to my fellow MEPs for the constructive input and would warmly recommend the report for which Mr Maat did most of the groundwork some time ago.
That ends my contribution, and I hope that the report will be adopted at the next plenary meeting.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, am glad to see that there are to be clear rules for the two pillars, the one being the fisheries agreement with Greenland and the other the broader cooperation agreement, and would like to say, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, that we are, of course, concerned about whether European taxpayers' money is being spent as properly as we have to want it to be.
On the one hand, that does mean - and this is where I really do want to give you, Commissioner Borg, a lot of encouragement - that there really do have to be very precise checks on what is caught by the individual vessels, and, on the other, that illegal fishing - on which you have declared war - is avoided come what may.
The Committee on Budgets takes the view that no more money should be forthcoming unless and until these two states of affairs are brought about, for we have to be careful that, under fisheries agreements too, European funds are indeed expended in the spirit of those agreements, in other words, that there must be no illegal fishing going on and that fish stocks must be protected, for if they are not, there will be no more work for the fishermen of the future.
It is for that reason that combining economy and ecology here is a smart move.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, it is a great pleasure finally to be able to debate a fisheries agreement with Greenland that begins to respect the minimum rules of financial transparency and non-discrimination between shipowners and Member States.
We must acknowledge the progress made since previous agreements, including the mid-term modification of 2003, to bring them into line - as the Commissioner has said quite rightly - with the guidelines of the Council of Ministers and the demands of the Court of Auditors and of this Parliament, which focussed essentially on that lack of budgetary transparency, the worst example of which was the institutionalised custom of paying astronomical sums for 'non-existent fisheries' or paper quotas.
In any event, this Agreement still has too much small print and its content is still too different from other agreements.
So that we do not have to relive past situations, therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he can commit himself to guaranteeing that we will never again have to hear about paper quotas or see grotesque situations such as that of the fishing of queen crabs - whose quotas, which had been repeatedly requested by Community shipowners, were returned in the end to Greenland unused and having cost a fortune - and whether fishing opportunities not used by the Member States to which they are allocated will be able to be used by those who request them, as happens in the case of the other agreements.
Having said that, Mr President, it only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Post, who has had the difficult job of continuing with a report that was begun by another Member, Mr Maat, and who has done a tremendous job.
Mr President, since I have a few seconds left, I would like once again to protest about the fact that, in this House, fisheries reports are always debated at the end of a night sitting.
I would ask you, as a Vice-President and a Spaniard, to try to do something to ensure that this does not happen again in the future.
Mrs Fraga, the advantage of debating at this time is that only women Members speak, because it appears that only women work at this time of night, apart from the rapporteur and the President.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in one minute I would simply like to say that I am absolutely delighted with what Commissioner Borg has said about this Agreement.
Just this afternoon I was looking back over my speeches on Greenland in the plenary of Parliament, in 2003 and also in 2002, and I believe that we are getting closer to what we were saying at that time and to what we have been saying since: that we want the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland to be as similar as possible to any other fisheries agreement signed by the Community.
In this regard, I can only express my pleasure at the fact that there is finally now a balanced distribution of its cost between shipowners and the Community budget.
I can only express my delight at the fact that the financial payments have been brought into line with the real fishing opportunities offered by Greenland and, of course, I entirely agree with the Commissioner that Amendment 7 should be rejected, because fleets without quotas must be able to take advantage of fisheries opportunities that are not used.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the ALDE Group welcomes the fisheries partnership agreement with Greenland.
We take this opportunity to repeat our thanks to the home rule government for the very fruitful discussions on this and other issues that a delegation from the group had with them when it visited Greenland last autumn.
We are clear that the agreement is a matter of mutual benefit.
However, we have serious concerns about one aspect of the regulation, namely Article 3(2).
This would allow the Commission to reallocate licences between Member States in cases where fishing opportunities have not been fully taken up.
We understand the Commission's wish to ensure full value for sums expended by the Community, but we do not believe that the same procedure can be used in the case of agreements where access to resources is based on vessels and tonnage.
The Greenland agreement is based on the purchase of quota. It also differs from other agreements in allowing for quota exchanges with Norway, Iceland and the Faeroes for which there is no monetary compensation.
In addition, the parent regulation for the setting of quota entitlements allows only for Member States to exchange quota with other parties.
Article 3(2) is therefore of dubious legality. It also undermines the principle of relative stability.
Amendment 7 offers an alternative mechanism to achieve the optimal use of fishing opportunities and one that does not give rise to such problems.
We hope that the Commission will accept that the grounds for concern are justified and that Parliament will give its support to the amendment.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur.
In Article 3(2) of the proposal the Commission has suggested that, should quotas be under-utilised, the Commission could reallocate Member States' licences to other Member States.
This appears to be legally questionable, a point underlined by the Council's Legal Service in a recent working group.
As uptake is already high, it is also unnecessary and would undermine the principle of relative stability and remove the opportunity for Member States to swap quota with other Member States rather than seeing the Commission reallocate it.
I want to keep the current mechanism, which brought about much higher rates of utilisation and preserved the respective rights and responsibilities of each party.
The concept of relative stability is vital to the Scottish fleet and gives our fishermen the historic rights that they have enjoyed for centuries.
Undermining this amendment puts all of this at risk and ignores the basic differences between southern fisheries agreements, where fishing licences are at stake, and northern agreements, where quota is at stake.
I urge colleagues to support Amendment 7, which upholds the principle of relative stability and historic fishing rights.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, first of all, thank you all for your comments and for your overall support of the Commission's proposal for a revised agreement with Greenland, which is an important part of the network of fisheries partnership agreements that are currently in place.
As I have already stated, the review was necessary for two primary reasons.
First, we needed to ensure value for our money through better and full utilisation of fishing possibilities and second, further to a critical assessment by the Court of Auditors and by this Parliament, the Commission is obliged to inject transparency into the agreement, and we hope to have managed to do so.
I agree that there will be scrupulous checking of the use of the fishing possibilities under this agreement and the use of the funds provided.
I would like to stress that, regarding the financial contribution to be paid under the protocol, the Commission cannot guarantee sound financial management without having the legal basis.
This means, in other words, that there is a need for a transfer mechanism which habilitates the Commission in case of under-utilisation and with due respect to the principle of relative stability and to Article 25 of the basic regulation to transfer in due time unutilised fishing opportunities to ensure their optimum utilisation.
I would also underline that the new mechanism of the agreement provided in Article 3(2) is specifically to make possible maximum utilisation of fishing possibilities and to eliminate 'paper fish'.
On the question of relative stability, raised by Ms Attwooll and by Ms Stihler, the temporary transfer of fishing possibilities from one Member State to another by the Commission is not contrary to the principle of relative stability, which, in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, governs the allocation of fishing possibilities amongst Member States.
Such a transfer will not have any effect on the allocation of fishing possibilities between the Member States in Greenland's waters in the future.
Each year the allocation will be done on the basis of the allocation keys - that is, on the basis of relative stability.
The intention behind Article 3(2) is to ensure the highest possible utilisation without affecting relative stability.
This article exists and is implemented in all other third country agreements with financial compensation.
The only agreement which does not have this article is the current Greenland agreement.
As the new FPA is an agreement with financial compensation and involves a significant amount of public funding, it is crucial that the Commission has the legal means to act.
I would also like to underline that, notwithstanding the improvements that have been achieved under the existing agreement, the rate of utilisation is still not the optimum.
Taking into account the transfers to Norway, it ranks at around 80 %.
If one eliminates the transfers to Norway, it will go down to about 65 % utilisation, and I think that we owe it to the public to achieve much better results than that.
Indeed, this article is subject to discussions in the Council and will be debated in the Council and decided upon, hopefully, on 11 June.
Admittedly, the wording could be clearer and improved upon, maintaining the principle of relative stability while ensuring the highest utilisation of possibilities.
So, we will do our utmost to achieve an agreement in the Council whereby we will polish the wording so that, without prejudicing the principle of relative stability, we will ensure the maximum utilisation of the fishing possibilities under this new agreement.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday 22 May.

(ES) Madam President, I do not intend to speak for five minutes.
I would just like to ask you, given your generosity and knowledge of the region to which I am going to refer, to allow me to speak on a point of order.
Madam President, I wonder whether the President of this Institution could express his support, if he has not already done so, for the Secretary-General of the United Nations', Mr Ban Ki-moon's, call for a cease to hostilities in Lebanon, which are causing huge loss of life.
I believe that this is essential and that it would reflect the feelings of every single Member of this Parliament.
I know that we have a debate on the situation in Palestine this afternoon, but the truth is that, at this very moment, innocent civilians are still dying in Lebanon.
That is what I am asking for.
Your request will be passed on to the President, who will certainly also put it to the Conference of Presidents.

The EU's Aid for trade (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the EU's Aid for Trade.
rapporteur. - Mr President, before turning to the substance of this report, I should like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in the preparation of the report and in particular to thank the Commission's Trade DG and Development DG, which, I am pleased to say, have been very keen to engage with Parliament on this particular issue.
Finally, I should like to thank Pelayo Castro Zuzuarregui, the Parliament official I worked with on this report.
He is leaving us for a year - we hope it is only for a year! - to work for the Spanish Prime Minister.
I have worked with him on this report and a number of other reports; I have found it intellectually stimulating to be in his company and I wish him well.
On the substance, Aid for Trade is a vital tool for linking developing countries to the global economy.
However, I want to stress at the outset that it is not a substitute for the Doha Development Round, but a complement to it.
It is clear that liberalising markets is not sufficient in itself to link developing countries into the global economy.
You just have to look at the experience of the last 40 years: LDCs have seen their share of world trade almost halved from 1.9% to 1%, and this is despite tariff reductions following the Uruguay Round and other tariff reductions and recent efforts such as the European Everything but Arms scheme, which gives duty-free and quota-free access to developing countries.
Therefore, liberalisation, which I would argue is important, clearly of itself has not been enough to engage the developing countries fully in the global economy.
I also do not argue - and I want to make this clear - that Aid for Trade is of itself a panacea.
However, it is quite clear that there is now a growing consensus on the benefits that Aid for Trade might bring.
The WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December 2005 set out an ambitious work programme for Aid for Trade and called for more assistance to help developing countries into the global economy.
This followed Mr Barroso's commitment at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles of GBP 1 billion of European Union money and GBP 1 billion of Member States' money to assist in the Aid for Trade budget line.
While this is all most welcome and sounded quite dramatic at the time of the announcement, we have to realise that the increases are quite modest in substance: the European Union's contribution will increase from a base of around EUR 850 million at the moment to EUR 1 billion, while the Member States - if they deliver - will go from EUR 300 million to a EUR 1 billion.
Last October the General Affairs Council called for a trade strategy to map out how we fulfil these pledges.
My report indicates some of the key points I hope we will see in that strategy.
Firstly, in relation to the scope of Aid for Trade, I want the measurement of the Barroso billion to be against the existing base, which has two categories: one being trade policy and regulation, the other trade development.
However, I welcome the fact that the WTO task force has added three further categories: trade-related adjustment, trade-related infrastructure and productive capacity.
These are vital aspects of the Aid for Trade agenda and I hope additional resources can be found to assist developing countries to deal with such matters as the phasing-out of preferences, reductions in government revenue as a result of tariffs being lowered, or help in adjusting to new competitive pressures due to regionalisation, such as EPAs.
My report argues that Aid for Trade should be demand-led and country-owned.
In this context, the WTO's enhanced integrated framework should become the key diagnostic tool for developing countries, assisting them to identify where Aid for Trade can bring maximum benefits.
Within developing countries we must also ensure that the private sector and civil society are engaged with the process.
While Aid for Trade undoubtedly represents a different approach to general development aid, it should, in my opinion, be based on the same fundamental principles of poverty reduction and sustainable development, and our main point of reference should continue to be the Millennium Development Goals.
I am pleased that much of what we called for in this report was reflected in the Commission's communication published in April, and, perhaps naively, I like to believe that was part of the intense interaction between the Commission's DGs and the European Parliament.
I hope that, when the final joint EU trade strategy is adopted over the summer, it will also be reflected in that strategy document.
I have called in my report today for biannual reporting back to Parliament so that we can check that the Member States and the Commission have delivered on both the quality and quantity of the aid that they are promising.
All institutions so far have shown a willingness to deliver collectively on what I believe is an important strategy that can make an important, if modest, contribution to linking the poorest countries of the world into the global trading system.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, David Martin, for what I regard as a very rich report on aid for trade.
I am very glad that he has referred to the Millennium Development Goals, because they represent our guiding idea and targets.
I agree with him that free trade, whilst a necessary condition for development, is not a magic wand, just as I agree with him that aid for trade, whilst a necessary component of any development strategy, is not a panacea.
I believe that this report expresses a very strong commitment to the aid for trade agenda which I fully share.
I have also read the very useful suggestions and guidance regarding the content of the EU joint aid for trade strategy, for which I am very grateful.
Furthermore, I welcome Parliament's engagement in this process.
Since 2005, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have developed a clear common vision on the main principles of aid for trade.
We all agree that trade can be an important catalyst for growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but the successful integration of developing countries into the world trading system requires more than better market access and strengthening of international rules.
In this respect the General Affairs Council conclusions of 14 and 15 May this year recall the crucial role of aid for trade.
The challenge we are now facing is to put these principles into practice in the context of the EU aid for trade strategy on which the Commission and Member States are jointly working.
This strategy should set out a roadmap to meet our financial pledges, give guidance to improve the effectiveness of our aid, provide a framework on monitoring and reporting of aid for trade, and address the capacity of the Commission and Member States to deliver aid for trade.
The strategy will be ready in October of this year and will then be presented at the WTO aid for trade review, so this Parliament's report is extremely timely.
I would like to address some specific concerns raised in the report, and first of all the issue of the broadening of the scope of aid for trade in relation to the EU financial pledges.
Let me emphasise that the credibility of our pledges is of great importance and make it crystal clear that there will be no changes to the scope of our pledge.
The EUR 2 billion target remains related to the categories of trade policy and trade development.
I attach great importance to the wider aid for trade agenda, which includes building productive capacities beyond trade development, infrastructure and adjustment aid.
For these areas, which are very capital-intensive, we need clear political commitment to do more, but let me stress once again that these efforts will not be counted in relation to our financial pledges.
Regarding the lack of additional resources for EDF funding to ACP countries, we would be happy to do more, but the Commission does not decide on the budget for the EDF. EU Member States do that.
There are limited exceptions only and these are also approved by Member States and dedicated to very specific purposes such as adjustment arising from the sugar reform.
Regarding the integrated framework, I am glad to confirm what I announced in Hong Kong.
The Commission is ready to commit EUR 10 million over the first two years to the multilateral part of the enhanced integrated framework.
In addition to this, the Commission will complement the multilateral window with substantial bilateral and regional funding to implement activities identified through the integrated framework and prioritised by the respective partner governments.
We will also provide human resources and capacity in the field to contribute to a better functioning of the integrated framework.
The issue of adjustment aid is rightly highlighted in the report.
However, I do not agree that the EPA negotiations deserve a special mention in this context.
Adjustment aid is relevant in relation to all external trade shocks. They may result from trade negotiations but could also be a consequence of unilateral reform as in the case of sugar.
In any outcome of the EPA negotiations, the implementation of obligations of ACP partners will be phased in over a very long period and this will facilitate adjustment and identify requirements that we need to help meet.
Finally, we noted your request to look into the IMF's trade integration mechanism as part of the EU aid for trade strategy.
We think that this is more appropriately addressed in cooperation with other international donors, for example as part of the global aid for trade review at WTO level.
Let me once again express my deep appreciation for this Parliament's political support for aid for trade, as well as our willingness to cooperate with the European Parliament to make further progress, and I look forward to doing so.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (NL) Mr President, the Commissioner was right to point out how trade and development cooperation are very much intertwined.
If we want to achieve the Millennium Goals in 2015, aid and trade must - as they indeed can - complement one another.
The developing countries need our help in order to further develop their regional markets, and the rules of origin must be improved as a matter of priority if they are to do that.
Europe and developing partners must join forces in a bid to locate a task force for development, one that can flesh out this construction of local markets.
This task force should be made up of experts in the area of trade and development policy, and could help develop and implement specific trade-enhancing measures.
We should, in this context, think along the lines of alternative tax revenue, the reinforcement of the production capacity and the standardisation and creation of joint external border control.
Human resources, in particular, should be developed further.
Practical support of this kind would be a real help in getting the local markets and mutual trade off the ground.
With regard to the large infrastructure, we thought the EIB was a better bet.
This trade-specific aid should not, however, come out of our own pocket; it should not, then, be funded from the existing development budget.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wants to see new funds made available for this, because otherwise, fewer funds would be available for achieving the Millennium Goals which are, after all, the chief goal to which the Commissioner, a moment ago, pledged 100% commitment, and in that respect we would like to wish him success.

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, for a long time, we supported developing countries in all kinds of areas, except for that of trade.
Partly as a result of that, countries and their economies have largely remained subsidy-dependent.
Economic growth proves indispensable to fight poverty effectively.
The tremendous progress which countries in Asia have made proves this point, Korea being a prime example.
Little by little, we are finding out that trade offers immense opportunities for the economic growth of poor countries.
Invariably, developing countries still lack the right infrastructure to be able to operate within the global market.
This is why these countries need our support, and this is where aid for trade comes in, whose goal is to enable developing countries to function within the international market.
Thanks to aid for trade, countries can, for example, improve the rules in areas that are related to trade, such as taxes and customs, and seeking to improve the road network and waterways, to fight fraud and corruption, and both enhance production capacity and also diversify.
After all, many countries depend on one agricultural product only.
The diversification of products makes for a more stable economy.
It is also necessary to increase capacity in order to train good negotiators.
I welcome this aid for trade initiative, because it offers poor countries aid in order to strengthen their economies and increase their independence.
As has already been mentioned, aid for trade is not a panacea for development, but a necessary tool to allow developing countries to tap into the international market.
I compliment Mr Martin, the rapporteur, on the report and also thank him for his good cooperation, as a result of which the report that is before us is not only sound in terms of content, but will also enjoy widespread support.
Mr President, Commissioner, in order to render this instrument effective, I would ask the Commission for a sound work programme - one that is both feasible and realistic - and for good cooperation with the Member States.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the way he has dealt with this report.
As ever, Mr Martin has been open and willing to engage in compromise with colleagues, producing a report which demonstrates a real consensus in the Committee on International Trade.
That said, having asked the shadow rapporteurs not to bring forward amendments at the plenary stage in order to preserve the spirit of that consensus, it would have been respectful had the PSE Group kept to that agreement.
Nevertheless, I think we have done enough to ensure that the consensus will hold through the plenary.
I was unsurprised by the depth of common ground between us on the crucial issue of the EU's Aid for Trade.
The G8 summit in Gleneagles where the Commission and EU governments both pledged EUR 1 billion in aid to the world's poorest people was preceded by a hugely popular campaign.
Through the Make Poverty History marches, the Live Aid concerts and other efforts, millions of people have made their voices heard.
They are angry, and right to be, about unfair trade rules and highly protected markets that work against those living in poverty and they are passionate about the need for change.
If we are to build on the phenomenal mobilisation of public opinion, the pressure must continue at every level, domestic and international.
The key question is whether there is the political will to drive that change.
Aid for Trade must ensure that the poorest nations have the capacity to benefit from increased trade liberalisation, efficient customs agencies, better infrastructure, tax regimes which do not rely on import and export duties and anti-corruption measures to ensure that the money gets to the people who have earned it.
Ultimately we will be judged not by how much is promised but by how much is delivered.
Pledges on aid are always more easily made than kept.
We are all too familiar with the double counting and relabelling tricks that recycle all pledges as new money.
The EU's Aid for Trade package has a unique role to play to ensure sustainable development, growth and prosperity in the developing world.
As such it must be new money over and above existing commitments and trends and it must not come at the cost of monies already earmarked for other crucial development projects such as health and education.
Whilst Aid for Trade is a long-term driver of development, meeting short-term targets, such as the Millennium Development Goals, must remain central to the EU's international development policy.
There too we must do better: some USD 50 billion more a year rather than the current commitment over a five-year period.
If sustained political will is required to deliver Aid for Trade, then political courage is needed to ensure we deliver the MDGs in sub-Saharan Africa.
Aid works best when it is delivering a common set of objectives agreed between donor and recipient.
We have to concentrate on finding solutions which best fit a country's needs. That means responding to the demands of civil society and the private sector.
As a Parliament, we have already thrown our weight behind the fair trade movement.
If we are to help reduce the poverty in which they live, we need mechanisms to ensure the aid reaches the people who need it most.
This report provides the Commission with some clear and reasonable guidelines to that end.
It is up to you, Commissioner, to deliver on them.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we, too, wish to thank Mr Martin for the good work he has done, and I would like to begin with a positive political development.
It is good that the 'General Affairs and Foreign Relations' Council, which is responsible, acknowledged on 15 May that reductions in tariffs made enormous inroads into the state revenues of many developing countries, and it is good that it stressed the need for, and necessity of, compensation payments to address this.
Had it not done so, we would run the risk of our trade policy possibly bringing about the rapid collapse of any development policy whatever in the countries affected.
It is absolutely vital that we do something about this, but for that we need additional funding that cannot be set against the development aid funds if we want to achieve the millennium development goals.
What has to be avoided is the occurrence of a sort of 'displacement effect', with a move away from the combating of poverty and from the millennium goals campaign towards promoting an orientation towards exports.
That would be a misconceived tendency, one that could be triggered by the injection of these two billion in the absence of deliberate political action on our part to counteract it.
In terms of development strategy, the stabilisation of local markets takes, as a rule, precedence over the preparation of the most vulnerable and poorest countries to become exporters; what matters is that our policy be consistent.
'Aid for Trade' must not be allowed to relativise the fight against poverty, and so it follows that additional funds are needed in order to finance it.
It is in this regard that I would be really interested to know from which Budget lines the money is being taken.
Moreover, 'aid for trade' must not be allowed to play a part in undermining the stabilisation of local markets, which must be at the heart of any development strategy.
That is the Commission's task in putting into practice the wide-ranging concept of 'aid for trade' and I appeal to you, Commissioner, to pay particular attention to these aspects.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, allow me to pose the following question. Why should there be Aid for Trade?
The answer is because trade has an important role to play.
I should now like to make a few observations.
For centuries, sound trade has brought people together without detriment to their identity, values or social and political life.
Europe needs to find equal partners amongst the major players on this stage and most especially amongst the lesser ones.
Trade must be governed by clear rules that allow both sides to benefit.
'Free and Fair Trade' is a slogan worth adopting.
Fair trade cannot take place without the relevant infrastructure, and without agreements such as those reached in the framework of the WTO for example.
Relevant guidelines applicable to the entire producer-consumer chain must be developed.
It must be borne in mind that aiding trade also involves supporting our own threatened sectors such as sugar and soft fruit.
In addition, support should be provided for cross-border exchanges between the Union and its neighbours, for example Ukraine.
At the global level, the situation concerning exchanges is so diverse that standardisation is required.
All citizens must be informed about these standards too.
An aid programme should therefore be developed drawing on Europe's historical experience and the wealth of Europe's supply of goods, services and know-how.
Funding for this programme should also be made available. Funding need not be on a large scale, but it is essential.
By way of analogy I should like to point out that sound trade can do more than simply raise the standard of living, especially in poor countries, which is the focus of this.
Sound trade can also lead to more peaceful solutions to global conflicts.
As I conclude, I would like to mention an anecdotal assessment, namely that Ryanair does more towards bringing about a common Europe than certain European institutions, because it brings people closer together.
Similarly, 'Fair and Free Trade' does more towards bringing about integration and well being for the people of this Earth than dubious political decisions, especially in poor countries.
Trade is what makes the world go round.
Europe should promote the kind of trade described, and it is the Commissioner's duty to ensure that it does so.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it will not have escaped anyone in this Chamber and in the economic and productive world of the European Union that an increase in Aid for Trade may help develop the market in a freer and at the same time fairer and better controlled way.
If the EU wishes to remain the world's top economic power and the area of greatest freedom and least social inequality, while also benefiting from the boost it has always received and continues to receive from Parliament, it must not only help to develop the ability of developing countries to promote foreign trade despite their unfortunately considerable loss of competitiveness on world markets, but it must also increase Aid for Trade in the knowledge that liberalisation and aid are not mutually exclusive initiatives.
In this context, the not insignificant sum of EUR 2 billion is still not enough.
We have to clarify the Aid for Trade concept itself by taking on board the conclusions of the WTO Aid for Trade Task Force on fundable projects and by integrating development policies and actual trade policies as much as possible, as envisaged in the integrated framework, not least with a view to reducing poverty.
(PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said within the European Union about a balanced multilateral system of trade and about enabling developing countries to become involved in trade and benefit as a result.
This concern has not, however, been accompanied by an improvement in the situation of the least developed countries. The opposite is the case.
Over the last 40 years the participation of these countries in world trade has almost halved, falling from 1.9% to 1%.
It is also the case that powerful large chain stores have caused the demise of small traders and that income has been transferred away from less developed countries.
That much is abundantly obvious. These facts indicate clearly that globalisation and liberalisation of trade serves to concentrate capital in stronger countries and to increase poverty in less developed ones.
We have noted a new approach to trade by the European Union in recent years.
This approach is characterised by a desire to export industrial products at the expense of agricultural ones.
It is gradually leading to a loss of food security for the Union in general and for the new Member States in particular.
It is therefore essential for the European Union to adopt a new approach to international trade and for work on the implementation of national strategies for trade development to be undertaken.
(EL) Mr President, no one doubts that aid for trade is a particularly important initiative.
It helps to bring about the more complete and effective integration of developing countries, especially the less developed countries, into the multilateral trade system.
As we have heard, trade is not a panacea for development.
However, it can strengthen the economic and general development of recipient states.
The special and differentiated treatment of developing countries within the framework of the WTO is necessary to a degree, especially as regards the less developed countries.
It should, nonetheless, be pointed out that their assumption of multilateral commitments and their compliance with WTO rules are an incentive for reform which will turn out to be to the benefit of the developing countries themselves.
The gradual opening up of their markets and an outward-looking economic and trade policy help to strengthen their competitiveness, allowing the transfer of technology and know-how.
The developing countries do, however, appear to be extremely reticent at multilateral negotiations to heed calls for them to open up their markets.
For this reason, aid for trade is of decisive importance in encouraging these countries to respond to new obligations and to apply multilateral trade rules, to mitigate the cost of their adapting to reforms and to integrate trade into their development policies more effectively.
It goes without saying that aid for trade must be accompanied by appropriate internal policies in developing countries, so that they maximise the result.
The European Union is being called upon to play a leading role in this endeavour, in order to formulate an effective, cohesive and targeted aid for trade agenda.
To close, I should like to congratulate Commissioner Mandelson for supporting this initiative and for linking the external aspects of competitiveness with internal initiatives for the benefit of the competitiveness of the European economy, which was the subject of our previous debate.
(LT) First I would like to congratulate the Member States and the Commission for making a commitment to increase the funds allocated for assistance to business to two billion euros by the year 2010.
This is a serious commitment, and in implementing it a great deal of coordination will be required.
In order to achieve this goal, a common European Union strategy is essential, which will have to set out the ways in which the stated goal is going to be achieved.
I also congratulate the Committee on International Trade for its timely report in which the committee presented Parliament's views regarding the complex issue of assistance to business.
I support the proposal that the Commission present reports to Parliament twice every year.
These reports should assess progress in the EU's granting of assistance to business.
Although the commitments I mentioned were made by various countries according to the traditional definition of assistance to business handed down by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in future there is a need to look more closely at the WTO's conclusions and the suggested widening of this definition to include 'business infrastructure' and 'creative productivity possibilities'; in other words, to do everything possible to ensure that assistance to business is all-encompassing, more flexible and more effective.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is today displaying ambitious commitments where development is concerned.
I welcome this because there is an urgent need to help developing countries to reduce poverty, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to benefit from sustainable economic growth.
Let us therefore hope and pray that these objectives are translated into concrete and effective action.
In this connection, we can only welcome the commitments made to increase aid for trade.
I should like to highlight some points that justify the essential nature of this instrument.
This instrument meets, firstly, the requirement for consistency, which must guide the EU's external actions: by interlinking the various areas of its external action, the European Union corresponds to two principles, those of producing better legislation and of increasing the effectiveness of its aid.
This instrument also deals with the reality of the multilateral trade system by helping developing countries and the least advanced countries to benefit from the advantages resulting from market access.
Finally, this instrument helps implement trade agreements.
One might mention at this point the WTO agreements or the economic partnership agreements.
Aid for trade thus helps to make international trade an instrument for reducing poverty through economic development.
Finally, if it is to be effective, aid for trade must meet several urgent needs: it must be accompanied by practical commitments, not least those promoting technical assistance; its implementation must be controlled and monitored and it must strengthen local ownership and results-focused management.
This is crucial if aid for trade is to enable developing countries to benefit from the advantages resulting from the multilateral trade system and to provide themselves with the means actually to increase their capacities in the trade arena.
Let us therefore call on all the parties involved not to relax their efforts, so that aid for trade is able to keep its promises.
Mr President, I would like to welcome and commend all those who have spoken on this subject this morning.
I do not find myself in disagreement with anyone who has contributed.
I agree, for example, with Mr Papastamkos, who said it is very important that, when we are pursuing trade and reform policies of our own, we are able to put in place flanking measures properly supported with adequate funds which enable developing countries to adjust to those reforms too.
I agree with Mrs SaÃ¯fi that this has to be a results-driven process, which is why I attach importance to proper reporting as part of an effective aid-for-trade monitoring and reporting pillar, both in respect of what we do in the EU and in relation to the WTO.
If I might, though, just make two responses: first of all, to those who have questioned whether there is any question of double counting, recycling of money, robbing Peter to pay Paul or robbing Paul to pay Peter (which might be preferable!) - in fact neither is happening.
Aid for trade, in our view, should never imply less aid for other sectors.
The increases in aid for trade for both the Commission and the Member States are less than the overall ODA budget increases.
Therefore, there is no need to reallocate resources from other sectors to meet the aid-for-trade pledges.
Secondly, one or two Members raised the issue of fair trade.
In my view, our strategy should confirm full support for any activity which involves the private sector - especially SMEs - and civil society to ensure that aid for trade facilitates the creation and growth of enterprises to compete in international markets, for example, voluntary initiatives such as fair trade, eco-labels and comparable corporate scheme standards.
The strategy should also address related issues of labour market and social adjustment and the ILO's core labour standards.
Last of all, I think that Max van den Berg's point about rules of origin, their improvement and simplification is very important.
It is something on which I have focused and not made, along with my colleagues in the Commission, as much progress to date as I would like to have done, and we need to add speed.
Lastly, I think Mr Schmidt made some important points about aid for trade and its possible impact on local markets, and I shall certainly reflect on those.
But I would like to thank David Martin once again for what has been an excellent and welcome report.
Commissioner Mandelson's speech ends the debate.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
The economic partnership agreements (debate)
The next item is the report by Robert Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on Economic Partnership Agreements.
rapporteur. - Mr President, this is a particularly important report.
The Commission, including the Commissioner himself, and I have worked very closely on it.
This report highlights the complexity of establishing a forward programme for trade relations between the EU and the ACP, two very different and largely unequal groups which share a common goal to strengthen trade as a means of real development.
Idealistic as this may sound, I have received a great deal of support from both the Commission and the representatives of the ACP regions and, despite the many concerns expressed by NGOs and political groups, they and I, and I am sure the Commission, remain optimistic.
EPAs have moved very slowly because of the conflicting ideas on a number of issues including regional integration, identification of sensitive products and preparing concrete and detailed proposals for EPA-related support.
The ACP has been asked to do a great deal and too often the institutional infrastructure and lack of capacity has raised questions as to whether these proposals will contribute to their development in a manner that they want.
The January 2008 deadline is obviously what makes this year so crucial for EPAs.
Time is running out.
Negotiators must press on to reach a mutually beneficial settlement on EPAs that will help ACP countries develop and support international trade relations.
In the event that some regions need more time, I believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that ACP exports to the EU should not be harmed.
This should be the objective, not discussing the feasibility of another WTO waiver, although I appreciate that the Commission is continuing to focus on reaching the deadlines.
However, I am anxious to know what provisions have been outlined for these regions which find themselves without an agreement.
My report makes a number of recommendations: simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin, full duty-free, quota-free market access for the ACP, workable safeguards, dispute settlement and monitoring mechanisms with transparent provisions and a real power to act in the event of changes caused by EPAs having a harmful effect on sectors of ACP economies.
These are the positive aspects and need to be correctly framed in negotiations.
We need to know how these mechanisms will work and to build trust and ensure that Europe will be as keen to help implement these mechanisms as the ACP countries.
We have recognised that, if EPAs are to be successfully concluded, there must be more ACP engagement than has been demonstrated throughout these negotiations.
Only a true partnership will ensure these agreements are beneficial to all parties.
The official EPA review due to be completed last December failed to provide a full and comprehensive report of the status of negotiations.
This is far from encouraging and I am curious as to what precedence this sets in the actual signing of the agreements.
It is clear that additional resources will be needed to cope with the effects of change ushered in by EPAs.
The scaling-up of trade facilitation, technical assistance and support to help ACP producers meet EU standards must be sufficiently extensive to offset losses from tariff revenues and help ACP countries take advantage of market access.
In the first instance this requires greater efforts to ensure that funds already promised are spent in a timely and effective manner.
The EU must be accountable for all of its development assistance and, together with the ACP, must set clear goals that boost ACP competitiveness and growth.
EPAs have an essential role to play as instruments for development and, appropriately designed, they represent an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations, promote economic diversification and regional integration, and reduce poverty in ACP countries.
I mentioned in my speech that the EU must be accountable.
This is taxpayers' money, and democratic accountability is of concern to all of us and is essential.
We have failed in many respects to help ACP countries; now I believe we have a real chance to do something that will really make a mark, provided we have the goodwill of all of them.
Unfortunately I have to leave now to go back for personal reasons.
I have worked very closely with the Commission and the Commissioner.
I think we have had a very good understanding and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them.
I hope that we can continue to work in that manner.
Mr President, I regard this report as very constructive, very realistic and very welcome.
As I said earlier this year in the Committee on International Trade, Mr Sturdy's is a contribution which helps us look afresh at the challenges we face in these difficult, time-pressured talks.
Yes, the EPA negotiations have moved slowly - more slowly, frankly, than anyone could possibly justify.
But at the same time we have to recognise that these agreements are new, innovative and ambitious.
When change is involved, people inevitably are uncertain and, therefore, want to tread carefully.
We need to balance our need to complete these negotiations on time with our need to respect others' uncertainties.
I fully agree with the starting point of the report, that appropriately designed EPAs are an opportunity to revitalise ACP-EU trading relations.
In fact, I would say that they are our only real opportunity to stop the further slide of ACP trade into the commodity dependence and decreasing diversification that have typified ACP trade over the last quarter of a century.
We looked for alternatives, and there is no shortage of suggestions and ideas.
None provides the legally secure trade regime or links to development that EPAs do.
None tackles the divisions between ACP countries in trade regimes that prevent regional markets emerging and lock countries into a North/South dependency.
So I am pleased that the report recognises the good faith and ambitious approach that we have taken.
At the same time it recognises that trade is not the panacea for development.
Only domestically driven policy reform built on firm foundations of good governance and an enabling environment for business and investment can secure the economic growth and development which the ACP countries seek.
But I also agree that trade is critical to support and build on this reform and, in so doing, deliver inclusive growth and jobs.
That is why I am determined that we will take the opportunity that EPAs present to us.
The development dimension of EPAs is in using market access, not merely granting it.
It is investment finance, not merely development aid.
This needs new rules fit for a globalised world, and this is why I am so keen that EPAs address issues such as competition policy, public procurement and trade facilitation.
But we know our partners' limits and will work with them to phase in change and to identify regionally specific needs and solutions.
No one is talking about immediate overnight change or imposing rules.
But we will keep talking.
To turn away in the face of challenge would be to neglect our duty to give the ACP the economic future they deserve.
We want to secure sustainable development, not unsustainable poverty.
The Sturdy report calls for full duty-free, quota-free market access into Europe, and this is what we propose.
The Commission's market access offer was made in April and proposes full access for all products with transitions for sugar and rice to protect the managed markets that the ACP rely on.
This delivers on our promises to take the greatest commitments on market access and hand the full flexibility of WTO rules on exclusions and implementation over to the ACP themselves.
Everyone will be aware of the importance the ACP rightly attach to additional development support in this negotiation.
This is a point on which Robert Sturdy sets out some very useful proposals.
Funding is important.
We must help the ACP grasp the new trading opportunities that EPAs will provide.
The EPAs will not fail for lack of financial assistance - that I can guarantee.
As part of this, we have suggested that EPA regional funds be established by each of the negotiating regions in order to build a tailor-made instrument, in line with international standards but owned and run by the ACP with ease of use.
These funds, which would also be available to channel the support of other donors, could include institutional support to ensure that the capacity to implement the EPAs is there: private sector competitiveness - from access to finance to industrial retooling, to improving SPS standards; and helping out financially in those countries which face a fiscal challenge with the lowering of tariff barriers as revenues are shifted from governments to consumers.
So our ambition is clear: to build, through EPAs, a trade and development instrument which galvanises investment flows, internal demand, private sector activity and job creation and, in so doing, builds a sustainable fiscal base for ACP governments to operate, to provide basic services and to determine their own economic future free of WTO waivers, concessions and constraints.
Let me finish on a broader political point.
There has been criticism, including from Members of this Parliament, of these negotiations, and concerns, particularly from our ACP partners, about the content, in some respects, of the negotiations.
But we are now making headway in these negotiations.
There is a positive dynamic to the negotiations.
We have the real prospect of cementing a deep partnership for development between the EU and the ACP.
The consequences of failure would be highly damaging to the EU and to the goal of balanced, dynamic growth in the ACP.
That is why I welcome this report and Parliament's support in delivering these agreements.
I would like to express again my appreciation for the argument and the proposals and recommendations contained in it.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a preliminary point, I should like to excuse my fellow Member, Mrs Sudre, who has been held up by a meeting with our new Prime Minister of France, Mr Fillon.
She would have liked to have spoken on the subject of the particular circumstances of the Union's outermost regions, which are particularly dear to her heart.
I should also like to congratulate my friend, Mr Sturdy, on the scope and quality of his work in this excellent own-initiative report.
Our Union must conclude economic partnership agreements, or EPAs, with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, or the ACP countries. These agreements are designed to strengthen economic growth, regional integration and the fight against poverty in six of the world's major disadvantaged areas.
In line with the spirit of Cotonou, we need constantly to point out that the EPAs must not amount to mere free trade agreements, under the World Trade Organisation, but must represent a genuine partnership, making it possible to develop a new intervention framework that is conducive to the development of the ACP countries' economies and, therefore, to consolidate peace, not least on the African continent, with a regional integration dynamic.
Due to their geographical location, near many ACP countries, the overseas communities, whether they belong to the EU or not, must be at the heart of these preferential and reciprocal agreements.
It is imperative that the particular circumstances of the outermost regions and overseas countries and territories be taken into account as part of these negotiations, on the basis of Article 299(2) and (3) of the Treaty.
The outermost regions and overseas countries and territories must be involved as far upstream as possible in the negotiations so that market access differentiations can be considered and their respective support arrangements coordinated, for the purposes of integrating them more into their regional environments.
It is in this connection, ladies and gentlemen, that I encourage you to support the amendments co-signed by Mrs Sudre and Mr Sturdy, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and designed to strike an intelligent balance between the regional integration of these outermost territories and the historical and geopolitical links uniting them with Europe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mr Sturdy.
Everyone agrees that trade can help fight poverty.
Unfortunately, the trade benefits for ACP countries, for which the Cotonou Agreement provides, have little effect in practice; nor, in fact, does the 'Everything but Arms' initiative.
This is all attributable to the deficient trade situation in the developing regions in question, the high, standardised European import requirements and the rules of origin that have, to this day, not been reviewed or tailored to practical situations.
It is because of these problems that the ACP countries are not operating within the world economy; if anything, they are moving away from it.
For this reason, the debate on the economic partnership agreements should not, in the first instance, be about acquiring free-trade agreements, but rather about concluding development contracts.
What should be central in these development contracts is trade development within the own region, including the institutional framework and personal means that are difficult to establish, along with the Millennium Goals.
Not until much later can we consider opening the markets for the EU.
This is, as we see it, where the problem lies.
Everything seems to be geared towards 1 January 2008, which is, of course, logical, because the deadline expires on 1 January, but meanwhile, the flexibility now on offer in the negotiations is, in actual fact, insufficiently tied to development indicators and much more to vague time indications.
The idea of 25 years has been floated, although this has not been mentioned explicitly anywhere.
Is the Commission prepared to link EU access to the markets in question to a development benchmark, so that we are certain that the local markets over there are ready for this?
With regard to the regions that ultimately decide against a European Partnership Agreement (EPA) - and we would like to reiterate the negotiations on this subject enjoy our unqualified support - but if it is decided not to conclude an EPA, is the Commission also prepared to make a point of accepting the alternative of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+)?
We are familiar with the technical discussion, but as we see it, disregarding bananas and sugar - as these have been taken out of the equation in practice, not least by us - this is very much a real alternative to the current trade conditions.
If the EU is prepared to commit to a rapid reform of the rules of origin - and this is something which the Commissioner confirmed in a different debate a moment ago - then this could well mean that we can make some headway in this respect.
Turning to the Singapore themes, I think it is wonderful, of course, if regions would like to do something with these at any time.
There is nothing wrong with that, although we should not impose anything.
It is of the utmost importance to meet the deadline of the EPA negotiations, as I pointed out before.
This is why we actually want to focus on development contract thinking, in which respect the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has advised that we should give ourselves room during the negotiations and time, content and money, and conclude a negotiation contract in the true sense of the word.
If the EPA were to turn out this way, this would be fantastic; if not, it is simply not a good offer.
I would also urge you to bring the GSP+ to the negotiating table as a real alternative, and talk about it openly in the debates.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the approach he has taken.
Mr Sturdy's approach in taking the Barbados resolution of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly as a starting point ensured that this report moved forward from a place of compromise.
As a whole, my group was satisfied with the tone and balance of the point, which is why we have not tabled any amendments.
However, we remain concerned about a key contradiction within the report and within the conduct of the negotiations themselves: on the one hand, we urge negotiators to intensify efforts to complete the negotiations before the end of this year; yet, on the other hand, we call on the Commission not to exert undue pressure on the ACP countries.
Both are accurate statements, but surely there can be nothing more pressing than a ticking clock with no acceptable deal on the table and no apparently suitable alternatives coming forward.
The Commissioner is familiar with the difficulties that deadlines present.
We are not only dealing with the EPAs negotiations, but in the background we have timetables for regional integration and, of course, the troubled Doha Round.
The fact that we do not have a WTO agreement has made these negotiations even harder, as the ACP cannot yet predict what they will get - if anything - out of Doha.
Through all this, however, runs the thread of development.
To make increased liberalisation a driver of poverty reduction and economic growth, the European Union must integrate its trade and development policies, and nowhere is that more important than with the ACP and EPAs.
The EU is being accused of putting the year deadline before development.
To counter such accusations I urge the Commissioner to demonstrate the Commission's flexibility and commitment to the ACP's concerns by undertaking a genuine exploration of development-oriented alternatives to the EPAs and, at the very least, if we do not have a workable agreement by the deadline, according to Cotonou we must provide at least equivalent market access to the ACP on 1 January 2008.
The European Union has the resources to undertake such an exercise.
Meanwhile the ACP is struggling on a financial and technical basis.
We have already spent a great deal of time discussing the EU's aid for trade this morning and the two rapporteurs worked closely to ensure that these two reports went hand in hand.
The EU's aid for trade programme is crucial to enabling the least-developed countries in the ACP to maximise on the benefits of increased liberalisation, and the Council has already confirmed that a substantial share of the increased trade-related assistance will be devoted to the ACP countries.
The ACP will continue to require substantial development assistance to address their supply-side constraints to trade beyond the next EDF.
I would like to see the Commission and the Member States work towards significantly increasing the amount of aid for trade available as demand from ACP States increases through implementation of the EPAs.
We must, however, acknowledge the moral difficulties of a major donor sitting across the negotiating table from a key recipient of aid for trade.
The Commission must not manipulate the prospect of aid by linking future development assistance to concessions made by the ACP in EPAs.
Aid, by its very definition, can be used as a carrot, but it must under no circumstances be used as a stick if the EPAs are not concluded before the end of the 2007 deadline.
Aid for trade works best when it is delivering a common set of objectives between donor and recipient.
With the Committee on International Trade and Parliament's delegation to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the Commissioner has a breadth and depth of parliamentarians with the expertise and willingness to engage with him on EPAs.
As the clock keeps ticking, I urge the Commissioner to work with them to find a development-oriented solution to EPAs which ultimately fits in with the needs of the ACP.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sturdy's report on Economic Partnership Agreements provides an accurate account of the current state of affairs.
Despite strong European Union commitment, the present situation is not good.
Cooperation based on agreements that fail to take account of the global market and of the principles laid down by the WTO does not bode well for partnership agreements within the ACP framework.
European Union aid to these countries should aim first and foremost to stimulate production that will not represent competition for EU producers.
It must not, therefore, create a conflict of interests.
The products concerned may be sold on the European Union's market on the basis of multi-annual agreements.
I could mention mining products and biofuels by way of an example.
In addition to humanitarian aid, the main priority for these countries is assistance in job creation.
Partnership agreements with ACP countries should be in line with the European Union's economic strategy.
New agreements should be based on principles laid down by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the ACP.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, negotiations are now entering upon a crucial stage, and they must not be allowed to fail, but it is also clear from what we are constantly told that the great pressure of time is proving too much for the weaker ones among our partner countries.
That is why we need a consciously more flexible way of planning trade beyond the first day of January 2008.
We should learn from the errors of the Doha round, when there was a date set in stone that was then overshot.
Given the intermediate results that have been achieved, it will not be difficult to explain that to the World Trade Organisation.
There has been talk here of alternatives such as the extension and further development of GSP+, and that might be one possible way ahead, one for which we have to prepare ourselves, for it must not come as a surprise.
We should stop overburdening the negotiations with the rules for investments in the services sector, which makes them all the more difficult and, far from helping us to conclude them speedily, prevents us from concentrating on the essentials.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement negotiations as conducted by the Commission with the backing of the Council are threatening the economic and food sovereignty of the ACP countries and jeopardising any remaining possibility for these countries to consolidate their own productive sectors by increasing the added value of their own production; they are thus leaving them open to the risk of further deindustrialisation.
The social and environmental impacts of indiscriminately opening up local markets to international investment, which is mainly directed towards natural resources and the produce of the land itself, would exacerbate the lack of any effective economic return for the people of those countries.
The only ones to benefit would be the large European multinationals.
On chapters such as the so-called Singapore issues, the trade in services and intellectual property rights, we will, moreover, have even stricter rules than those set by the WTO itself.
A WTO Plus agreement will push the people of Africa even further into the abyss of poverty.
The stability of entire rural communities is at risk in Africa, as are thousands of manufacturing jobs.
Without work, there is nothing left for people to do but migrate, trying their luck on those dilapidated boats that have again invaded Europe's Mediterranean shores in recent days.
As the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we are calling for the EPA negotiations as they have been set up to be closed and for a new start to be made on different bases, focusing on social justice, solidarity and the self-development of peoples.
In our view it is inconceivable and illogical that, while the Doha Round talks are stuck, the Commission should not want the EPA negotiations to allow for any departure from the negotiating deadline.
The whole European Union should instead do all it can within the WTO to gain recognition for a transitional regime, under which a trade preference system benefiting the ACP countries will be maintained until such time as a new agreement is finalised.
For all these reasons, and for others that I have no time to mention here, my group has decided to vote against the Sturdy report.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
I take the floor also in my capacity as a member of the permanent delegation of the European Union to the ACP countries.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement, and I endorse its main points. Special thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr Sturdy.
This is a very good and extensive report, but it contains 53 detailed points. It almost amounts to negotiating instructions.
I would like to highlight the professionalism of the work undertaken, but I am concerned about a certain political aspect that ought to emerge from a European Parliament report.
I should like to refer to what I believe to be the five most important points regarding the effect we, the European Parliament, can have on the negotiations.
Firstly, it is essential to clarify the sustainable development aspect of Economic Partnership Agreements. It is not currently all that clear to the countries we are negotiating with.
Secondly, it must be understood that opening the market in the framework of the Economic Partnership Agreements, simply opening up the market, does not by itself improve competitiveness.
It is very important for our partners in the ACP countries to understand this too.
Thirdly, we should find ways to encourage reforms in those countries, by way of preferences, incentives, and also through scientific and educational aid and personal exchanges.
This is all about general civilisational development, which is sometimes even more important than opening the market to products.
Fourthly, we should protect certain specific and sensitive sectors such as agriculture in those countries.
We must provide protection for particular social groups. Some of these, for example women, may also be threatened in the framework of individual provisions.
Special preferences must be arranged for medicines and health care related issues.
My fifth and last point is that integration and regional cooperation out there, on the ground, is fundamental.
Our European Union also developed primarily on the basis of mutual cooperation and we must emphasise that.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation of the economic partnership agreements between the Commission and the ACP countries is giving rise to the deepest concerns among these countries and is taking place in a climate that is incompatible with the historical partnership relationship that unites us.
Europe is perceived as seeking to impose at any price free trade areas on countries that are among the poorest in the world, and under its conditions.
The relationship of trust with the ACP countries is now at stake.
We must re-open the negotiations on new foundations so as to address the concerns raised in the ACP countries concerning the impact of the EPAs on the future of their economies, many sectors of which could not withstand the lowering of customs protections or a situation in which they face uncontrolled competition with the European economy.
The Commission must revert to the principles laid down in the Cotonou Agreement.
The aim is development, not reciprocity when it comes to opening up markets.
Such a principle would be at odds with the aim set, given the inequalities in development that will not disappear in 20 years' time.
Thus, these countries must have the opportunity to choose between an EPA and another form of preferential agreement.
We must offer those who have not signed an EPA by the end of 2007 market access that is at least equal to the preferences from which they benefit now, with none of them having to find themselves back in a more unfavourable situation at the end of the agreements.
Furthermore, services and the Singapore issues should not be included in the negotiations.
The only obligation in terms of compliance with the WTO rules concerns the preferences granted for trade in goods.
These issues were taken out of the negotiations within the WTO, at the request of the developing countries.
They should not be re-introduced suddenly for the ACP countries.
These issues are first and foremost the responsibility of the regional groupings of the ACP countries, whose sovereignty should be respected in this matter.
The Commission must therefore withdraw them from the negotiations.
Furthermore, the parliaments of the ACP countries and the European Parliament, together with civil society, must have access to all the elements of the negotiations and must be consulted and involved as they take place.
Finally, if longer deadlines are needed in order to do a proper job of negotiating good economic partnership agreements, then the Commission must demonstrate flexibility and defend the principle of this before the members of the WTO.
(NL) Mr President, Mr Sturdy has written a balanced report which also accommodates the fair criticism voiced by the ACP partners to the effect that, during the negotiations, the EU does not listen enough to their complaints and is instead far too ready to impose things unilaterally.
I should like to touch upon an aspect that is often overlooked, namely the regional aspect of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA): reinforcing south-south trade.
The development goals can only be achieved if the objective of EPAs is to encourage good economic management, promote the regional integration of the ACP economies and attract and hold onto more investments.
Timely and effective aid for trade is a conditio sine qua non if the trade potential of the ACP regions is to be increased.
In this connection, I would remind the Commission of its President, Mr Barroso's, pledge to grant the developing countries EUR 1 billion in trade support.
The fact that the Council agreement on the forthcoming financial perspectives has made insufficient provision for the proposed EUR 190 million needed annually for countries from the sugar protocol is not a good sign.
After all, keeping one's promise is a matter of elementary credibility, and it could well determine whether the negotiations succeed or fail.
(SV) There are three key concepts that the Commission needs to bear in mind in the negotiations: to listen, not to compel and not to become stressed.
We must listen to the ACP countries' demands.
These negotiations are not conducted on an equal footing.
You, Mr Mandelson, have hundreds of experts at your disposal.
The ACP countries, for their part, have just a few.
We have huge economic power.
They have only the beginnings of trade and industry.
We can buy up the whole of their trade and industry.
They are scarcely able to buy food for the day.
When conditions differ so greatly, it is important for us to listen to their demands and to try to meet them.
Economic Partnership Agreements must exist to promote their development, not to increase our profits.
We must not, therefore, engage in compulsion.
If they do not wish to open up a market, we must do as is stated in paragraph 17 of the resolution and not force them to do so.
All trade experts educated in neo-liberal thinking believe that reduced tariffs are always a good thing and that free trade is always better than fair trade, but the reality shows that that is not the case.
Moreover, it is reality that our negotiating partners inhabit.
Mistaken liberalisation can lead to people's deaths.
You can explain what you believe, but allow them to take the decisions.
If they are wrong, the mistake is theirs.
It is easier to live with deficiencies for which one is oneself responsible and which one can change than to live in extreme poverty imposed by others.
Reciprocity is unnecessary.
Allow them to decide about it for themselves.
We can live with or without reciprocity, but they can die because of it.
Finally, we must not become stressed.
I therefore hope that the House will delete recital F and approve Amendment 4.
Allow the negotiations to take the time required and, in the meantime, allow the General System of Preferences to remain in place.
They can then safely continue to sell to us without having a sword of Damocles hanging over them.
Together with the ACP countries, we 27 EU countries constitute a dominant group within the World Trade Organisation.
If we wish, we can together say that we need to extend the period of the negotiations or else devise alternatives to economic partnership agreements.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, when the WTO ruled that the customs advantages conferred by the countries of the EU on their former colonies amounted to putting other developing countries at a disadvantage, it was not calling for a new world order.
I believe, Commissioner, that you are overestimating by far your authority's competence in matters of planning.
The EPA drafts that you have now slapped down on the table in front of the negotiating parties constitute a manifest over-reaching of your negotiating mandate.
Treating our own experience in Europe with complete disregard, you seem to want to force through a global patchwork rug of alliances between states founded solely on economic considerations, and so, by not giving your partners even the first chance to find common social and political ground, you are putting European businesses at a massive competitive advantage.
I, for one, repudiate the idea of forcing our partner countries to accept conditions of the kind that the radical free-market elements have not managed to get accepted even within the EU.
No pretence is made that your regulations for public contracts are anything other than means towards the wedging open of the market; you may be putting two boxers in a ring, but one of them weighs 100 kg more than the other.
I call on you, then, to suspend all negotiations on matters over and above customs tariffs and use your power to get the WTO reordered so as to take more account of the demands of development.
Mr President, I would like to join with those who have congratulated Robert Sturdy on what I think is a good report.
The report correctly stresses that these are negotiations that are being conducted between unequal partners and it has been a theme of many of the other contributors this morning.
I think the fact that the Commission and the ACP countries perceive the negotiations from a different standpoint is at the heart of many of the problems.
If we look at the end of the year deadline, the perception of the Commission is that the deadline is an essential tool for meeting its WTO obligations.
From the viewpoint of many of the ACP countries on the other hand, the deadline is being used to rush them into agreeing unsuitable agreements, and the Commission, I think, has to do much more to reassure the ACP countries that the deadline is not and will not be used to browbeat the ACP countries into agreements that they cannot otherwise live with.
On the situation with aid, the Commission says, and Commissioner Mandelson repeated this morning, that the negotiations will not fail for lack of money.
But it is unfair to expect ACP countries to make long-term decisions on liberalisation and regional integration without having a long-term view of the amount of assistance that would be available to help them put together the regional regulatory frameworks to instigate new methods of collecting government revenues to make up for the loss of the tariff income or to construct a type of infrastructure which we know from our own experience in the EU is so important to developing our regional economy.
When we move on to the issue of market access, I have heard the Commissioner say in this Chamber that the European Union has no offensive trade objectives with ACP countries.
But again, when we hear from negotiators, their perception is that the Commission is pushing them very hard to open up our services markets and to make other market-opening offers.
I say all this in a genuine spirit of belief that the Commission wants a pro-development package with the six regions.
The Commission believes it is acting in the interests of the ACP countries, but it must understand that negotiations between unequal partners create suspicion in the weaker partner.
When we talk about deadlines, they see threats, when we are vague on the aid package, they see linkage between the amount of market-opening they are prepared to offer and the size of their aid package.
If we are to overcome these concerns, then we must bring more openness and transparency to the talks themselves and we must promise that once we conclude the talks, that there will be parliamentary oversight to the finally concluded agreements so that they can be reassured that parliamentarians will be involved in this process from their implementation.
Mr President, following the progress of the EPA negotiations has been like living in two parallel universes.
On the one hand, there have been many statements from the ACP side that the process lacks the development focus it is supposed to have.
The ACP countries insist that they are being put under pressure to negotiate on the Commission's terms and they are particularly concerned that the Commission has failed to give time for proper impact assessments and has dismissed any assessments that were not in line with its own position.
On the other hand, strangely, the Commission has maintained throughout that no one is complaining or asking for alternatives to EPAs.
However, the January 2007 review of EPAs by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa was clear.
This external and independent review concluded that there was a failure of the negotiations to have a development focus and an excessive focus on trade liberalisation alone.
Given this external UN assessment, I do not see how the Commission can keep on maintaining that the EPA negotiations have a positive dynamic and that everything is rosy.
Mr President, I trust that the Commission will take note of the concerns that many- indeed, the vast majority of - Members of Parliament have raised this morning.
The EPA negotiations are clearly at a very critical stage, and this week European Union and ACP ministers meet in Brussels to review progress, at a time when, as others have said, they are under intense pressure to conclude by the end of 2007.
The reality is, of course, that even where technically they are well prepared, ACP countries still face serious political issues which remain between ACP member states, within governments in the ACP, between governments and private sector, civil society and regional integration organisations.
David Martin raised some very important points about the level of suspicion and anxiety that exists in ACP countries.
In the last few weeks I have been in both west and east Africa and, from the Prime Minister of Senegal, to the President of Ghana, to the Tanzanian Minister of Trade, the message was exactly the same: there are too many unresolved issues.
On aid for trade: is it new money?
Is it predictable?
When is it going to be on the table?
On levels of regional integration, in Tanzania I learnt of the enormous problems there and of the new east Africa configuration which they are planning for and have, I think, written to the Commissioner about.
Then there are the Singapore issues, which others have mentioned and which are currently causing enormous difficulties in the SADC negotiations.
Most ACP member states have welcomed duty-free, quota-free access.
However, it remains the case - and I am not sure that anyone has mentioned this - that a dozen or more EU Member States are expressing concern and objections to the proposal, and some ACP states are concerned about the impact on sugar, bananas and rice.
Only yesterday, Barbados was saying that the region could benefit only if the EU ensured that they build the technical, productive and infrastructural capacity so that they can maximise the opportunities, particularly for sugar, between 2009 and 2015.
There is this doomsday scenario that people talk about.
That is why, if they cannot sign up by the end of this year, the ACP should be provided with a high level of market access using GSP+.
The assertion I hear that alternatives do not exist is simply not the case and neither is the claim that no ACP region or country has asked for them.
Recent research by the ODI, the UN and others points to an enhanced GSP as a viable alternative to EPAs and would provide that essential breathing space for negotiations to continue.
GSP+ would provide more generous access than GSP, which is clearly not an option.
Most ACP countries could well meet the eligibility criteria and would be provided with a level of market access almost equivalent to Cotonou for current exports, with very few exceptions.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to express my satisfaction with the way in which this debate has been conducted today in this House. I wish to do so, among other things, because I believe that it blatantly gives the lie to the allegations that we have been hearing regularly over the last few months, to the effect that only a few madmen from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and a civil society defying the European Commission in principle or out of habit are worried about the staging and the outcome of the economic partnership agreement negotiations.
That is certainly not the case, as we have heard this morning.
To put it simply, there is in fact just one question to be asked today within the context of these negotiations, and that question is as follows: is the Commission able to guarantee the ACP countries that, once signed, the agreements will provide them with development conditions that are more favourable than the ones from which they benefit today?
If it is, then I personally no longer have many problems with these economic partnership agreements.
If it is not, which I fear, then we have to reject them as they are presented to us at the moment, and for as long as they unduly favour an approach to human relations that is overly concerned with trade, to the exclusion of everything else and to the detriment of the general interest of the peoples of the ACP countries.
Improving the living conditions of as many of our contemporaries and future generations as possible, in the North and in the South, is a priority objective that we are entitled to demand on the part of the Commission.
Accordingly, the Commission has a duty to proceed with the negotiations on these agreements, willingly and with all due transparency.
In this regard, I refer to the very practical, very correct, remarks made by my colleague, Mr Arif.
However, the Commission has a duty also to give itself, and to give our partners, the necessary timescales, as several speakers who have taken the floor before me have said.
It is high time for this demand, which is made by millions of European citizens whom we represent in this House, to be considered with a far more serious and respectful approach than is the case today.
Commissioner, we are hearing Members talk extensively and insistently this morning - and we regularly hear such talk in this House - about the economy, the opening up of markets and competitiveness.
These words, let us not forget, are words that we must take for what they are, that is to say, concepts and, at best, instruments, whose only value is their possible contribution to satisfying the general interest, the interest of as many people as possible, not a number - even a growing number - of privileged persons, which can take advantage, both in the North and South, of any old agreement concluded with any old party, but a growing number of men, women and children who, together, represent the great majority of the outcasts of our world and who expect a great deal from a relationship with their European partners which, if not generous, is at least balanced.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, in its latest proposals, the European Union is considering extending the 'everything but arms' concept to all the ACP countries.
True, this is an advance that will make it possible to ensure that none of these countries loses out after 2007, but it is not a miracle solution that makes the EPAs development agreements.
For them to become development agreements, we need to go much further: we need to provide for a transitional period that is much longer than the 10 or 12 years that are currently being proposed; we need to put an end to agricultural dumping and respect the principle of food sovereignty; we need to offer genuinely special and individual treatment and enable the ACP countries to protect some of their sectors; we need to put a stop to the pressure on the Singapore issues, in order to uphold the right of all States freely to manage their public services; and, finally, we need to involve civil societies and parliaments more.
I believe that that is the price to be paid if the EPAs are to serve as a matter of priority the development of Africa, and not just that of Europe.
Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to respond to this debate on behalf of the Commission because of the importance of this subject: nothing less than future development, alleviation of poverty and opportunities to use the advantages of the international trade system are at stake for the ACP, some of the most poverty-struck countries in the world to whom we owe an absolute obligation.
The Economic Partnership Agreements are about using trade as a lever for development.
We have no intention of forcing ACP countries to make commitments against their will.
We are operating with one constraint, however: EPAs need to be WTO-compliant, thus including trade-opening on both sides for trade in goods and trade in services.
This of course, and I say this emphatically, does not mean symmetrical trade-opening between the EU and the ACP.
Obviously, in market-opening towards its partners, the EU will go much beyond what ACP partners will do for the EU.
In addition, in many areas, we are ready to give serious consideration to transition periods and in some cases very long transition periods - up to 25 years - together with substantial financial aid to help these countries implement their commitments so that EPAs genuinely act as a catalyst for policy reforms in ACP countries.
Concerning market access, recently the General Affairs Council of our Member States reaffirmed the principle of duty-free, quota-free, access to the ACP but with transition periods for a few sensitive products, notably rice and sugar.
The same principle applies on bananas but we agreed on additional evaluation, notably to take into account the EU's outermost regions, and that will happen.
Specifically, in response to what Mr van den Berg said, we are jointly building with ACP regions asymmetric market access schedules which allow continued protection for ACP-sensitive sectors.
Our duty-free, quota-free offer gives great scope to protect the ACP and to open their markets in a deeply asymmetric manner.
In addition, flexible safeguards will be in place so that we can take action quickly if problems arise.
However, a conditional market access schedule would once again put our trading arrangements in a vulnerable position in the WTO, creating further uncertainty for ACP traders and investors.
Introducing such a conditional approach would therefore not be wise from the point of view of the interests of the ACP countries themselves.
Some Members have talked about alternatives to EPAs.
I can say without any hesitation or qualification whatsoever: there are no better development-friendly or superior development instruments available to us that would exceed the ambition and the potential that Economic Partnership Agreements offer.
To offer GSP as some have suggested, when instead we could negotiate good Economic Partnership Agreements, would indeed be nonsense.
ACP countries that are not LDCs would end up with worse market access to the European Union than almost any other developing countries in the world.
Yes, some then go on to propose GSP+ as an alternative, by relaxing entry criteria to GSP+ and expanding its coverage.
This again is completely unacceptable.
GSP+ continues the divisions in trade regime between LDCs and non-LDCs that EPAs are seeking to remove and does not promote the use of market access in the way that EPAs do.
The GSP is open to all countries and many would simply take advantage of relaxed GSP+ criteria, exposing the ACP to direct competition while fundamentally undermining the purpose of GSP+, which is using trade preferences to promote signature of accords on human rights and good working practices.
So I hope that people will not pursue or entertain the idea of GSP or GSP+ being an acceptable and/or superior alternative to EPAs.
The best development option by far is to sign EPAs on time.
Any alternative falls short of this.
We cannot simply flout WTO rules on the goods trade section of EPAs.
If it becomes clear that for any region we are really not going to make it, LDCs get Everything but Arms; for non-LDCs that export bananas in particular, the waiver route is probably not politically viable at all.
For others, things depend on progress in negotiations.
I would like to conclude by saying that, in contrast to some of those who have spoken here in Parliament this morning, I find the approach of the ACP countries shows considerable realism and understanding of what it is in the ACP's interests to do.
The ACP countries have voluntarily agreed the route map that we are following in negotiating these agreements.
It is certainly not in the interests of the ACP for those who present themselves as friends of the ACP to peddle a doomsday scenario, to generate fears and insecurity which can only hold the ACP back from engaging in the negotiations which it is so much in their interest to conclude by the end of the year.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (DE) I should like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for highlighting the great need for action on the part of the European Union in the negotiation of economic partnership agreements.
We ought to start by bearing in mind that we have to work at the efficient inclusion of the ACP states in world trade and at equal success in all regional groups, which can happen, inter alia, through trade concessions and technical aid for the producers, so that the losses they sustain through tariff revenues can be compensated for, yet that alone does not give them what they need.
What they also need in order to actually benefit from easier access to the market is expert instruction and guidance.
I also believe it is likely to be essential that the underlying administrative procedures be simplified if they are to be able to use the resources available to them in a more efficient way.
We, being Members of this House, ought, I think, to be aware of the fact that trade with states such as these is also in Europe's interests, and, moreover, we, being citizens of developed states, owe it to the citizens of the ACP countries to do everything in our power to enable them to put down roots in world trade.

It is generally understood to be clear that the adoption of an amendment from a committee whose opinion is sought can be automatic only when that amendment falls under the exclusive competence of that committee.
The word 'exclusive' is missing in this instance.
For the sake of greater precision, I have agreed with the rapporteur that the term 'exclusive competences' be added to this sentence.

Organic production and labelling of organic products (vote)
- Report: Aubert
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on organic production and labelling of organic products is finally going to be put to the vote today, firstly after referral back to committee, and then after an urgent request to the Council, which, I might add, was unanimously rejected by our Parliament last month.
Unfortunately, the new discussions held over the last two months with the Council have not enabled us to progress further on important points.
In particular, neither the Commission nor the Council agreed to the dual legal basis that we were demanding.
The Council did not go back on its decision to permit, by special derogation, additives and veterinary treatments made from GMOs.
Furthermore, certain chemical substances could also be permitted by derogation.
With no codecision, we are forced to acknowledge this state of affairs.
We do, however, deplore the uncommunicative and offhand attitude of the Council over the last few weeks, in spite of the good will of some Member States.
I just as deeply regret the fact that the majority of the groups refused yesterday to postpone the vote until June, given that the Council itself had postponed its meeting on organic farming.
I regret that the majority of the groups did not wish to exhaust the means that we have to apply pressure.
That being said, the Council did nevertheless take up a number of our amendments in its compromise, and regular consultation of all the actors concerned is part of the overall agreement.
I therefore call on you now to adopt this report.
You can count on my determination, and on that of my fellow Members from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, closely to monitor this matter over the next few months.
(Applause)
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, you have asked to take the floor.

On some points of detail, we and the Council of Ministers see eye to eye.
I want to take this opportunity to extend warm thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and Mr Trakatellis, who spent over a year negotiating with the Council and the Commission, and also to Mr Daul, who watched over the whole business.
This new agreement, then, brings us a good way forward where the codecision procedure is concerned.

(The oral amendment was not accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 52:
(FR) I shall try again.
This time I fully identify with the spirit of the amendment.
It consists in asking the Commission to take account of what is in the amendment.
That is the spirit of the amendment.
This means that, where it says:
... 'should not seek to include', we should say that the EU 'should deal carefully with these issues'.
(FR) I would advise my fellow Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to think carefully before opposing this, otherwise we risk voting against the amendment as a whole.
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
That concludes the vote.
Voting time
The next item is Voting time.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
We voted for this final agreement because Parliament secured a EUR 40 million increase above the amount provided for in the Council Common Position.
The budget for LIFE+ now stands at around EUR 1 894 million.
Part of the LIFE+ budget is earmarked for 'nature and biodiversity' projects.
Parliament has ensured that at least 50% of budget resources of LIFE+ will be dedicated to project action grants to support the conservation of nature and biodiversity.
In its common position, the Council had proposed earmarking 40% of the whole budget to such projects.
Lastly, as mentioned in the final report, Mr Dimas read out a statement during the Conciliation Committee meeting saying that before the review of the Financial Framework, the Commission would carry out a review of committed and planned spending at national and EU level on the management of the Natura 2000 networks. This overview will be used with a view to adapting Community instruments, in particular LIFE+, and to ensuring a high level of cofinancing.
To conclude, the outcome is far more satisfactory than any agreement that could have been concluded at an earlier stage of the legislative procedure.
I warmly welcome the outcome of this conciliation procedure, with its accent on a centralised approach in which the Commission continues to manage the programme, thereby ensuring value added for Europe as a whole, equal criteria and excellence, and reducing extra spending on setting up national level management bodies.
I should like to highlight other positive elements such as the EUR 40 million increase in the general budget and the award of 15% in funds for transnational projects.
I shall therefore be voting in favour of the common project adopted by the Conciliation Committee on LIFE+.
(DE) Mr President, we have been equipped with yet another instrument fit for combating the trafficking in human beings and their sexual exploitation, in the shape of the Daphne III programme, but the fact of the matter is that, since over 100 000 women in the European Union are victims of people-trafficking and of violence, this sort of programme needs to be properly endowed.
I am very glad to see that the budget has been topped up by 50 million, bringing it to over EUR 114 million, which will enable us to mount information campaigns in the countries from which those women and children originate who are enticed into the European Union, there to become the victims of sexual violence.
Such information campaigns enable us to prevent this by informing women and offering them protection from exploitation.
If that is combined with aid provided under programmes for improving the position of women at risk, then we are, by means of Daphne III, taking a quite vital step in combating violence, people-trafficking and sexual exploitation.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the GrÃ¶ner report on the grounds that it has certainly succeeded in achieving progress in the fight against the violence suffered by women, and there is no doubt about the role that the Daphne programme has played in that.
It has to be said, though, that violence against women is more widespread in cultures in which patriarchal power still has deep roots and in which hardly anyone regards it as a problem.
Violations of women's human rights such as genital mutilation and forced marriages are happening among us, too, as a consequence of the waves of immigration over recent years, and I believe we need to do more, in order to address this, than to raise awareness of the problem or make forced marriages punishable in the EU.
There must also be no acceptance of exceptional court rulings justified by reference to cultural considerations; when criminals are punished, be they from the host community or from Western cultural backgrounds, the same law must apply to Muslim immigrants.
This is where Justice must be neither blind nor dumb.
I am voting for the adoption of Mrs GrÃ¶ner's report on the Council's common position with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 a specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women, and to protect victims and groups at risk (Daphne III programme) as part of the General Programme 'Fundamental Rights and Justice'.
The Daphne programme was set up in 1997.
It has served to fund over 350 projects providing support for non-governmental organisations and institutions and associations involved in protecting children, young people and women against violence.
I offer my strong support to the third stage of this project, to which Mrs GrÃ¶ner's report refers.
The main aims of Daphne III are supporting the development of the Community's policy relating to public health protection, gender equality, combating domestic violence, protecting children's rights, combating gender violence in situations of conflict and combating human trafficking and sexual exploitation.
These ambitious aims for 2007-2013 will be supported by a budget of EUR 116 850 000.
A comparison with the Daphne I budget - EUR 20 000 000 and with the Daphne II budget - EUR 50 000 000 is testament to recognition of the programme's importance and achievements.
The report also rightly highlights the need to open up the programme for cooperation with non-governmental organisations by ensuring greater transparency, reducing bureaucracy and providing assistance for applicants seeking funding.
I supported these Amendments to Daphne III, the EU's specific programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women.
I am pleased that the third phase of Daphne (2007-2013) has an increased budget of EUR 116.85 million.
In addition, I am pleased that the bureaucracy will be reduced so that NGOs have easier access to the programme.
I fully support the work of the rapporteur in combating violence against women.
The DAPHNE programme helps in tackling this issue across the EU and those who fail to support this report today should be condemned.
in writing. - (FR) The extension of the Daphne programme for 2007-2013 demonstrates the European Parliament's desire to ensure that this plan, which was implemented in 2000, continues.
Violence against children, adolescents and women is a tragic social phenomenon.
Some groups that are particularly vulnerable to violence must be better protected, but we must not forget about domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
In RÃ©union, for example, the number of offences against women has doubled in 20 years, and more than a fifth of women have suffered at least one form of violence in a public space during the last 12 months.
I would therefore like it if the European Commission devoted a European year to this type of violence.
I welcome the commitment made by the Commission, which has increased the budget to almost EUR 117 million, even though this amount is lower than the one requested by the European Parliament.
The twofold increase in the resources testifies, however, to a real ambition in the objectives.
This effort must still be accompanied by transparency in the programme and must make the programme more accessible to civil society, which lacks technical assistance when it comes to preparing draft proposals, particularly in the outermost regions.
I hope that, in future, assessments are conducted by a committee of experts.
Instead of some of the more far-reaching proposals suggested to us, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed a modest revision of Rule 47 (which would be renamed 'Procedure with associated committees').
This more modest change would require the chairmen and rapporteurs of the committees concerned to meet and jointly identify areas of the text falling within their executive or joint competences.
The chair of the committee responsible would have to take account of any such agreement when ruling on the final responsibility for different parts of the text.
The rule would also allow the parties to agree, if they so wish, on more precise arrangements for their cooperation, which opens the door to possibilities such as a joint working group.
The rule change also would guarantee that associated committees are represented in any Parliament delegation in a conciliation procedure.
We abstained from voting on the reports by Mr Corbett and Mr Leinen on enhanced cooperation between committees and practical arrangements for the codecision procedure.
Admittedly, from a practical point of view, these reports aim at simplifying the work done by this Parliament in its institutional and legal framework.
However, they are symptomatic of a parliamentary practice where, ultimately, everything is more or less decided in advance, in small committees, by means of the interinstitutional or intergroup compromise, and in the name of effectiveness and rationality.
They are also symptomatic of a parliament in which the 'large' groups - at least those that are recognised as such - call the shots and in which the individual rights of Members are reduced to their most basic expression, and are even non-existent when it comes to producing legislation.
By imposing order on its procedures, this Parliament, which already suffers from a lack of national and political representativeness and from a lack of proximity to Europeans, is going to lose once and for all the characteristic that ought to define it: that of being a parliament that is elected by the people, for the people.
(DE) Mr President, I also voted in favour of the Laperrouze report on the grounds that it is of course better, where water is concerned, to sort things out in advance than to have to spend a great deal of money on repairs later on.
Being an Austrian, and thus a citizen of a country with very considerable water reserves, I do believe that a sustainable and environmentally conscious water policy means that we must no longer give financial support to intensive agriculture, which brings in its train such problems as over-fertilisation.
Instead, support should go to those farmers who use traditional methods of cultivation.
In forestry, too, we can play a part in determining which and how many pollutants get into the groundwater and at what rate, while also helping to protect against flooding.
I voted in favour of the Laperrouze report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy and amending Directive 2000/60/EC.
I feel that the EU should continue to play a fundamental role in protecting the environment.
Furthermore, the purpose of this proposal is to protect and promote environmental quality in accordance with the principle of sustainable development.
These are much needed measures that follow up the proposal contained in the Water Framework Directive and will help to end the chemical pollution of water, which disturbs aquatic ecosystems, causes biodiversity to be lost and makes human beings increasingly exposed to pollutants.
This fresh proposal for a directive on environmental quality standards in the area of water policy follows on from the Water Framework Directive, adopted in 2000.
The proposal sets out environmental quality targets for surface water to be achieved by 2015, albeit without any formal appraisal of the various existing laws or an integrated approach to water policy.
This is therefore a series of separate measures with some positive aspects.
I welcome, for example, reference to the need to take account of the scientific and technical data available, the different environmental conditions in the different regions, balanced economic and social development and the polluter pays principle.
Yet this is presented in a framework of fostering neoliberalism, with the proposed measures playing second fiddle to 'maintaining uniform competitive conditions in the internal market'.
It also introduces vague concepts such as 'best available techniques', which may be used to make it compulsory to use patented technology and equipment.
This will engender dependence, and may serve to deprive workers of production resources given the price of hi-tech equipment.
Although Parliament has made some improvements on the Commission's text, it rejected most of the proposals tabled by our group, which is why we abstained from the final vote.
in writing. - (EL) The title about environmental quality standards in the field of water policy does not really correspond to its content, in that it focuses on harmful substances in surface waters and on sediments which come solely from pesticides.
Other contaminants, such as industrial waste water, urban waste water, landfill leachate, thermal pollution from corresponding sources, the pollution of lakes with air pollutants from incineration units which are brought down with the weather etc., are left out of account.
However, the chemical pollution of surface waters may cause disruptions to water ecosystems, destroying biodiversity, or contaminants may accumulate in the food chain from poisoned fish.
Moreover, it is clear that the Commission's intention is to target and blame agriculture as being the sole factor responsible for the chemical contamination of surface waters.
Moreover, the 'polluter pays' principle does not stop pollution, but it does legalise the inconsiderate actions of industry and other monopolies.
No specific measures are proposed for controlling the sources of the disposal of 'priority substances', both dangerous and harmless, the concentration limits of which are dealt with in the proposal for a directive.
Nonetheless, the report does expand the limited content of the directive in order to achieve more effective protection of waters. Ultimately, however, both the content and the orientation are a long way from contemporary needs for protection of the social right to high-quality water, which must be complete and not partial and fragmented.
Water quality is essential to our environment and I am pleased to see that through European action we have witnessed improvements.
I believe that the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to look at the effectiveness of all Community legislative acts with a direct or indirect impact on water quality is a step in the right direction.
(DE) Mr President, although the rapporteur, Mrs Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Aubert, has worked very hard at producing a good report, the delegation of the Austrian People's Party in the European Parliament has today voted against it, on the grounds that we still find many things in it that we find highly problematic.
We still believe that the limit value for GMOs in organic agriculture must be 0.0%, and that imports from third states must meet the same criteria as products from EU Member States and must therefore be subjected to controls.
Likewise, the labels that we have in the EU must not be used for products from elsewhere, so that consumers may not be misled and that their traceability may be assured.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the motion that the Aubert report on organic production and labelling of organic products be referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
As far as I am concerned, it is necessary that the threshold for accidental contamination by GMOs should not be the same as in conventional agriculture, that is to say around 0.9%, for one would thereby be making the de facto admission that contamination can no longer be prevented and that it cannot be guaranteed that a product is GMO-free even if certified 'organic'.
I supported the proposal in this regard from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, according to which the presence of GMOs in organic products would have to be limited solely to unforeseeable and technically unavoidable amounts to a maximum of 0.1% and that the term 'organic' was not to be used to describe products contaminated accidentally by GMOs in excess of a detectable threshold of 0.1%.
Finally, I endorse the motion that a different legal basis be found for this matter relating to organic farming.
Having hitherto been a consultant, the European Parliament intends to become a codecider where problems such as this are concerned, and that will constitute progress.
We abstained from the final vote in view of what has happened throughout the process.
On the one hand, we object to the Commission's position. It proposed a regulation authorising the presence of up to 0.9% of GMOs in organic products, among other points with which we disagree.
We still feel that this is unacceptable, particularly as regards organic farming.
To tolerate the 0.9% of GMO contamination proposed by the report would mean accepting GMO contamination of organic products.
This will undeniably have an impact on consumers, and constitutes a serious, unacceptable threat to the survival of the organic food industry.
Consumers choose to buy organic products because they are produced more sustainably and without pesticides and are completely GMO-free.
To accept the introduction of GMOs, even in very small quantities, is tantamount to hoodwinking consumers and will have serious consequences for the environment and for people's health in general.
On the other hand, given that it has been possible to improve the Commission's proposal in plenary - even though the Council has not yet given a positive response and has not accepted the amendment to the legal basis - we abstained from the final vote in the hope that it will be possible for further concessions to be made on the proposals that improve on the initial position.
I will be voting in favour of Mrs Aubert's report on organic production and labelling of organic products.
I believe that consumers have the right to clear identification of products they intend to purchase.
Nevertheless, regulations on labelling have to reflect day-to-day realities.
We cannot specify requirements that lie beyond our ability to operate in a meaningful way reflecting the best practical means available at the time.
To do otherwise is to collude in limiting the availability of products many consumers might choose to purchase.
in writing. - (FR) Organic farming now represents 1.4% of the agricultural production of the 25 Member States and 3.6% of the utilised agricultural area (1.8% of the agricultural land in Brittany).
Consumer demand continues to increase, and the arrival on the market of these products, which have all manner of labels and which are produced even outside the EU, presents new problems where control, certification and labelling are concerned.
Furthermore, the subsidies and standards in this area are very disparate from one country to the next, and this creates distortions of competition for those organic producers who receive the least assistance.
I therefore welcome the adoption in plenary of the opinion of the European Parliament addressed to the Council calling on it swiftly to adopt the regulation on organic farming.
This new regulation must make it possible to clarify the Community framework relating to organic food production, which dates back to 1991.
Parliament requests that the national inspection systems be strengthened so that products can be traced at every stage of production.
If it is compulsory to use the European logo (for foodstuffs containing 95% organic ingredients) and the 'EU-organic' indication, then it must remain possible to add other private logos.
Finally, the use of GMOs must be prohibited in organic farming.
The much-vaunted upgrading of agricultural production and improvements to agricultural products through organic farming risk turning into a colossal scam at the expense of producers and consumers.
The few multinationals trying to control the global food chain through modified organisms for the sake of their profits have won through and all the political groups of the EU, including PASOK and New Democracy, are to blame.
The admissible presence of GMOs and the addition of supplements (vitamins etc.) from GMOs to organic foods are the back door for using modified organisms in countries and areas resisting their use, which they recognise as dangerous.
Setting a limit for admissible levels of modified organisms in organic products, however low it may be today, means it can be increased without control, given that even the European Parliament was not allowed the right of codecision.
This limit will now be set by the multinationals in line with the natural contamination which will be caused by the permitted coexistence of conventional, genetically modified and organic crops, however many protective measures are taken.
Thus organic farmers will see their products downgraded, while consumers buying 'organic' products with GMOs will be deceived.
Unfortunately, our proposals to ban modified organisms in organic food were not accepted; but the fight continues with the workers for healthy crops and healthy food.
I supported the resolution on organic food products which builds on the report in March to introduce stricter rules governing organic food products.
I believe that this can increase consumer protection.
in writing. (SV) I am voting in favour of the report because, unlike the Commission's proposal, it retains the option of national labelling.
I regret, however, that, in spite of everything, it recommends that EU labelling should be the dominant form of labelling.
I voted for the report on organic labelling because it still allows for national labelling.
This means that, although the proposed EU label recognises a diluted version of organic foods, particularly in terms of GMO content, national labelling can still signal the absence of GMOs in organic products in an EU Member State's own market.
Mr President, I am delighted today to support my group colleague in her report's assertion that organic production and labelling represent a crucial area of EU production in need of protection.
As the market for organic food grows it is vital that consumers feel safe in the definition of what is and what is not organic.
We in Scotland have a thriving organic sector and I want to see that flourish.
A stable labelling and definitions framework will assist that.
The European Community and Greenland have had fishing relations for a long time, but the 1985 framework agreement expired on 31 December 2006.
The new protocol in place as of 1 January 2007 for a period of six years lays down the fishing opportunities for Community vessels, the financial contribution, the categories of Community vessels that can operate in the Greenland exclusive economic zone and the conditions under which they can operate there.
The main objective of the new agreement is to retain and strengthen fishing ties between the Community and Greenland Home Rule following the establishment of a partnership and dialogue framework aimed at improving sustainable fishing policy and at the sensible exploitation of fishing resources in Greenland fishing areas in the interests of both parties.
Portugal has a particular interest in the fishing sector and is therefore in favour of the conclusion of this new agreement.
In spite of our vote in favour of the report before us - which approves the proposal for a regulation in question - we are concerned about Article 3(2) of the regulation, which allows the Commission to consider license applications from any Member State when Member States covered by this agreement have not exhausted the fishing opportunities to which they are entitled.
We feel that in the event of the under-use of fishing opportunities granted to a Member State as part of quotas and licences, the Commission should consult the Member States in question with a view to ensuring the optimum use of fishing opportunities, including the possibility of transferring unused fishing opportunities to other Member States.
We believe, however, that this possibility should not undermine the principle of relative stability; it should not, in other words, have any influence on the future award of fishing opportunities to Member States in the context of these partnerships.
As such, we support the amendment clarifying this point.
As Amendment 7 was not carried, the EPLP was left with no option but to vote against the report.
This report could jeopardise the historical fishing rights of the Scottish fleet and sets a dangerous precedent for future fishing agreements.
I am voting for the adoption of the report on practical arrangements for the codecision procedure.
I should like to begin by thanking Mr Leinen, the rapporteur, for a very well prepared report.
Every effort should be made to ensure that the European Union functions as efficiently as possible and to simplify the system of interinstitutional cooperation.
Our aim must be to make decision taking and the development of European legislation by the three Union institutions, namely the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, as transparent as possible for the citizens of Europe.
The codecision procedure is an important element of the European Union's legislative system.
It ensures that new EU legislation is adopted in a more democratic manner.
The proposals for improving this procedure contained in the report are apt and should help to simplify the functioning of this decision-making system.
Halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 is something that should be supported as a matter of principle.
Appropriate measures are therefore required.
Species and ecosystems need space to develop and recover.
Accordingly, the maintenance of ecosystems should become a fundamental goal of all EU horizontal and sectoral policies. Healthy ecosystems play a vital role in prosperity and well-being in the EU and worldwide.
If urban and rural development goes on overlooking nature, our landscape will be dominated by cement and pollution.
Given that biodiversity is a cornerstone of sustainable development, biodiversity concerns need to be integrated into all areas of policy-making.
Although there are contradictions in Community policy, the Member States must take up all available opportunities under the CAP, the CFP, cohesion and structural funds, LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme to support biodiversity targets.
Furthermore, it is imperative that greater consideration be given to financial needs in the 2008-09 Community budget review, during which there should be an assessment of the sufficiency (or otherwise) and availability of EU financing for biodiversity, especially for Natura 2000.
I voted in favour of the Adamou report because I feel that the loss of biodiversity will have a serious impact on the future of the EU.
Furthermore, the Action Plan before us will prove to be a vital tool for implementing the measures needed to halt the problem by 2010, although I do feel that this deadline will be decidedly difficult to meet.
I agree that the consequences of climate change will be such that ecosystem services and the specific roles played by the CAP and the CFP should be taken into account, given their importance in meeting targets and in ensuring the long-term existence of biodiversity.
in writing. - (EL) The EU's interest in halting the loss of biodiversity is superficial and hypocritical, because it does not take substantial measures or provide the necessary funding.
At the same time that it appears to be fighting for biodiversity, its basic priority is to promote GMOs.
The report quite rightly refers to the dangers from genetically modified fish. It does not refer to the huge threat from resistant, genetically-modified plants which shrink plant biodiversity and harbour dangers to public health.
There is already a plethora of data about the mass disappearance of species; the rates of loss are 100-1000 times higher than natural levels, with tragic consequences for the genetic flow between populations of flora and fauna.
The main causes of the loss of biodiversity cited are climate change, environmental pollution, intensive farming methods and inappropriate management of forests and water resources.
These, however, are the result of the plundering exploitation of nature by the monopolies for the sake of their profits.
Even the 'polluter pays' principle acquits the polluter, legalising the downgrading of the environment and making it the subject of haggling, for the benefit of the profits of capital.
Basically, the responsibility of governments and of the EU is being passed to the citizens, by strengthening education and raising awareness.
The people must acknowledge that the anti-environmental policy of the EU and of the governments of the Member States is to blame and must condemn and overturn it.
Mr President, I am pleased that this important report gained the majority it did, because the gradual loss of biodiversity should concern us all.
The implications of the moves to biofuels should in particular be kept to the forefront of our attention.
While nobody would deny that we need to move away from fossil fuels, the knock-on effects of major shifts in production to monocultivation of (often GM) biofuels could have long-term effects that are even more detrimental, and this report does well to keep this issue on our agenda.
The fact that 52% of freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction whilst cod and other fish stocks are at worryingly low levels should be a wake-up call for action.
I agree with the rapporteur that biodiversity loss is as important as climate change and that Member States must show greater political will to prevent the loss of biodiversity.
I am also pleased to see that the amendment condemning deep-sea bottom-trawling and other unsustainable fishing practices was carried.
(PL) Mr President, the creation of a single market within our community, a very extensive market and one that has gradually enlarged, has brought benefits to all its participants.
The aforementioned enlargement was preceded by the creation of a single market, the introduction of new legislation and by a whole process of adjustments.
In short, conditions were approximated, thus ensuring genuine competition.
Opening the market is a condition of globalisation.
For this to be beneficial to everyone, however, a process that involves not only negotiation but also adjustment, including educational and information activities for interested social groups must precede opening.
The creation of a global market must be founded on similar principles to the ones we adopted when creating the European market.
The experience was a good one.
Setting standards and conditions to be met by the interested parties is particularly important. These include environmental standards, conditions relating to work and pay, and the principles of innovation.
A so-called road map should be drawn up for this process, laying down the various stages and allowing for development.
Full monitoring by the interested parties should also be arranged.
in writing. - (FR) This report commits the European Union and its trade partners to the path towards triumphant liberalism, liberalism that goes against the tenets of European trade policy.
I regret that the MEPs are renouncing what they have defended until now: a trade policy that consisted in subordinating the trade agreements to social and environmental requirements by respecting the sovereignty of developing countries when it came to the management of a number of sectors vital to their development (public services, investment, public contracts and competition rules).
This vote has replaced this policy with a strategy aimed at the wide-ranging liberalisation of services and of investment in developing countries, one that will meet the expectations of European manufacturers, to the detriment of economic development needs.
The principle of free trade must be a tool used to promote development, not an objective in its own right.
I deplore the fact that the Singapore issues, which had been excluded from the Doha multilateral negotiations, have been re-introduced by the MEPs in this report as priorities for future bilateral negotiations.
I voted in favour of the Caspary report because, although it is not perfect, I feel that most of the socialists' objectives were met, which were as follows: preference for multilateralism and the conclusion of the Doha Round, special treatment for countries with development problems, mutual recognition of standards, compliance with social and environmental minimum standards, the fight against current dumping, protection of intellectual property, the adoption of codes of conduct and best practice by European firms and increased involvement for Parliament.
I warmly welcome an active and constructive role for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in bilateral negotiations with emerging economies such as Korea, India, China and Russia, in which wide-ranging, well-balanced reciprocity is required.
At the same time, support for the least developed countries must, as a matter of urgency, be stepped up and the conditions created for enabling them to play an active role in world trade.
The final text, in my view, dealt adequately with these issues and offered much-needed opposition to the unilateral review of trade defence instruments.
in writing. (PT) I voted in favour of the Caspary report because, although it is not perfect, I feel that most of the socialists' objectives were met, which were as follows: preference for multilateralism and the conclusion of the Doha Round, special treatment for countries with development problems, mutual recognition of standards, compliance with social and environmental minimum standards, the fight against current dumping, protection of intellectual property, the adoption of codes of conduct and best practice by European firms and increased involvement for Parliament.
As shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I warmly welcome an active and constructive role for our group in bilateral negotiations with emerging economies such as Korea, India, China and Russia, in which wide-ranging and well-balanced reciprocity is required.
At the same time, support for the least developed countries must, as a matter of urgency, be stepped up and the conditions created for enabling them to play an active role in world trade.
The final text, in my view, dealt adequately with these issues, and offered much-needed opposition to the unilateral review of trade defence instruments.
I should also like to highlight the fact that the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs enjoyed a willingness to compromise.
On reading the new report by this House on the benefits of globalisation - 'benefits' despite the growing number of unfair practices damaging European businesses, the relocations and unemployment - I thought of the new President of the French Republic.
In his electoral speech on Europe, he spoke of necessary 'protection'.
He even dared to use the term 'Community preference'!
I do not know what Mr Sarkozy has been doing over the last five years, but he has certainly not been reading the reports by this Parliament, or the records of the Council or the speeches by Mr Mandelson and his predecessor.
They never mention 'preference', except when it comes to encouraging an even greater liberalisation of our markets.
They never mention protection, even though the EU's trade defence instruments are manifestly inadequate and randomly used.
They mention only the pursuit of globalisation and risk management.
Yet, the European Union manages absolutely nothing, and especially not the millions of unemployed, the devastated industrial sectors and the near-devastated agricultural sector.
In Mr Sarkozy's eyes, these losses are included among the acceptable risks.
I ask the question: is Mr Sarkozy deceiving his public on these issues, or is he himself being deceived?
Free trade and global liberalisation are presented here as panaceas, alongside the sacred cows of price stability, increased competition and tax cuts that facilitate the exploitation of workers.
I should also like to highlight the fact that the report states that 'bilateral and regional FTAs' are a 'sub-optimal' solution and as such should be launched only when necessary 'to improve the competitive position of EU exporters on crucial foreign markets'.
They 'should be WTO-compatible, comprehensive, ambitious' and should ensure far-reaching liberalisation of services and investment, going beyond both existing multilateral commitments and those expected to result from a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda'.
In other words, with the WTO negotiations deadlocked, the order has come to press ahead whenever and wherever possible with the liberalisation of trade, to the delight and the profit of the large economic and financial groups in the EU.
What the report fails to mention are the disastrous consequences of capitalist liberalisation - with its 'structural reforms', the end of customs duties and the imposition of so-called 'intellectual property rights' - such as the glaring increase in inequality across the world, rising unemployment, unstable work, poverty and the appalling impact on the environment and biodiversity.
We therefore voted against the report.
While this report had some negative elements, such as its call for a delay of the Trade Defence Instrument Review and the unprecise nature of the language on liberalisation (which has opened up the possibility that certain aspects of liberalisation may be negotiated upon which were controversial at the WTO level), I felt on balance it was a report to be supported.
The introduction at Committee stage of paragraphs on the need for Core Labour and Environmental Standards to be integrated into the EU's trade deals, and of additional references to development considerations, made the report more rounded.
While it could have gone further in its considerations of development issues, it is my view that during the current generation of bilateral trade deals the targeted countries (South Korea, India and ASEAN - given that in ASEAN there will be special and differential treatment to take account of developing countries) will be well placed to defend their interests during negotiations.
In a globalised world, the concerns raised in this report are extremely important.
Although I do not agree with some of the points made, I can see in this list of problems and potential solutions an approach that is, in essence, a realistic one.
To my mind, this is one of the most important aspects.
The debate on the external competitiveness of the EU, or on the EU and the global economy, must be based on realism.
It is an extremely dangerous mistake to foster the illusion that it is possible to seal the borders, to impose rules identical to our own throughout the world and to ignore the social impact of competition.
I feel therefore that the right strategy is to derive maximum benefit from this new reality, whilst keeping to a minimum its detrimental effects.
That means investing in both the cutting edge and the traditional and in what is specific and non-transferable as opposed to what is attracted by the living standards in the European area.
The fashionable idea that the Eurocentric world (or simply a world in which Europe is economically and strategically important) died with the advent of the global economy is not a cast-iron truth, it is an opinion that may be contradicted by the facts; and facts are shaped by political will.
I support this report and the idea of adapting the EU's trade policy to future challenges.
Europe's leading position in the world market enables us to prepare for change in such a way that we can respond to globalisation without abandoning our interests or the social model.
The increased liberalisation of trade must be accompanied by better use of defence instruments to combat unfair trade practices.
Without wishing to call for protectionism, which would not reduce the effects of globalisation, it is vital for Europe to adopt a strong stance on scrupulous compliance with its international trade agreements.
We cannot allow our competitors to use state aid policies for exports, to implement artificial currency devaluation and to violate basic environmental rules. It is also unacceptable for these countries to use child labour and forced labour and not to honour workers' rights.
The opening up of international trade and market access must be global and reciprocal.
Furthermore, the inclusion of minimum social and environmental standards in our trade agreements must be safeguarded.
The European project must always be based on solidarity, on respect for human rights and on sustainable development.
I support the call to reject this proposal, thus making the review unnecessary.

Debate on the future of Europe with the participation of the Prime Minister of Italy, Member of the European Council (debate)
It is with great pleasure that I welcome the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Romano Prodi, to the European Parliament today to discuss with us the future of Europe.
Italy, one of the founding Member States, has always been in the forefront in guiding the process of European integration, and Italy is also playing a decisive role at this moment, when we are seeking a solution to the stalemate reached in the process of European integration - a solution that everyone can accept.
In particular, I should like to thank the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, for the fruitful collaboration that we have established in order to make a success of revising the Treaties.
The President of Parliament knows that when he speaks he has not only the support of Parliament, but also that of Italy, and that gives him greater strength.
(DE) Prime Minister, my dear Mr Prodi, in Rome, your country's capital city, there took place in March of this year a series of celebrations in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, when we were able to rejoice in looking back on 50 years of stability, prosperity and progress that our citizens have enjoyed.
Now, though, is also the time to look forward into the future together.
Today, the European Union faces great challenges and must, in order to master them, summon up the will to take the necessary steps and implement reforms that will guide us along the way to a secure future.
You, Mr Prodi, in your time as President of the Commission, played a part in shaping the history of the European Union at an important juncture in time.
The Commission under your chairmanship, represented in the Convention by Commissioners Vittorino and Barnier, played an active part in the work on the future of the European Union and watched over the birth of the constitutional treaty right up to the Intergovernmental Conference.
The German Presidency of the Council is currently working hard to find a solution satisfactory not only to all those countries that rejected the Treaty, but also to the eighteen Member States, constituting the majority by population of the European Union, that have already ratified it.
As this process moves forward, the European Parliament unreservedly endorses the substance of the constitutional treaty, not least because it represents a compromise achieved after lengthy negotiations.
We realise, though, that finding a solution will call for hard work on the part of all of us, and so we strongly support the efforts on the part of the German Presidency of the Council, especially those undertaken by the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, towards a renewed consensus among all 27 Member States.
Were our response, however, to end up making the European Union less democratic, to limit its ability to take decisions, and to make it less transparent, that would be to misinterpret what those citizens who, in the referendums in France and the Netherlands, expressed their misgivings, actually wanted, and so this House will not be satisfied with a result that is not in the interests of the European Union and of its citizens.
I am persuaded, Prime Minister, that, with goodwill, it is possible not only to draw closer to one another, but also to achieve a result.
(IT) Prime Minister, the floor is yours.
Prime Minister of Italy. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of Europe and of European integration, and it is in that knowledge, and not without emotion, that I address you today.
I am most grateful to the President, Hans Gert Poettering, for this opportunity.
Between now and the 2009 elections, Europe will be playing for its own future.
In a month's time, the European Council will decide on launching an Intergovernmental Conference, at the end of which we must be able to say that we are equal to the commitments that we all adopted together in Berlin on 25 March this year.
It is a question of deciding what Europe needs - what we all need - in order to address the challenges that the world imposes on us.
This sounds like an abstract issue, but in fact it is highly concrete.
We ought to have realised by now that the ability of us Europeans to interpret the globalised world and to take the opportunities it offers depends on how we are able to make our joint institutions operate.
I must say straight away that, quite frankly, I do not agree with those who continue to contrast the need to produce results with the need to strengthen Europe's institutions.
It is precisely in order to get more results that I have always hoped and fought for stronger and more effective joint institutions.
This time we are not starting from scratch.
In other words, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.
In October 2004, all the European countries signed a treaty and 18 countries have actually ratified it.
Over these last two years, it has been the arguments of those who are hesitant that have been heard most of all.
The time has now come to listen to those who have ratified the 2004 treaty, those who have worked hard, including with their own citizens, to stay on that path.
They had embarked on that path a few years previously at Laeken, where it had unfolded from a fundamental and irrefutable starting point: that Europe could not achieve ambitious results without equally ambitious reforms.
Well, I am convinced that that remains a valid point.
We must therefore start again from October 2004, putting aside the struggles and pauses for reflection of these last two years and thinking seriously and responsibly about our future and that of our children.
It is not simply a matter of agreeing on the new rules that we need.
There are other equally urgent requirements, without which Europe will be unable to function. These include a budget worthy of the name, and genuine policies for tackling the major challenges that modern life is throwing at us: energy, climate change, the North-South divide, and so on.
However, let us start today with the most urgent issue, which is to find a way out of the constitutional stalemate and to reform the institutions.
To be successful in this, we have to hold faith with a principle that lies at the basis of our existence as the European Union, a principle so fundamental that it defines the very ethics of our being together.
It is the principle whereby, in furthering European integration, it is essential always to make an effort to understand the arguments of the other side and in some way to take them on board.
We have always made this effort, and we shall continue to do so.
However, we also expect the other side to be just as understanding.
We expect them equally to take on board our aspirations, which in this case, as you all know very well, are to work towards ever closer union.
Bearing this principle in mind, we shall make every effort to help the German and Portuguese Presidencies to preserve as much as possible of our ambition for union, while also taking the other side's arguments into account as much as possible.
Having established that, I must now say what in my view we cannot allow the June European Council and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference to do.
First of all, we must remember that, this time, keeping to the timetable is directly associated with a question of democracy.
In 2009, Europe's voters will need to know what kind of Europe they are being asked to vote on.
What role will the European Parliament have?
What will its duties be?
Will there be a stable Council Presidency, and a European Foreign Minister?
How will the Commission be formed?
And so forth.
The Intergovernmental Conference therefore needs to be given a precise and selective mandate, with a clear indication of the few significant sticking points for negotiation and, above all, how to resolve them.
Only by doing that will we succeed in honouring our promise to formulate the new rules by 2009.
If it were given an open mandate, the Conference would be unlikely to reach a conclusion by the end of 2007, and the time needed to process the new agreement at national level would mean that the process could not be completed by early 2009.
In short, it would automatically result in an impasse.
Allow me to make an observation at this point.
This is something that suddenly occurred to me the other day after rereading the 2004 Constitutional Treaty - I would ask you all to have another look at it, now that some time has passed and it is possible to be more objective.
Well, the document produced in 2004 is good, really good, and it has a broad, Europe-wide reach.
Above all, its first part puts across in a clear and intelligible manner the meaning and the vision of the great common enterprise on which we have embarked.
We should therefore think twice before we shelve it and set off down the path of plugging new elements into the existing treaties, whether wholly or in part.
We would also be throwing out all its existing simplicity and legibility, at the cost of the people's understanding and, hence, of their support for the European project.
Most of all, however, we would be throwing out a text that provides a consistent view of Europe, a text that is able to combine the ideals held by many of us with the practical need, which everyone recognises, to endow our Union with more solid rules and sufficient resources to meet its new challenges.
The way the negotiations have gone so far makes me think that, unfortunately, we shall have to meddle with the 2004 text again.
Yet I would like to put it on record in front of you all here today that I am convinced that in doing so we will be depriving ourselves of something very important.
For those of us who believe in the European project, that would be an enormous sacrifice, and a very high price to pay for all those who have ratified it and made a democratic investment in doing so.
