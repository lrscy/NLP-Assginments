The probability is that it will be more difficult to sell the products of those vaccinated animals, and that it will be at a reduced price.
Will that also be covered by future compensation schemes, yes or no?
What is the Commission proposing to do in this respect?
Third point: how are we to pay for such outbreaks in future?
In that respect we were lucky with the outbreak in 2001.
There was sufficiency leeway in the agriculture budget.
If calculations are correct there is considerably less slack in the agriculture budget.
The euro is strong against the dollar and there will be very little leeway.
If there were a new outbreak now, how would we pay for it?
This was in fact why the Liberal Group submitted an amendment in 2001 calling for studies to be carried out in to insurance systems.
In that respect the Commission did do its work.
At the end of May we shall have a report on the subject.
As rapporteur for the 2004 budget I myself made it one of my priorities.
It is not acceptable that we should always leave the financing of such outbreaks to chance, according to whether there is money available or not.
It must be put on a sound financial footing.
I hope to be able to work that out in future in consultation with the Commission.
The point about six months and three months is also essential for us and I therefore recommend that the plenary should accept the amendment of the Liberal and Christian Democrat groups on this.
Mr President, the history of foot and mouth disease in Europe can be traced back over many years, but the great catastrophe began in the South of England on 21 February 2001.
Although it had been known for decades what damage could be caused by the uncontrolled outbreak of a disease, the opportunity for effective defence against the epidemic was not taken.
The courses of action set in motion in the Member States affected were unable to prevent the spread of the virus.
The state of emergency that was then announced in various regions of the EU left both the rural and urban public equally enraged.
Rural areas began to resemble high-security blocks, and a sort of state of emergency was the order of the day on the farms that had been affected.
At this time, there was no shortage of ideas as to who was to blame.
The EU's ban on vaccination, which adhered to the principle that, if even only one animal was vaccinated, the whole country was declared to be infected with FMD, met with little approval on the part of the public, and even well-informed officials demanded at the time the use of what are termed marker vaccines in order to prevent the disease from becoming more widespread.
Many members of the public saw the containment of foot and mouth disease by means of the open burning of animal cadavers as demonstrating complete disregard for animals' dignity, and nor did the bottom line add up in economic terms.
By doing justice to this principle, the report on the control of foot and mouth disease draws the right conclusions from the calamity of 2001, and has, moreover, been able to confirm the results produced by the work of the committee of investigation.
This is an encouragement to the same course of action in other cases, such as that of fowlpest, a constantly-recurrent disease that spreads from one country to its neighbours, one of the main problems with which is the large number of contacts across frontiers.
Then - if you go by what the press says - there is the great danger of fowlpest, like foot and mouth disease, becoming even worse than a worst-case scenario.
The principle of 'killing rather than vaccination' or rather its opposite, should, in the EU, apply to all animal species.
It would be worth Parliament's time and effort to investigate that more closely, examining, for example, whether the German ordinance to prevent the spreading of classic fowlpest is in line with what is actually known and whether all species should be included in the text.
It would also be possible to re-examine how cross-border cooperation is actually organised.
As far as FMD is concerned, all is quiet in the candidate countries, but I would like to take this opportunity to observe that this state of affairs can change rapidly.
Any and every misjudgment in the area of controlling zoonoses and the early diagnosis of them has economic and social consequences.
The report was quite right in stating what had to be done, and the work has been a support.
I endorse the report and the proposals it makes; above all, I endorse those amendments that have to do with the protection of the fundamental right to property, and which lead the report to emphatically hold fast to some sort of compensation arrangement for those affected.
I also endorse those amendments that seek to increase the freedom of action of veterinarians and the steering bodies in the Member States.
In so far as the Member States' responsibilities will change at all, they will increase, as the decision as to which epidemic strategy is to be applied, and when, is to become a matter for the country in question, and rightly so.
This does not discharge those who keep animals from their obligation of cleanliness and good order.
Criminal activity in border areas involving the trade in animals belongs in another law, but the report sets out the right approach to this, too.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which I believe to be an extremely important piece of work.
We really are now moving towards a situation where the terrible mass slaughters of the last foot and mouth epidemic really will be a thing of the past.
I am particularly pleased to see that vaccination has been promoted to being a vital tool in the fight against foot and mouth - this shift in emphasis that Commissioner Byrne spoke about.
But as far as our own Parliamentary report is concerned, I would like to make sure that we stick with the text agreed in committee, which talks very clearly about vaccination as a tool of first resort.
That is the language we used in the report from the Temporary Committee.
That is the language of the Royal Society report in the United Kingdom.
It is right and appropriate to use that clear and unambiguous language here as well.
I welcome the amendment that supports a change in OIE rules so that there is no longer an automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate.
But we have recognised that in Britain over 10 million animals were slaughtered, many unnecessarily.
Priority was given to narrow economic interests of regaining export status as quickly as possible, regardless of the devastating consequences to the wider rural economy and rural communities.
On mass slaughter, my group has an amendment to delete pre-emptive culling.
We believe that the evidence we heard in the foot and mouth inquiry demonstrates that preventive slaughter is not necessary, it is not desirable, it is not economic and it is not efficient.
It should not be permitted by this directive.
It may seem a long time ago since we saw the pictures of the burning pyres on the front pages of newspapers in all those Member States affected.
Some people have already forgotten that, but the farmers and communities that went through that terrible time have certainly not forgotten it and many are only now beginning to put their lives back together again.
I hope that this report and the Commission initiative will be another step in the process of ensuring that such devastation can never be allowed to happen again, either in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the European Union.
Mr President, while we are considering this evening how to combat FMD in future, animals and farmers are being hit by the next infectious animal disease, fowl pest.
The EU's animal disease policy requires re-evaluation.
No one, in 1991, was aware of the possible consequences of instituting the policy of non-vaccination.
Since then we have learned the hard way. Vaccination could have prevented the destruction of millions of healthy animals.
If economic interests are paramount, mankind loses its dignity and creation its protection.
I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture has adopted our amendment, in which we make an urgent plea for the observance of ethical principles in combating animal disease.
In the new directive set out by the Commission, concern for creation still receives scant attention.
I did not dare to count on preventive vaccination. I had, though, hoped that 'emergency vaccination and retention of stock' would be the first option in the event of an outbreak.
The Commission continues to opt for culling and at the very most extends the possibilities to emergency vaccination.
I there fore support the amendments making emergency vaccination the first option in combating the disease.
Moreover, such emergency vaccination and keeping animals alive must be given a fair chance.
Products of vaccinated animals are no less safe than those of non-vaccinated animals.
Labelling these products, however, does create such an impression. And that in spite of the fact that, for years prior to 1991, these products were eaten by consumers in my country and elsewhere.
In addition we must prevent Member States having to opt for culling on the basis of the financial contribution made by Brussels to combating the disease.
Emergency vaccination costs the European Union less money, while a Member State is subsequently forced to incur costs to market the products.
The savings created by vaccination should be used to compensate for these incidental costs.
The existence of various serotypes of the FMD virus is an argument against preventive vaccination.
At the same time it is an extra stimulus for research into the development of FMD vaccines.
This makes preventive vaccination the option for the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the key element in this debate today on foot and mouth disease is the constraints imposed by the OIE with regard to the trade sanctions inflicted on countries that no longer enjoy 'foot and mouth disease free' status.
It is these rules that make this disease so terrifying for breeders because of the huge economic losses they cause.
We must remember that the foot and mouth that affects livestock is not dangerous to man.
It is not a public health problem.
I therefore endorse our rapporteur's proposal in Amendment No 5 to recital 14 to the effect that the Member States should submit proposals to the OIE to modify trade sanctions in these situations.
To be more precise, this change to the OIE rules must take two forms.
Firstly, consideration must be given to the progress made on vaccines - marker vaccines, which make it possible to distinguish a vaccinated animal from an infected animal, and more general vaccines - and we must remember that products from vaccinated animals - dairy or meat - pose no danger to human health nor any risk of contagion.
Therefore, there is no longer any reason to discriminate against these products or the countries where they are available.
This change to the rules will also make it possible to reconsider the problem of preventive vaccination, which should be authorised by the Member States in cases where, for their own reasons, the breeders so desire.
I am thinking in particular of animals with a high genetic value, breeding animals and rare breeds that are important for biodiversity.
Secondly, Member States must be allowed to regionalise their breeding areas, thereby ensuring that a case of foot and mouth in Alsace - speaking hypothetically of course - does not prevent Brittany from exporting its excellent animal produce.
Finally, and I am sorry that this point that I raised during the work of our Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease was not taken up by the rapporteur, we must not lose sight of the fact that certain changes in European agriculture, which have been facilitated by shifts in a certain CAP, are in themselves risk factors for the spread of diseases.
I am referring to the increase in the size of farms, excessive intensification, the spread of enclosed breeding, the specialisation of regions and the transporting of animals over long distances: all of these factors, which combine to create very high animal densities, increase the risk.
At a time, Mr President, when Parliament will have to state its position on the mid-term review of the CAP, we must endeavour to remedy these shifts rather than amplify them by giving priority to human-sized farms, extensive breeding in the least favoured regions, the local integration of activities and local abattoirs; in short, agriculture with a human face.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, for his excellent report.
This is the second report.
First of all there was his report on behalf of the temporary committee and now there is the report on the Commission's legislation.
I would also like to thank Members of Parliament for setting up the temporary committee.
Commissioner Byrne has listened to the temporary committee and has come forward with some good proposals.
I would also thank him for banning personal imports of meat and dairy products into the EU.
I just wish that Member States will now enforce that regulation better.
We must learn the lessons from this terrible blight to our countryside, farmers and the rural population.
Let us not begin to rewrite history and change what we learnt the hard way, nor alter our views.
The views of the European inquiry were clear about how a future outbreak should be handled.
The EU committee did more to raise the profile of the EU and put a proactive and positive impression forward of what Brussels was attempting to do, than anything else I have witnessed while I have been a Member of this Parliament.
We showed that we were listening and that we would take action over their concerns.
We spoke to farmers, the tourism industry, people and rural businesses.
Let us be clear about what a future strategy must contain.
We must have proper checks on the readiness and the value of our contingency plan.
Contingency plans must be checked and re-checked, rehearsed and re-examined so that we are not in the unprepared state we were in at the last outbreak.
We must have the resources, knowledge and personnel to react quickly.
We must use vaccination as a first method of dealing with an outbreak, at the same time, in conjunction with and alongside slaughter.
We must not rule out the use of slaughter.
There are rumours circulating that the Council is backing away from the use of vaccination, downgrading it on the scale of its importance.
Vaccination is not the only tool in our armoury, but it must be fully and effectively used from the beginning of any outbreak.
We also need to reassure the consumer about vaccinated meat products and develop and research more new vaccines.
We must never again see the mass slaughter of ten million animals - our citizens will not accept it.
Any future outbreak must allow vaccinated animals to remain in the food chain to prevent such a terrible waste of resources.
We must never again allow political interference to dictate how we attack an outbreak.
We must never see the funeral pyres which remain so vivid in the memories of all who witnessed them both in person and on our TV screens.
Finally, we must not become complacent.
There is no doubt that whilst the Commission has tightened up on personal imports, which I welcome, we are still wide open to the disease entering the EU.
My own government is taking a reckless approach to it.
After an outbreak that brought our rural communities to their knees, we only have four sniffer dogs to try and prevent contaminated meat entering the country.
This is folly and, say what you will, it is simply unacceptable.
We must have a concerted, organised and united approach to prevent illegal imports.
We, as governments across the EU, must put in place the appropriate resources to do the job: manpower, money and, dare I say it, sniffer dogs.
Finally, we must fight the disease in conjunction with the farming communities, not in spite of them.
We cannot ride roughshod over them as we did in 2001.
We have to gain their trust, show our commitment, and then we will be able to keep the terrible disease out of the EU.
Mr President, I rise as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
For that reason alone I will not follow Mr Parish in his more provocative remarks.
I advise him to look up the number of animals for which compensation was claimed before he uses his total figures for mass slaughter - as hideous as that undoubtedly was.
I simply want to say to the rapporteur that the way in which he did this job, both on the temporary committee and subsequently, is a template for the way in which this work should be done.
He was considerate, courteous and thorough.
I think the UK Government, which found itself in the eye of the storm, would also apply those words to him and appreciated this.
The Commission has moved, in large measure, to implement what we in the temporary committee recommended.
The arguments will always return to the exact relationship between stamping out through culling and vaccination - whether to live or die - in a society that both cherishes its FMD-free status, yet has proper moral scruples about the means in extremis employed to return to it.
These arguments will move with the science.
We are right to prioritise the research needed.
I would like some kind of estimate from the Commissioner as to how that research is progressing.
The epidemic moved with terrifying speed.
As has been said during the current SARS outbreak, the virus had its own rage to survive.
It was awful to see that speed.
Movement restrictions were not effective in the early stages.
We had 50 000 sheep on the move, largely untraced, when the virus struck.
I am sure we all agree that the mass culls that followed should never be seen again.
They traumatised whole communities.
Member States now have a wider discretion as to how they control the outbreak and the sequence to be followed in emergencies, from stamping out to vaccination.
I would like to emphasise, as Mr Blokland did - and it came through in our report - that there is a moral dimension to this.
Unless we have an ethical element in farming it is unlikely that we will have commendation in the future for measures that we might take the next time this happens.
As far as our own committee is concerned, we needed to emphasise three things to the Commission.
One is faster updating of contingency plans subject to practicability.
We need to look at the seamless nature of the world we live in, in terms of the buying and selling of foodstuffs.
Perhaps the Commissioner could say a word on what the FVO is doing about looking at the movement of foodstuffs into the country, given some of the problems we have had in recent times.
We need to be able to tell the public, as consumers, much more forcefully why it is that meat from vaccinated animals is safe to eat.
We cannot have a pro-vaccination policy unless we have public acceptance of it, which goes with that greatly changed consumer standpoint.
While our own Food Standards Agency argued this case in Britain, it found itself confounded by the negativity of too many producers and too many retailers.
Finally, we should take special measures, as others have said, to preserve rare breeds, an indispensable part of the animal gene pool, so that they are not swept away by some new pandemic.
I am sure that the Commissioner can appreciate the need to be practical.
He has shown that.
The tenor of this debate will be set by the degree to which we can also preserve our humanity and life in all its infinite variety.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish firstly to say to the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, that I have rarely been involved in work on a report that has been handled as diligently and fairly as Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler has handled this report.
It is simply admirable, and I want to say thank you.
At the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that, by now abandoning the non-vaccination policy, we are creating changes that will be very significant for those countries that export extensively to third countries.
I want at the same time to say that foot and mouth disease is so infectious that anyone who believes that all the problems are solved merely by opening the way for vaccination and who is also sure of being able in future to contain a future outbreak of the disease will have to think again, for that is not the way foot and mouth disease works.
I therefore choose to go on believing that it is the non-vaccination policy that we shall continue to work towards, and I acknowledge that the situation will meanwhile be one in which we shall use vaccine, as we did for example in the Netherlands, under the very proficient administration of the Dutch.
Ring vaccination did prove effective as a way of containing the disease.
In that connection, it is also important for me to support what was said by my colleague in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Mr Mulder, namely that it is important for the vaccinated animals not to remain in the food chain but to be removed from it.
That is not something for which there appears to be a majority right now, but it must be remembered in this regard that the vaccinated animals are of course disease carriers, and, given that fact, it would be a disaster if any of these animals were to pass on the disease.
I should also like to point out that there can be no question of imagining, as is done for example in Amendment No 11, that milk and meat from vaccinated animals can be sold freely throughout the EU.
In this area, we must be very clear in demanding regionalisation so that, if such milk and meat is to be sold, it is within, and not across, national borders.
Although I am aware that this is not Commissioner Byrne's area, I shall again draw attention to the fact that there is a need for export agreements, particularly with the Americans, so that we contain the losses there might be in connection with a future epidemic of foot and mouth disease and, especially, in connection with possible vaccination.
It would not of course be of help to anyone if, instead of exporting fresh produce to third countries, we were to close the doors, with the result that these products were to end up on the European market at sharply falling prices. That is not of course what farmers need in this situation.
There is also a real need for the Commission to undertake serious regionalisation and to conclude agreements with the Americans.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Commissioner Byrne for the commitment he has shown to the work of the parliamentary Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth and, indeed, for ensuring that the main findings of our report have featured prominently in the Commission's directive.
I also thank Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler for working so tirelessly on the matter since day one.
To have reached this final stage is a positive advertisement for the European Parliament.
When the temporary committee visited regions affected by this terrible disease, including my own country of Wales, we were told by people how grateful they were that the European Parliament had set up this inquiry as they had no other way of voicing their grievances within their own Member States.
This directive makes several valuable recommendations relating to the tightening of import controls - which has already been mentioned - setting contingency plans, establishing expert groups and moving emergency vaccination to the forefront of disease control, in line with the welcome changes made to international trade rules.
Central to the UK Government's mishandling of the 2001 crisis was its lack of a clear-cut policy on whether and when vaccination should have been used.
This led to the unacceptable continuous culling, which was based on flawed scientific evidence, and the blinkered decision to reject vaccination.
In the event of future outbreaks, slaughtering should be limited to infected premises, based on sound laboratory tests.
We owe it to our rural communities everywhere to learn the lessons of 2001.
Mr President, there are situations in which emergency vaccination is very sensible, but there is no reason for causing difficulties in terms of exports.
The problem arises due to the fact that the veterinary borders have been removed in connection with the introduction of the internal market.
The EU has become a single veterinary zone.
Denmark has lost its independent veterinary status.
Understandably enough, the United States and Japan also regard the EU as a single country.
They close the door to the import of pork from throughout the EU if there has been vaccination against foot and mouth disease in one location in the EU.
Each year, the EU exports approximately 1.5 million tons of pork at a value of EUR 4 000 million.
Of this, Denmark alone is responsible for 600 000 to 700 000 tons.
If the exports were instead to be transferred to the EU's internal market, this would mean an increase approaching 10% in the supply of pork.
This would lead to a total collapse of the market throughout the EU.
The Commission should, from the beginning, have taken account of the risk of third countries' introducing trade restrictions.
The Commission has not remotely taken on board this loss of exports that occurs if no advance measures are taken regarding third countries' acceptance of exports.
It must of course be possible to change the vaccination strategy, partly so that what are otherwise good intentions are not pursued at the expense of the EU's absolutely vital export interests.
I must therefore call upon the Commission to ensure it takes account of all the factors - including those relating to trade - in evaluating what rules should apply in future.
There is a lot to suggest that veterinary regionalisation should be introduced, involving a kind of 'export pocket' free from vaccinated animals, from which exports could be made even if there were foot and mouth disease outbreaks elsewhere in the EU, with corresponding vaccination against the disease.
Finally, Commissioner, do you intend to comply with my requests?
Mr President, I am very alarmed that no real effort has been made to act on the experiences that the UK had during the devastating outbreak of foot and mouth.
We have a right, in this Parliament, to demand that there ought to be real action right across the European Union to put into place a strategy to defeat this terrible disease, should it again break forth.
In Northern Ireland there are no such structures in place.
The veterinary experts have told me that they are quite appalled at the apathy of the government in this field.
How different this experience has been in the United States of America.
There, they have periodical dry-run operations and the strategy nationwide is tested, weaknesses are discovered and the fine-tuning of the whole programme is updated.
This, I believe, is necessary in the European Union.
I trust that all governments will be urged to accept that necessity.
We in the UK know the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak and how it brought both agriculture and tourism to their knees.
We know the emotional pain and human tragedy that resulted, largely because of the controversy about vaccination.
I welcome this report's dedication to a policy to vaccinate to live.
I believe that policy is much better than the one of 'don't vaccinate but rather burn'.
The Commission's proposals have been sensible, following the lines of the European Parliament's temporary committee.
I strongly believe that Parliament should endorse the opinion of the report before it.
I congratulate the rapporteur and the committee for bringing it forward.
The report points to a real way forward, in the fields both of preparation and deterrence.
The alarming rise of the incidence in animals of tuberculosis and brucellosis highlights the need for immediate action against these diseases.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really do not want to start without thanking our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, for the truly outstanding work he has done with this report, but, today, I want also to thank Mrs Redondo, who chaired the committee on foot and mouth disease and who managed it with a great deal of circumspection.
Fundamentally, I believe, both the Commission proposal for a directive and this report are to be welcomed.
It is fortunate that the proposal submitted by the Commission takes on board most of the demands made by Parliament's committee on foot and mouth disease, which, on 17 December 2002, adopted a resolution calling for the revision of the European Union's existing policy on the control and prevention of foot and mouth disease.
As the contributions to today's debate make clear, the next epidemic is already rampant in Europe, and I believe that it really is five minutes to midnight when it comes to our changing the European Union's policy, for we have to avoid in future any epidemic spreading and becoming the tragedy that we saw in Great Britain in 2001.
We are not talking here only in terms of the grave financial losses sustained by farmers, especially in the upstream and downstream sectors, or about the damage to rural areas and the profound public disquiet; this is, rather, an image issue for European farmers such as ourselves and for the agricultural policy as a whole.
One important point that has been taken on board is the retention of the ban on prophylactic vaccination, which strikes me as pointless until such time as there is a vaccine that covers all seven serotypes and the 80 subtypes within them.
There is a need for research into this to be extended and improved.
A further, and decisive, point is that the importance of emergency vaccination is recognised, so that it is no longer seen as a last resort.
In conclusion, it has to be said that the disease, which spread to such an immense extent in Great Britain that we all still shudder to recall it, could have been prevented.
All that was needed was for appropriate control measures to be taken and for the existing vaccination requirements to be adhered to in the Member State in question.
The one thing that has become perfectly clear is that the Member States really do have to discharge the responsibilities placed on them by the Treaties.
I trust that we have learned our lessons from the past in order to be able, next time, to act with more responsibility and coordination.
Never again must there be a catastrophe - for a catastrophe is what it was - of these dimensions.
Mr President, I wish to join the others in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, for an excellent job well done.
It is one of the few areas in which I have noticed that all political groups in this House had very little difference at the end of the day, and certainly our mission was exactly the same.
I thank him and colleagues who were on the temporary committee for the first year.
I should like to thank Mr Sturdy, Mr Parish and my UK colleagues who were at the forefront in promoting the original establishment of the temporary committee, for reasons that will be obvious.
It is not often that I agree fully with my Northern Ireland colleague, Mr Paisley.
However, on this issue we would find very little to differ on, and I welcome his comments here this evening.
The outbreak of FMD in the European Union in 2001 was a disaster not only for agriculture but also for many related enterprises and organisations.
The outbreak demonstrated without question that the European Union's FMD risk-management policy, and the risk assessment on which that was based, needed to be reviewed.
Farmers, vets and politicians all shared the great concern of the general public over the death and destruction of millions of animals, of which many, if not most, were not infected with the disease.
There was huge psychological damage, in particular to farmers and their families when they had to depopulate or destroy their animals.
It is not just in the UK - the epicentre of the outbreak - but even in the Cooley Peninsula in Ireland, which had to be depopulated that to this day the psychological damage to the families concerned is absolutely immense.
While I do not support the return to routine or preventive vaccination, a review of vaccination policy is very appropriate, especially the use of emergency or fire-break vaccination to control the spread of an outbreak.
Further discussion with the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health, is urgently necessary to ensure that an infected country can regain its FMD-free status as soon as possible.
After the last case and after the slaughter of the last vaccinated animal it is necessary to regain FMD status.
In contrast to a colleague, Mr Busk, who has just spoken, I do not have problems with vaccinated animals entering the food chain.
However, as long as the OIE has concerns about exporting such animals for the food chain, we have to get in line.
Therefore, we need our scientists to get their heads together on this and resolve it.
FMD-vaccinated animals are not infectious when they get into the food chain.
We already vaccinate our cattle for a whole array of diseases and consume them daily.
Therefore we need to become rational in our approach to this particular issue.
Marker vaccines to distinguish vaccinated animals from animals carrying the virus will have a major role to play in this area in the future.
I would like to make a special plea to ensure that Member States' veterinary services are properly resourced.
With serious financial losses now for many years in livestock enterprises, we cannot take for granted any longer the existence of rural large-animal veterinary practices, especially in our remote areas, let alone the development of urgently needed herd-health surveillance programmes involving routine visits by practising vets.
The vet is in the front line of surveillance for indigenous and exotic diseases.
The one thing we can be sure of is not whether there is another outbreak of an exotic disease in the EU, but when.
I would also like to thank the Commission for acceding to my plea for a special protocol for non-susceptible animals, in particular equidae.
I refer to Annex VI on the restrictions on the movement of equidae in this area.
A few amendments were accepted at committee and I would urge the Commission to indicate that it would take them on board.
An emergency must be documented by a veterinary surgeon on call 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.
For the equestrian and racing industries, Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday Mondays must be covered for the movement of animals for breeding or for emergency operations or for competition purposes - because the horse does not carry, it is not susceptible.
The transport must be authorised by the competent authorities, but they must be contactable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
An on-call official veterinarian must be informed about the route prior to the departure of any horse transported in dedicated transport in an outbreak.
I declare an interest in the equestrian area.
I thank the Commission and the authorities concerned for including for the first time a protocol in an FMD contingency plan for a non-susceptible species.
Following my presentation of the Commission's proposal on Community measures for the control of FMD to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I was very pleased to learn that Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler had been appointed rapporteur for this dossier.
This prudent appointment ensured that the highly-valued expertise on FMD acquired by the temporary committee has been directly incorporated into your assessment of the proposed FMD directive.
At this stage, I should like to pay tribute to the officials in my own office - I do not normally do this - and point to the quick response of those, one of whom is here this evening, who, on that fateful night in February 2001, when informed by the competent authorities in the UK of this outbreak, at 9.30 p.m., were in a position to make sure that the competent authorities of all other Member States were aware of the outbreak by 10.30 p.m.
Their quick reaction contributed considerably to the containment of this disease.
This is true in circumstances where we deal with communicable diseases, whether animal or human diseases.
A fast response is of critical importance.
Containment saves the situation considerably.
Not surprisingly, the Commission's FMD proposal has prompted vigorous debate amongst all interested parties.
The proposal has been subject to in-depth analysis in the technical expert working groups chaired by the Greek Presidency in the Council.
The overall opinion emerging from various discussions has been positive.
The Commission has received wide support for the general policy laid down in this proposal, not least because it is a carefully considered, pragmatic reform, rather than a revolution.
The Commission notes with satisfaction the general support of this House for the increased emphasis on emergency vaccination.
This has also attracted the broad support of Member States.
I note, however, that some Members would have liked us to go even further in this regard, but to do so would have compromised the fundamental elements of choice and flexibility that we are aiming to promote.
We agree that disease preparedness must be enhanced and that contingency plans should be based on a worst-case scenario.
In addition, and perhaps more importantly, contingency plans must be regularly reviewed and subject to critical analysis through carefully prepared and realistic exercises.
In the report of the Committee on Agriculture, 48 amendments are proposed.
The Commission can, in fact, agree with 47 out of the 48 amendments tabled.
The Commission cannot agree to Amendment No 32 which, although in line with the report of the Scientific Committee of 1999, is against the current rules of the OIE.
I would however add that the Commission's proposal provides for rapid adaptation, should the OIE recommendations be modified.
On the additional amendments tabled for this plenary session, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 51, 52 and 53 in part.
In the international framework, the Commission is committed to addressing, at every suitable opportunity, the issue of regionalisation policy and to contribute to adaptation of the OIE Animal Health Code to reflect scientific and technological progress.
To proceed unilaterally would block international trade of EU animals and their products.
In this regard we hope to make progress within the next week at the General Session of the OIE.
Before concluding let me address one issue of particular concern - that of veterinary funding.
The proposal before us today does not address Community rules on the veterinary funds because the principles of our control policy have not changed.
Furthermore, a study on a possible future animal health insurance scheme is well advanced but not yet completed.
Finally, I would like to address some of the questions raised by a number of Members such as Mrs Corbey, who asked who is responsible for FMD vaccination.
That responsibility rests with the Member States.
However, as a matter of prudence, the Member States are advised to inform and get clearance from the Commission before embarking on this for a number of reasons, not least funding for compensation and also to ensure that there is an agreement with other Member States in the event of cross-border trade.
She asked me how we could ensure that supermarkets sell meat from vaccinated animals.
It is true to say that there is no law requiring the labelling of meat from vaccinated animals, but there is a requirement in respect of the stamping of carcasses of fresh meat but not in respect of other products.
This is an issue that needs to be addressed but I cannot see how this can be dealt with by regulation.
It is a matter for the free market.
Regarding Mr Mulder's question regarding insurance, this is being undertaken.
Work has been done and a report is anticipated.
Mr Whitehead asked me about research on vaccines.
I can assure him that work has been undertaken under the DG Research programme.
There will be a report on that issue in due course.
I thank Members for the speed with which they have delivered their opinion, thus paving the way for these new provisions on the control of FMD to come into force as soon as possible.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne did not answer my question about when the contract about research into better vaccines - marker vaccines, etc. against contagious animal diseases would be concluded.
Fortunately, he said that the insurance study is almost completed.
However, the study on market vaccines has not yet started.
When will it start?
I am happy to be able to tell Mr Mulder that quite an amount of work has been undertaken in relation to this research at the moment.
Public tenders have gone out.
I understand some of them have been finalised quite recently and I expect the others to be finalised imminently.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0066/2003) by Mrs Ferrer, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on capacity-building in the developing countries (2002/2157(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry to have to discuss this report this evening, at this late hour, when it was initially scheduled for Thursday, which could have enhanced this debate on development cooperation.
Unfortunately, however, this is the way things are.
Commissioner, the experience acquired over the past few decades in the field of development cooperation and the lack of significant results in this field have highlighted the need for a change in the focus of development policies, in order to improve the effectiveness of aid, reduce the chasm between rich and poor countries and thus fulfil the objectives of sustainable development that we have set for ourselves.
There are certainly many and varied factors preventing the poorest countries from being able to board the development train and win the battle to eradicate poverty: external debt, first and foremost, the great shame hanging over developing countries, the fratricidal wars that devastate so many poor countries, the AIDS pandemic, corruption at every level of public life, but this failure can also be explained by the use of foreign models and the fact that development objectives have in the past been set without the participation of those receiving aid.
We should not be surprised, therefore, that the idea of capacity-building as an essential factor in improving the results of development policies has been gaining ground, in particular since the Rio Declaration of 1992, which recognises the fact that a country's ability to follow the path of sustainable development is largely determined by the capacity of its people and institutions.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation, which fully agrees with this principle, therefore organised a public hearing a few months ago on capacity-building and then agreed that a report should be drawn up on the subject, for which I was given responsibility as rapporteur.
It should be noted that this report was unanimously approved, since it was unanimous in committee that capacity-building should constitute a fundamental element in development cooperation, essential to ensuring effective aid.
In order better to understand the scope of the proposals contained in the report, I believe it should be specified that, in my eyes, capacity-building is first and foremost a new form of understanding and, above all, implementing development cooperation policy which requires a long-term global strategy that is individually tailored for the various players according to the different environments represented by their society.
This strategy should aim to improve skills and the conditions required for a country to be able to improve its levels of economic and social growth.
All this should take place in support of national efforts to be carried out by each country for itself based on the plan drawn up by each country according to their specific interests and needs along the lines of what is being done, in particular, with strategy documents for each country.
The European Union and its Member States - although not only them, but all international donors - should therefore review their cooperation methods and change the focus of their development policies so that capacity-building, as a participative process based on appropriation, constitutes the basis for the policy, with the aim of enabling individuals, as well as bodies within civil society, to develop their potential and the skills that should allow them to achieve the development objectives that they themselves must also be in a position to determine.
We should provide them with the means - in a word - to play a leading role in their own development, to which they have a right.
In other words, help them to improve their institutional capacities and achieve the level of training that is necessary in order to open the door to development.
We should also help them to diversify and improve production capacity, develop infrastructures and the macroeconomic framework required to attract investment, provide them with technical assistance to increase trade capacity so that they can integrate world trade and thus share in the profits it generates.
A development cooperation policy focused along these lines constitutes the most suitable instrument for progress to be made towards eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development for all.
That, Commissioner, is why there is a need - I would say an imperative - for a Commission communication in this regard, to instigate action in the field of development aid from the European Union and its Member States and also the various formulas contained in the motion for a resolution on which we are to vote.
For it is only by means of these policies, by providing the necessary means for capacity-building, that we shall be able to put an end to the injustice which means that 20% of the world's population enjoys 80% of the world's wealth, while 80% are deprived of the right to live in the dignity that is the inalienable right of each individual.
. Mr President, Mrs Ferrer's report provides very interesting ideas for developing the concept of capacity building and to describe the means to implement it.
This is an area we have identified as a priority for our development cooperation.
It is the main element in our overall policy statement dating back to November 2000, and adopted also by Parliament.
We are working to improve the strategic approach to European Union action on capacity building and are approaching it from the perspective of good governance.
The report is therefore timely, because it comes as we prepare the communication on governance in Community development policy.
This being said, capacity building is typically an area that has to be mainstreamed in all our interventions, and is increasingly recognised as a key factor in all areas of development.
Our communication will give priority attention to three specific topics - governance in general, political governance and economic governance - three themes which we see as part of the broader agenda of capacity building.
I fully agree with the approach followed in Mrs Ferrer's report on searching for a definition.
Particularly relevant are the need to adapt capacity building to the context and the rather broad notion of capacity building, which includes not only the 'classic' inputs such as 'training and materials', but also a range of innovative aspects.
The reference to the need to avoid imposing foreign models is also highly welcome - ownership has to be promoted.
The different priority sectors mentioned also show an innovative approach to institutional development; the security issue, in particular, has indeed become one of the new political concerns.
The specific problem that we face is that of setting priorities within the area of capacity building, linked to the scaling-up of activities.
The need for capacity building is accepted everywhere.
There is interest in the issue and, in principle, there is a readiness to provide funds.
However, when one takes a snapshot of what happens in practice in this area, one sees a patchwork of uncoordinated activities, usually very small-scale and attached to specific projects or programmes.
If we really want to promote ownership, this situation has to change.
What is needed is improved priority-setting by developing countries themselves and more coordination and harmonisation among donors to promote activities on a larger scale and over the longer term.
In fact, the formula I keep using in addressing what needs to be done on capacity building is that instead of having it as an additional measure here and there in the actions we are implementing, we have to turn capacity building into hard-core, big-money development cooperation and not shy away also from agreeing to cover recurrent costs as part of the capacity building effort.
Finally, I agree with the criticism of the problems in assessing the impact of the Community-financed interventions within our statistics in the Commission.
This problem is being addressed.
It is one of many aspects of the same problem that we are working on.
The communication will deal with this issue by devoting a chapter to current practices within the Commission and lessons learned.
The recommendations of the rapporteur in this respect are very welcome.
I conclude by once again thanking the rapporteur.
Mr President, capacity-building in developing countries is one of the new concepts underpinning the current cooperation policy, based on the appropriation of development processes by societies receiving aid.
It is an endogenic process, by means of which a society increases its social capital, through the activities of individuals, organisations and institutions, in order to carry out its duties and set and achieve its objectives in every field.
It is therefore a very broad concept, which has been effectively summarised in the report we are discussing today, for which I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer.
However, although capacity-building in the developing countries should affect all aspects of development, it must be based on essential capacities, which, in the opinion of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are, on the one hand, organising civil society and strengthening democratic institutions, and, on the other, building individual capacity through education.
All this should of course take place through certain minimum development requirements that guarantee the survival of the people. This means compliance with certain minimum basic health standards.
The organisation of civil society refers to the structure of citizenship and citizen participation in social and decision-making processes.
All this should take place within the context of an endogenic dynamic and external aid, as we have requested of the Commission, should therefore be devoted to strengthening basic organisations, urban and rural citizens' associations, local NGOs and traditional social institutions, more than to direct aid to the budgets of the countries receiving aid.
This evening the Commissioner has recognised that this report is timely and necessary and that it effectively details the capacity-building that must take place for development.
Strengthening democratic institutions is one of the matters pending cooperation in general and Community cooperation in particular.
Democracy goes far beyond periodic elections and requires the implementation of flexible participation and dialogue mechanisms between citizens and institutions, as well as their democratisation, based on the concepts of good governance, transparency and combating corruption.
Individual capacity-building through education is the ultimate capacity-building system.
The Socialist Group considers education to be a sine qua non condition for development and reducing poverty, as we pointed out in the Community budget.
With this own-initiative report, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to join large aid organisations in including capacity-building among the general elements of its cooperation policy.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer once again, as well as all the groups who contributed, with their amendments, to ensuring that this report contains guidelines for updating and improving the Community development cooperation policy.
The next item is report (A5-0126/2003) by Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on education and training in the context of poverty reduction in developing countries (COM(2002) 116 - C5-0333/2002 - 2002/2177(COS)).
. (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, 'DOUBLE NOW' cried 200 European schoolchildren last week in the Chamber of the European Parliament in Brussels.
They were referring to the part of the Commission budget for development cooperation that is devoted to primary education.
Currently, that is only 4%, and it must therefore be doubled to 8%, hence the famous 'double now' slogan.
Education is an important means, if not the most important means, of combating poverty.
Literacy breaks the vicious poverty circle in which many families have been imprisoned for generations.
If countries are to develop further, they need an educated population.
Education is also the key to improving the position of women.
Across the world, 113 million children are still not receiving any education, and approximately two-thirds of these are girls.
In 2000, the international community in North and South agreed that, by 2015, all children should be able to attend school.
If that Millennium Development Goal, education for all, is to be achieved, we need more funds between us: an estimated EUR 8 billion extra to be able to educate every child by 2015.
Incidentally, that is the same amount in total over the next few years as the war in Iraq cost in three weeks.
Primarily, of course, developing countries themselves have to make approximately 20% of their budgets available for basic social services such as education and health care.
The North must commit itself to the aim of together having produced additional resources for education by 2015.
Some countries have to increase their total contribution, whilst others, within theirs, have to move funds over to education.
Without that commitment on the part of North and South, all our combined efforts at effective poverty reduction have little chance of success.
Fortunately, the European Union has a special responsibility in the field of education.
The Commission and the Member States together constitute the world's largest donors active in development cooperation.
Therefore, they have to - and do - take the lead in policies aimed at sustainability and long-term solutions.
Europe's share of the figure of EUR 8 billion per year mentioned earlier is available.
Much of it is lying dormant within the European budget, or can be released by the movement of funds.
As the Commissioner knows, the Parliament is no advocate of granting budget support just like that, because money intended for education, for example, is then often used for completely different purposes, as we saw from the recent example of money being spent on defence in Uganda.
Instead we advocate sectoral support, whereby not only the Finance Ministers are involved but, in this case, also the Ministers for Education.
In addition, my report advocates an active role for teaching unions and parental organisations in the development of education plans in the developing country.
After all, it is not we who develop a country; it develops itself.
In response to our questions yesterday, Commissioner Nielson said that the Commission has, to date, made EUR 1.3 billion available for the next five years.
That is a significant and important start.
I also understood from his answers that the Commission is in the process of systematically looking into where, within the dormant funds, further possibilities lie for achieving a considerable increase.
In addition to the funds within the ninth European Development Fund that are to be devoted to education, still more is needed if all the education targets are really to be achieved.
Progress is too slow; we need to speed it up considerably.
Priority must be given to doubling the budget for primary education, and, as part of this, it is equally important that the Commission's Education for All Fast Track Initiative should play a leading role.
The Fast Track Initiative is an initiative of Unesco, the World Bank and various donors, including the Commission.
Developing countries - Mauritania and Niger, to name but two - receive accelerated, supplementary funding on the basis of education proposals.
My report urges the Commission to convert its pledges into tangible financial resources.
I am enormously pleased that my report can already be regarded as outdated on that point on account of the Commission's pledge to finance the first seven countries.
I appreciate that very much.
It is a success for us all.
Unfortunately, on many other points my report is very current, and by no means outdated.
There remains to be addressed the important issue of girls, who still constitute the majority of the 113 million children not receiving any education.
Many children still cannot attend school because they are working, whether voluntarily or against their will.
Education is still not provided free of charge in many cases, which means that many parents cannot afford to send their children to school.
In addition, education in developing countries has to contend with the loss of teachers due to AIDS, with an absence of, or too little, reading material, and with schools that are difficult to reach.
In the post-conflict situations in Afghanistan and Iraq, education remains imperative, precisely because these are situations in which reconstruction is to be achieved from devastation and a heap of rubble.
Fortunately there is a fair amount of good news, too.
Benin and Gambia recently abolished school fees for girls, and Eritrea, for years ravaged by war, was recently awarded the International Literacy Prize.
My report asks the Commission to report back in a year's time on the implementation of this resolution, if it is adopted tomorrow, and I am assuming with some confidence that it will be.
I hope that that progress report will be full of good news, and I consider it a tremendous stroke of luck for those sympathetic to the cause of education that the Commission has been prepared to make that EUR 1.3 billion available.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say that last week it was 200 children in Brussels, this week it is in excess of 10 000 cards and petitions from Europeans sent to the Commission Representations in support both of my report and of the Commissioner.
It is good that the public is aware of what we are doing here and that we are all proud of the work the European Union does.
'Double now': that was the slogan, and I shall keep saying it.
I would like to thank Parliament, and Mr Van den Berg in particular, for the extensive work and interest put into the examination of the Commission's communication on education and training.
Education has a major impact on reducing poverty and our purpose is to maximise it.
This is in line with the Millennium Development Goals and Education for All objectives.
Ownership by our partner countries and complementarity with other donors are also vital aspects.
In fact, when we talk about this, not only focusing on the actions of the Commission, we should take a tour around Europe and clarify what each of our Member States is doing, because complementarity is supposed to work both ways.
Even in Maastricht this is a common activity and not a Commission-only activity.
Of course it is a privilege for the Commission to have an organised dialogue with Parliament on all occasions.
We support education both through budgetary support and sector funding.
I would agree with Mr Van den Berg about the special quality of sector programme funding but we are, in the name of complementarity, very happy that the Commission can provide budget support.
Where we do it we try to link it to policies that have also been worked out and contributed to by other donors, thus improving the quality of the recipient or partner country's actions.
The Commission's communication on this subject also opens up the possibility for the Commission to fund recurrent expenditure in education budgets of partner countries.
This has been a missing element.
It is nice to build a teacher training college, but if we only build the bricks, and not the curriculum and especially the professors' salaries, we will never meet the challenge.
At the same time, we must make sure that resources reach those who truly need them and create results.
Our partner countries have to improve the efficiency and quality of their education systems and, as regards donors, a flexible attitude toward financing mechanisms is necessary.
The first priority in our education policy is basic education - six-year primary school.
This is in line with the Millennium Development Goals on education, which give priority to universal primary education.
The second priority is to ensure a balanced strategy encompassing secondary and higher education, vocational training and adult literacy.
Work-related training is of particular importance in countries that have attained an acceptable level of schooling as a first step.
We also included additional policy priorities for our support for education.
In particular, more attention should be given to the impact of HIV/Aids on education systems and the role of education in preventing HIV/Aids and in improving health in general.
Furthermore, the Community policy focuses on the needs of the poorest countries and poorest people, with particular attention to women, orphans and children in conflict and post-conflict areas.
The communication highlights that resources for education and training must be substantially increased, so the slogan about doubling the effort is very meaningful.
The international community should give preference to countries that have the most clear-cut commitments to Education for All.
This is the important outcome of the whole effort in Education for All, not only highlighting it but also creating some sort of peer pressure on all concerned to give this higher priority.
Education budgets should be geared towards vulnerable populations and equity in access to education: primary education should be compulsory and free, girls and boys should have the same opportunities, rural areas should be given priority, indigenous populations should be supported and the special educational needs of orphans or disabled should be met.
Finally, the Commission highlights the importance of a shift in the monitoring of education, focusing more on outcomes and results.
Clear indicators are being developed using and reinforcing our partner countries' own monitoring systems in close coordination with other donors.
This is an issue we have been discussing in our dialogue between the Commission and Parliament.
We have seen some real progress in improving these monitoring systems.
We work with other donors to agree on common, but country-specific indicators.
It is not possible, or desirable, to evaluate the impact of a single donor's activity in isolation from the country's activity and other donors' operations.
In the coming years we will be able to have a better-founded discussion because we will have figures available in order to clarify our position.
We can see a place for a mix of input and output targets, but we do not support a specific target as a percentage for the education sector. This is in respect of the reality of ownership.
There is no disagreement about the wish for increasing it, but we cannot give a specific figure.
Finally, I thank the European Parliament and the rapporteur for this resolution and the strong commitment to promoting education it always demonstrates.
Mr President, we feel the Commission Communication is highly relevant and Mr van den Berg's report adds certain contributions that enrich the original text.
He has shown flexibility by accepting the majority of the amendments tabled, and, on behalf of my parliamentary group, I would like to say that we shall vote for the report.
In fact, many fora and macroconferences have already been held in relation to the need to increase efforts to eradicate poverty, which is undoubtedly the most serious problem we face.
It is something of a coincidence that, with the resources now available, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives set for 2015.
It is good, however, that, within our limited means, we are focusing our attention on health and education, which are so closely linked and interdependent.
It has been clearly shown that health and education, education and health, are the best policies for development, that they enable millions of human beings to escape poverty.
It is true that some progress is being made, as stated by the rapporteur.
In Africa, for example, 60% of children today attend school, which means that 40% are still not attending.
In other words, 45 million children are condemned to illiteracy and poverty, probably for life.
New difficulties have arisen in some countries.
The tragedy of child soldiers means that, in some West African countries, mothers prevent their sons from attending school for fear that they will be kidnapped and not return home, as we have seen recently, last week, in Ivory Coast, in a report by various agencies and other NGOs present on the ground.
The problems of gender segregation are still causing an unsustainable situation in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries.
In Latin America investment in education has dropped alarmingly over the past few years of crisis throughout the region, and this affects ethnic minorities in particular, as the Commissioner has pointed out today, in Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, but also in countries such as Argentina, which until now had an excellent education system but is now moving backwards.
By attending school, both boys and girls can and should receive a basic education that contributes to improving health, not just in relation to HIV and the ways in which it is transmitted - as the rapporteur reminds us - which, although it is a serious problem, is no more serious than other problems that could be alleviated more cheaply. This is the case of food hygiene, to cite just one example.
I feel it is particularly necessary for international financial organisations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to review their criteria and make them more flexible in order to promote free, universal education.
That is now one of the priorities we must address and try to achieve some progress in this specific area.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since I was the draftsman of the opinion of the committee on women's rights and equal opportunities on this report, I should like first of all to offer my sincere thanks to Mr van den Berg for his excellent work and of course for having adopted portions of our committee's recommendations.
So what is the situation?
We have a good report, we have a good rapporteur, we have a highly-motivated Commissioner here among us, and many committed people in the field, overseas aid workers, and educationalists.
Yet there are a number of infuriating aspects, because everything takes so long.
The clock is ticking and yet I see so many organisations in the field that have to beg in order to be able to build schools and pay teachers.
We have a long road ahead of us.
The right to education and access to education are often empty words in developing countries.
That is right: there are still 113 million children who do not attend school and most of them are girls, as Mr van den Berg has already said.
They have to help with the housework, they have to contribute to the daily provision of food for the whole family, they have to look after the infants, they have to sell any leftovers at market and they have to fetch drinking water.
That means that they have no time to devote to themselves.
I can therefore wholeheartedly endorse the conclusions of this report, namely that education is the key to combating poverty.
Only through education can a country develop, only through an adequately educated population can a country progress.
Give a girl or a woman education and you are educating the whole family.
We also all know that equal opportunities for women are not only achieved by changing legislation and social conditions.
No!
It happens through education.
Participation of women in all sectors of society and the achievement of general social, cultural and economic progress begin with reasonable qualitative and quantitative education.
We have already seen this in Europe.
Only when women were given reasonable schooling and access to education did emancipation take off in all sectors of society, including politics.
But it is a long road.
As the rapporteur rightly says in the notes to his report, educated women have more opportunities for improving the economic situation of themselves and their family, and even down to their choice of husband.
The individual personal development of women also offers more protection against exploitation in all its forms, including prostitution, forced or otherwise, and human trafficking, particularly trafficking in women and children.
I have, despite this, three further observations.
The time frame indicated in this report is in my view somewhat unclear.
The financial consequences are not properly set out.
And I therefore hope that the Commission, jointly with the Member States, will set to work in a coordinated way to achieve the objectives contained in the statement of the Commission.
Secondly the problem of AIDS, and finally, in conclusion, education, which as Commissioner Nielson said at the outset, must be adapted to the local culture.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking my colleague Mr van den Berg most warmly for his splendid report and, of course, also for his other activities, such as education for all.
As is set out in this report, the proportion of people who are illiterate is depressingly high in many countries, particularly in Africa, where there are few opportunities, especially in sparsely-populated areas.
As it would, in desert or other uninhabited areas, be unrealistic to build a large number of schools near to where people live, we have to take a good look at other solutions to reduce the educational deficit.
This is one of the things Mr van den Berg takes up in his report, proposing, for example, the setting-up of mobile schools, which are of particular importance in providing basic education.
In this context too, though, I will come back to the subject of modern information and communication technologies, the use of which enables distances to be overcome, the digital gap to be crossed, and education to become more widespread.
It is certain, though, that in the long term, the most important mass medium is radio, which could - and should - be even more widely used as a means of providing education than it has been so far.
The example of what is done in the Australian outback can certainly not be followed exactly in African countries, but is one from which one can learn, and it too must form part of any strategy for education.
I am glad that I do not have to point out the need to take especial account of girls and women in all educational endeavours.
In this report, at any rate, this has become a generally accepted fact.
It is not, however, generally known that education - particularly basic education - conducted in the predominant regional languages results in a marked increase in the desire for education and reduces parents' misgivings about sending their children to school.
This is where we must help with the investment in appropriate teaching material, play our part in promoting the education of teachers and contributing to the dissemination of knowledge that relates to local interests and is therefore an indispensable necessity in terms of raising the consciousness of civil society.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for your Communication and congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work concerning this fundamental issue of education and training in the context of reducing poverty.
This is not the first time Parliament has addressed this matter and I do not think it will be the last, and not only because for many of us - and for me, of course - achieving obligatory, free, high-quality universal education for all is the absolute priority of development cooperation.
I said that we will continue to talk about it because we are far from being able to achieve the objectives set in Dakar within the anticipated timescale, and we must therefore continue to be vigilant so that there are no further delays and, if possible, to ensure that at least the European Union and the Member States turn the commitments they have made into reality, into practical action, and that they decide not just to give the appearance of making education the priority in development, but really make it a priority, if we genuinely want a fairer society, in which each individual has the same choices and opportunities.
In a moment we shall discuss the report for which I am rapporteur, on capacity-building and its key role in improving the effectiveness of development aid.
How, though, can we think of capacity-building if 113 million children have never been to school and 150 million have not completed primary education, as the rapporteur points out in his report?
For this reason, I can but agree with the measures proposed to give education its rightful place in development cooperation policy and overcome the obstacles that prevent so many boys and girls from having access to education and, with it, the right to a better life.
In conclusion, I would like to ask the rapporteur to accept the amendment I tabled together with Mr Corrie, on behalf of the PPE-DE, requesting recognition for the State's obligation to guarantee the right to education and the role that the private sector can play in making the universal right to education, which sadly is currently the most violated right, a reality.
Mr President, education is a crucial weapon in the fight against poverty.
This might be common sense, but it is also a choice in terms of development strategies.
It is a question of priorities.
Some people claim that education is an optional extra and that what is really needed is work, even low paid work requiring no qualifications.
I believe that the low cost option tends to create perverse self-perpetuating mechanisms and that education is not an optional extra.
Education and training involve an effort to provide opportunities to all individuals, in order to give the greatest number of people the ability to form part of society and to participate in shaping that society.
The European Union has distinguished itself internationally for its adherence to this approach, both in Europe and with regard to those countries whose development we support.
We therefore welcome the Commission communication, the content of which fully warrants Parliament's support. We also congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
I simply wish to emphasise some points: the importance of the balance between quality and quantity in education, with a decisive commitment to eradicating illiteracy; the importance of involving local actors in the programmes we support, strengthening the practice of decentralised cooperation; a commitment to achieving gender balance - the education and vocational training of girls and women not only have a direct impact on the economy, but also in the medium term, on changing minds and even on liberating societies; the commitment to protecting education, even in times of conflict and following conflicts and the priority to normalise and improve education and training.
I would also add the need for further efforts with regard to training for the purpose of reintegrating ex-combatants.
Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's Communication, but above all I would like to congratulate Mr van den Berg on his excellent report, which I believe contains elements and measures that are essential in this task.
Mr President, 65 million girls in the world are deprived of their right to education and we are doing very little to resolve this situation.
The framework presented by the Commission, as stated by Mr van den Berg, contains very few proposals for action that specifically promote education for girls.
This in itself is serious, but it is even more serious if we take into account the fact that babies whose mothers have not had access to education are twice as likely to suffer from malnutrition and die before the age of five than those whose mothers have completed primary education.
Just one or two years of school for the mother reduce the infant death rate by 15%.
The education of mothers is far more effective in reducing malnutrition than any other measure, including the availability of food.
We know that women are a determining factor in development: better-trained women mean a higher level of development for their societies.
The strategy to combat poverty and, of course, the fight against AIDS can only be successful if specific emphasis is placed on education for girls.
Therefore, and because it is their fundamental right, education must be our priority: high-quality, obligatory, general, public, primary education lasting at least six years.
Education - I repeat - must be our priority.
That is the reason why I shall use my final seconds of speaking time to plead the case, as the rapporteur has done, against including education in the general agreement on trade and services at the next WTO negotiations.
The right of boys and girls to education cannot be subject to market laws.
The next item is oral question (B5-0092/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the protection of audio-visual performers.
A very good evening to you, Mr President, at this late hour, shortly before midnight, when we few are together.
I would just like to play a question and answer game with you.
Let us talk about an international hit film, a European film that has been a success around the world.
Let us take as our example the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.
Do you know who wrote the script?
No?
Shame on you!
Do you know who composed the music for it?
That neither!
Do you know who directed it?
Perhaps someone can remember?
No, they cannot.
Could you tell me who the film's backers were, or who its producer was?
Hmm.
I assume, though, that you have heard of its two stars, Hugh Grant and Andy McDowell.
We could carry on this question-and-answer game for ever and a day, whether with 'AmÃ©lie' or with 'The Pianist', it does not matter which.
Both directors and producers know all too well what is valuable to them about their actors - firstly, their talent, and secondly their name - whilst the public have quite personal reasons for their adulation of their celluloid heroes and heroines.
Successes at film festivals, the sought-after jangling of money in box-office tills, good viewer figures - all these things are directly dependent on a performer's quality as an actor and on his or her popularity with the public.
Let me clarify this by saying that I do not want to be misunderstood as attempting to assess the merits of any one of the creative professions in the film world; such is not my objective.
Film-making is a collaborative effort in which everyone is important, from the author to the producer.
All are doing their work, and all of them - with the exception of one professional group - are protected internationally.
Authors enjoy the protection of the Berne Convention and of the WIPO copyright treaties.
Producers and players of music are protected internationally by the Rome Convention and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty.
Even television stations, which are, primarily, more consumers than creators, have their rights guaranteed by the Rome Convention, and these are to be brought up to date by the WIPO treaty on the rights of broadcasting companies, something that is awaited, being urgently necessary, right and important.
Performers in films, though, are still not covered by the Performers and Phonograms Treaty.
Why?
Since 1996, negotiations within the WIPO have produced no favourable outcome for the heroes and heroines of the screen, who also got no result from the diplomatic conference in December 2000; nor did bilateral meetings between WIPO members achieve the desired objective.
The signatory states are now to meet again, in Geneva, from 18 to 20 June.
Performers in films have been waiting for years for a minimum of protection for their copyrights at an international level.
Whilst the EU has always acknowledged the economic importance of artistic output, we know all too well that what is today the work of an artist will tomorrow be part of our cultural heritage.
Within the EU, performers are protected by national legislation, but in most countries their rights are minimal or non-existent.
The failure to harmonise these rights internationally means that the performers in works originating in the EU are no longer protected, so that their free circulation is curtailed, with adverse effects on the distribution of European works at an international level.
All in all, then, these are hardly good conditions.
You will be familiar with the saying that 'the world is a village'.
Technological developments over recent years, media convergence and technological developments yet to come mean that this saying is more true than ever before.
Borders are eliminated and obstacles removed, legislators and all interested parties are faced with a plethora of challenges.
One of them is that of providing international protection for the work of performers, in respect of which the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport wishes to send Geneva a political signal.
As it is the Commission that will be representing the EU's Member States at the WIPO negotiations in June of this year, we would like to put the following questions to you and be given answers to them.
What view does the Commission take of this discrepancy between audiovisual performers and other creative artists?
Should they not enjoy the same international protection as all their colleagues in the music world?
Is the Commission able to inform us of the current position in the WIPO negotiations as regards audiovisual performers?
Thirdly, what actions does the Commission contemplate taking in order to do away with this discrimination against one single professional group?
The Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member that on the international level the rights of audio-visual performers, unlike the rights of authors, oral performers and phonogram producers, have not yet been updated and adapted to the new digital environment.
It recalls that the European Community and its Member States on 26 September 2002, at the WIPO General Assembly, reiterated their continued commitment to a meaningful update of the Rome Convention of 1961 as regards the protection of audio-visual performances in order to provide audio-visual performers with the international protection they deserve.
The Commission attaches great importance to finally settling this issue of unfinished business from the 1996 WIPO Diplomatic Conference, which adopted the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.
While some progress was made on this issue during the WIPO Diplomatic Conference on the Protection of Audio-visual Performances of December 2000, the existing differences could not be bridged during three weeks of intensive negotiations at the conference, nor during other contacts over the last two years.
The European Community and its Member States are committed to resolving this issue and can therefore support the organisation by the WIPO Secretariat of an ad hoc informal meeting in Geneva from 18 to 20 June 2003.
The Commission will actively participate at this meeting, where all participants, including WIPO member states, and interested intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, should have the opportunity to exchange views and information.
The issue of the protection of audio-visual performances should remain on the Agenda of the WIPO General Assembly for its session in September 2003.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am able to say, speaking on behalf of my group, that we strongly support this initiative, and I wish, through you, to extend warm thanks to the Commission, which evidently takes the same view.
The fact is that it is only together that we can reach the goal that is set before us - that of more protection for the rights of audiovisual artists.
I regret the fact that we did not have time to discuss these issues in committee, but time is pressing upon us, 18 June is getting closer, and it is right that we should today send a strong signal of our resolve to see the WIPO Treaties supplemented as soon as possible in order to bridge this gap and finally bring about the legal protection that audiovisual artists need.
I would like, therefore, to suggest that the Commission should forward to us, not only here in plenary in good time before the conference, but also after it in the relevant specialist committee, a report on the outcome of the negotiations and on the progress that - it is to be hoped - will have been achieved.
Should you come up against serious difficulties in preparing for the conference, I would say that we needed, as soon as the next meeting of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to receive a report on the subject from the Commission, that is to say, one with comprehensive information before and after the deliberations, so that we can in fact take this matter forward.
Please allow me to draw your attention to a point that I regard as crucial, but which does not put a question mark against our fundamental support.
I refer to the issue of the relationship of artists to those who play the most important part in transmitting their artistic performances, that is, the radio and television stations.
It is, I think, something of an over-simplification to say that the radio and television stations do not create works, but do nothing more than consume them.
What I would like to make clear in this regard is that what is at issue here is exclusivity.
This is, of course, primarily about artists and the protection of their work, and it is precisely that loophole that the law has to close, but I do think that it is also important that we should find a way of bringing on board potentially competing interests, so that they do not, overtly or covertly, tend to prevent us from finding a solution to the problems.
So we wish you good luck with the negotiations, and ask that you keep Parliament informed about what comes out of them.
Mr President, Mrs Echerer, having kept us all informed on a subject which too often is relegated to the sidelines of our debates here, has shown herself to be a late night performer deserving of her intellectual property and of successive royalties.
I have to declare an interest: as a broadcaster and a film producer in my time, I am still in receipt of hard-won royalties of one kind or another from some of these activities.
We are looking today in the world from which I emerged, at a situation where diversity of output is growing and where the power of those who control that output and buy the rights in it is also growing.
Those who currently do not have a negotiated position for more than one payment for their own activities are the losers in all of that.
For those in the audio-visual sector, this is a situation which has worsened, not improved.
As the questioner pointed out, music performers have a very strong union which over the years has been able to protect their position.
For producers there is now some degree of recompense and this can be negotiated over time.
No such rights apply in the case of audio-visual performers.
We know precisely what they face because without the protection of treaty they are constantly confronting a larger power - one which has all the power and all the regiments of lawyers you could possibly want - which can smash them down.
It took the great artist Peggy Lee nearly 20 years to outface the Disney Corporation to receive continuing payments for the voiceovers that she had done for some Disney cartoon films.
If it took her that long because she had no power of treaty to support her, what happens to the unknown and obscure artist who is placed in the position which the questioner has raised tonight?
I have one final question which perhaps will not be answered now, but which will recur in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
We know that on the eve of the WIPO informal meeting, we have one further chance to address this matter in September.
What happens if those negotiations fail, as the last ones and the ones before that failed?
What is the Commission going to do then?
Are we going to persist with this issue, or are we going to lay it aside with a regretful sigh while the power of those who own the rights and jealously maintain them is extended, and while the audio-visual artists remain confined in the shadows?
Mr President, I would like, first of all, to thank the Commission for its explanations and then also all the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, especially the coordinators, who were able to find a solution to this issue, something that the short time available made a matter of urgency.
In order to clarify my - perhaps somewhat over-simplified - statement to the effect that broadcasting companies were more consumers than creators, I would like to add that this is not a value-judgment, but simply a statement of fact.
They are both consumers and creators, but not exclusively so, and even so they can enjoy protection at international level, which film performers cannot.
On this I agree absolutely with Mrs Hieronymi.
This is a loophole that we should close, and I am glad that the various powers are making a united effort to do this.
When we talk about this international protection for audiovisual performers that we desire, what do we mean by it?
This is, primarily, about their moral rights.
Imagine that one of your speeches here in plenary were to be used without your authorisation, in a modified form, or perhaps even misused; as its author, you would be able to defend yourself, but, as a performer, you would have hardly any options, and only rarely the right to do anything about it.
A second aspect, and an important one, is the use of names. It is of immense importance to any creative artist that he should be able to put his name to his work, even if he is a mere cog, a part of the whole.
That is every bit as important to performers, including those outside the European Union.
Now, although one does not perhaps have to worry as much about the likes of Hugh Grant as about the thousands who are less prominent, even national film celebrities sometimes go through bad years, when it just happens that they are not on set for a single day all year.
That may be the luck of the artist and something that one cannot do anything about, but the rent still has to be paid.
What would help them is something to which they do, in fact, have every right - to have a share in the added value of successful productions - whether this be through the practice of buy-outs, through appropriate remuneration, or by way of the options that are open to us in the European Union.
I do think that all the audiovisual performers outside the EU, who do not enjoy these rights, are waiting expectantly for a signal from us.
I am glad that we are fighting this battle side by side, and I wish you good luck, or, to put it in thespian language: break a leg!
May the exercise be a success!
In conclusion of this debate, I have received a motion for a resolution
The next item is the proposal for a Council decision, by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the conclusion of an agreement in the form of a letter between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia on the ecopoint system applicable to Croatian transit traffic through Austria.
Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing the Commission's gratitude to Parliament for agreeing to deal with this matter under urgent procedure.
As you know, the agreement we are discussing tonight will establish the number of ecopoints allocated to Croatian trucks transiting through Austria for 2003.
This agreement, in the form of an exchange of letters, is foreseen in the Road Transit Protocol to the Interim Agreement between the EC and Croatia on Trade and Related Matters, which took effect on 1 March 2002.
The number of ecopoints and the other administrative aspects of the agreement were agreed in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment of Community trucks during the validity of the ecopoints system inside the Community.
I understand the agreement is already applied on a de facto basis.
I very much hope therefore that the European Parliament will be able to give a favourable opinion on the draft agreement.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Commissioner, most warmly for making it so clear that what we are dealing with here is not of interest to Austria alone, but that this is about the legitimate enforcement of treaties between the EU and our neighbouring states.
In fact, the Commission proposal for a Council resolution on the conclusion of an agreement between the EU and Croatia deals simply with a matter of routine, the object of which is to make the present system of ecopoints applicable to transit traffic through the Republic of Austria binding upon Croatia.
Everything that has been decided about this, Commissioner, is already the subject of an agreement under international law between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia, and must therefore be adhered to even now.
It is the dates applicable under the interim agreement concluded at that time that make the submission of a resolution such a matter of urgency.
As the Agreement, as the Commissioner has said, applies to the year 2003, then, as far as implementing this exchange of letters is concerned, it is already five minutes past midnight.
We Austrians - myself included - cannot, then, understand the arguments that are often adduced against it, as we are inclined to see this as another attempt at obstructing the quest for a replacement for the ninth Transport Protocol in the treaty with Austria at the time it acceded to the EU.
Such a thing should, though, be repudiated clearly and without equivocation.
Any discussion of the ecopoint system resulting from this Common Position of the Council must be conducted in serious and reputable manner.
What we will be voting on tomorrow will be the fulfilment of an international undertaking on the part of the European Union in a manner commensurate with the EU's status as a community based on law.
This is, therefore, a duty incumbent on all of us, and so I ask all members of this House to express their approval of the Commission proposal tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, as has already been said, this is about the consummation of a relationship that in fact already exists.
This being so, we were not entirely convinced that this was a matter of urgency, as it might have been possible to submit a motion on this subject at a rather earlier date.
That is why my colleagues and I have not been able to agree to this being treated as a matter of urgent and topical importance, but the majority have done so, and we will, of course, agree to the terms whereby the agreement is implemented.
Like Mrs Schierhuber, I would like to reiterate very briefly that the ecopoint rules as such keeps on being criticised, and I can also see that it cannot be of long-term duration, but what is at issue at present is to what extent these ecopoint rules can or should be extended until 2006, because we are working on the assumption that we will then at last have what is termed the infrastructure costs directive, by which is meant a set of general rules applicable not only to transit traffic, but also to HGV traffic on the roads in general, especially HGVs that are not very environmentally friendly.
The fact is that we have to see that the ecopoint rules have helped a great deal to make road traffic more environmentally friendly, quite simply because the fact that HGVs, which are worse in terms of the environment, use up more ecopoints has led many operators and haulage firms to acquire more environmentally-friendly HGVs, these being cheaper in terms of ecopoints and capable of making more journeys.
It was also very smart - and, one might say, ultimately consistent with market conditions - to enact a rule that, rather than prohibiting transit, prompted enterprises to acquire environmentally-friendly HGVs; and that, in fact, is what the present debate with the Commission and the Council is all about.
We are very grateful to the Commission for giving us a great deal of help in finding a transitional arrangement with which another technological advance can be achieved.
Even now, it is a matter of debate whether, if we impose more ecopoints on the HGVs in Euro-category 2 - that is, those that are very bad for the environment - while exempting entirely those in Euro-category 4, companies will promptly change over from Euro-category 2 to Euro-category 4 in order to use HGVs that are environmentally friendly and exempted for the purposes of transport.
Contrary to the impression - one that should not be given - that we are extending rules that are fundamentally wrong and unworkable, this arrangement with Croatia is one that will be good for the environment not only in Austria, but also throughout Europe, for these environmental effects make themselves felt not only in the Austrian Alps, but in Europe as a whole, and so I thank the Commission for its support, and we will, tomorrow, as a group, be voting to approve these rules.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Broad economic policy guidelines (2003-2005)
Mr President, I would like to start by explaining exactly what we are discussing. We are dealing with the economic guidelines, and in my view, there are three novel aspects to them.
Firstly, they are economic guidelines for three years, not just for one year. Secondly, they will be discussed alongside the employment guidelines.
Thirdly, we are holding these discussions at a time of recession. We have learnt this morning that the most powerful economy in the European Union has entered into recession.
These are therefore no ordinary economic guidelines.
Given these circumstances the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and myself in particular, were requested to draft a report promptly to allow the Commission and the Council to study it.
We were asked to try and arrive at the broadest possible consensus.
We have achieved this.
All the groups had to make compromises but we did manage to reach an agreement. I should like to take this opportunity of highlighting the splendid work of the spokespersons for the various groups.
Othmar Karas spoke on behalf of my group, Robert Goebbels spoke on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Carles-Alfred GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm spoke on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
I would also like to say to the Commission that whenever Parliament has been invited to respond, the response has invariably been helpful.
As suggested in the Poem of the Cid, a servant will always respond well to a good master.
I urge you to bear this in mind and to involve Parliament in the discussion of these economic guidelines. Amongst other things, this discussion will serve to put pressure on the Member States lagging furthest behind.
I shall now outline the key points of my report. Firstly, we want to know whether the current coordination mechanisms are adequate, or whether further measures are needed.
We understand that the Treaty states that national policies, supply policies and short-term policies are policies of common interest and should be coordinated. We are now three years behind with the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Whenever the Commissioner appears before us, he states that the delay is due to lack of application and due diligence on the part of the Member States We wish to do more than simply wring our hands. We would like to suggest appropriate action to remedy these failures concerning implementation.
We have two proposals in this regard.
We would ask the Commission once and for all to draw up a list detailing the rigidities hindering implementation of the internal market and structural change. This list should also detail priorities, measures required and the calendar for meeting the Lisbon objectives by 2010.
Assuming that lack of due diligence on the part of the Member States is the reason for this delay, we call upon the Commission to explain to us what it could do to remedy the situation.
Once upon a time there was a Spanish constitution stating that Spaniards should be fair and charitable. Unfortunately this constitution did not contain any provisions detailing how such a transformation was to be achieved.
Subsequently, Spain endured three civil wars during the nineteenth century. We call for coordination to guarantee that all economic policies are going in the same direction.
That is what coordination is about.
Secondly, I would like to stress that I believe wholeheartedly in maintaining balanced budgetary positions. There is no need to change things that are working well just because other things are not.
Monetary policy has worked well during this period. This policy is aimed at achieving price stability.
It is managed through an independent bank and a Stability Pact that has maintained only a certain degree of discipline in the Member States. I stress that there has only been a certain degree of discipline.
Some States have gone significantly astray. I would therefore like to reiterate my conviction that budgetary balance must remain the objective.
As the Commission stated, those extravagant countries will have to reduce their structural deficit by half a percent of GDP.
Thirdly, convergence programs should be assessed differently, as the Commission itself highlighted. The Commission has to verify that budgets are balanced.
It also has to check carefully to ensure Member States do not exceed the 3% limit. In future, the Commission ought to take account of each Member State's starting point.
It ought to take account of each country's debt and of how it plans to use resources obtained.
It ought also to take account of the country's anticipated future commitments.
Take the case of a country which is not in debt, which plans to allocate money to public finances, notably to measures promoting the Lisbon strategy, and which does not have significant commitments for the future. The case of a country where these circumstances do not apply is entirely different.
We call upon the Commission to ensure that Member States build up a budgetary reserve when times are good, or, to use a Biblical image, when the cows are fat. Such a reserve could be drawn on in bad times.
We stress that countries should also reduce taxes whenever possible.
In particular, we advocate a reduction in taxes increasing labour costs, as this would stimulate employment.
Countries that cannot afford to reduce taxes should introduce supplementary measures. They should reduce public spending or increase income in other ways.
It is impossible to maintain a balanced budget and reduce taxes at the same time.
You cannot have your cake and eat it.
As regards the policy on wages, we advocate keeping wages in line with the Retail Price Index. We believe actual wages should be in line with productivity.
We advocate increasing labour mobility.
In addition, we call on the Commission to speed up work on eliminating the fiscal barriers hindering the transfer of employment pensions. We further call on the Commission to establish an appropriate fiscal policy to complement the agreement reached on pensions.
We appeal for social dialogue.
Allow me to reiterate that we would like to see fiscal incentives for employment. We call for a reduction of the burdens that make employers unwilling to take on staff, especially those on the lowest wages.
With regard to policies on investment, we are aware it has frequently been said we are lagging behind the United States because of lack of investment, especially in technology.
We are also aware that we are more or less on a par with the United States in terms of public investment. Under investment occurs in the private sector.
We therefore call for a benchmarking exercise to pinpoint the various needs, inadequacies and shortcomings of those companies.
This is particularly relevant if small and medium-sized companies, with less than nine employees, are to access new technologies.
Resources can only be allocated efficiently if the full picture is clear. We just need to know how things stand.
We would like the Commission to report on this promptly. After all, to paraphrase a Spanish poet, there is no such thing as a favourable wind for a sailor who has not yet set his course.
All we are requesting is a report to identify inadequacies and deficiencies in SMEs. It would then be possible to establish how best to proceed.
I would like to end by thanking all the groups and their spokespersons for their efforts. Once again, the Commission can be assured that Parliament is ready, willing and able to help overcome the difficult situation we find ourselves in.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil for his report. I would also like to thank all those Members of Parliament involved for their active cooperation in its production.
Clearly, we are launching a new venture.
It differs substantially from our activities in previous years. For the first time, the broad guidelines of economic policy cover a three-year period.
The Commission recommendations on these guidelines are based on the fundamental principles established at the 2003 Brussels European Council. As Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil pointed out, it is also the first time these guidelines are being put forward alongside the broad guidelines on employment.
For the first time too, a number of changes to the broad guidelines of economic policy have been included. We believe these changes are crucial.
The general part of the guidelines has been drastically cut.
We believe now is the time to focus more effectively on priorities.
We have defined the specific guidelines for each country in a more precise and systematic manner. It is also the first time a specific reference to the Eurozone has been included.
As is only to be expected, the economic strategy built into the guidelines of economic policy is based on the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council.
The GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil report contains some criticism of the broad economic guidelines. It alleges they are not sufficiently ambitious.
In my opinion this criticism is not justified.
The broad guidelines relate well to the agreements reached at Lisbon.
It is also true that we are aiming at commitments that can be defined and assessed more effectively.
I agree with Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil on this, and will comment later on his idea for a specific action plan.
The underlying problem however is not devising new plans, but implementing what we have already agreed.
In our opinion, we also need to take account of the particular situation we are in at the moment. We need to deal with the difficulties posed by the cyclical conditions.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil emphasised this. I also agree however that we should not set aside the fundamental elements of our strategy just because we are currently in a somewhat difficult situation.
Our strategy is based on three key ideas: healthy macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and sustainable processes. As regards healthy macroeconomic policies, I think we all agree that achieving budgetary balance is essential.
I also agree with Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil that it is especially important to guard against repeating past mistakes. The latter entailed implementing polices promoting cyclical economic patterns thus storing up problems for the future.
The Commission outlined its concern over this problem in its communication last November. We pointed to the need to implement the Stability and Growth Pact during the good periods of the economic cycle, not just during the bad ones.
This is essential if we want to avoid subsequent problems. In short, we are seeking to establish a sound policy and allow automatic stabilisers do their job.
When it comes to the potential for growth, I completely agree that the necessary structural reforms should be implemented. These are key to ensuring the economy of the European Union stands up better to external fluctuations.
Nonetheless, if these reforms are to be effective they must be all-embracing and applied jointly.
We fully agree on the need to increase employment.
The difficulty concerns whether we need to implement specific employment incentives or whether it would be better to draw up a general economic policy with employment as its objective. We think the latter is the best option.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, you said that one of your concerns was the implementation of an action plan on structural reform. You asked two questions.
Firstly, you asked why we do not have a list of structural reforms. Secondly, you asked why we are not using mechanisms to monitor these reforms more effectively.
In my opinion, the list of structural reforms is contained in the Lisbon conclusions.
Our yearly progress reports are contained in the summary reports. It also true that it falls to Member States to implement them.
Establishing another new plan would not resolve the problems.
We believe we already have the plans.
We know what we need to do.
I feel the crucial issue is how we implement these plans.
We therefore think we should focus on two essential aspects of this.
Firstly, there are the yearly reports issued by the Commission on the application of the broad economic guidelines of economic policy.
The main idea behind moving from one to three years is to focus more on the application of annual principles, and less on their definition.
Another reason was to place greater emphasis on the peer pressure system established in the European Union. This is a key aspect of the coordination of economic policies.
You raised an important issue, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil. You queried whether or not this is sufficient.
I believe that it is sufficient if we can count on political agreement on the part of the Member States to apply joint decisions. We must remember that the system of coordinating economic policy consists of coordinating national economic policies based on a Community system.
We must also remember that peer pressure is the only way we have of implementing this. The sole exceptions are the recommendations we use to identify certain failures and, of course, the Stability Pact.
As regards improving sustainability, the importance of public debt is worth noting. I agree with you on the need to focus on this issue and we are paying special attention to it.
We think it is essential to provide for future obligations by setting aside assets beforehand.
We also feel it is crucial to ensure a greater and better use of natural resources.
Consequently any form of sectoral subsidy resulting in a less efficient system in environmental terms must be given careful consideration. Similarly, sustainability and social cohesion must be considered as objectives of economic policy.
Lastly, I would like to refer briefly to another proposal presented in your draft involving a Lisbon implementation plan.
I think we share your disquiet.
The Commission has made it clear that it is concerned about the failure to implement the decisions taken at Lisbon.
Clearly, implementation is behind schedule. Once again, however, I do not feel that the solution lies in devising new plans.
Rather, I believe we must move ahead more speedily with what we have already decided. Political will is essential for this.
So too is Parliament's support. The positions adopted in this House will be crucial to the success of all the efforts required.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Garcia-Margallo, ladies and gentlemen, let me say right from the start that the Commission has always had, and will continue to have, our group's support for anything that helps to generate more economic dynamism and anything that furthers the implementation of the common objectives and decisions.
There is, however, one point to which allusion has already been made and which it is important to underline from the outset. We have an internal market concept, we have the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, we have European competition policy, we have the Financial Services Action Plan and the Risk Capital Action Plan, we have Article 2, which obliges Member States to pursue a course of economic policy coordination, we have the Stability and Growth Pact, we have the euro, we have EU enlargement and hence the expansion of the internal market into a home market, and we have the eco-social market economy as our model of economic governance, which means competitiveness within a free market, promoting social cohesion while being mindful of its responsibility towards nature and people.
Should not all this be enough to put us in a better position than we are in?
Why do we need new economic policy guidelines?
We need them because we have no European employment policy, because we have no European economic policy, and because the task of implementing all the various decisions that we jointly adopt is therefore primarily a matter for the Member States and because many Member States fail to do their homework.
Half-heartedness, superficiality, a lack of courage, and complacency, indeed, insincerity about many of the key issues on the Community's agenda shape the picture.
There is a lack of ambition and a lack of political will.
Let me say this here today: new economic policy guidelines are no substitute for political will, for the willingness to act instead of apportioning blame, and for greater commitment and a willingness to accept responsibility for all these issues.
We need more European thinking instead of wrong-headed national egotism.
There can therefore be only one message sent out from here today, and it is this: we need a benchmark.
Who is the best, the most creative, the fastest, the most successful in implementing common decisions?
It is results that matter, not guidelines or a succession of summits.
It is the successes, not the means of achieving them, that matter, and we must therefore do our utmost to implement what we have agreed.
We need fresh impetus, new and courageous efforts, more own capital, more risk capital, and a climate that favours business start-ups.
We must strengthen the internal market and remove distortions of competition.
We must introduce majority voting on matters relating to taxation and harmonise all business taxes in Europe.
We need more competitiveness, more research, more competition in education and research, and more competition on merits.
If we finally do what we all pledge to do at all the summit meetings, Europe will not only be the world's number one in terms of its population and area, but also in terms of competitiveness and employment.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Mr GarcÃ­a Margallo's report, which I consider to be an important contribution to the development of effective coordination of the Union's economic and social policies, starkly exposes the shortcomings which have characterised the drawing up of the broad economic and social policy guidelines in recent years. On the one hand, there has for too long been no attempt to establish a proactive policy that can combat the trends towards stagnation and recession which are still raging through many of the Union's economies.
On the other hand, to say the least, the principle of streamlining and coordinating employment policies through the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines has been belatedly recognised. Moreover, the goal of achieving the strategy laid down in Lisbon in 2000 and the related structural reforms by 2010 has been included in what seems as yet to be a rather ill-defined fashion.
We must not underestimate the progress made, but it must be stressed that we now need to overcome the delays and ambiguities, providing for effective coordination of Member States' economic, employment and environment policies by establishing a proper calendar setting out the intermediate steps for achieving the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives by 2010, particularly with regard to public investment in the research, education and lifelong training sectors and a European network of essential services, starting with transport and telecommunications.
Moreover, we also need to set up an institutional coordinating structure in the euro area so that - as stated in Mr GarcÃ­a Margallo's report - the euro area has a single representative in all the international economic and financial institutions.
Lastly, we need, for the euro area too, to define the phases of an economic, social and environment policy which is also compatible with the Lisbon strategy and with flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact.
As of 2004, these measures should become the core of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new goals for enhancing flexible management of the Stability and Growth Pact.
In this regard, I would stress that we need to avoid general formulae and great ambiguity: not all economic policies can both satisfy the Lisbon and Gothenburg criteria and respect the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of public deficit and government debt, even in the event that the Pact is managed more flexibly, as proposed by the Commission - whose efforts we appreciate - particularly in this current phase of virtual stagnation.
In other words, the Commission cannot ignore the fact that a discrepancy of 3% with regard to the minimum objective of 60% of government debt is due to an increase in current expenditure, or maybe to tax cuts across the board, or to a policy of boosting public and private investment - for example, in research, in training, in retraining workers of retirement age who wish to continue working - especially considering that such investment is recognised, formally recognised, by the Commission itself as an objective of common interest.
The same priorities should be pursued, as Commissioner Solbes said, in periods of growth too, when the conditions are created for greater compatibility between the broad economic and employment policy guidelines and the parameters of the Stability Pact, which is also - and the Central Bank itself must not forget this - a Pact which should seek to increase income and employment and, after Lisbon, to bring about full employment and social cohesion.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil's report. We believe it rightly emphasises the importance of providing a more appropriate framework to ensure that the objectives set in the various stability pacts and the main broad guidelines of economic policy are attained.
The stability and credibility of the Union's economy and its single currency are at stake.
Over the last few days we have become very much aware of social unrest resulting from essential proposals to reform pensions systems. Reform is needed to guarantee pensions and associated benefits.
These are integral parts of the welfare state system characteristic of the European Union. The Union provides and guarantees the best social protection and the greatest social balance when compared to other large economies.
If it is to preserve that balance, the European Union must make a more determined effort to take the action many have called for in recent times. During the preparations for the Spring European Council in Brussels under the current Greek Presidency, we highlighted two shortcomings.
The first was failure to attain the Lisbon objectives. The second concerned the need to tackle a number of outstanding structural reforms mentioned in Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil's report.
Action on these is certainly needed.
I should like to reiterate the importance of this area.
It encompasses a number of unresolved key issues which are therefore still holding back economies and their development at European level.
Liberalisation of some sectors is one area where action is outstanding. Another is failure to adopt technological innovation.
Research and development is not being promoted adequately either. Further, as Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil pointed out, it has now become urgent to give priority to SMEs, especially to those with the most potential for growth and innovation.
It is well known that large corporations tend to shed jobs when times are hard.
This is happening at the moment.
It is actually the SMEs that create more employment and stimulate economic recovery. I would emphasise once again that such recovery must take place within a strict framework and budgetary balance.
It is also essential to attain the objectives set in the stability pacts. These are an integral part of the framework on which the European Union and the euro are based and from which they will develop.
We cannot afford to restrict or weaken it.
Mr President, I am the rapporteur for the report on the Guidelines of the Economic Policies of the Member States.
The idea was for us also to have voted on that report today.
For the first time, we would have seen economic and employment policy guidelines coordinated in terms of time, but that was unfortunately not to be the case.
As rapporteur, I pulled out all the stops so that we should be ready in time, but to no avail.
It means that this report will not be presented until the June part-session, and by then it will be too late.
It means that the Council will decide on the guidelines on the same day that we vote in Parliament, and the Council will not therefore be able to take account of our points of view.
That is serious because it means that the important balance between the two processes will go to pot.
Instead, the economic perspective will totally dominate. It is a shift we also see elsewhere in political life.
It bodes well neither for the Lisbon process nor for the social Europe in which so many Europeans have placed their hopes and confidence.
The EU now finds itself in a difficult economic situation, with weak demand, low levels of investment and growing unemployment in ever more Member States.
What was of course needed was a clear overhaul of the economic guidelines, but the Commission continues, unfortunately, to support the Stability and Growth Pact and budget discipline and to believe in the possibility of saving our way out of the crisis.
If, through having a common currency, it is not permitted to increase state expenditure and there is no possibility of regulation by means of flexible exchange rates, only the labour market remains.
The measures proposed by the Commission are therefore concerned not so much with economics as with the labour market.
It is a question first and foremost of reducing labour costs and the attendant social costs, but that leads to a reduction in domestic demand, which is incredibly important.
That, of course, is what needs to be increased if we are not to enter a vicious circle.
The Stability and Growth Pact was duly created in order to keep inflation under control during a period of growth when there was a perhaps justified anxiety about inflation.
Today, the situation is different.
Now, the same Pact is instead giving rise to deflation and growing unemployment.
The policy of economic and monetary union binds all the eurozone countries to a common fate and to a policy of cut-backs leading to a type of collective decline.
'United we stand and united we fall', the refrain might go.
It means, on the other hand, that those countries are well placed that are able to say no to the euro and to remain outside the policy of economic and monetary union.
My own country, Sweden, is to hold a referendum on EMU in September, and, with each month that goes by, opposition to the euro is growing, both among the general public and among economic and political experts.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe it would be infinitely better to continue with the Lisbon policy and to pin our faith in investment in skills, knowledge and innovation.
Ideally, we need comprehensive public investment programmes strategically designed so as to strengthen demand both for products and services from the private market and for training, research and other such things that increase knowledge.
That is the way forward, and if the actors in the market do not themselves succeed in meeting these requirements, it is we politicians who must create the conditions that induce companies to dare to think in the long term.
It is impossible to save our way out of the crisis.
Mr President, rapporteurs, today it was the intention to have a joint debate on both the global economic guidelines and the employment guidelines.
The rapporteur for these employment guidelines of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stated a moment ago that we have a problem.
Not only are we trying to simplify the guidelines, not only are we here to talk about a three-year period, but we are also trying, as they say, to 'streamline' them.
We have not managed to do this.
This is very unfortunate since the broad and global economic guidelines in the text to a large extent refer to the employment guidelines which are yet to be discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The problems are patently clear, and in the light of these problems - some people in the Netherlands say that every disadvantage has its advantage - in the light of these circumstances, we have held emergency talks with the Council and the Commission in order to alleviate this problem we have, namely the inability to submit our opinion on the employment guidelines on time.
The Council has promised that, in the next few years, the consultation period will be longer, and the Commission has also promised that it will submit its proposals more quickly.
Both have pledged this in writing.
Having said this, there is still a problem in my view. As Mr Schmid has already pointed out, we are unable to commit to deadlines in certain areas.
This means that we need to inform both the Commission and the Council of the opinions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in a more informal manner as and when we can and, at a later stage, of the opinions of the plenary too.
I would mention the fact that, since there were 167 amendments to the employment guidelines, some restraint is called for.
I should like to make a few comments on the broad economic guidelines and particularly those employment guidelines.
As some speakers have mentioned already, we are at the moment talking about both long-term policy - which could be referred to as the Lisbon policy, 2010 - and short term policy, and, in the short term, we are facing a recession, as we were reminded a moment ago.
During a recession such as this, there is no longer a labour shortage, but rather a job shortage.
This means that employment guidelines should be more dynamic in the short term and should also be more country-specific in a number of ways.
This job shortage also translates into a shortage of work placement and work experience places.
Neither does it offer any incentives to solve the poverty problems.
Reintegration is said to be adversely affected and the concept of availability comes under pressure.
Financial incentives that are being mentioned here are more limited and will not immediately have the desired effect on the poverty trap and the promotion of jobs.
In fact, what we need to do in the short term is to consider job sharing again.
Issues that are very much on the agenda and which I should like to emphasise are working shorter hours, options to cut down the number of hours, the reduction of overtime, which is currently growing rapidly, and possibly promoting subsidised work and social economy or the third sector.
Alongside this, entrepreneurship should be stimulated.
In our committee, a number of proposals have already been expressed in the form of compromise proposals in order to stimulate the small and medium-size businesses, and they strongly emphasise the fact that the pillar of equality has taken a knock.
We should like to maintain this equality.
This does mean, however, as the Belgian Employment Minister has already pointed out, that certain target groups, such as the elderly, should perhaps be pleased with the fact that they can enjoy their early retirement at the moment.
This is the subject of political debate.
We will bring our proposals to the next meetings and we will take it from there.
Mr President, we are all aware of the current economic difficulties faced by national governments.
For those like myself from countries within the eurozone it is clear that the constant decline of the euro vis-Ã -vis the United States dollar is causing considerable problems for our exporters.
All of this at a time when the global economy is already facing many uncertainties.
Rather than dwelling on the current difficulties and becoming doom and gloom merchants, we need to take a positive approach and I commend our rapporteur for his approach in this regard.
I fully share his conviction that the European economy is one which urgently needs a new approach to economic policy making.
This year's broad economic policy guidelines cover a three-year period and a new streamline procedure within the European employment guidelines has been put in place.
I very much welcome this.
I would hope that this integrated and longer-term planning perspective will bring about the desired level of economic policy coordination between the Member States.
At the same time it is important that each Member State government fulfils its duty to react to the particular set of circumstances in that Member State and uses those policy instruments open to it to boost competitiveness, employment and the national economy.
The summit's decision to set up a special employment taskforce in this regard is welcome.
While the successful completion of the enlargement process is clearly being focused upon by all institutions, we must avoid becoming too inward-looking in the Union.
The newly-enlarged market will add a new impetus in terms of investment opportunities and labour mobility to the whole competitiveness agenda.
I sincerely hope that forthcoming presidencies will take this view and prioritise those areas of the Lisbon Agenda where further progress is needed.
The suggestion of enforcement powers for the Commission smacks of a centralist approach to economic development that has long become obsolete as our new Member States from central and eastern Europe can testify.
I doubt if any of the ten new Member State governments would take kindly to the idea that their national budget must be vetted in Brussels, rather than in their own national parliaments.
I would be opposed to any proposal to bestow economic governance powers on the EU in the context of the forthcoming Treaty revision.
Even in the context of this debate, it is proper to put down a marker to make it clear that attempts to create a federalist EU, as distinct from a confederation of Member States, must be strongly resisted.
The EU is unique in this respect and our goal and vision must continue to be a Union of Europe of the Nations.
Mr President, it was one year ago yesterday that we held a debate on the global economic policy guidelines in this plenary.
During this debate, I made some critical remarks about the economic policy guidelines.
I indicated that the promises were very rarely kept.
To my chagrin, I have to say that little has been done with this criticism since. It is therefore logical that the same criticism should now also apply to the report by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil.
Last year, we already saw a decline in economic growth.
We now have to conclude that, despite fine policy intentions, recovery is still not on the cards.
It appears that, with the policy guidelines, which form an open coordination method, we in the European Union are unable to cope with an impending recession.
In addition, the objectives of the Lisbon process do not appear achievable with the current instruments.
In short, the transposition of the policy intentions under implementation and the implementation of the guidelines leave something to be desired.
Meanwhile, I have gleaned from various sources that an open coordination method does not work.
In practice, this method is apparently too non-committal and is also not very well-defined.
Consequently, cooperation by means of the open coordination method is not sufficiently binding upon the Member States.
It would therefore be useful if it were made clear in what way the Member States can work together in the field of employment and social policy, obviously thereby taking into consideration the Member States' responsibilities.
I should like to put a question to the European Commission, and specifically Commissioner Solbes, in this connection.
Can you indicate whether, and if so when, you will be tabling proposals in order to improve cooperation within the framework of the Lisbon process?
In this respect, do you deem it possible to come up with a clear definition of the open coordination method in the short term?
A few years ago at the Stockholm Summit, it was decided to aim for integration of environmental policy and social policy into the economic policy guidelines.
This was with the intention to establish a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union.
At present, economic prospects are uncertain, which has an impact on the creation of a sustainable and social market economy.
I should therefore like to bring two important points to your attention.
First of all, social policy.
In the debate on social policy, the European model is compared to the American model.
The European model is based on solidarity, while the American model is not.
The question is now to what extent this solidarity is still reflected in the policy which the Union is wishing to adopt.
Secondly, I should like to draw your attention to the need for integrating environmental policy into economic policy.
In my view, there is too little attention paid to the environmental aspects of economic policy.
It seems that the integration of economic and social policy is more obvious than integrating environmental policy into economic policy.
Might the reason lie in the fact that environmental policy costs money initially and does not lead to profits that are readily measurable?
I would therefore welcome, alongside references to the importance of the environment, clear and concrete environmental objectives to be included in the economic policy guidelines.
Objectives with regard to energy consumption and CO2 emission reductions spring to mind in this respect.
Economic growth will need to go hand in hand with a responsible use of natural resources.
Moreover, I consider taking active government measures aimed at increasing birth rates in Europe in a bid to keep pension schemes affordable extremely debatable.
Since both the report by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil and this debate are critical about the global guidelines, it is time that the European Commission took these comments to heart.
We, as the European Parliament, will need to ensure that economic policy is implemented in a consistent manner.
The Commission must be pro-active and must inform Parliament in good time about the results achieved.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, when introducing this report on the BEPGs, the rapporteur declared himself to be satisfied with the broad, almost unanimous consensus achieved within the Commission, and, I imagine, within Parliament.
I can see why, but I believe that there lies the limit of our work and, ultimately, also one of the limitations of the BEPGs as such.
It is easy to support the Lisbon objectives - who would not agree on these objectives - but what is difficult is to agree on the instruments.
If you were members of a national parliament, Mr President, Mr Trentin, it would ultimately be a hard task to achieve consensus on the choices to be made and the positions to be adopted.
I believe that this - but we know that now, it is an intrinsic problem - is the limitation of these major guidelines and the open coordination policies, particularly because I feel we need to have the courage to go further on some issues, making decisions rather than seeking the lowest common denominator of different positions held within Parliament and by the different Member States, and getting to the heart of the issues.
I want to mention three points, which I feel receive insufficient emphasis in both the BEPGs and the report.
The first is pension provision.
Let this be understood - and we must shout it out loud and clear - there are going to be generations of poor pensioners in Europe and we are not doing anything about it because we do not want, we are not strong enough or courageous enough to impose certain choices on those who stand to benefit from pension systems not changing in due time.
We have systems which are financially unsustainable, whose treatment of the younger and future generations is wicked, and yet we cannot muster the political will to change the situation.
The issue would cause a heated debate even in Parliament.
We have witnessed the strike in Austria, we have witnessed the strike in France and there will soon be a strike in Italy. The status quo lobby upholding the interests of those seeking to prevent any changes in the field of pensions is powerful and active.
I believe that the European Parliament's documents and statements too must call strongly for protection of the interests of all, especially the youngest citizens.
In his report, which is, moreover, valuable, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo calls for social dialogue.
I believe that, where an issue such as pensions is concerned, what is needed is not dialogue but a social debate instead and, where necessary, a political debate too.
The pensions dialogue with the people filling the squares in Vienna, Paris or Rome, where the people's fear is exploited with demagogic proposals when they know full well that something needs to be done, is a sterile dialogue, a dialogue that can lead nowhere.
Another point: immigration.
Although I can think of an amendment which I hope will not be supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I hope that the reference will be retained in the report to the important role played by immigrants and immigration in increasing the dynamism and flexibility of the European economy at precisely the time when, with enlargement, some of the larger countries are calling for the introduction of the free movement of workers to be postponed until 2011.
The free movement of workers will contribute greatly to the dynamism of the European economy and the reference must be preserved.
I will end with one last point, Mr President: the Lisbon goals, making the European economy the most competitive knowledge-based economy.
We must ask ourselves how that will be possible in countries such as the European countries which reject the cutting-edge technology of GMOs and stem cells.
Mr President, I fully agree with the previous speaker, Mr Della Vedova, that the greatest challenge to economic sustainability is the growth in Europe's ageing population, which is a problem we must tackle while its economic impact is still controllable.
The status quo is not really an option for European governments.
In order to prepare for the overall as well as the budgetary effects of ageing populations we have to increase employment, reduce public debt and reform pensions and health care systems.
The additional costs that would result from postponing the pension system reforms will in the future be taken out of the pockets of today's youth.
Change, even change that is necessary and inevitable, always meets with resistance, which is what we have also experienced this week in Strasbourg.
This resistance to change, however, cannot be allowed to become a pretext for delaying necessary reforms or a barrier to them.
Europe's economic situation is worrying and our economic growth is clearly poorer than what was forecast.
Avoidance of geopolitical risks now gives us some hope of faster economic growth, but numerous experts are also pointing out that in forecasts made in the last two years faster economic growth has always been put off until the following six-month period.
Our poor economic growth is largely home-made: 'made in Europe'.
Ladies and gentlemen, sluggish growth, falling productivity, a decrease in external demand, a decline in business and consumer confidence, and the continued rise in unemployment are facts of life this year.
The only positive factor is the low rate of inflation, which has averaged around 2% and will possibly fall even further.
At their summit meetings the heads of our Member States have promised to implement structural reforms allowing growth and stability.
The extent to which this has been done in practical terms, however, has been inadequate, and poor economic growth and mass unemployment are the price we pay for putting off these reforms.
If we want the broad guidelines of economic policies to have a successful outcome they should incorporate a clear work programme which defines the main areas of action for reform and a timetable for completion.
In addition, the guidelines should list the special actions which are needed in those areas where internal political 'stalemate ' has obstructed progress in certain Member States.
The EU is still characterised by its under-utilisation of human resources.
Our employment rate, which is low when viewed in the international context, is also due to the misconceived incentives embedded in our benefit systems, which are conducive to withdrawal from the labour market or remaining outside it.
Tax and benefit systems should be reformed, for example, by reducing excessively high rates of tax for those on low incomes.
Tax reductions, however, should be made for everyone in paid employment.
More flexible arrangements for working time and less stringent regulatory systems would enhance participation in the labour market and improve employment opportunities.
Mr President, in presenting Parliament with the broad economic policy guidelines, Commissioner Solbes has observed that Europe is apparently lagging behind the United States inasmuch as the Americans seemingly have a more flexible labour market and greater productivity.
The observation seems so obvious that no one any longer takes the trouble to check the facts.
The fact is that actual economic conditions in the United States bear less and less relation to the dominant political discourse in Europe.
According to Professor James Galbraith of the University of Texas in Austin, the high level of unemployment in the United States is not a result of the flexibility symbolised by 'hire and fire'.
I quote in English:
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one might be surprised at the way in which the first few recitals of this report have been interpreted but, in the final analysis, this merely shows that everyone agrees with the evidence: the disastrous situation facing the European economy, specifically slow growth, the loss of confidence amongst investors and consumers and the increase in unemployment, to which I would add the unsustainable levels of income inequality, poverty and social exclusion.
This situation requires a new approach to drafting economic policy decisions in order to achieve the aims of high growth, full employment, sustainable development and greater social cohesion.
The only problem is that, when confronted with the evidence, the answer is unfortunately always the same: speed up the process of liberalisations and structural reforms, as recommended in the Lisbon strategy - an approach that the employers' representatives welcome so wholeheartedly - wage moderation and sticking to labour flexibility and job instability.
Let us be clear about this: the rapporteur's amendments accept and support the guidelines proposed by the Commission.
The rapporteur himself acknowledges that these guidelines are a repetition of previous recommendations, but what is being called a new approach is only 'more of the same', with even greater intensity when what is crucial is to find a new direction.
We would need to propose a total change to the liberal shift of the EU's economic and social guidelines.
We must also ask ourselves about the causes of this situation and the answer to this question can be found in the policies that have been pursued to date.
One only has to look at the current situation to see that making the labour market more precarious, eroding workers' rights and moderating wages are not going to increase productivity, combat poverty or respond to demand that is falling, both internally and externally.
The link between the economies of the Member States and the reduction in purchasing power is well known, as is the need to invest in education and training and in research and technology in order to facilitate higher productivity.
As has already been stated here on several occasions, however, we need to do the opposite of what the stupid rules of the Stability Pact call for, which is forcing a reduction in public investment, leading to the State having no responsibility in the fields of health and education and making it difficult to use the Structural Funds correctly in the countries with the weakest economies.
Similarly, economic and social cohesion requires a bigger Community budget, not the smallest budget to be proposed in recent years, which is what the Commission has just presented for 2004, accounting for less than 1% of Community gross national income.
Similarly, liberalisations and privatisations are calling into question public service and its quality, as demonstrated by recent workers' protests throughout Europe.
The most shocking aspect of this report, therefore, which closely follows the Commission's recommendations for this year's economic guidelines, is the argument it makes for its increasingly neoliberal measures despite the serious consequences they are having.
The Commission makes its aim clear, by expressing the view that wage increases must remain moderate, with the aim of allowing profit margins to be re-established.
The focus of the Commission's policies is always profit and not people and this is why it is so insistent in calling for a flexible, mobile and cheap labour force, without rights, which can be used whenever, wherever and however employers wish, thereby supporting job instability over employment, and demonstrating total disregard for working people.
I reiterate: this cannot be the way forward.
The European Union must be a project for people and not only to increase the profit of a few and the workers should be given greater respect.
Treating workers with dignity is a crucial step in increasing labour productivity.
Madam President, chance occasionally organises things rather well.
We are debating these broad economic policy guidelines when, barely 48 hours ago, the French state was paralysed by a general strike and when huge demonstrations against government projects to reform the retirement pensions system brought together more than two million men and women from every town in France.
Has Mr Raffarin misinterpreted these broad guidelines that, overall, echo those of previous years?
No, Mr Raffarin is a faithful disciple of the Commission.
He forces himself to administer one of the potions, namely the sixteenth, recommended by the good doctors of Brussels.
'In particular, Member States should over the coming three years design, introduce and effectively implement reforms of pension systems, encourage longer working lives by modifying incentives that encourage early withdrawal from the labour market and by restricting access to early retirement schemes, increase funding and improve, where necessary, access to supplementary pension schemes'.
Potion number 3 is also in danger of failing to promote social cohesion, which is however one of the objectives adopted in Lisbon.
It concerns salaries.
The Member States must 'ensure that nominal wage increases are consistent with price stability and productivity gains.
In particular, wage developments should remain moderate.'
Along the same lines, the measures providing for greater 'flexibility' in the labour market might be cited.
Potion number 6: review labour market regulations.
Potion number 7: facilitate labour mobility, both geographical and occupational.
It is true that the Margallo report introduces a few touches of humanity into these economic remedies reminiscent of MoliÃšre's Doctor Diafoirus, but he does not fundamentally alter the ultra-liberal philosophy underlying them.
They are about erasing the social advances that, more often than not, are the result of workers' struggles.
Under the guise of promoting competition and increasing productivity, the process is under way of creating a society in which everyone is engaged in open warfare against everyone else.
We are a long way from the model of the social market economy that might represent a European ideal, humanely reconciling the necessity for private initiative with the need for a social guarantee that each and every person's basic needs will be met.
It is symptomatic that these prescriptions demand sacrifices from employees alone.
There is no mention of those possessors of capital who have accumulated, and are accumulating, considerable profits, in particular by practising unfair dismissal and by dissolving companies.
In conclusion, allow me to quote an extract from an editorial in the Basque newspaper, Egunkaria, which was arbitrarily banned a few weeks ago.
I quote, in translation: 'Today, we are no longer in the age of Aristotle, who justified slavery by observing that ships did not sail unaided.
Nowadays, when ships do in fact sail more or less unaided, economic policies should not seek growth at any price. They should seek quality, not quantity.'
That is not, unfortunately, the perspective from which these guidelines have been written, and that is why I shall not be able to vote in favour of this report.
Madam President, in its broad economic policy guidelines (2003-2005), the Commission presents a group of recommendations that, in themselves, appear to us to be completely sound: ensuring the long-term viability of public finances, launching structural reforms, particularly of the labour market, in order to make better use of human resources, reducing unduly high marginal tax rates, encouraging competition, reforming pension systems and so on.
In the eurozone - especially in France and Germany - these recommendations are, unfortunately, scarcely put into practice.
Economic revival is having to wait, unemployment is increasing and the date of a return to balanced public finances is forever receding.
Nowhere are anything but rigidity and tensions to be seen.
I would also emphasise, incidentally, that the situation in the eurozone is much more serious than that in the rest of Europe.
