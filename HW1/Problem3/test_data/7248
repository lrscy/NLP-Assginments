Presidents, so nothing has been able to deter the American Government and its British and Spanish accomplices from unleashing a pre-emptive war against Iraq, on the pretext - which everyone knows to be false - that Iraq poses an imminent threat to the United States and even to the whole world.
In fact, as Mr CoÃ»teaux has said, the United States has already, since the end of the Gulf war, been undertaking military operations, especially from the air, against Iraqi targets, causing losses to the civilian population, and has done so in peace time.
At the same time, the US is guilty, through having imposed a brutal embargo, of a genuine genocide which, according to the UN itself, has caused the death of more than one million Iraqi children.
The intention, which is today being cynically declared in the first few hours of the conflict, of assassinating Iraq's political leaders, represents a new stage in the descent into barbarity.
From now on the leaders of the coalition can be neither indignant nor astonished when they become the prime targets of terrorist reprisals.
This crisis has proved the senselessness of the European Union, torn apart by the opposing positions of its members, and has also proved that with average-sized powers and unable to become a major power, it is possible to create an organisation with no power at all.
Those in our countries who are striving for peace should call, as was done at the time of the Korean War, for an extraordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly to be held.
Perhaps the only thing that could be done there is talk, but that will at least be doing something to achieve peace.
Mr President, we all regret Europe's failure in this crisis and the fact that the existing instruments for coordinating our foreign policy have shown themselves to be ineffective.
There is no question that our group wishes the European Union to have an autonomous position in the world based on the defence of legitimate interests, but also on values such as democracy, respect for human rights and freedom, in other words, everything that the regime of Saddam Hussein has destroyed in his own country and everything we share with the United States.
And therefore my group advocates strengthening the transatlantic link which has united us at other times in our history, which have also been difficult, as the President of the Catalonian Government has said.
Despite the obvious differences within the European Union, there are certain things which I believe, now more than ever, we are obliged to do together. We must increase our efforts to contribute to the search for peace in the Middle East, and to eliminate the points of tension in the Maghreb and, of course, provide humanitarian aid during the conflict and then assist in the human, political and economic reconstruction of the country afterwards, as the Presidency of the Union has pointed out.
I would ask the European Commission to reflect on whether it was hasty in some of the statements it made in this regard.
At times like this it is easier to look the other way, it is easier to hide behind a banner than to confront tyranny.
Sometimes it is more profitable as well.
What we must do is respect the opinions of others.
However, experience has taught us, Mr President, that force is the only response to oppression, and we are only servants of our democratic convictions.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, if we had to choose between US democracy and Iraqi dictatorship, the choice would be easy. If we had to choose between the transatlantic alliance and the dictators, the choice would be easy.
As it is, we have to choose between Kofi Annan and George Bush, we have to choose between Prime Minister Simitis and President Prodi, who are the leaders of the Union, and Tony Blair and JosÃ© Maria Aznar.
Kofi Annan represents the law, Bush does not. Prime Minister Simitis and President Prodi represent the Union, the others do not.
In whose name did George Bush deliver the ultimatum to Saddam Hussein?
In whose name did Tony Blair and JosÃ© Maria Aznar disregard the document signed at the European Council on 17 February?
We had scheduled the Euro-Mediterranean Forum for next week in Greece, Mr President, as you know, to discuss peace, social progress and peaceful coexistence.
Many members of the parliaments of Arab and European Union countries are asking how they can discuss the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly when bombs are falling on Baghdad, when Kofi Annan, the law and the UN have been brutally sidelined by George Bush's arrogance, when we are at the start of a war that is unilateral, pre-emptive, unjust, illegal and, as has been said, immoral and criminal.
Even if the dictator falls soon, the arrogant nature of this action will remain. In 1991, there was the UN.
In 1995 and 1998, the UN, NATO and the European Union were unanimous. In 2001 the entire world supported George Bush and the United States in the fight against terrorism.
The President of the United States has wasted a huge amount of political and moral capital, he has dealt a blow to the UN, he has divided the European Union, he has widened the Atlantic and he has made relations with the Arab world more difficult.
A great deal of damage has been done.
In effect, Mr President, war broke out on 17 September 2002, when the new strategy of the Bush approach was announced to the world.
There was a country, the United States, which had great power, which grew out of the war to free Europe, Africa and Asia from fascism, out of the fight against communism during the Cold War, and now this power is in danger of becoming domination based on the use of force.
The United States has thus discarded its historical role and, this being the case, it could be the start of a serious crisis, a crisis which, as Norman Mailer said, could affect democracy within the United States, and if it affects democracy within the United States it could also affect democracy in Europe too, and our freedom could be under threat as well.
Therefore, President Cox, Mr Papandreou, tell the Council clearly, make it quite clear to the Council today and tomorrow that Europe has lost with George Bush's war.
We have lost.
Even if the dictator falls, I must stress, we have lost.
The Europeans who are true friends of the Americans, of the citizens of the United States, cannot support George Bush.
After the Second World War, we decided that never again would there be an Auschwitz, never again would there be a war.
We must build this new Europe and give it a new Constitution which retains these two pillars: never again an Auschwitz, never again war.
(Applause)
Mr President, the current situation lends a great deal of weight to the opening sequence of Roman Polanski's award-winning film 'The Pianist', released last year, which showed a Polish family joyfully celebrating with champagne when it is announced that the French and British have declared war to go to the aid of Polish democracy in September 1939.
The rest of the film shows the extent of the suffering awaiting the family.
These images are useful in that they temper the confidence we might have today in a cause which, ultimately, is just, and our hopes for a democratic future for Iraq, and add a human aspect.
For, as a last resort, the combat taking place will set soldiers from democratic States against a totalitarian State.
And in the face of such a situation, it is impossible to remain neutral.
Mr President, war is an evil, but in some cases it can be the lesser of two evils.
The war has begun and Europe has been unable to prevent it.
We must therefore do all we can, Europe must do all it can to ensure that this war is the lesser evil.
Mr President, 'the United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours'.
With this sad but entirely justified observation, America's President Bush gave notice of the liberation of Iraq, the region and the world from Saddam Hussein.
Military action against this merciless tyrant is not only fully justified; it is even a bounden duty.
The UN resolutions are clear in this respect.
The opposition organised by some Member States has, to put it mildly, not done anything for the credibility of the United Nations as a body for enforcing the peace.
It was high time we took action against the local, regional and global danger posed by this heartless tyrant with his weapons of mass destruction.
At the same time, it is of the greatest importance to repair damaged transatlantic relations.
Let us - in Europe, America and elsewhere - recover our unanimity and together commit ourselves to a free and democratic Iraq.
We pray for compassion towards the Iraqi people and soldiers and their families.
We also pray that we in the European Parliament will, together with President Bush, acknowledge our dependence upon God.
Mr President, despite the errors, the culpability and the geopolitical inconsistency of the US policy, Europe must not lose its capacity for farsightedness or fail to realise the severity of the threat posed to us by Baghdad.
Have we forgotten September 11 already?
European foreign policy, if there is such a thing, cannot be reduced to the fine, ineffective action of narrow-minded pacifists, who have never genuinely condemned Saddam Hussein or the use of weapons of mass destruction in their demonstrations.
Even today, we have heard honeyed words spoken to the Arab world.
I ask you: have you seen or heard Arab television?
It proclaims loud and clear what the crowds of Arabs, including the immigrants living in our cities, want to hear.
Yet when Saddam Hussein draws the menacing sword of Islam and proclaims Jihad, it is we Europeans who will be his direct, closest target.
May God prevent a disaster in London, Milan or Brussels such as that caused by Arab fanaticism on September 11 in Manhattan.
May God protect young Europe and the young Europeans who, I am afraid, will be fighting in the front line or, like our fine Alpine troops, working for peace in Afghanistan.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every war is a moral defeat for politics, and, in this instance, war is also an expression of Europe's weakness.
The good news associated with this is that this war will mean the end of Saddam Hussein, who has so many people on his conscience and who would wreak even more havoc.
Even so, many of the public have doubts when considering whether this good objective justifies the sacrifices involved.
Let us just consider the problems related to the region's stability, the issue of the legitimacy of a war started by unilateral actions, and the consequences for the United Nations.
My own doubts about this have not been dispelled, either.
We now have to be prompt in providing aid for the people in the aftermath of war and for the purpose of stabilising the region.
This is where we Europeans have to make the effort, and we have to get the quartet down to work with a view to resolving the problems in the Middle East.
Especially, though, we have to do our own homework.
None of Europe's governments appear to be coming out of the present situation in a particularly good light, and we should recognise that it is only together that we have a part to play in matters of war and peace, that the Convention must therefore come to a successful conclusion, and that foreign policy, too, must be founded on decisions by a qualified majority, in order that Europe may soon speak with one voice.
This must also be the basis on which we again strengthen our transatlantic ties, which bind us to the great democracy on the other side of the ocean, but these must be founded upon our own strength, on which any partnership must be dependent.
Then, I believe, the democracies on both sides of the ocean will be able to make it their concern to establish a just world order, for no world order can be established by violence.
Other ways and means must be found to create this world order, and this is something we must achieve together.
Mr President, having won less than a quarter of the electorate's vote, George W. Bush is the least well-supported president in US history.
Although he is in power, he does not represent the American people, to whom Europe owes a great deal and with whom we share so many values.
It is precisely these values that Bush is scorning, with his warmongering cronies and his disregard for Europe.
The primary victims of this war are the pre-eminence of international law, the necessary respect for all human life and the need to work towards a fairer, more peaceful world, which imposes the essential requirement that force be used only as a last resort.
Bush wanted this war.
His target is indisputably an unacceptable regime, but there are other dictatorships that also deserve to be eradicated.
The universal reign of democracy and human rights, however, will not be established through the use of weapons and cultural violation.
President Bush will certainly succeed in bringing down Saddam Hussein's regime by military force.
It will, however, be at the cost of many innocent victims and significant collateral damage in Iraq and the surrounding area.
Those, like the stock markets, who are expecting a short, clean, clinical war should recall why Bush Senior, who did have the backing of the international community, did not at the time take military action to the point of overthrowing the Baghdad regime.
In fact, Bush Senior knew that he would get bogged down in a quagmire, that the fall of Saddam Hussein would lead to ethnic and religious confrontations that could not be managed from outside.
The risk of an extremely costly, prolonged conflict is clear. Such conflict would be punctuated with terrorist incidents and suicide attacks, leading to further division and a consequent spiral of violence in the region and beyond.
The economic cost as well as the human cost could exceed the intrinsic cost of the war, which is estimated at USD 100 billion.
The world economy has been experiencing a minor recession for the past three years.
The financial markets have seen stock losses exceeding a trillion dollars.
Banks, insurance companies and pension funds have been weakened.
International trade has slowed down.
Civil aviation, tourism and other economic sectors will suffer on account of the climate of insecurity and the speculative explosion in the price of certain raw materials, particularly oil.
If consumers in the United States and Europe were to lose confidence, internal demand would collapse and lead the global economy into a prolonged recession.
Not only will the weapons conflict cause desolation and ruin in Iraq, it will also affect the social and human condition of hundreds of millions of men and women all over the world.
Mr President, history will look harshly upon those who have chosen military action over a promising diplomatic process supported by the United Nations.
Mr President, I refuse to be considered to be Saddam Hussein's friend - for he is and will always be a criminal - just because I am in favour of peace.
I am opposed to this war because it is taking place outside the context of the UN, and if we reject the grace of God there remain only the law of the jungle and the law of the strongest; there remain only moral, legal and political illegitimacy.
In this context, the decision of certain governments to allow US troops to use their airbases and air space, as even the renegade Italian Government has done, is in contrast with the general principles of international law enshrined in the United Nations Charter.
Therefore, I and my party - l'Italia dei valori - which immediately opposed this conflict vehemently, are now taking a stand against the wily tricks of the governments which claim not to be warmongers but which are helping those who are warmongers: a role which is usually reserved for those abetting criminal acts.
Hitherto, these governments have assured us that they would respect the will of the UN, but now that the UN has refused to authorise the attack they have already broken their promise.
Clearly, Mr President, they were thinking, as they are thinking now, about the future distribution of the spoils of war and they hope, like all puppies begging at their master's table, that some crumbs will fall from the United States' table.
Mr President, we see how, after months and years of negotiation, diplomacy has failed to disarm the Iraqi regime peacefully.
However, given the regime's nature, that laudable objective was, no doubt, impossible to achieve, Saddam Hussein having an inordinate tendency to interpret any desire for peace as evidence of the weakness of those with whom he is dealing.
There are thus many things that we might find regrettable about the approach that has been adopted.
First among them would no doubt have to be the way in which the European Union itself approved the intervention in Kosovo in 1999. That created a precedent, for the operation was carried out without reference to the UN, even more so than the current intervention in Iraq, which can at least invoke Resolution 1441.
Today, however, we must draw a line under our regrets.
Let us not allow ourselves to be led astray.
Primary responsibility for the present situation rests with the loathsome regime of Saddam Hussein, who, as past events have demonstrated many times over, brings the scourge of war in his train much as clouds presage storms.
Now, we must do everything possible to safeguard both the Iraqi civilian population and the future of an Iraq liberated from tyranny.
With this in mind, Mr President, the European Council meeting this afternoon would do well to recall these objectives and unite around them.
Mr President, in today's debate I believe we are faced with a double frustration.
Firstly, the frustration that peace has regrettably not been possible.
And I would like to say that peace is not the exclusive domain of any political group, of any Member of this Parliament, or of any government.
Peace is a universal value which is expressed and lived by an individual according to the ethical conscience of that individual.
There is also frustration, Mr President, at the insufficient role played by the European Union in this conflict.
But we can confront this fact in two possible ways: by means of a simplistic, fruitless and internecine debate, criticising ourselves for the insufficiencies and irrelevancies of our presence or, as the President-in-Office of the Council said, by drawing conclusions that will prevent us from repeating the same mistakes in the future.
And it is clear that, in view of our lack of capacity, Mr President, there is currently no alternative in the field of defence and security to the Euro-Atlantic alliance, whether we like it or not.
Furthermore, Mr President, as has been said here this morning, the problem of the Iraqi crisis does not lie in Washington, in London, in Madrid, in Paris or in Berlin: the problem is in Baghdad and is called Saddam Hussein.
Mr President, we must mobilise all our resources.
We must turn need into a virtue and try to turn the discord of the present into harmony in the future.
A future, Mr President, which nobody is going to hand us on a plate, a future which we must fight for and in which we can exert an influence for better or for worse.
And in order to make a success of that future we have two alternatives, Mr President: we either realise our greatest dreams of a united Europe, a Europe of unity in diversity which speaks with a single voice, or we will have to learn to live with our worst frustrations.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, this war was a foregone conclusion.
Popular protest was ignored and UN backing dispensed with.
Question one: where to now?
Where is the world going and where do we stand, as representatives of the people and as responsible men and women, simply responsible men and women, witnessing these highly dangerous developments?
Question two: if this dangerous turn of events is merely, I repeat merely , met by our wishes and/or intervention for this war to end as quickly as possible, what next?
What other foregone conclusions will be applied using the same modus operandi, with us again hoping they will end quickly?
President Bush maintains that he is fighting the dictator and the dictatorship, which he compares with the democracy which he and all of us serve.
Question three: is our democracy so superior that we have to despise the reactions of people all over the world, trample all over international law and dismiss the contempt shown for the UN and its Security Council?
Is this the difference between democracy and dictatorship?
Is this the difference between dictators and democrats?
Question four: this old Europe, as Mr Rumsfeld so disparagingly calls it, is making a huge effort to demonstrate that, with peace, democracy and solidarity, it can move forward and set the world an example in how to resolve international differences peacefully.
Are we going to allow plans or foregone conclusions about its divisions or weakening unity to be imposed on us on the long hard road towards reconstructing our future by being tolerant and relaxing our reactions?
I have posed four questions which bring me to a very simple conclusion. Forceful reaction to friends and allies dragging the world to ruin on the grounds of the misunderstood interests of a superpower which has lost the plot and asks no more than that we should bungle along with it!
We too have responsibilities for this world, rooted in the democracy we serve and defend.
Down with war!
Long live peace between nations!
Mr President, I am afraid that all endeavours to bring the Iraqi crisis to an end without using force have failed.
Thus, an intervention is being carried out which, I would point out, is based on at least three United Nations resolutions: 1441, 678 and 686.
I share Mr Poettering's opinion on Saddam Hussein: it is he who is responsible for the current events. He could have avoided armed conflict by putting an end to his bloody dictatorship, as was suggested to him until yesterday afternoon not just by many Members of Parliament but by the Government of Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries too.
We cannot compare President Bush to Saddam Hussein. We cannot compare the President of the largest Western democracy to a bloodthirsty criminal autocrat who has annihilated all trace of democracy in Iraq and is the only dictator to have used weapons of mass destruction.
I am afraid that Europe has shown itself to be divided on this matter.
It is our immediate duty to seek to restore unity to the Union.
Today's European Council, Mr Papandreou, can be the start of a new endeavour to give Europe a single foreign policy and a single defence policy.
We can take practical steps to reinvigorate the European action, Commissioner Patten, once the Iraq conflict is over.
The Union, together with the United Nations, must take the lead in building the new Iraqi democracy.
It will thus have a major role to play which involves, not least, taking powerful, coherent measures to combat terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
However, this politically strong Europe will have to be an interlocutor on an equal footing with the United States, another major leader in international politics, although we cannot, as President Prodi said, hope to build the Europe of tomorrow from a position of opposition to the United States.
Moreover, a number of criticisms have been made of the Italian Government which do not deserve a reply, for they are unfounded and were coarsely expressed in the manner of those who always give partisan interests precedence over national and European interests.
Mr President, it has to be noted that there is no legal justification for the decision by the United States to resort to immediate war, as the desired objectives could have been achieved by other means.
The inspections produced evident results and, as Mr Blix himself said, opened the way to genuine disarmament by Iraq without the need to engage in armed conflict.
President Jacques Chirac and French diplomats have not ceased their unequivocal condemnation of Saddam Hussein's regime.
Moreover, they have constantly expressed the concern that Security Council resolution 1441 should be given its full meaning, repeatedly proposing that the inspectors be given further material or legal resources.
The position maintained by France is shared by a large section of the international community, and in the Security Council, the sole legal body authorised to legitimise the use of force on an international scale, there has never been a majority sufficient to authorise an early recourse to war.
I am horrified by the thought of the consequences of such a war in terms of human lives, both those of the Iraqi civilian population, which has already suffered particularly greatly, and of the British and US armed forces.
In the event of a chemical or biological attack, France will give them every support in the form of humanitarian aid.
A conflict such as this, however, jeopardises the efforts made over 50 years to build a world founded upon law and collective security.
This conflict both greatly endangers the political stability of the Middle East as a whole and creates the risk that terrorism will again inflict devastation on a global scale.
All we can do is hope that it will come to an end as quickly as possible.
On this sad day, I am extremely proud to be French, for my country has been unstinting in its efforts to attempt to avert this futile war.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time for illusions is past, and now we must face reality.
Saddam Hussein's criminal regime must be disarmed.
That is what most of us in the House want, and to that the United Nations has committed itself in almost innumerable resolutions of its Security Council.
Most of the indications are that it would not have been possible to disarm Saddam Hussein without the use of military means, whether another four, eight or twelve months had been spent attempting it.
What matters now, therefore, is this war be brought to a speedy conclusion, sparing, if at all possible, those not actively involved in it.
My sympathies today are with the soldiers who must come through this war, as well as with their families and with those who will be the victims and will have suffering to endure.
I believe that one of the illusions that we must cast off is the role of the European Union.
The part it has played in this crisis has been a lamentable one, for it has been divided and lacking any capacity for action and or any influence on the objectives it purportedly seeks to achieve.
That is not the least reason why the European Union must, in the post-war period, undertake to make a substantial contribution towards enabling the people of Iraq to establish a state and a social order that are of their own choice and that is prepared to live at peace with the world.
It is obvious, though, that the Europeans have failed.
When will Europeans at last learn that the world will listen to them only when they speak with one voice?
Mr President, this morning, then, the war began that must lead to genuine disarmament in Iraq and that is designed to put an end to the reign of terror that has been conducted there by Saddam Hussein over many years.
It is deeply regrettable that the United Nations Security Council has not been able to bring about such disarmament despite 17 resolutions since 1991 and the many teams, with hundreds of inspectors, that have been in Iraq since then.
Saddam Hussein has already waged three wars: against Iran, against Kuwait, and against the Kurds, using chemical weapons in his own country.
These wars led to millions of deaths and produced millions of refugees, 50 000 of whom live in the Netherlands.
Meanwhile, there are strong indications that these chemical and biological weapons have also been placed in the hands of terrorist organisations.
What those groups are capable of, we saw on 11 September in New York.
That is why, politically, I support this action and why I also wish to express my loyalty towards the many soldiers, from Europe too, who have to complete this difficult task.
I was still a child when American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers risked their lives in order to liberate Europe and my own country in 1945.
Since then, I have often wondered how many millions of lives could have been saved if we had intervened as early as in the 1930s.
That is how I see this action now, as an action designed to prevent much greater disasters in the future.
I wish to express my sympathy for the Iraqi population which has already suffered so much but for whom there is now perhaps a light at the end of a long tunnel.
Finally, there will be a very great need, once this war is over, for the healing of wounds.
Iraq will need a very great deal of help.
EU Member States will have to reflect upon their behaviour during the last week in the Security Council.
We shall have to reach out to those in the Arab world, for this war is not directed against them but against the evil in Iraq that must be stopped before it is too late.
That is what this conflict is about and that is why, politically, I want, in common with the Dutch Government, to support those countries which last night began this action to disarm Iraq.
Mr President, in the past few months, the common foreign and security policy has very obviously proved to be devoid of any content.
One might think it should be possible for the EU Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder when democracy is challenged by dictatorship.
One might think that the EU Member States should be able to unite in choosing between freedom and oppression but, unfortunately, a number of Member States have made it clear that, in foreign policy, they are not in the first place guided by what may be regarded as right and proper.
It was very gratifying to see the majority of new Member States siding so powerfully with those values that form the basis of our European cooperation, and correspondingly sad to see long-standing Member States react to those countries' stance with threats and blackmail.
We might ask ourselves what right we have to ask countries that have experienced decades of dictatorship to abandon their democratic ideals.
It will take time to heal the wounds inflicted upon European cooperation during the last few weeks and months.
Even so, we must work more single-mindedly than before to build an EU that can speak with one voice and act with one agenda in the world.
The voice and the agenda must, however, be ones that we can be proud of. There must be one voice that speaks for freedom, democracy and human rights, and not only on our own continent.
The first thing we can do is help with the construction of a liberated Iraq, both in economic terms and through practical aid in building the Arab Middle East's first democracy.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the summit is due to meet tonight.
It will discuss exactly what we have discussed here this morning.
Your president, Mr Pat Cox, will have the opportunity to address the meeting on behalf of the European Parliament and we await his comments with interest.
I can, however, assure you that the Greek Presidency will pass on the views expressed in this Chamber, this Chamber of democracy, where European public opinion is represented, to this evening's meeting.
Here too the perceptions have differed.
This is a strength, not a weakness.
It is the basic principle of democracy.
Our wager, our challenge is to find the synthesis from this democratic thesis and antithesis, the common will to move forward.
The presidency also assures you that it will do its job to help achieve this aspiration and reach this synthesis.
We know, as do the Fifteen, that we always have a responsibility to approach and achieve this common will.
Numerous members of the European Parliament spoke of the need to heed the voice of the citizens of Europe and their unity and common will.
Perhaps, as we discuss the future of Europe, we should consider how to empower this voice, the citizen's voice, in our institutions and decisions and how to ensure our citizens are more seriously involved in the overall process.
Nonetheless, numerous common messages emerged from these different perceptions.
Of course, the first was acute disappointment at the failure of diplomatic efforts.
The second was the need for our humanitarian presence.
Commissioner Chris Patten spoke about this.
And regardless of one's stand on the war, it is, I think, morally and politically correct to say that the European Union will not turn its back on any humanitarian problems which this conflict may cause.
We have to turn our attention to the Iraqi people. Hunger, refugees, the cold, possible problems in northern Iraq, vulnerable groups, displaced persons, these are all problems waiting to happen.
I should like to emphasise that we already enjoy excellent cooperation with the Commission and Chris Patten on these issues and, as he quite rightly said, the European Union can be proud of its record here.
Even if we have aspirations to be a more important piece on the international chessboard, we should be proud of the important humanitarian work carried out by the European Union in all four corners of the world, wherever it is needed.
Thirdly, numerous references were made to reconstruction.
This word is a word which many Member States have been loath to use or discuss, either because, first, the war has barely started and, secondly, because they are understandably reticent about calling on the European Union to pay for the damage when the party is over, especially when, in this particular war at least, the Union did not approve.
But here again we have an important responsibility.
First of all, a responsibility for the fact that we want any developments in the region, and in Iraq in particular, to be directed centrally, to be directed by the UN, and if we are involved in reconstruction we can insist that the European Union will only make a substantial contribution if the United Nations is involved and directs the process, whatever that process may be.
Consequently, we have a responsibility to ensure that the UN has the lead role and then, of course, we also have a serious responsibility to play our part in the reconstruction process, whatever that process may be, as and when the fighting stops.
We also have a serious responsibility, as many of you pointed out, towards neighbouring countries.
We are in contact with them and I think that here too, especially as regards the candidate country, Turkey, that it needs our help, especially as it progresses towards accession, and that it is bound to be affected one way or another by the crisis in Iraq.
In the Arab world, several Members pointed out that dialogue here is difficult at the moment.
I would say the opposite is true, because the European Union has authority in the Arab world.
The initiatives the European Union is taking, our constant understanding with them, have shown that there is no cultural divide.
Even the citizens shouting for peace in our streets have proven that.
The invitation extended to the presidency of the European Union by the leaders of the Arab world to visit Sharm el Sheik was not a happy coincidence.
I also welcome the initiatives taken by the European Parliament to arrange meetings with parliamentarians, regardless of when they take place.
This dialogue is essential if we are to start a debate on fundamental issues, fundamental issues which will avert possible future crises, issues such as poverty and economic cooperation, human rights and democracy, the role of women, security and how we can work together to fight terrorism, illegal immigration and numerous other problems.
Of course, the fact that we are advancing this peace process in the Middle East jointly with the Quartet, and with the unanimous backing of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Fifteen, is appreciated by all the forces working for peace, by Israel and by the Arab world.
Finally, an important message emerged about our relations with the United States.
Numerous speakers emphasised that the point is not whether we are for or against the Americans.
That is not where the problem lies.
Whether we are friends or not is not the point.
As Mr Crespo and several other speakers said, we are partners and partners need to talk on equal terms.
Talking on equal terms means, as Mr Poettering said, that we ourselves need a strong Union.
We need a single voice and we need to be able to take on more and more responsibility in international affairs.
We need to give serious consideration to the future development of our defence and foreign policy and we need systematic dialogue with the United States.
As a brief aside, when we met a few months ago, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress went for me hammer and tongs on the subject of the International Criminal Court and our position.
I discussed the matter with them, I expressed the views of the European Union and I realised that they do not really know what we are thinking, what our stand is and why we think this court is so important.
I do not know how many I convinced, but they certainly went away thinking more about our position than before.
I also know that Mr Pat Cox has already taken initiatives to start a debate between the European Parliament and Congress and I welcome these initiatives, which I think should be supported and, of course, intensified.
We have to work with the United States if we want a multilateral approach to problems and I did not hear anyone speak out against multilateral cooperation within the international community.
A multilateral approach to today's problems which, in the final analysis, means safeguarding a simple principle, the principle of the 'strength of law' rather than the principle of the 'law of the strong'.
That is what the European Union is. A community of values.
A community of principles.
That is what unites us. Different nations, different languages, even different traditions, but with a common will based on principles, based on these values.
And it is on the basis of these values that we are building the Europe of the 15, the Europe of the 25, then of the 28 or even perhaps more, if we include the Western Balkans.
We have done a massive amount of peace work on the basis of these principles.
We are continuing this magnum opus by enlarging and promoting our international role.
And we can ensure that Iraq and how the problem of Iraq has been dealt with will be the exception in the international community rather than the rule, thereby safeguarding global intergovernmentalism, which there is an increasing call for, and the application of the basic principles which we embrace and serve, be it in the Council, the European Parliament or the Commission.
We may have our differences, ladies and gentlemen, but we shall emerge from this crisis - this is the message I get from my colleagues and from our citizens, whom we all honour - decisive, with renewed political will, determined to build a stronger, united Europe.
Whether this will come about today, tomorrow or in a few months' time, I do not know.
But the momentum is there.
The momentum is there and I think it is our responsibility to help put flesh and bones on our debate in the Convention on the future of Europe and, of course, later, at the Intergovernmental Conference, so that we can talk of a Europe which will foster democracy, progress and peace both on our own continent and throughout the world.
So I am optimistic, especially following our debate, that the leaders of the European Union, the European Council, will indeed send out a message of unity, cooperation and determination to deal efficiently with the problems ahead, and I envisage a decisive role for the European Parliament in paving the way forward.
Mr President, whatever else the Parliament may or may not think about me, I think that it would concede that I have always taken this Chamber and, indeed, the issue of democratic accountability, extremely seriously.
One day - I will leave it very late because it may be a very unpopular thing to say and I may be accused of lÃšse-majestÃ© - just before I leave the European Commission next November, I will deliver a little speech in this Chamber about how much better debates are when the people who make speeches have the courtesy to stay behind and listen to the answers.
I should like to answer three of the points that were raised in this debate.
They were raised in one case by somebody who is still here, and someone else who raised a point to which I will respond was one of a number who mentioned U.S. relations.
Let me begin with the discussion on humanitarian aid and reconstruction.
My honourable friend, Mr Evans, who alas is not able to be with us, claimed to detect a difference between the remarks I made last week on reconstruction and humanitarian assistance and what I said today.
I want to do something which I always used to criticise the former Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, for doing. I shall read to you one of my own speeches.
I would just like to quote what I said last week and then move the debate on a little.
After talking about humanitarian assistance, I said that 'immediate humanitarian help is one thing, but the demands upon us will certainly extend much beyond that.
As the House is all too well aware, Europe's external relations budget is already heavily committed.
It will be very difficult in any circumstances to launch massive new programmes in Iraq and in the neighbourhood of Iraq.'
We have had representations already, for example, from the Jordanian Government.
But it will be that much more difficult for the European Union to cooperate fully and on a large scale - also in the longer-term reconstruction process - if events unfold without proper UN cover and if the Member States remain divided.'
I went on to say 'I am simply making an observation of fact: if it comes to war, it will be very much easier to persuade you - the European Union's budgetary authority - to be generous if there is no dispute about the legitimacy of the military action that has taken place; about the new political order that emerges thereafter; or about who is in charge of the reconstruction process.
I am not making a quasi-legal point.
I am simply offering a political judgement of no great novelty or sagacity.
It seems pretty obvious to me.'
Indeed it does seem obvious.
I am delighted that since then, others have taken up a similar theme.
There should be a new UN resolution following any conflict, providing not just for humanitarian help, but also for the administration and governance of Iraq.
That must now be done under proper UN authorisation.
These are not my words; they were from the speech made by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in the House of Commons this week.
I say without any hint of irony that I am glad that the argument some of us have been putting for weeks, if not months, is now starting to take off.
I wonder, just in passing, whether it would have done so if we had never raised the point in the first place.
Second, I should like to say a brief word about the United States and our relations with that country.
Criticising the United States is not the same as having a European foreign policy.
It is equally the case that to disagree with the world view of Richard Pearle or Robert Kagan is not to be anti-American.
There are millions of Americans who disagree with Mr Pearle and Mr Kagan.
(Applause)
I do not think that anybody accuses them of being anti-American.
Do we accuse most of the last Democratic administration of being anti-American?
Do we accuse a lot of Republicans today of being anti-American?
If signing up to whatever Richard Pearle has to say is a necessary price to pay to demonstrate that one is a passionate believer in the transatlantic relationship, then you had better put in a call to Brent Scowcroft or to many of the most distinguished figures in previous Republican administrations.
Let us make that point gently: I am not prepared to be judged on my relationship with America by whether or not I agree with Richard Pearle.
(Applause)
And since I am in an excessively candid mood, I shall make a third point.
There have been many discussions in the Convention - which rolls on under its distinguished presidency - about the future of the common foreign and security policy, discussions in which I have taken part myself, discussions about the use of qualified majority voting, discussions about double-hatting; all this and much more: it has been an extremely exciting ride for all of us who have taken part.
But let me remind the House of what the Treaty already says. Article 11 was referred to by the honourable Member in her extremely good speech.
Article 11(2), subparagraph 2, says that 'The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity.
They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations'.
I do not know how this translates but, as my late father would have said, pull the other leg.
Institutional change can certainly help to create political will.
I do not doubt that at all.
But you cannot create political will through institutional change alone, and institutional change is not a substitute for political will.
I am afraid that is a lesson which I have learned the hard way over the last three and a half years.
(Applause)
That brings our extraordinary debate to a close.
I should like to thank all colleagues who have participated and also the Council and the Commission for their participation.
The debate has revealed that many differences remain, but also that they are based on honest and deep convictions, which also differ.
I thank you for the calm, reflective and respectful manner in which the debate has taken place.
(The extraordinary sitting closed at 11.45 a.m.)
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
It is with great sadness that, with the war in Iraq already having begun, we are here taking part in what is nonetheless an important extraordinary sitting, to which we are contributing, together with our group, in this last ditch attempt to join forces against the war.
The protest still stands at this particularly serious time in international politics, marked by a unilateral, unlawful war waged by the United States and its allies in defiance of the United Nations' Charter and the will of the Security Council, which will provoke a humanitarian disaster and cause the deaths of thousands of innocent people.
It is inadmissible and particularly repellent that a number of European governments, especially that of Portugal, should be associated, through the notorious Azores Summit, with this war that has been condemned by a range of public opinion and is the subject of a motion of censure delivered to the government of my country.
It is unacceptable that, in disregard for the European Parliament's position - which is one of opposition to a war without the sanction of the United Nations - some European governments should have persisted in their support for the Bush administration, whose real objective was never to disarm Iraq but, rather, to overthrow the Iraqi regime, install a North American protectorate there and control the wealth of Iraq, particularly in the form of oil.
We shall continue to oppose war and to defend peace.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 20 March 2003.
We are greatly saddened today to learn of the death after a long illness of our former colleague Mr JosÃ© Aurelio de Barros Moura on 25 March 2003.
Mr Barros Moura was a Member of this Parliament from 1986 to 1989 and then again from 1994 to 1999 in the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
He was a Vice-President of the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly.
All those colleagues who knew him and worked with him appreciated greatly his personal qualities, his good nature and his openness.
Above all, we recall him as a man of deep conviction and a strong and committed advocate of European integration.
I would ask you to rise and observe a minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)
Mr President, you have always shown a great deal of sensitivity when people, or even one person is killed in political violence anywhere in the world.
I should like to propose, following the death today of 15 innocent people in Baghdad market and the death of soldiers on both sides, that we observe one minute's silence for the victims of the war in Iraq.
Mr Alavanos, I think the House shares your feelings for all of the casualties and victims of this war and I hope, in the course of our debate this afternoon, that colleagues will be able to take the opportunity to express for themselves the kind of solidarity which you have shown here today.
Mr President, during the Strasbourg part-session I called on you to take up the case of a number of Cuban dissidents arrested in that country. They are members of the Christian Liberation Movement.
A wave of new arrests took place during subsequent weeks. Journalists, dissidents and human rights defenders were targeted.
It should be noted that all this coincides with the opening of the Commission's permanent representation in Cuba. It also comes at a time when many Members of the House were giving favourable consideration to extending the Cotonou Convention to include Cuba.
It may be desirable to continue dialogue with the Cuban people and their government, and to keep channels of communication open. Nonetheless, Mr President, I appeal to you once again to take up this cause and press for the release of these Cuban journalists, dissidents and human rights defenders.
This week I communicated precisely the concerns you mentioned on the last occasion to the Ambassador of the Mission of the Republic of Cuba.
I outlined in detail our concerns and I shall forward you a copy of the correspondence.
Mr President, a large number of Members of this Parliament and of its staff are deeply affected by the war and want to express their deep sympathy with the victims.
That is why many Members of Parliament and members of staff have decided to wear black armbands during this week's part-session.
We would ask for your understanding for this mark of solidarity with all the victims and with public opinion, which has come out against this war.
I shall speak later on the subject of Iraq but, while our attention is focused on that country, there are atrocious activities going on in other parts of the world.
I refer in particular to Zimbabwe, where in the last few days police have arrested over 500 people - including Members of Parliament - and hospitals have treated more than 250 people with serious injuries.
This is another instance in which the failure of European Union governments to speak with one voice and to implement policies with resolution has given licence to another tyrant - in this case, Mugabe.
I ask Council to redouble its efforts to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe.
Colleagues, as you know, our Rules of Procedure allow for a number of short speeches at the beginning of a sitting.
I have taken a number, but many more colleagues wish to speak.
I propose, with regard to those still wishing to speak, to invite you to make your points of order after our debate.
The presidency of the Council is present and in terms of the dignity of the House, it should be appropriate now to proceed with our business.
By letter of 7 March 2003, Mr Olivier Dupuis requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in a case pending before a court in Rome.
Pursuant to Rule 6(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I have referred this request to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, one of the Members of this House, Mr Cappato, has been detained in prison for three days by the British authorities.
I would like to know whether parliamentary immunity still exists in Europe and whether being awarded the title 'European of the Year', as Mr Cappato has, automatically means one has to go to prison, in which case that is a competition which we would all do well not to enter.
Mr President, I want to talk about what Mr Bigliardo said and the letter you have received regarding the immunity of Mr Dupuis.
Mr Pannella too has been given a four-month jail sentence, commuted to eight months of conditional release, for civil disobedience with regard to drugs.
He has to inform the Italian authorities of all his movements and he can only come to the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg for a total of seven days per month.
Mr Pannella, Mr Cappato and Mr Dupuis all subjected themselves to these sentences voluntarily without raising the question of their parliamentary immunity.
Our concern is not for them: it is for Parliament and the safeguarding of its work and its plenary sessions.
I should like to point out at this juncture that if colleagues wish to raise other cases involving the defence of parliamentary immunity, I invite them to take these cases up with the relevant committee, namely the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the outcome of the European Council of 21-22 March and on Iraq.
(Several Members on the left held up placards denouncing the war in Iraq)
Ladies and gentlemen, the spring Council met in Brussels to discuss the economic and social situation in the Union.
This was the third European Council summit meeting with this agenda.
As you all know, the objective of the Lisbon strategy is to make the European economy the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
Before the Council was convened, the view was expressed that this Council should not meet or that it should deal solely with the war in Iraq.
The Presidency did not agree with these views.
We have a direct interest in developments in Iraq.
We are particularly concerned that there should be no human casualties and we are particularly concerned about the civilian population in Iraq.
However, this does not mean that we should abandon our main mission, by which I mean our policies for economic development and employment in Europe, especially in the current climate of recession and unemployment.
It would have been wrong to allow the summit to become a casualty of the war.
That would have played right into the hands of all those who take pleasure in highlighting Europe's inability to cope with crucial situations.
(Members on the left held up placards reading 'Stop the war' and 'Stop the killers' and the words 'Thousands are being killed' were heard in the background)
We know that people are filled with intense emotion about this issue, but everyone has the right to be listened to in serenity and with respect.
I appeal to colleagues to please show that respect to the Prime Minister.
You shall have your opportunity to speak.
The European Council concluded that the slowdown in the economy had lasted longer than anticipated and that the current prospects of a recovery were overshadowed by the war, global political risks and economic uncertainties.
The European Council also concluded that considerable progress had been made with the Lisbon agenda, now entering its fourth year.
For example, five million new jobs have been created since the start of the Lisbon strategy - 500 000 of them in 2002 despite the less favourable economic climate, with unemployment declining by 2 million.
Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
A great deal of effort is needed if we are to push ahead with our economic and social reforms.
The European Council set four priorities: to raise employment and social cohesion is the first priority.
By reforming tax and benefit systems and increasing incentives for labour market participation and incentives to encourage the labour markets to be more adaptable to changing economic conditions and, of course, by paying attention to social cohesion.
The second priority is to promote innovation and entrepreneurship.
This means increasing company expenditure on research, facilitating the creation of companies that focus on innovation, improving their access to finance, reducing administrative burdens and encouraging the spirit of enterprise among young people.
The third priority is to strengthen the single market and connect Europe.
We need to open up the European energy, transport and financial services markets and improve the regulatory framework and consumer protection.
The final priority is environmental protection for growth and jobs.
This means taking action in the environmental field and promoting new investments in clean and more resource-efficient technologies.
At this point, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that, as the conclusions show, considerable progress has been made with the Lisbon strategy during the Greek Presidency.
For example, significant results have been obtained as regards agreeing on better coordination of budgetary policies, agreeing on a transparent and cheap Community patent, fourteen years in the making, putting into place an integrated Europe-wide financial market, setting the direction for the revised European Employment Strategy, introducing a Tripartite Social Summit, establishing a Tripartite Social Summit, agreeing on energy taxation and setting targets in sectors such as renewable energy, increased energy efficiency and bio-fuels.
The European Council issued guidelines.
The conclusions contain guidelines on how to achieve the objectives I have mentioned.
In 2003, the European Union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments.
What are they?
The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, the Employment Guidelines and the Internal Market Strategy.
The Council ordered these tools to be streamlined and coordinated and to be given a three-year perspective, in order to make them more efficient.
The Council took a series of decisions in specific sectors, such as employment and modernising the European social model.
The Council urged the Member States to maintain the momentum of reform of national labour markets.
As I said, it stressed the need to reform tax systems in order to promote employment and increase labour demand in Europe, improve the wage and salary formation system, so that they take into account the relationship between wages, price stability, productivity, training levels and labour market conditions, modernise employment legislation, taking account of the need for both greater flexibility and greater security and improve labour mobility over occupations, sectors, regions and across borders, for example by improving transparency and recognition between systems of vocational education.
Finally, in this sector, the European Council invited the Commission to establish a special European Employment Taskforce, headed by Mr Wim Kok, to propose specific measures to increase employment.
The Council also touched on all the other sectors which constitute the Lisbon strategy: knowledge, innovation, entrepreneurship, competitiveness, and set certain deadlines for completing various reforms.
Finally, I should like to mention that it laid down substantive regulations on safety at sea in the wake of the Prestige accident.
Ladies and gentlemen, this - very briefly - was the outcome of discussions on the Lisbon strategy.
Now I should like to say something on the subject of Iraq.
It is a known fact that all the Member States of the European Union demanded the disarmament of Iraq and the destruction of any weapons of mass destruction it may have had.
It is also a known fact that there is acute disagreement as to how and when disarmament will take place.
This issue was discussed repeatedly in the Security Council without any agreement being reached.
On the contrary, the divisions widened.
It would therefore have been pointless for the Presidency to hope that the differences which have emerged over all the past few months would be overcome at the Council.
On the contrary, it felt that, with the beginning of the military conflict, principles needed to be laid down for dealing with the situation caused by the start of war and that we should be thinking about the future and the aftermath of the crisis in order to preclude new divisions, in order to set clear, common objectives, in order to limit the repercussions of the war and avoid a chain reaction of crises and in order to be able to work once the war ends.
That is our objective.
Peace and progress in the region.
At the beginning, this effort was met with doubt.
Could we discuss this sort of agenda?
However, the Council achieved a common position, pointing out, among other things, the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq, the need to address the major humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the conflict, the need for our solidarity with the countries affected by it and the central role of the United Nations, both in dealing with the Iraqi crisis and in the international system in general.
The Security Council, the conclusions state, will need to give the United Nations a mandate to deal with the post-war period.
Another point was the need to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process, our determination to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy and the importance of the transatlantic partnership.
Is the fact that we steered clear of the main problem a sign of hypocrisy, as some have suggested?
No, it is not.
The differences of opinion on the main problem were clear.
The impasse was also clear.
There was no point in discussing it.
We needed to focus our attention elsewhere: to what is important for the future.
And that is what we did.
Perhaps some people would have preferred to widen the gap, to add more fuel to the fire?
We believe that, now that the war has raised even more questions, the European Union has a duty to send out a message about restoring peace in the region and dealing with the aftermath of the war.
The future is every bit as important as the present.
If we fail to address it, we shall find ourselves on a very slippery slope.
Is the Union of Europe split at the moment?
Yes, it is.
However, the answer is not to exacerbate the divide, the answer is to try and highlight where we can work together and pull in the same direction.
The decision on Iraq was a decision based on the premise that the European Union has a voice and must have a voice in international affairs.
It is therefore a symbol of the efforts being made to create a balanced Euro-Atlantic relationship in which Europe maintains its independence, takes special initiatives and has its own role.
That we want an independent Europe is clear from another point in the conclusions referring to greater research capabilities in the defence sector and the creation of a European defence capabilities development and acquisition agency.
Ladies and gentlemen, what is our objective?
To get international relations working in a more widely acceptable manner at international level as quickly as possible.
This presupposes that the United Nations, through its institutions, will issue the main guidelines on what is to happen after the war in Iraq.
Its reinstatement from a challenged to an unchallenged international legal system will be achieved if it is clear that the United Nations are against taking on a central role.
The decision emphasises the central role of the United Nations.
With the differences of opinion over Iraq, numerous people concluded, sadly, that we have no common foreign policy.
But that is not strictly true.
There are common positions on numerous foreign policy issues.
On other issues, and on aspects of certain more general issues, the Union's foreign policy is taking shape.
Policies in other sectors are also taking shape.
And there are also divisions in other sectors.
From the common agricultural policy through to immigration policy.
And yet no one ever said that the European Union was superfluous because it failed to agree on the directive on working conditions for temporary agency workers or on how to deal with economic migrants seeking asylum or, finally, on changes to the Stability Pact.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is constantly taking shape.
That is why its development is a challenge, a challenge to think, to apply our knowledge and experience and work for a prosperous, secure future.
The war in Iraq, which we have to deal with, is part of that challenge, which is why we cannot merely welcome or condemn it.
We also need to look at the future prospects of Europe and the world.
Our ambition in today's world is to put an end to war, to the reign of terror, to threats to man and his environment, by creating rules of global intergovernmentalism.
The United Nations have not yet managed to become a convincing, efficient institution, even though they are charged with addressing issues which are vital to the global community.
And it will be some time before they do.
National chauvinism is extremely powerful, which is why we have a political duty to continue to strengthen the role of the European Union, thereby helping at European and global level to consolidate the process of peace, cooperation and progress.
The Brussels Summit showed that, despite our differences, we still feel Europe is the best way of preventing one new superpower from monopolising our cosmos.
Europe's ability to participate and influence a multipolar world must be kept alive with initiatives, cooperation and a belief in our common future.
The spring Council in Brussels may not have answered questions, but it issued guidelines which will allow us to put Europe's role into practice, if we cooperate, if we live in harmony together, if we fight together for a multipolar world.
Mr President, as a supporter of the coalition war effort, when I displayed my poster which read 'Saddam Out!', I was told by Vice-Presidents Dimitrakopoulos and Provan to remove it, as it was apparently against the Rules of the House.
Can we please have a consistent ruling on this matter?
(Mixed reactions)
You are perfectly correct.
The ruling is that these kinds of displays should not take place inside the Chamber.
I would invite colleagues who have now made their point, which has indeed been tolerated, please to consider the decorum of the House and to remove the material on display.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate focuses on the recent European Council: a Council that took place at a time of grave international crisis, which made the task of the Greek Presidency extremely difficult.
I therefore wish to express particularly heartfelt thanks and appreciation to Prime Minister Simitis and the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Papandreou, for their skilful and sensitive handling of the summit.
The Spring European Council is the time in the Union's yearly calendar when it traditionally looks at economic issues, but the Iraq crisis cast a shadow over the whole of the Council held in recent days in Brussels.
I will therefore begin my speech today with that.
As I speak, a war is under way and no one can tell how much longer it will last. A war in which troops from some Member States are fighting in the region.
A war that has caused great divisions within the Union. A war opposed by the overwhelming majority of European citizens and very many others throughout the world.
A war which, like all wars, brings death and suffering in its train, even if it ultimately brings the fall of a dictator. First of all, I wish to express the Commission's - and my own - sympathy to those families who mourn loved ones and to all who have suffered as a result of the war.
I also want to reiterate the need for respect for human dignity, even between the belligerents.
We should also bear another fact in mind: the extra funds requested for this operation - USD 74.7 billion - are much higher than the total amount of aid the world gives the poorest countries each year, which is only just over EUR 50 billion.
The statement on the Iraq crisis adopted at the end of the Council's work gives a clear list of the many important points on which there is unanimous agreement within the Union.
They need to be highlighted in this debate too. They include the central role of the United Nations, both during and after the crisis, combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, respect for Iraq's territorial integrity, the need for urgent action in terms of humanitarian aid, our commitment to multilateral management of world politics and the Atlantic Alliance, which continues to be a strategic priority.
There are many points we all agree on, then, and they are crucial. We should bear this in mind after all that has been said and written on our divisions in recent days and weeks.
However, we must not try to pretend that these divisions are not there.
We must not lie to ourselves or to our fellow citizens.
Having listed these crucial points on which the Union is in agreement, we must admit that the European Union is going through a very rough patch.
I am thinking about the role the Union should be playing and is not.
Indeed, the issue of the enlarged Union's foreign and defence policy is starkly highlighted by world events.
We must ask ourselves what role we want to play on the world scene.
I say 'want' because I am convinced that the Union has the means to develop with time into an active, influential international political player, not just economically but in terms of security too, on the basis of the values on which Europe is founded.
Let us start with security.
The European citizens have already made it clear what they want.
They want peace, multilateralism and a Europe - a Europe that brings security as well as peace - and they have made this abundantly clear recently.
This is not an emotional reaction at a time of crisis, brought on by the natural anxiety and concern always triggered by war. It goes much deeper, and it would be a sin to ignore it, for it should unite us in purpose.
Indeed, the Treaties require the Member States to 'support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.'
They are, and I quote, to 'work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity'. They must refrain from 'any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.'
How little the letter and the spirit of these Treaty provisions have been observed recently is plain to all.
Moreover, this has come at a time when the representatives of all governments, institutions and parliaments meeting within the Convention are working on the Union's new constitutional charter and when the Union's now impending enlargement is bringing new opportunities and imposing new responsibilities.
Let me take this opportunity to applaud the positive result of Slovenia's referendum on accession, which has followed closely on Malta's.
Ladies and gentlemen, the road we have travelled in the last 60 years towards a united Europe has not been easy. There have been many rough patches, but Europe has always drawn courage precisely from its deepest crises and used them as a springboard for its most spectacular advances.
It was the failure of the EDC - of the plan to create a European Defence Community - which created the impetus for the Treaty of Rome.
It was the United States' decision to float the dollar and the resulting collapse of the whole Bretton Woods system which set Europe on the long road to monetary union. Later, the oil crisis in the 1970s and the currency crisis in the summer of 1992 spurred us first to set up the European Monetary System and then to draft the rules on Economic and Monetary Union in the Maastricht Treaty.
Today, history is repeating itself. Europe's future hangs on the way we face this crisis.
We could decide to go for a system of international relations based on the balance of power and entrust ourselves to the sovereignty and national interests of the individual European States but, as Commissioner Patten said in this very House, that would be like trying to tackle the challenges of the twenty-first century with the instruments and policies of the nineteenth century.
Moreover, it would be contrary to the very nature of the Union, which is based on dialogue, solidarity, multilateralism and an inspiring combination of ethics and politics.
We must decide to carry through Europe's unification and give it the institutions, the instruments and the decision-making mechanisms it needs to make it a genuinely political Union - which is the road our fellow citizens want us to take - a Union that can apply unified policies for the economy, international relations and defence.
In the field of defence, the last few days have brought the launch of an initiative that could take us far.
Belgium, France and Germany have decided to look jointly at closer integration.
There is a background to this initiative, which these countries are right to say is open to all other Member States, because it must bring us together, not divide us.
I am not just referring to the experience consolidated some time ago now in the integration of European armed forces within multinational corps such as the Eurocorps, Eurofor and Euromarfor.
Let us cast our minds back to Saint Malo in December 1998.
A process was set in motion that led to the common European security and defence policy in the space of six short months and thanks to which we can now rely on instruments such as the Political and Security Committee and the Military Committee and Military Staff of the European Union.
The countries behind the initiative - I would point out - were France and the United Kingdom, and, thanks to that agreement, the goal of a rapid reaction force of 60 000 troops can now be considered to be within reach.
It is the first step towards what people are demanding for the first time in the history of the European institutions: our common defence.
The European Convention has created a working group on defence.
In its conclusions, the working group stressed the need to develop European defence capabilities and to strengthen the industrial and technological base.
Two weeks ago, the Commission adopted a Communication on defence-related industrial and market issues with the aim of facilitating and fostering more effective coordination of a European defence-equipment policy.
Lastly, on 18 March 2003, the Council decided to launch the first military operation in the history of the Union and take over from the NATO forces operating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at the end of this month.
Ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans are not from Venus, as some would suggest.
The peoples of this old, wise Europe have a long and painful past. A past that has led us to base our Union on law and to work for an international order founded on right, not on might.
(Applause)
We are fully aware, however, that humanitarian policies alone are not enough, just as it is not enough to outstrip the other main players in the area of development aid policy.
We know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions, until we stop relying on the European Union for economic growth and the United States for security - and there is nothing anti-American in what I am saying, not least because cooperation between the United States and the European Union has greatly increased recently, even in the most sensitive areas.
Think of the remarkable cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after September 11 and the constant dialogue between the US Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, and our own Commissioner Lamy.
Experience shows that European unity is a condition for and a guarantee of effective transatlantic cooperation, and what I am saying stems wholly from a deep conviction that only Europe, only Europeans, can decide what Europe's interests are.
Today, we are faced with a crisis, but history has a sense of timing: this challenge may be a deciding moment for Europe but it has come while the Convention is sitting.
I therefore call on this House and all the institutions represented in the Convention, and I appeal to all its Members directly not to miss this opportunity.
Today as never before, we can seek to forge our own destiny, but we must learn the right lessons from past experience.
At Maastricht, Europe laid the foundations for both Economic and Monetary Union and the common foreign and security policy, policies which we have too often disregarded.
While the former has evolved to the point of putting the euro into the citizens' pockets, the latter is still in its infancy.
The institutions, the instruments and the decision-making mechanisms for implementing the two policies were quite different and so are the results.
However much time it may take to fully implement our plans, the moment of truth for Europe's foreign and defence policy has come.
The decision demands great far-sightedness and great political courage, but the choice is clear: do we want to be left out, all of us, of the management of world affairs, or do we want to play a part, on an equal footing with our allies, in building a new world order?
Ladies and gentlemen, I started off today by saying that the Spring European Council is the principle occasion when we review our economic progress each year. This year, there are some encouraging points, and we should not forget the great progress made recently in opening up markets.
The process of opening up the telecommunications market is almost complete. The energy market is in the process of being opened up.
Great progress has been made on mobility and on many aspects of social security. After years of work there is the agreement on the Community Patent.
Here, too, however, we must be honest with ourselves.
Our progress in implementing the reform strategy decided at Lisbon three years ago is too slow.
I am not just talking about the widespread disappointment on the issue of savings tax.
The growth rate of our economies is alarmingly below that required to create the jobs we need and to support the process of convergence of the acceding countries' economies.
That is why I told the European Council last Friday, as I am telling you today, that it is time to send a strong, clear signal of our commitment to support growth.
There are two sectors in which I believe action can and must be taken immediately: Trans-European Networks and research and development.
The priorities for the Trans-European Networks were identified some time ago but, to date, they have not brought much in the way of results.
Even the 14 projects given priority in 1994 at the Essen European Council are severely behind schedule. Meanwhile, new corridors are needed to take advantage of the opportunities enlargement will bring, as the amount of traffic on our roads and in the tunnels that pass through our mountains is increasing exponentially.
Investment in the Trans-European Networks currently stands at below EUR 20 billion per year.
At this rate, it will take over 20 years to complete them all.
Equally depressing is the state of the major research and development programmes, to the extent that, despite the funds made available in the Union's budget and the loans granted by the European Investment Bank, public expenditure in this area is actually significantly down on last year, while private investment is still below the minimum required as well.
It is therefore time to launch a major initiative to bring about a substantial increase in the funding of both the Trans-European Networks and the major research and development projects.
I have therefore asked Philippe Maystadt, the President of the European Investment Bank, to work with me in seeking new sources of funding, exploring all possible options such as Union guarantees and special borrowing facilities.
These, ladies and gentlemen, are the preconditions for reinvigorating the Lisbon process and expanding the horizons of our knowledge.
Joint research, networks of excellence, mobility of students and researchers and the key programmes on life sciences, renewable energy and the environment are vital.
I am quite aware that financing is not the only obstacle to the speedy implementation of these major projects, and I am equally aware that many years are needed to complete them.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why there is no time to waste.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with a word of thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency of the Council, and also, Mr Simitis, to you personally.
This time of grave crisis is one in which, rather than dividing Europe, it needs to be brought together, and it is evident that that is what is in your mind.
As this Europe of ours does not belong to any one party family alone, but is our common possession, what I desire for you and for us all, gathered here, is that, in the remaining weeks of your Presidency, you will be successful in guiding this European Union in the right direction for the future!
(Applause from the right)
At this time, we think of the coalition troops in Iraq, some 30 000 of them from a Member State of the European Union.
Human dignity being indivisible, though, we think also of the Iraqi soldiers who are being misused by a criminal regime.
I hope that what was so well expressed in the Conclusions of the summit here in Brussels will indeed come to pass, and that all Iraqis will very soon be allowed to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity under a representative government that will be at peace with its neighbours and an active member of the international community.
That must be our objective, and we Europeans must not opt out at this stage but, together, united and with determination, must make our own effective contribution to giving peace in the Middle East a chance.
Although there are differences of opinion in our group, as there were before the war, the great majority of us take the view that there is one thing we should be saying to our American friends. It is that, whilst international institutions such as the United Nations, NATO, and, of course, this integrated European structure, the European Union, may have their faults, because they are manned by human beings, we do agree that they have a vision for the future, and, no matter what the imperfections of these structures of peace, we will not allow anyone to jeopardise these institutions, the basis of whose existence is beyond question!
Richard Perle has said that both the UN and NATO had lost their contemporary relevance and were meaningless in the twenty-first century.
I would like to respond to that by saying that, if we ourselves put a question mark against the North Atlantic Alliance, what are we actually saying to the peoples of central Europe, to the Poles, and to the Slovenes, who have just held their referendum?
That is where they are seeking security in the face of threats!
That is why we have to give some thought to how to improve these institutions, but we must not question their existence.
(Applause from the right)
We do, of course, need proper trans-Atlantic relations and a trans-Atlantic partnership.
Nobody is in any doubt about my position on the Iraq issue, and that is why I tell our American friends that the European Union is also in the American interest.
Americans should not see relations with Europe solely in terms of relations between the USA and France, the USA and Great Britain, the USA and Germany, the USA and Greece, the USA and all the others.
We will soon be meeting them again in the forum of the World Trade Organisation, where the European Union must - and will - present a united front.
Hence my plea to our American friends that they take the European Union seriously.
It is our way of strengthening our influence in the world; it is our way of living at peace with one another and maintaining good, well-ordered, relations with the United States of America on the basis of partnership!
(Applause from the right)
The President of the Commission has praised the Belgian initiative on defence policy.
I spent ten years as chairman of this Parliament's security and disarmament sub-committee, so I know what I am talking about when I say that I very much support what they are trying to do, but am not sure that having a meeting of the few here in Belgium is the right way to go about it.
We were highly critical when the British Prime Minister sent out invitations to dinner at No 10 Downing Street, with some being invited and others not.
If that sort of thing catches on even in the Benelux states, then my great fear is that we will end up with new communities forming in the south, in the east, in the west, communities of Social Democrats, communities of Christian Democrats, some of them overlapping.
We must make use of the Community institutions and work together in them!
(Applause from the right)
Let me make a few comments on the Lisbon process; while I am grateful to the President of the European Council for mentioning this topic, we have for some time regarded as excessively bombastic the statement that we are to become a best economic area in the world.
It always reminds us a bit of Nikita Khrushchev, who, in the 1960s, always wanted to overtake the USA, and we know what the result was!
The goal is the right one, but what now matters is that the instruments be brought into play, and this is where a number of Member States are not doing what has to be done.
I would have liked more to have been said about monetary stability.
A lot is being said about the Stability Pact's flexibility.
Let us just consider what the Euro is worth to us today.
Let us imagine what things would be like if it did not exist - how then would our currencies be valued in relation to each other today?
It is for that reason that we must defend the common European currency, and we need it to be a stable one.
What is of pre-eminent importance is globalisation, which is often decried - sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly.
Big businesses are able to seek out for themselves a business location where taxes are at their lowest, which small and medium-sized enterprises cannot do.
It follows that structural reforms must be of such a nature as to enable small and medium-sized firms to invest, taxes to be cut and jobs to be thereby created.
This is where governments must take some action at last!
Please allow me to make two comments by way of conclusion.
I hope that a statute for European political parties will come about before the end of the Greek Presidency, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge you to ensure that we achieve a result on the issue of the financial package with the prospect of enlargement.
We will not accept any curtailment of Parliament's rights as regards the Budget, but nor do we want to delay enlargement; we want to keep to the timetable.
We wish you success in your efforts to do this.
To the President of the Commission, too, I make the plea that we should now do everything possible to maintain Parliament's rights and prevent discrimination against the candidate countries.
For these things we will continue to campaign, and we ask that you put them into practice.
Then, success will be ours under the Greek Presidency of the Council, a success that I wish, not only for you, but also for us all, and from the bottom of my heart.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the courage and resolution it displayed during its second summit. In the light of recent events I fear it may yet be called upon to convene further summits.
On behalf of my group, I should like to express our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the victims of this war. There must be no more victims.
My group therefore believes the war must cease immediately.
The United Nations must assume management of the conflict. The latter should never have been taken out of the United Nations framework.
I also deeply regret the unilateral decision taken by the President of the United States to leave this framework and start a war. I support Mr Annan.
Once again, I must emphasise that the present unilateral action is in breach of the United Nations Charter and of international law.
On behalf of my group I should like to further reiterate our complete opposition to the doctrine of pre-emptive attack as an instrument of foreign policy.
(Applause)
I would like to repeat what Mr Cook said in the House of Commons. Multilateral agreements and a world order governed by rules afford better protection to our British and European interests than unilateral instruments.
From President Carter to the Pope, countless individuals around the world endorse this view. Mr Poettering quoted Mr Perle, a spokesperson for the armaments industry.
Mr Perle is a shameless lobbyist.
He wrote an article thanking God for the failure of the UN. Given that so many are swearing by some God's name or taking it in vain, I should like to seize this opportunity of sending out a timely reminder.
There is a fallen angel in both the Bible and the Koran. The fallen angels, who were angels of light, are named Lucifer and Iblis respectively.
Their fall was caused by pride and unbridled blind arrogance. That is the very situation we are currently faced with.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, no war is a clean war.
The doctored images presented to us conceal horror.
We are today receiving pictures of that market in Baghdad. You will recall that the European Union evolved from a common market.
No doubt you also recall another market, in Sarajevo, and how that was bombed.
I hope your consciences are stirred.
We are all involved in a conflict which is becoming increasingly horrific.
Clearly, large numbers of Iraqis long for a future without Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime.
They wish to enjoy freedom and dignity. Clearly too, they do not wish to have further death and destruction inflicted on them.
This action was taken unilaterally, outside the framework of the Security Council.
It has resulted in disaster, because very often the local population does not perceive the troops as a liberating force. The people are determined to protect what is theirs, to defend their land.
Furthermore, this region is beset by many complex problems. It is most unwise to destabilise it further, and this could impact the Middle East process.
Both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have insisted that this crisis and future action must be dealt with within the UN framework. I could not agree more.
Indeed, I have said so twice already in this House.
I have, however, read today's newspaper and apparently the management of the port of Umm Qasar has been awarded to a United States company. The latter is offering to subcontract some of the work to European companies.
This flies in the face of respect for the UN. Is the European Union to be invited to do subcontract work for the UN?
That is not the way forward. I believe we should make our voice heard.
We must insist on humanitarian aid being administered in a civilian framework, and furthermore, within the UN framework. Aid must not be administered by any of the powers currently involved.
(Applause)
I should like to make a final point before I finish and leave the floor to my colleague Mr Goebbels. He will speak on the Spring Council.
My point is as follows. We know the President of the United States has already estimated the cost of the war at USD 75 000 million per month.
Oil prices and exchange rates are on a roller coaster. President-in-Office of the Council, I very much fear that if this state of affairs continues you will be forced to convene a further summit to assess the European and world economies.
In conclusion, Mr President, we have to recognise that public opinion is riven by emotion. It is disconcerted and overwhelmingly opposed to this war.
I refer to wider public opinion, not just to European public opinion.
The public does not understand the urgency of this war or the reasons for it.
There is a world-wide movement for peace.
I have in mind Saturday's demonstration.
It falls to us to relaunch the multilateral approach to international relations. The dignity and legitimacy of the United Nations must be restored.
It will then be in a position to fulfil its role as a government for the world.
The European Union failed to act as one and therefore bears a share of the responsibility for this crisis. We must be able to envisage a future in which the Union can construct a foreign and security policy worthy of the name.
This is essential if we are to act honourably in the interest of the future of all humankind.
(Applause)
Mr President, the war with Iraq inevitably overshadowed the Council's important economic reform agenda.
It is only natural that, at such a time, economic issues should take second place to matters of life and death.
However, given the negative economic impact that the conflict could have on the Union's economy, we must not take our eyes off the ball and let the economic reforms that are needed to revitalise our economy fall further behind.
So before turning to the conflict with Iraq, I will say a few words about economic reform.
The truth is that the process of economic reform is running into the sand; with the European Union set to enlarge to 25 countries, we will have to run just to stand still.
I should like to cite just three examples.
First, at 1.9% of GDP, our investment in research and development is well below levels in the USA and Japan, and with only two of the accession countries spending more than 1% of GDP on research and development, we will be hard pressed to reach the 3% Lisbon target by 2010.
My second example is taken from the Barcelona Council, where Europe's leaders committed themselves to cutting the percentage of single market laws not yet implemented to less than 1.5% - instead, the proportion rose last year to over 2%.
As the incoming Member States will naturally face some teething problems in implementing law in the early years, this implementation deficit is in danger of growing further if we do not redouble our efforts.
Progress will certainly not be achieved if others emulate the tactics used by Mr Berlusconi in his shameful attempt to defend illegal milk subsidies at the expense of a deal on the taxation of savings.
That hardly augurs well for the Italian presidency.
And third: raising levels of employment.
It is impressive that we managed to create half a million jobs last year despite the economic slowdown.
But the scale of the task ahead becomes clear when we note that unemployment in the EU as a whole rose last year to nearly 8%.
On the issue of jobs, the Council appears to have followed the age-old practice: 'If in doubt, create a task force'.
I wish Wim Kok well in his work, but it is hard to see what answers he can come up with which are better than the tried and trusted recipe of reducing the burden of taxes on labour and increasing market flexibility.
On Iraq, I welcome the forward-looking nature of the European Council conclusions, brokered by the President-in-Office, and their focus on humanitarian assistance, on rebuilding Iraq and the central role to be played in this by the United Nations.
Humanitarian aid must get through.
We see from the situation in Basra just how important that is.
The horror transmitted through our television screens shows us just how necessary it is to get our relief agencies in and working.
I welcome Mr Prodi's proposal for EUR 3 million of immediate humanitarian aid through the Red Cross.
Liberal Democrats will support the rapid approval by our House of your request for the release of a further EUR 70 million from the emergency budget reserve.
The EU has been damaged by the divisions of recent weeks.
This could presage a new effort to heal the political wounds, but it is hard not to agree with the Luxembourg Prime Minister when he says that problems cannot be resolved unless they are discussed.
I agree with the Council that we need to strengthen transatlantic relations.
Our dialogue must be extended to cover reform of the United Nations and the role of international law, but the United States must accept that nothing durable can be established without institutions and rules.
My group also welcomes Belgium's proposal for a ministerial meeting on North Korea.
If the situation in Iraq had been discussed at the Seville Summit - as Mr Verhofstadt proposed - we might not be at sixes and sevens today.
We must wait and see whether 2003 is an annus mirabilis or an annus horribilis for the European Union, but since we are now in the Year of the Goat, I would congratulate the Greek Presidency on its tenacity, persistence and determination in pushing through its agenda.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Simitis, the President-in-Office of the Council, quoted the statement from the summit to the effect that Iraq's territorial integrity must be maintained.
I do believe though - and hence my dissatisfaction - that you ought also to have mentioned that this territorial integrity is at this very moment under the most massive attack and that our most important task is to end this war.
It is my belief that we can see, from day to day, how it is becoming more evident that this war is becoming ever more inhuman and more contrary to international law.
For Mr Rumsfeld, the American Secretary for Defence, to describe it - as he did yesterday - as a humanitarian act, is something I can regard only as cynicism of a fairly barbarous kind.
I believe that when the USA started the war a week ago, it mounted an assault on the most important principle of law for civilised nations, that being the obligation to resolve conflicts by peaceful means.
This is a tragedy, particularly because this was not merely an instance of obligations and international law being violated, but also because it wrecked a great and outstanding opportunity for effective peacemaking.
I believe that any common foreign policy on the part of the European Union - something that has again been referred to today - must be not merely common, but also an alternative, countering the USA's unilateralism, military power politics, and disregard for law and treaties with a strengthened United Nations, with the defence of the UN Charter, of international law and of the international ban on the use of force.
Any such policy must deal with conflicts - not only the specific conflicts themselves, but also their causes - and promote cooperation across the board.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like right now - and without repeating too much - to draw your attention to three primary problems.
For a start, my group continues to insist that this war be brought to an immediate end.
Even though the numbers of the civilians and soldiers wounded or killed by bombs and other military measures are bad enough, neither the statements by the Council, nor the statements to the press, nor the statistics make any reference to the thousands of Iraqi children who are dying even now as a consequence of this war.
Secondly, there is no doubt that this war puts the USA in breach of international law.
It is even now openly threatening to break international law again.
Last week, and quite openly, Mr Rumsfeld, the Secretary for Defence, ordered that the armed forces in the Gulf region be equipped with CS gas.
You are well aware, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that there is no exception to the ban on the use in armed conflict even of non-lethal gases such as CS gas, contained both in the Geneva Protocol and in Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
I call upon you to object to the US administration's disregard and violation of such crucial international treaties, and to do so in unmistakeable terms.
Thirdly, in Iraq there are tens of thousands of Iranians opposed to the regime in their own country, as well as Kurdish refugees from Turkey.
Lingering in refugee camps, their fate attracts no international attention.
They are very much at risk from this war and the threat of massacre hangs over them.
I beg you to ensure that their plight becomes public knowledge, and to tell your Iranian, Turkish, American and British partners that the European Union will keep a close eye on what becomes of these people.
Above all, Mr Simitis, have the courage to demand that the USA put an end to this war!
Mr President, I recently attended a debate at a school in Germany. To my surprise, I was faced with a banner reminiscent of demonstrations my contemporaries and I were involved in, back in the mists of time.
Emblazoned on this banner was a text to the effect that making war to preserve peace is like making love to preserve your virginity.
I have not quoted the exact English version so as to preserve some elegance.
I am sure none of you will have difficulty understanding it.
Mr President, you are quite right when you say this war is an intellectual challenge. I would add that it is also a physical one.
Plainly, we are allowing our divisions to stunt our intellectual faculties. It is also plain that a number of Council declarations have a surreal quality.
So too have statements made by Members of this House. Plainly too, we are all in favour of humanitarian aid.
That is the one point on which there is general consensus, and on this I agree with Mr Watson. That much is clear.
The issue we are confronted with today is quite straightforward, however. Will Parliament make a clear statement on this war or will it not?
Will Parliament be tarred with the same brush as the Council of Ministers or the General Affairs Council or will we achieve a majority tomorrow?
I appeal to those who do not want a majority at any price.
I urge them to stop and think.
The choice is between two clearly defined positions. One is the stance taken by the coalition of those in favour of the war because they believe it is important and necessary, as has just been stated.
They can go ahead and vote for a resolution that might read as follows. Carry on the good work Mr Rumsfeld, or any other like-minded person.
Right is on your side. Off you go, in the name of God, liberate the planet and show how to make love without losing one's virginity.
They have every right to do so.
The second position involves obtaining a majority in this House to reject war as an option. Such a majority was achieved at the end of January when the war was declared illegal.
(Applause)
Accommodation will be called for in order to obtain a majority against the war.
If we are unable to make compromises we shall show ourselves to be as intellectually stunted as the Brussels Council.
That is the problem confronting us today.
It is actually quite easy to solve.
Some state that the war was not sanctioned by the United Nations. Others state it is neither legal nor legitimate.
I maintain it all comes to the same thing, and that only honourable Members skilled in hair-splitting could come up with differences in meaning between these various phrases.
Obviously, having established that the war does not have the backing of the United Nations, it can be said to lack legitimacy.
Consequently if this motion is passed, we will have notched up a victory. That much is plain.
Turning to the text of the resolution, a heated debate is in progress over the form of words. It concerns whether to express deep regret or condemnation of the fact that the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Italy, Poland and several other states I cannot recall should have unilaterally decided war was justified and gone ahead.
In my view, what needs to be made plain in this resolution is that inspections should have been continued and that we are opposed to those who put an end to them and resorted to war.
I do not therefore believe it is a matter of vocabulary.
I should like to make one further point quite clear before I conclude. Some Heads of Government are intent on keeping certain lies alive.
The reason why the Security Council did not vote for the resolution tabled by the United States, United Kingdom and Spain was not a French or Russian veto. The reason was that there was no moral majority in the Security Council in favour of going to war.
That is the plain truth!
(Applause)
On this basis Chile and Mexico had the courage to table a resolution which rightly retained inspections as the way forward. It should be borne in mind that both these countries are economically dependent on the United States.
The House must therefore understand that when it votes tomorrow, it will also be sending out a message on that carefully nurtured lie perpetuated by the UK and Spanish Foreign Ministers and several others.
The moral majority that emerged on the Security Council in favour of intervention in Kosovo was 13 to 2. No such majority emerged in favour of intervention in Iraq.
That is a historical fact.
The rest is simply a brazen lie kept alive by Heads of Government afraid of their own people.
One must call a spade a spade.
Finally, I have to say how much I hope the House will have the good sense to vote tomorrow in such a way as to make it plain that the advocates of war have been overcome and relegated to the minority.
If we win, we will have won a greater battle than a mere battle of words. Each group will then be able to resort to its ideology to defend the common view.
If we are prepared to make compromises I am confident we can win this moral victory over the advocates of war tomorrow.
(Applause)
Mr President, we cannot deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light.
Consensus building - which is at the centre of policies being pursued by the Greek Presidency - could not become a reality because of the polarised viewpoints on the war in Iraq taken by different countries in Europe.
The Greek Government tried valiantly to secure a common political position on Iraq and Europe, but notwithstanding its tenacious and determined efforts, this objective could not be secured.
The Greek Government must be commended for the measured approach it has taken during this very turbulent time for the European Union.
In very simple and blunt terms, we are here today to try and pick up the pieces after what has been a bruising experience for all Member States within the European Union.
We must remember that the European Union has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild itself in the face of adversity.
This is the core of the challenges we now face.
The European Union has brought political stability to the people of Europe for over 50 years.
We must not, and cannot, lose sight of this fact, but we must look at the bigger picture.
The European Union as a political and economic entity has brought prosperity and a sense of political purpose to the people of Europe.
We have an internal market, we have a single European currency and the European Union is shortly to increase in size to 25 Member States.
These are all real political achievements which are contributing to the standard of living and the quality of life for many people in Europe.
We can all be proud of these achievements because we all played a key role in making them a reality.
The events of the last few weeks have rocked the European Union to its foundation.
We must now ensure that we pick ourselves up from this position and play a central role in providing all the necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq over the coming months.
I welcome the conclusions of the Brussels summit and the commitment of the European Union to rebuild bridges with America and to support the transatlantic relationship.
America and Europe can achieve so much across a range of measures when they work together, as opposed to working against the interests of one another.
We must try to rebuild this relationship as a matter of urgency.
The European Union must carry out its moral political duties in ensuring that the humanitarian problems of Iraq are addressed with vigour and determination.
We must continue to work with the United Nations, whose authority has also been very badly shaken in recent times.
Like many others here today, I greatly wish for a speedy end to the war in Iraq.
The atmosphere here today is muted, but that must not disguise the fact that the European Union does have a lead role to play in ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people will be fully addressed.
This is our duty, a duty which, last week, the EU leaders recognised must be faced up to.
I believe the European Parliament must take a similar political position here today.
I should like to say to the Presidents that there is a degree of masochism in linking a series of debates at European summits in this way. Indeed, as the Greek Presidency indicated, these summits represent the high point of hypocrisy.
The peak of absurdity in this chronicle of a break up foretold, is that for once, Europe did say the same thing, even if it did not speak with a single voice. I refer to the Europe of the institutions.
All the institutions came out in favour of the same approach.
The European Parliament declared itself on 31 January, the European Council on 17 February, followed by the Commission through the words of Mr Patten and your own words, Mr Prodi. They all declared themselves in favour of the approach put forward by France, Germany and Belgium.
It involved giving precedence to the law enshrined in the United Nations Security Council.
For once too, the Europe of the institutions was at one with the people of Europe.
The people of Europe also gave overwhelming indeed unanimous support to this same approach. We may actually be witnessing the birth of a new form of European political public opinion transcending national boundaries.
Europe certainly did speak with a single voice. Even better, Europe spoke with the same voice.
So what?
Mr Prodi, vacuous statements are being attributed to Mussolini.
He might well have said that when it came down to it, governing Italy was not as difficult.
The difficulty lay in that it served no purpose. In the light of current developments, it seems to me that Europe is in danger of becoming an Italy raised to the power of 15 and later of 25.
The difficulty is not quite as Mr Simitis described it. It is far more complex.
This is not some kind of agricultural marathon, where one has to adjudicate between carrots and turnips.
Mr Simitis, your comments were unworthy of your position.
For the first time since the Treaty of Rome, Europe finds itself divided on objectives rather than on methods, means or timetables. One half of Europe has become the adversary of the other.
That is the crux of the issue. We are up against two opposing concepts of law, two opposing visions of the world, two opposing cosmogonies.
That last word comes from Greek, Mr Simitis. In this very House, you have seen banners emblazoned with Stop the killers, and others with Give a chance to war.
Do you really believe this is like dealing with carrots and turnips when no decision has yet been taken on the film's ending?
Mr Simitis, eurospeak is no different from other meaningless political speak.
Mr Prodi, you referred to a European defence system.
There has been much talk of one.
Why not?
Europe's last chance could indeed be to create a genuinely European defence system.
I have to tell you here and now, however, that this debate will take place in other fora, including the level of the Convention.
The European defence system will not be created within NATO any more than the single currency was created in Fort Knox.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, after his brilliant, impressive digression, a theological thesis raising the issue at the heart of the discussions of the Byzantine theologians on the sex of angels - how to make love while still remaining a virgin - Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit moved on to his other pet subject, his desire for a moral majority to be achieved in this House tomorrow.
Why not say ethical, Dany?
Tomorrow, our task will be not to seek a humble, secular political majority on specific objectives, but rather to build a moral majority in this House.
Go and get yourselves killed with your ethics, with your morals, with your quests for absolutes, with your digressions!
Our secular - or Christian if you prefer - task is to find for us all, tomorrow, as we are doing in Italy by identifying one or two feasible political objectives for the future, a path which will make it possible, instead of staying in your 1938 Munich world, Dany, to go to a world where, at the weekend, we will all fight together for free Italians, free Germans or free Iraqis, instead of sacrificing everything to the moloch of peace, to the moloch of an absolute whose boundaries you are totally unable to define.
Of course we want peace, but not the 'rest in peace' kind!
And death does not start with American or Israeli missiles or guns; death starts with all the victims of Pol Pot, with all those whom you do not even remember, with the peoples of the Volga and Don rivers deported 80 years ago, with the 500 thousand killed and massacred by Saddam in the last 10 years.
All your moralising, all your absolutes!
I accept, I am pleased that some Communists are turning and are changing from Communists to Liberals, but I do not accept that they should expect to continue to condemn me, as they did as Communists, accusing me of not being liberal enough or non-violent enough. Me!
I would propose an amendment to your motion, Mr President, an amendment which, at this time in Italy - and I would also point this out to the President-in-Office of the Council so that he considers it - has obtained an absolute majority of Italian MPs: a simple proposal, that is, to make the goal of a free Iraq the subject of negotiations, even with Saddam, negotiations possible here and now, as President Mubarak, Tony Blair and others, secularly and with humility and courage, say they want.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, when we debated the Iraqi crisis in Strasbourg a fortnight ago, there was still an albeit faint hope that it would in the end prove possible to avoid violence and to exhaust every means for a peaceful settlement of the problems, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially Resolution 1441.
Unfortunately, this hope was dashed by the so-called new strategic dogma, and global public opinion is witnessing a military conflict which, over and above its uniformed and civilian casualties, to all of whom we pay our respects, has inflicted collateral damage on basic institutions and parameters of international life such as the UN, the guardian of the fundamental prerogatives of the international system of law, transatlantic relations, which are indispensable to international equilibrium and, finally, the cohesion of the European Union, at least in the foreign policy sector, which is vital if it is to have a decisive presence on the international stage.
All these institutional factors have been seriously damaged and are being severely tested, in such a way that their future, or at least their ability to play their particular role in international events efficiently, still hangs in the balance; they have to face up to a great many unpleasant truths both now and in the long term, the most important of which, of course, is the fact that the authority and the very essence of the UN have been undermined and those who favour unilateralism and high-handedness over logic and legality when acting to resolve what are doubtless very real problems have left its principles and rules in tatters.
It is no use confining ourselves to a diagnosis of the current tragic situation and a prognosis of its inauspicious prospects, however.
On the contrary, we need to turn our attention to the future and support the overwhelming majority of nations and governments by trying, even before the war ends - which we all hope will be sooner rather than later - to restore the prestige of the United Nations, which will undertake to restore normal conditions in Iraq, strengthen the transatlantic relationship within a framework of cooperation and on an absolutely equal footing and consolidate European unity, so that the sad events we have witnessed over the last few days never act as a future precedent and are consigned to history as an example to be avoided.
I should like to suggest to the Presidents that the traffic jams in Brussels were the only visible result of the summit.
It was clear beforehand that the summit would be divided on Iraq and stalemate would ensue. We were resigned to the Union being confirmed in its role as a political dwarf.
To have the so-called economic giant settle for the lowest common denominator in its economic, social and environmental conclusions is, however, cause for despair.
The world is threatened by a serious recession that will probably last longer than previously anticipated due to the war in Iraq. Yet we are treated to empty words.
The Presidency is not to blame. Nonetheless, it has seen fit to present us with 37 pages of conclusions, containing 12 640 words.
I would remind you that Moses managed to write the Ten Commandments in a mere 180 words.
The summit must have had one sane moment though. Paragraph 9 of the conclusions reads as follows.
'Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do.
It is time (...) for the Union and the Member States to fulfil their commitments regarding (...) by translating words into action.'
With regard to action, the European Council invited the Commission to consider several problems.
Between now and the 2004 spring summit the people of Europe can expect at least 17 new action plans, road maps and other reports.
Jumbled up in this Community rag bag are a new employment task force, the stated wish for more concise guidelines on economic policy and for recommendations on economic reforms with strict timetables if appropriate.
The Commission was invited to produce a report on tightening up the use of structural indicators.
There is to be a plan of action on entrepreneurship and another on simplifying and improving the regulatory framework.
Instead of a framework directive on public services, agreed on first at Nice and again at Barcelona, we are to have a Green Paper on the subject.
The must-have list even includes a study on the means the European Union could deploy to assist the people of Iraq to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity.
Further to the Van Miert report on missing links in trans-European networks following enlargement, the so-called Competitiveness Council was invited to specify the guidelines required in terms of connectivity.
No connectivity means fewer exchanges and less growth.
Nonetheless, the Council failed to take any decisions to remedy the obvious shortcomings of the infrastructure of an enlarged Europe.
In these times of severe budgetary restrictions, the states are happy to deceive themselves that the top of a molehill is a lofty summit with a view far into the distance.
As long as the Union is forced to manage on 1% of the Community GDP, it will be reduced to making empty gestures.
Mr Poettering is concerned for the euro.
I have to say that our single currency is holding up pretty well against the dollar and other international currencies, despite the French and German deficits.
If monetary stability really has to be preserved for the public good, then exceptional situations call for courageous measures.
The cost of the war and the subsequent cost of the peace will be a heavy burden for the economy of the world.
A policy to revive the economy is vital if Europe is to avoid deep recession.
Mr President, I wonder why the Commission is delaying application of the flexibility provided by the Amsterdam Council's resolution for times of recession. I wonder too what it is waiting for to encourage investment pursuant to Rule 11 of the Council Regulations dated that very 7 July 1997.
I trust it will not wait for an official statement that our economies are in difficulty before taking action.
You shall have to do a report to answer that question, Mr Goebbels.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to endorse the statements made by Mr Watson, the leader of my group. I join with him in condemning the conflict in Iraq and calling for agreements within the framework of the United Nations, of course.
I also join with him in wishing to commit the European Union to regaining its unity. The Union must then contribute to rebuilding the affected areas so a process of peace and stability can actually be consolidated and guaranteed.
The European Union was unable to demonstrate the unity required.
Sadly, it was therefore unable to exert its influence as we had hoped.
I trust that at least we shall now be capable of first regaining our unity and then of leading the peace.
I should also like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results of the Brussels Council held last week.
The Council was devoted in particular to consideration of the so-called Lisbon process.
During debates and discussion at Strasbourg it had already emerged that we have little to congratulate ourselves on in this regard. In terms of productivity and competitiveness, the gap between Europe and the United States has not narrowed.
On the contrary, it is now actually widening.
As we understand it, the reason is that the appropriate structural reforms were not carried out. Also, the discipline promised concerning key aspects such as the promotion of research and development activities failed to materialise.
New enterprises capable of taking on board innovation and new technological processes were not encouraged either. Obviously, all this has hampered the development hoped for.
I believe the secret of effective implementation of the Lisbon process commitments lies in the area of structural reform. It is equally important to promote research and development activities and the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises, in conjunction with proposals for social improvements.
Mr President, at this Spring Summit the Council needed to show itself capable of reversing its neoliberal political guidelines and to adopt a policy that gives priority to employment, public investment, inclusion and economic and social cohesion, in order to address the economic slowdown, unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, which remain at high levels in the European Union.
Unfortunately, it did not do so.
Instead of halting the process of liberalising essential public sectors and services, it has followed the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe (UNICE) and insists on accelerating economic reforms based mainly on speeding up the process of liberalisation in sectors and services, on the competitiveness of undertakings, on stepping up the coordination of budgetary policies and on the strategy of the Single Market, continually relegating the social sphere to second place, subordinating the objectives of the labour market, education and society to the entrepreneurial spirit, and insisting on the rapid inclusion of pensions in the financial services action plan, opening the way to their privatisation.
In this way, it waters down principles laid down in the Treaty and impedes their implementation, specifically in the fields of economic and social cohesion, solidarity, environmental protection, public health and food safety, public services and social rights, sustainable development and the quality of life, which is unacceptable.
Instead of suspending the Stability Pact in order to review the irrational criteria for nominal convergence and committing to a policy of economic development that is capable of addressing international uncertainty and instability, which has been made worse by the unjust, illegitimate and illegal war against Iraq, the Council is reaffirming the need for these objectives to be met.
It is thereby sweeping under the carpet the serious difficulties facing some Member States and the serious social and economic consequences caused by the obsession with cutting investment and public spending, preventing objectives for creating high-quality jobs from being attained and increasing social tensions and labour instability.
Even when the Council acknowledges the need to present a declaration on services of general interest, it postpones drawing up such a document until the next Competition Council, thereby forcing these services to obey the rules of competition, which is not acceptable because this heightens social inequalities.
Instead of implementing urgent measures, as Parliament called for during the last part-session in Strasbourg, to address the increase in restructuring, relocations and closures by European and multinational companies, which are making thousands of workers redundant and which call into question the regional development of huge areas in crisis where there are few alternatives forms of employment, the Council has opted to attach absolute priority to companies' competitiveness, insisting on structural reforms of the labour market, on worker mobility and on making labour more flexible and precarious in order to adapt to the current economic climate.
Hence the question remains as to the rationale for creating the working group on employment: I would like the Council to explain whether this has been done to allay the concern in the minds of those people who still retain a modicum of sensitivity to the problems of millions of unemployed or whether the intention is simply to shape the implementation of the European employment strategy in order to facilitate the implementation of its increasingly neoliberal guidelines.
Mr President, I should like first of all to recall the forgotten Iraqi victims, especially the young people, who have been the victims of a militaristic government, of an empire that is in decline rather than at its zenith.
George Bush, the president of the United States Government, is himself the clearest indication of the crisis in that country.
This Parliament must not fall in with the logic of war; it must call for the UN General Assembly to convene immediately in order to demand a cease-fire.
As a Galician, and as a citizen of the Spanish State, I wish to speak out against Jose Maria Aznar, a prime minister who is disloyally calling the European Union into question.
He is a prime minister who ridiculously believes himself to be a key player, together with Bush and Blair, in a new Yalta, this time held in the Azores.
His attitude is ridiculous and paranoid.
He is a prime minister who, one hundred years on, wants to turn the Spanish State into a new colony of the United States; into a new Puerto Rico.
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming some of the conclusions of the European Council, but I would also like to caution or criticise others.
The purpose of the Spring Council was clear at the outset: it was to be an economic forum, an opportunity to review the stage we had reached and also to chart out a new way for the future, in particular by looking again at the Lisbon strategy and establishing what alterations had to be made for us to continue to move towards that target.
It should also be an opportunity to focus on continuing the development of economic growth and employment and also guaranteeing quality of life, quality jobs and pension entitlements for all people across the EU.
As we all know, economic uncertainties and global political risks confront us and make alterations difficult.
We in the European Union should recognise that our hands are tied, to a certain extent, to the kind of things that we can achieve.
However, there are opportunities within our system that allow us to build on the positive developments.
Economic and social dimensions are intertwined in reaching the 2010 objectives.
To create and sustain jobs, the European Union must become the most competitive economic area in the world and I am delighted to welcome the Council's decision to establish the Competitiveness Council.
Alongside this, the whole question of education and the kind of skills training that is given to people must be brought into focus.
Areas of literacy, digital developments, vocational training and lifelong learning must be seen as key parts of the package to give the people of Europe the necessary tools to be able to meet with the demands of an ever-changing economic environment.
We must be enterprise-friendly.
We must be more flexibility-friendly, not setting down rigid regulations and rules which drive economic investment out of the European Union, sending it to low-cost labour areas.
We must also ensure that the Commission is held to task with regard to the impact assessment it carries out on proposing legislation and the effect it will have on an industry.
Employment is the one way that we can guarantee overcoming poverty and social disadvantage.
However, not just any kind of employment will achieve that.
It is the quality of jobs and the quality of entitlements that will make it happen.
Social partnership has proven itself as a model with regard to how we can overcome difficulties in the workplace, ensuring proper representation for workers and also guaranteeing that enterprises have the freedom and flexibility to move forward.
There are two other points that I want to make very briefly.
First of all, one of the key elements must be protection of our environment.
We must ensure that when we hand down our countries and our continent to future generations, they are in a better condition than they were in when we inherited them.
The last point I wish to make is one of a personal nature with regard to Iraq.
Whatever we feel about the rights or wrongs of the conflict in Iraq, the most important thing to do now - and I congratulate the Greek Presidency on trying to achieve a consensus on this - is to bring all of Europe together with regard to humanitarian aid, facilitating the rebuilding of Iraq and ensuring that its people have the right tools to make their own decisions.
Mr President, depressing - that is the word that best describes the situation in the European Union last week, with Member States showing a complete lack of mutual respect, and a growing gap between old allies.
The unfortunate proposals that were publicised on the margins of the Council of Europe simply in order to keep tagging along with a small group of sympathisers made the discord even worse.
In these circumstances in particular, it was surprising and positive that the Member States were actually able to issue a joint, forward-looking declaration on Iraq in which the European Union also exhibits a sense of responsibility by promising both humanitarian aid and implicit help in reconstructing the country.
I compliment the Greek Presidency, which was able to sneak that in by concentrating on what was politically achievable.
I call on the Commission to put forward concrete proposals for both kinds of aid as soon as possible.
The declaration on the territorial integrity of Mesopotamia is of particular importance, as this is currently threatened by Turkey's plans to enter Iraq.
What means does the Council plan to use to prevent Turkey from doing this?
I fear that political pressure alone will not be enough.
Is the Council also willing to impose far-reaching political or economic sanctions against Turkey if the Turks actually cross the Iraqi border?
I for my part think these should include postponing or abandoning her accession to Europe.
Finally, the declaration shows great appreciation of the United Nations.
I would, however, like to emphasise that this organisation cannot operate unless all, and I repeat all members (particularly of the Security Council) take responsibility for the actual enforcement of the international rule of law and the continuity of UN resolutions.
Inflexibility and an unwillingness to compromise are really not the sole preserve of the Americans.
In the light of the events of the past few weeks, I therefore find Europe's devotion to the UN painfully hollow.
Mr President, the Brussels Summit dealt with economic growth in Europe quite separately from the implications of the current war in Iraq, as if the one were not inextricably linked to the other. That was almost surreal.
The crucial issue of the war was relegated to the additional points which confirms, if confirmation were needed, that the European Union is not a player in international diplomacy in its own right.
Further to the conclusions devoted to Iraq it seems rather to be cast as a humanitarian NGO.
As for the glorification of the CFSP in conclusion 69, this is clearly what surrealist writers term automatic writing.
The question arises as to whether it really is in Europe's interest to resort to language of this kind to play down the current split. Ever since the question of Iraq arose, our continent has become a virtual battlefield.
The battle is between two visions of Europe's rightful role in the world and also about the very organisation of the international system. Europe is currently at the heart of a fundamental debate with implications for the future of the whole international community.
There is discussion on whether Europe should be independent or aligned, whether there should be unilateralism or agreement between nations. The European Union itself is not participating in the debate, but Europe is certainly involved.
Along with the United States, Europe is one of the main interlocutors in the form of two troikas.
On the one hand there is Paris-Berlin-Moscow, and on the other London-Madrid-Rome.
Each of these troikas has its rationale and support.
For one this is enshrined in the New York memorandum, and for the other in the Declaration of the Azores.
I query whether the only way of dealing with these two views is to deplore them.
To do so is to confirm a monolithic vision of Europe, whereas diversity has always been our distinguishing feature.
We would deserve the derogatory appellation of old Europe if we indicated we no longer wished to be the privileged area where different conceptions of world order wrestle with each other. We would certainly deserve it if we were only intent on evading the impact of confrontation, for the sole benefit of spineless and meaningless consensus.
Robert Kagan might be proved right. No matter if what Europe says has no impact, so long as Europe says it with one voice.
Is that really our aim?
Should it be necessary to stifle all differences of opinion to be a true European?
Could not the spirit of free competition be applied also to foreign policy?
I would say to the Presidents that the European Union would be failing the people of Europe if, in the interests of uniformity, it made Europe distance itself from mayor debates on the future of the world instead of taking its place at the heart of those debates.
Mr President, the Spring Summit was held under very difficult circumstances.
I will not mention the situation in Iraq because my group chairman has already done so and my fellow countryman and colleague Arie Oostlander will be doing so.
I will therefore concentrate on the socio-economic aspect.
It is clear that the uncertainty about the consequences of the war and its duration will have and is having an impact on the world economy.
I think, however, that we must also realise that the growth in unemployment in Europe naturally started long before that.
One of the reasons for this is, of course, the lack of structural reforms in the European economy and the fact that necessary measures have been postponed for too long.
In this regard I was nevertheless enormously shocked when I saw the scoreboard which the European Commission - and bravo for doing so - has for the first time added to the documents that contained an evaluation relating to Lisbon.
If you allow that to sink in, you realise that there is an enormous gap between the words and decisions being taken on the one hand and their implementation on the other.
I think that the Spring Summit should have given at least as much priority to restoring confidence in the European economy, in terms of what is agreed at policy level.
I must say that the Spring Summit delivered more than I had anticipated.
So in this spirit, I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency.
What really matters now, however, is its implementation, and that is why my group - and I am pleased to see that this has also been adopted by other groups - has proposed compiling a roadmap in which the European Commission sets out in more detail what steps need to be taken in order to achieve the Lisbon targets by 2010.
I therefore hope that the Commission - and I am also looking at the President, Mr Prodi - will be able to produce such a roadmap by October 2003, so that we can get a more accurate idea of what must happen in the future.
That is all the more necessary on account of our impending enlargement and because the Lisbon targets will, of course, soon have to be achieved in a much bigger European Union, and I think that it would be useful to keep an eye on that.
We acknowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises have a significant role to play in the area of employment.
We now need to actually implement the charter we established for SMEs, for example, but also the action plan for the simplification of regulation.
We have been talking about the need to make it easier for SMEs to access investment capital for so long now.
Why do we not do it, why can we not just get rid of these obstructions?
We have formulated a fine target of 3% of the GNP for research and development, public and private, by 2010, and rightly so, but we need to finalise this too, as some Member States will already be above 4-5% by then and others will still be a long way off.
How are we going to close this gap, and what efforts will have to be made by the various Member States?
We are in favour of the open coordination method, but that is not enough, and the European Parliament and the national parliaments will also have to be involved in this.
If I may be permitted to summarise, I would like to say that we are on the right track, but it would in particular be to the Commission's credit if we could convert our good intentions into roadmaps in order to create concrete handholds that enable us to evaluate where we stand and evaluate our progress together every year and in order to prevent the Member States from hiding behind fine words.
It is now time for deeds.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as the President-in-Office pointed out, the purpose of the spring Councils is to examine and promote the European economy.
The state of war which surrounds us at present and which has been imposed on us not by the Americans, not by the American nation or the American people, but by the Bush administration, with its unilateral and arrogant policy, and by a number of European governments which took it upon themselves to split the European Union, is in danger of distracting us from our set programme.
For our part, keeping our eye firmly on the long-term programme of the European Union is not a formalistic policy, it is a way of maintaining and starting to restore the seriously damaged union of Europe.
When you want unity, you do not start, nor should you start with what divides you; you start with what unites you.
And however much our foreign policy divides us at the moment, our economic policy is equally well able to unite us.
If we are to achieve this truly admirable and ambitious objective, we must make the macro-economy work more efficiently, integrate the financial services market in Europe and strengthen the spirit of enterprise, research, education and the integration of the European networks.
But how can we integrate the European networks when, as the President of the Commission pointed out, we only spend EUR 20 billion a year and it will take twenty years to complete the programme?
All these worthy objectives are included in the Lisbon strategy; however, we have to admit that we are in the third year and, in certain sectors such as education, for example, things are not going quite according to plan.
Those who supported the Lisbon strategy for regenerating the European economy were right about one thing.
Their programme, with the resources which needed to be mobilised, was a programme with a long-term return.
However, we need measures which have an immediate return in the present climate, with the threat of recession hanging over the global economy, so that we can find new impetus which will allow the Lisbon strategy to proceed to its conclusion.
In order for this to happen, we need to shake off the fatal spirit of defeatism besieging us at present and regain the spirit of determination of Lisbon, even if the present, disastrous circumstances for the Union can be summed up in the words of Kipling: 'If you can bear to see your life's work broken and stoop again, build it again with worn-out tools'.
That is precisely where we stand at the moment.
That is where our duty lies.
If we fight for this, the day will dawn when truth will also prevail for us in Europe.
Mr President, of course it would have been better if the weapons inspectors had been given more time, if Saddam Hussein had respected the resolutions and if the UN had given a mandate for the intervention in Iraq.
Now, the war is under way, however, and we must look to the future.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party hopes that the war will be short, that there will be as few civilian casualties as possible, that Turkey will not enter Kurdistan and that we shall soon be able to bring the Iraqi dictator to justice in The Hague.
Those who were carrying placards here in the Chamber, bearing the words 'Stop the killing!' should call to mind how many hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered and driven out of the country by Saddam Hussein.
The post-war period will see some arduous work begin, first of all of course in the form of humanitarian aid.
Following that, Iraq must be reconstructed.
Stable and democratic institutions must be created so that the Iraqi people can at last live in freedom and peace.
The UN must have ultimate responsibility for this work, and the EU must make a generous contribution.
Iraq must not become an American protectorate.
What is more, new life must be breathed into the peace process in the Middle East.
Transatlantic relations, which are in tatters, must be repaired.
The UN needs to be reformed, and we must get a broad discussion under way about what international law really entails and about how it might be able to protect people in future.
Finally, the EU must get its act together and show that it has learned from the dÃ©bÃ¢cle of recent weeks.
We need a common foreign policy.
We can make a host of institutional changes but, as long as there is a lack of political will, the EU will fail to be heard in the arena of foreign policy.
I wonder when it will be our turn, when B52s or lethal cyber war weapons will attack our buildings, or maybe those in France, perhaps with the support of Great Britain and others.
A paradox?
No.
We can expect even this from the fundamentalist culture of Bush's council.
I have seen an Iraqi baby's lacerated head, lacerated by the weapons of those who call themselves liberators.
Those bodies and images are no different from those of the Kurdish baby girl poisoned by Saddam's chemical weapons, the little Palestinian boy slaughtered by the Israeli army, the little Israeli girl killed by a suicide bomber or the bodies of the Twin Towers victims.
With this war, the masks have come off.
The USA is not complying with international law: consider Kyoto, the International Criminal Court, the death penalty, star wars, the use of weapons of mass destruction.
United States militarism is a danger to the international community; a policy of domination and death is a danse macabre between terrorism and this policy.
However, it is also from the United States, from its people, that hope and an alternative are emerging: huge groups are saying 'no' to the war, 'no' to terrorism, 'no' to revenge, as they are all over the world.
What can and should we do?
How can we make the countries waging this war of aggression comply with the agreement ratified in the United Nations after the Second World War?
Europe cannot simply say: we will take care of the reconstruction.
Our efforts should be channelled into stopping an unlawful war.
The present, Mr Simitis, is the past and also the future.
This is why we must prevent Iraqi, British and American citizens dying.
We say that the UN should be the organisation to act: and so let us convene the Security Council and the United Nations Assembly.
Europe must be united, of course, but it must be united in saying 'no' and in ending this war.
Rabiya, a young Iraqi girl, told me with great intensity: 'You are killing our dreams too; you are killing our dream that we can free ourselves from Saddam Hussein's dictatorship'.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, I welcome the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission.
The war against Iraq is completely without justification and must therefore be condemned.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is something on which the Council remains silent.
In the war against Iraq, cluster bombs and landmines are to be used, in contravention of international law.
The Council remains silent about that, Mr President.
The war is being waged against the civilian population, millions of innocent people becoming immediate or secondary victims, the latter as a result of the collapse of food and water supplies.
Anyone who has been in Iraq will know what the situation there is like.
The war is unleashing a humanitarian catastrophe, but the Council has nothing to say about that either, and so, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I call upon you to be silent no longer.
I urge you to support the initiative by Russia and the Arab League for an emergency session of the Security Council, to gather together those Member States of the European Union that have opposed the war, and to set in motion action that will rescue the United Nations from its role of spectator and again give it a part to play in this conflict.
Be silent no longer, Mr President-in-Office of the Council!
Just as we do, you represent the majority of Europe's citizens, and you can be sure of their support.
I urge you to take responsibility and stop this war.
Mr President, the 1815 Congress was criticised for amusing itself while there was a war on.
One could take a cue from history and lay the same charge against the members of the Council. In the shameful summary document issued, the word Iraq first appears only on page 31 of the 36 pages of the Presidency conclusions.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your distressing verbal statement proved the Union's failure and powerlessness. The war is happening.
It is an event of major significance. With Great Britain at their head, the Union's members are directly responsible for it.
