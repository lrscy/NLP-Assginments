However, I am confident we can achieve a lot in the coming year.
In the area of financial services, the Commission commends the good work done in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs over the last years, and, more particularly, the report we are discussing today.
There is a considerable degree of convergence between our own thinking and the thinking in the European Parliament.
Many of the main themes included in the report presented today by Mrs Van den Burg on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will also be reflected in the Commissionâs Green Paper on its future financial services policy.
We address similar priorities.
In a way there is no surprise there, as we have both been very transparent in our approach and preparatory work.
I do not wish to dwell on all the recommendations set out in the report, but let me highlight some which I believe are particularly important.
Firstly, there is a clear need to coordinate transposition by the Member States, strengthen enforcement and increase supervisory convergence.
I broadly endorse the views expressed in the report.
Particularly, I think paragraph 14 gives the right nuance as some form of integrated supervision will only be beneficial if regulation is no longer fragmented.
Convergence will not occur if an integrated supervisor still needs to interpret and apply 25 different sets of regulations.
Therefore, the Commission endorses a step-by-step approach, building on the European regulatory and supervisory committees in the area of financial services.
Secondly, the better regulation agenda is important.
The Commission agrees that future measures must be targeted and evidence based; impact assessments will be thoroughly applied.
Basic pan-European framework rules are needed so that businesses can develop European strategies and consumers can benefit from enhanced integration without artificial barriers.
However, overlapping, contradictory and duplicative requirements create a burden and must therefore be withdrawn.
Thirdly, effective consultation is key.
We all have listened very carefully to all different stakeholders: industry, large and small; regulators; supervisors; investors; workers and consumers.
We have taken their constructive ideas on board and we have listened to each other.
There is broad support for our common approach; a degree of consensus which is so crucial at the start of a new phase.
I personally hope this convergence of thinking, the good contacts established and the open way of policy-making will guarantee a swift launch for our policy programme of âconsolidationâ for the next five years.
Effective delivery of our common programme must be mandate of the European Commission and the European Parliament.
This weekâs adoption of Mrs Van den Burgâs report will therefore be an important step forward.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like very sincerely to thank and congratulate Mrs van den Burg on her report.
I thought we worked well as a committee to reach a reasonable and balanced template for the future of Europeâs financial markets.
The industry and all three European institutions have undergone a stressful five years of legislation in this area, and the most stressful stage, for the industry at least, is probably still to come.
The result is certainly not perfect, and it certainly does not please everyone.
However, in our Group we are all agreed that breathing space is now required to see these 40-plus directives properly implemented by transposition into national legislation, and to build up experience of their operation.
Furthermore, the industry needs time to digest these often substantial changes to its ways of doing business.
This will inevitably take time: it would be foolhardy to rush into further changes until we see how these work out in practice.
After completion of the few remaining Financial Services Action Plan matters, there may be one or two other areas which need legislation â asset management may be one.
Nevertheless, the Commission and this House need to be very careful that any such legislation really is necessary, justified by cost analysis and can be delivered usefully.
Whenever possible, non-legislative improvements would be our preferred route.
The Lamfalussy process has a key role in ensuring that the FSAP legislation works for the benefit of both financial services companies and their customers.
It is vital that transposition be implemented on-schedule and accurately, and we will expect the Commission to keep an eagle eye on this, because we will be keeping our eagle eye on the Commission.
We will not hesitate to use our rights of challenge under the Lamfalussy process if we see the need.
We have made major strides towards an integrated European financial services market.
In time this will be of great benefit to our economic prospects by providing the competitive capital market that Europe needs and which we are striving to achieve.
There are not many other projects that will contribute as much towards achieving the Lisbon goals.
It is now our duty to see that these matters are honed and perfected as they come into operation.
It is now our duty, the duty of the Commission and the duty of the Member States to see that the financial services industry is given our full support in providing the essential ingredients of a successful European economy.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we find ourselves at a gathering which, I believe, we must also examine in the light of our global strategy: the Lisbon Strategy.
In reality, if we want this strategy to succeed, we require financial markets capable of financing the needs of our economies.
That is the challenge we face; that is why, for the past five years, we have been striving to implement this Financial Services Action Plan; and that is why we believe we must go forward.
Many have said it and many continue to say it: we require a break in legislation.
Commissioner, I am aware of your attachment to this undertaking.
Everyone agrees, however, that there are two or three issues that we will obviously need to take further.
Amongst these issues, I note that Mr Purvis has just raised that of asset management.
Allow me to mention two others with which you are well acquainted.
First, the issue of the database and all the difficulties that lie in implementing a genuine database that respects consumersâ rights; that is one of the key elements if we want to see our efforts in this area crowned with success.
After having legislated on investments, there then comes the issue of the post-market situation, which, I imagine, will keep us extremely busy in the coming months.
That said, I should like to make two observations.
The first concerns the rights of this Parliament.
We have accepted the Lamfalussy Process.
Should this Parliament have a call-back right, we will require measures for implementing this right at level 2.
In addition, we will need to monitor movements at level 3 because we are well aware that the situation could go adrift at that level, something we will need to be able to denounce when it occurs, if that proves necessary.
I should like to say a word about the situation of the regulators, as this is a debate that we have not resolved entirely within our Committee.
We are on track, picking up with the Himalaya Report.
I should, however, like to point out to you what we learnt when we officially met the CESR and its officials for the first time, in Paris.
They told us very clearly that if we want a regulation to be implemented on a European scale, it will take more than benchmarking between national authorities, as the effect of this alone will not produce a sufficient level of harmonisation between the powers of different national regulators during the step-by-step process we are in.
That is an element that we must take into consideration.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, the measures contained in the financial services plan have already been implemented, or are well on the way to being so.
So far as one can tell from todayâs standpoint, the financial services plan can be described as a success.
The question now arises of whether it needs to be followed by a successor, a âPost-FSAPâ, in other words.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has considered this issue in an own-initiative report.
It is vitally important that this House should make its opinion known at this early stage.
The European internal market in financial services is still a long way from being complete, lagging well behind the internal market in goods.
What we do know is that it is particularly in the retail markets that much more remains to be done, while the question has been repeatedly raised as to whether the financial services industry might not be entitled to a break from regulation after making such efforts.
It is also raised in the own-initiative report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, although the rapporteur has today answered it firmly in the negative.
The text agreed on by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is largely balanced, and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports it.
I have, though, critical comments to make on two aspects of it.
The first is that although the work of CESR is, in wide-ranging fields, doubtless something to be welcomed, it must comply with clearly-defined ground rules.
There must be better consultation and interaction between CESR and the democratically-elected European Parliament; as its decisions have a considerable impact, the relationship with Parliament, which should be consulted in good time, should be a close one.
Secondly, although the big banks are making the case for deliberate and far-reaching harmonisation, it still needs to be clarified to what extent this applies to all sectors of the financial services industry.
The Commission should give some thought to this.
In this connection, the Liberals and Democrats support the amendment tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which is open to various interpretations.
Overall, we can endorse most of the rapporteurâs amendments, and I extend warm thanks to Mrs van den Burg for the work she has put in.
Â Â  . Madam President, âtransparencyâ is a much-used word in Mrs van den Burgâs report, but there is nothing transparent about the great jumble of committees and processes that she also describes.
First, a committee of wise men was set up on the regulation of European securities markets.
What wisdom did it bestow?
A four-level regulatory approach and the creation of two more committees!
Then the Commission appointed four expert groups to mark the first step in the action plan review process.
That was in October 2003, long before all of the action plan had even been implemented.
If that were not enough, there was input from a monitoring group and four other committees.
Who said âwhen in doubt, hold a committee meetingâ?
Only a report from an EU institution could say with such a straight face that this is a powerful recipe for success, at least in terms of delivering legislation.
The EU is very good at churning out laws: is transparently obvious.
However, I have a warning for ordinary people out there in the real world, like those in our visitorsâ gallery: it is transparent to me that more regulation is coming, thus there will be more laws to break; there will be more interference in pensions and insurance matters; more European-level supervisory bodies that will override national ones; and more back doors through which the EU intends to interfere in national taxation policy.
The report notes the existence of overlapping directives that might lead to contradictory and duplicate requirements.
In the real world, this would be seen as a work of fiction, not a serious proposition.
So, the EU confuses itself, but in the confusion, I should like to repeat one transparent certainty: if the EU is the answer, it must have been a very silly question.
Â Â  AÂ few years ago, American financier George Soros deplored the billion-dollar losses of his companies carrying out financial operations, and urged the governments of the most powerful countries of the world to address the organisation and the introduction of clear rules and order in the world financial markets.
Operations on the world financial markets and, in particular, trade in derivatives recorded a literally explosive growth in recent years.
Their volumes and growth of dynamics exceed many times those of classical financial operations involving real production, services and consumption of products.
Any fluctuation in or, at worst, a collapse of even one part of these markets may have serious consequences for the world economy, not to speak of the fact that every negative development on financial markets has repercussions for personal finances and fates of ordinary citizens.
In this regard, I appreciate the presented material and good work of rapporteur Ieke van den Burg as another contribution to devising a conceptual solution in this field not only within the European Union, but with the ambition of an intercontinental approach.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her constructive and good cooperation.
She has produced a balanced text that takes a look at the European internal financial market â to which, over recent years, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has devoted a great deal of attention â and, while doing a good job of analysing our present situation, also looks towards the future.
To be sure, having had a great deluge of legislation, we must now consolidate; we must ensure not only that it is properly implemented, but also that we learn from our initial experience with it, and that we tackle the next legislative project piece by piece rather than with gusto, as we did before.
We should also â contrary to what certain participants in the European market would like us to do â handle the topic of maximum harmonisation with a great deal of care.
I can imagine those who currently write to us demanding maximum harmonisation in consumer protection matters saying â yet again â that we are taking harmonisation too far with the Consumer Credit Directive; that is why they should be very careful when calling for such a thing.
This House has, for some time, been quite clear about where it stands on CESR; although we are in favour of the Lamfalussy procedure, we want transparency and participation, and there is a very, very great deal of room for more of that in CESR.
Our expectation is that what happened with âClearing and Settlementâ will not be allowed to recur.
I also call on Commissioner McCreevy to apply the same sensitivity to pressing for international standards in a field in which international bodies keep introducing more and more standards for large companies, which are then applied by small and medium-sized enterprises as well.
This is where democratic control is called for, and this is where the Commission and Parliament must join together in developing the institutions for this purpose.
Let me end with a comment on European supervision.
I regard the approach taken by âBasel 2â â that of approaching this with very great care â to be the right one for a draft.
We should take care not to be too hasty in creating a Europe-wide level playing field, thereby ignoring the regional and national level playing fields that we already have.
The one must not wreck the other.
That is why I favour a bottom up approach, so that, while focusing on European regulation and supervision, we build them up slowly, starting from the bottom.
That this should be enforced from the top down is intolerable.
Â Â  â Madam President, the creation of a single market for the financial services sector is a key factor in completing the internal market and in fostering further economic and social development in Europe.
In this context, the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP), adopted in 1999 and strengthened at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, is an indispensable tool.
It is now universally acknowledged that the FSAP has been a success, given that 39 of the 42 legislative measures have been adopted.
It is premature, however, to issue a definitive verdict, because many of these measures have yet to be implemented.
Efforts must now, therefore, be channelled into ensuring that the necessary implementing measures are transposed into national law, and, in particular, that the operation is monitored, transparently and effectively, for a certain amount of time.
Monitoring the FSAP will enable us to gauge the impact of the legislation on the smooth running of European financial markets and on the development of promotional, supervisory and anti-discriminatory measures.
Monitoring of this kind should be an urgent priority for the Commission and the Member States.
Among the various points raised by the rapporteur, in compliance with the proposed guidelines, I should like to highlight, if I may, in view of its major importance, the call for the Member Sates to transpose, quickly and effectively, the directive on Occupational Retirement Provision, so as to increase the opportunities and alternatives for savers and offer them the best possible return on their investments.
The overriding message of this report is that the Member States must adopt âthe principles of better regulationâ, opportunely adopted by the Commission, and that there must be greater convergence of national supervision practices relating to the measures incorporated in the FSAP.
I also wish to highlight the point that any future legislative measures aimed at remedying market failures must include a cost-benefit analysis of implementing them, in comparison with not implementing them.
Mrs Van den Burgâs report addresses the whole question of financial services sensibly, coherently and intelligently and I therefore feel that Parliament should support it.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
While talking about the integration of financial markets, we have to consider several aspects.
Firstly, the recommendations of Parliament concerning improvement of these market activities are important not only for professionals, but also for every citizen of the European Union, and we often forget that.
In one way or another, by obtaining insurance policies or using bank services, we all participate in the financial market.
In addition, to take account of the investments into the market of the pension funds would lead us to understanding that lately the quality of life is increasingly dependent on the activity of the financial market; in case of disorderly performance of at least one institution, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of citizens can suffer losses.
However, effective management of the financial market cannot be achieved by implementing a particular regulation, since I can tell you from the experience in my country that such administration is costly, hard to implement, and, after all, does not protect investors and merely restricts market development.
Secondly, we cannot expect progress within the European single market if the national legislation differs.
We have to provide conditions for the inflow of capital to the European market from different countries of the world, and this capital cannot come because of the national barriers in the European financial market.
Therefore, great attention has to be paid to the national legislation that has an impact on the financial markets; also activities of various working groups have to be encouraged.
Thirdly, current regulation of the financial market lacks completeness and is fragmentary, and I do not approve the suggestion to stop adoption of new legislation regulating the activity of the financial market.
I think it is important to replace fragmentary laws with all-inclusive and well-drafted directives.
Otherwise, local institutions will initiate those legal acts, as it happens in the case of clearing and settlement.
Therefore, we have to create favourable conditions in Europe not only for big players, but also leave some room for the activities of national businesses (small companies) and individual citizens at the national level.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to make a few comments on the resolution before us.
There has been a very great deal of legislative activity in recent years â in my view, almost too much.
I should like to say that the costs to the financial sector of transposing all these new laws is quite high and is growing.
Just introducing the whole of the BaselÂ II Directive is costing the banks a very great deal of money.
I therefore wish to limit legislative ambitions in future and slow down the process to some extent.
For example, I welcome the fact that we did not come up with legislative proposals in the area of clearing and settlement.
Competition should be allowed to operate.
There is no risk of monopoly.
Technical development is taking place so quickly that competition from new players is breaking down the old monopolies.
One area in which I definitely do not want to see new legislation is that of corporate governance or the way in which companies are run.
Allow the market to be self-regulating in this area.
If Germany wants its own rules for corporate governance, it should be allowed to have them.
If Britain wants its own rules, it too must have them.
The financial market will in time decide which system inspires greatest confidence.
It will attract investorsâ interest.
I believe in institutional competition.
There should be no devising of a common code, regulated by some directorate of the European Commission.
Too much legislation will lead to rigidity in the system.
What has once become law becomes almost impossible to change.
There is a great risk of our obtaining a financial market full of legal disputes, proceedings, advisory court judgments and yet more legislative measures to plug the gaps in the legislation.
The terms harmonisation and level playing field have been the gateway to a suffocatingly legalistic system.
Scope should be provided for the mutual recognition of each othersâ systems.
Responsibility for supervising the financial market should not fall mainly to the EU.
Instead, better cooperation between the local, national supervisory bodies is needed.
I do not wish to see a new super-finance inspectorate in the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, past years have seen a relatively large number of middle class people falling for the attractions of financial instruments, the use of which was formerly reserved for a very small elite.
People believed they could increase their own wealth quite quickly, only to wake up filled with utter bitterness.
I have two suggestions to make.
Here is the first.
Is it not possible that the EU institutions might explain to the European public, in very comprehensible terms, precisely what, in the way of such instruments, is currently available, at the same time assessing the risks involved in them?
Secondly, can we not follow the example of the USA, which is now, at least, bringing transparency and a whiff of control into the world of hedge funds?
Europe is in urgent need of it.
Hedge funds are the ones that pull out the lot, the ones whose enormous leverage can achieve some massive dividends, but also massive losses, and which, in fact, over and over again, move the whole of Europeâs economic structure in their direction.
That, I think, is something we should tackle as a matter of priority.
Â Â  Mr President, this report on the Financial Services Action Plan comes at an important time for the integration of financial markets in Europe.
As you have heard, Parliament is unanimous on this issue and the vote in committee was almost unanimous.
The past few years have been marked by much law-making.
There are clear indications that markets now need time to digest what has been decided.
As legislators, we should be extremely sensitive to this concern and focus our efforts on what is essential and beneficial.
For its part, I hope the Commission assumes a twofold strategy.
First, in its capacity as a prime mover of Community legislation, it is vital that the Commission concentrates on non-legislative means to carry out measures in the financial markets wherever possible.
Apart from legislation currently under way, rigid laws should be considered only when absolutely necessary, i.e. after a comprehensive impact analysis shows that the intended objectives cannot be achieved through non-legislative means.
This approach should take due account of evolving market practices and the principle of subsidiarity.
Secondly, in its role as EU executive, the Commission should take a rigorous approach to enforcement.
Thirty-nine out of the 42 FSAP measures have been adopted.
However, many implementing measures have not, and transposition into national law is only beginning.
The Commission should start a benchmarking review of implementation in the Member States with the aim of completing the EU financial architecture as agreed.
The pace of integration in the financial markets has been far better than in many other areas.
Much of this is due to the expediency and flexibility inherent in the Lamfalussy Process.
As we move beyond the FSAP, however, the process itself should take into account the new environment in order to ensure that the appropriate balance of legislative and horizontal measures, structures of transparency, parliamentary control and stakeholder consultation improves further.
For instance, structured dialogue between the EU and the US and other global capital markets could thus be better fed into the process, thereby strengthening both the European financial playing field as well as these relationships.
As for the convergence between supervisory practices, we need to be realistic.
The report before you sets out a useful strategy for creating lead supervisory practices in the EU.
With a longer term perspective, provided that the parliamentary accountability of any new body thus created is guaranteed, we can see the benefits of moving towards a more uniform supervisory regime for financial markets.
One possible option is a 26th European regime for supervision of global actors.
All these options should be left open and used if the Commission thinks it is necessary.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that we believe that both the services directive and the internal market in finance are safe in the Commissionerâs hands, thanks to the good cooperation between the Commission and this House.
Let me say, secondly, that the action plan for financial services in the period up to 2005 is a success; with 39 out of 42 measures already having been adopted, it is a success on the road that leads to the internal financial market, and it is successful as a result of the work Parliament has done.
Necessary although these measures are, there are too many people who regard the great number of new and necessary regulations as excessive.
They are wrong to do so, for the package of measures needs to be implemented in a very short space of time, and the internal market is not yet complete.
So let us consolidate instead of over-regulating, and implement instead of making excessive demands.
When, moreover, we assess the way we implement these regulations, we have to ask ourselves three questions.
What added value has the European Action Plan provided for the European Union?
What problems have become apparent?
What action do we need to take?
The answers to the last question are obvious: as yet, not all the Member States of the European Union have the euro as their common currency; that weakens the internal market.
Fiscal policy is dealt with at the national level and requires unanimity; that weakens the internal market.
Cross-border payment transfers are not yet fully developed.
Basel 2 is not yet in force, and âClearing and Settlementâ is waiting to come in.
Our problem is supervising the national supervisory authorities and getting them to cooperate with us.
Although we are in favour of Lamfalussy, it must not be allowed to result in a loss of democratic control, of democratic legitimacy and of clarity in the reaching of decisions and the formation of opinion.
The time for action to be taken is dependent on when we will have completed implementation and know precisely what steps we next have to take together.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I indicated earlier, this report marks the start of a new era in financial services.
I thank Mrs van den Burg for her very stimulating report and the considerable effort that has gone into producing it.
Based on this report and our consultation with other stakeholders, next week, on 3Â May, I intend to present to the College of Commissioners a Green Paper on financial services policy for the next five years.
I will present this paper to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in more detail on 9Â May.
The Commissionâs Green Paper will be open for public consultation until 1 August.
Our final policy conclusions, deriving from all this work, are planned for the end of this year.
A number of issues were raised and I will try to respond to some of them.
Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Kauppi referred to the âHimalayaâ report.
The Commission thinks integration needs to be accompanied by matching supervisory structures: the more integrated the markets, the more integrated and convergent the supervisory structures must also be.
For the time being, I consider the Lamfalussy structures to be sufficient, but they need to be closely and continuously monitored and adapted, or further developed if needed.
Only after careful assessment might future initiatives be necessary, with strict application of the subsidiarity principle.
A number of speakers, including Mrs van den Burg and Mrs Kauppi, mentioned the so-called 26th regime.
That regime may sound attractive in its simplicity, but in practice it will require some degree of harmonisation across the board, whether legal or in terms of tax, language, etc. The benefits of those 26th regime schemes remain to be proven, and reaching an agreement on optional European standards designed for only certain products will be difficult.
However, I take note of the current debate and will respond to the call to explore such 26th regime schemes further, as explicitly expressed in the van den Burg report.
Both Mrs van den Burg and Mrs BerÃšs mentioned retail markets.
We agree that there are important barriers to integration of retail financial services markets.
The integration of retail markets is complex and demanding.
However, this should not be the conclusion but our starting point.
Product characteristics, distribution systems, consumer protection, contract law, differences in consumption, culture or other economic or structural realities play a prominent role in the retail area and create considerable complexity for cross-border supply and demand.
These barriers, however, have their origin in the fragmentation of the European market for historic reasons.
The Commission does not accept the argument that, as European integration increases, this fragmentation is there to stay.
In ten years from now, the retail market will look completely different to the market of today.
Our role is to anticipate and facilitate this development and not shy away from new initiatives.
Mr Purvis and Mrs BerÃšs raised the question of asset management.
We will look to act only after the issues have been identified and potential solutions found.
Where objectives can be achieved by non-legislative action, we will obviously choose this route.
We might also need to address this question of legislative changes if they present the only way to secure single market freedoms in the area of investment funds.
Mr Radwan raised a number of issues, including one on the standards issued on clearing and settlement.
I must point out that the Commission is not bound in any way by the ESCB CESR standards, and any policy decisions which might be enshrined in a future directive on clearing and settlement will take precedence over the ESCB CESR standards.
Mr Radwan also raised the question of the democratic governance and political accountability of rule-setters.
Last week I was in the United States.
You will note that we are working hard to influence the reform process under way within the International Accounting Standards Board.
We are looking carefully at the arrangements proposed for the International Accounting and Auditing Standards Board, which will elaborate national standards and auditing.
During that recent visit to the United States, we made good progress in some of these areas.
Mr Wohlin raised the question of the new framework for capital requirements.
They offer a range of approaches.
For those banks moving to the simplest approaches, the changes from the existing standards of BaselÂ I are not huge, so the costs of implementation are reasonably small.
Banks moving to more sophisticated approaches will have to spend more, but they will do so only if this is a sensible business decision and the benefits will outweigh the costs.
Members raised other points, which I hope will be taken up in the time ahead.
In conclusion, I refer to what I said earlier: there is a considerable degree of convergence between the thinking in the European Parliament, the Council, industry, consumers and the Commission.
I am convinced the coming five years will be extremely challenging.
As the foundations for good collaboration between the institutions have been laid, I am sure we will be successful.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0065/2005) by Henrik Lax, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC)Â NoÂ 539/2001 as regards the reciprocity mechanism (COM(2004)0437 â C6-0097/2004 â 2004/0141(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur for his report and for his overall support for the Commissionâs proposal.
The origins of this proposal relate to a two-fold observation.
On the one hand, reciprocity is an essential principle when considering visas.
On the other hand, the mechanism laid down in Regulation 539/2001 to ensure respect for reciprocity is unsuitable, essentially on account of its inflexible and automatic nature.
As a result, the mechanism has not been used in more than three years, in fact not since the Regulation entered into force, even though situations of non-reciprocity continued with regard to old Member States and the number of cases of non-reciprocity increased at a remarkable rate with the arrival of the new Member States.
The Commission has therefore proposed a more flexible and more realistic mechanism, which is more credible and effective as a consequence.
Every situation of non-reciprocity will be the subject of notification.
The Commission will play an active role with regard to third countries that enforce visa requirements.
It will draft a report to Council on the situation of non-reciprocity thus created and, if necessary, it will propose the reintroduction of the visa requirement for citizens of the third countries concerned.
The amendments proposed by Mr Lax pursue three different objectives.
The first objective is to extend the mechanism to a set of situations that do not exclusively relate to visa exemptions, but also to the conditions for issuing visas.
This extension stumbles at the obstacle of the Regulationâs legal basis.
Furthermore, in seeking to incorporate a whole series of issues which are in reality of lesser importance, it runs the risk of weakening the reciprocity mechanism, which must remain focused on an essential issue, identified as such by the citizens, namely the continued visa requirement by third countries that are themselves exempt from this requirement by our Member States.
The Hague Programme confirms that therein lies an issue to be resolved as a matter of priority.
The second objective is to prevent situations of non-reciprocity from continuing indefinitely, and to include the possibility of reacting by means of measures in the field of external relations.
I am anxious to point out to the rapporteur that I share the general approach of this amendment and I must also tell you that the political orientation that emerged at the JAI Council of 24Â February takes the same line.
I cannot, however, accept the binding of the Commissionâs power of initiative as far as proposing provisional measures is concerned, nor, for reasons of legal basis, the extending of the Commissionâs right of initiative within the present contexts to proposals for measures relating to areas other than that of visa policy.
Finally comes the third objective: to include the European Parliament in every stage of the process.
The necessary transparency must of course be ensured, but the reciprocity mechanism must remain a flexible instrument which can be accessed quickly, and which â and this is the key point â must allow provisional measures.
The temporary restoration of the visa requirement for third countries is, in actual fact, situated in a plan other than the transfer of a third country to a list of countries subject to the visa requirement, which is annexed to Regulation 539/2001.
A transfer of this type consists of an amendment to the Regulation and as such, it is of course decided by the Council, upon consultation of the European Parliament.
Finally, with a strengthened reciprocity mechanism, the Commission will be equipped to respond to the formal invitation of the European Council of 4-5 November: to continue with our efforts to ensure that, as soon as possible, citizens of every Member State can travel without a visa, for short journeys, to all of the countries whose citizens undertake visa-free travel within the Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
As we have just heard, enlargement of the European Union has highlighted the issue of the EUâs visa policy in a new way.
Citizens of quite a few of the new Member States require visas to travel to the United States, in spite of the fact that American citizens do not need visas to travel to the new Member States.
In these cases, there is a breach of reciprocity between the countries.
It is easy to understand why people assume that the EU should make vigorous efforts to promote freedom of movement, especially since visa policy is harmonised and falls completely within the Commissionâs area of competence.
The Commission should therefore act as an ice-breaker.
A few months ago, Polandâs former President, Lech Walesa, spent the night in a tent outside the White House in Washington in protest against the American visa requirement â a good example of just how loaded the issue is.
The EU has a weapon for cases such as this, namely the reciprocity mechanism.
For example, Poland and Greece can issue a notification to the Commission to the effect that, in their cases, reciprocity is not being respected by the United States.
Finland can do the same in connection with Venezuela, etc. A notification should lead to the whole of the EU introducing a visa requirement for citizens of the third country concerned, but the mechanism has not been used even once because the consequences have been regarded as too far-reaching and difficult to deal with.
My report, which has been approved by the committee responsible, proposes that the Commission should have a wider range of tools at its disposal.
The EU should have recourse to other sanctions and not just automatically introduce a visa requirement.
The report gives the individual Member States three months â a longer period than that proposed by the Commission â in which to negotiate with the third country.
Moreover, I propose more stringency once the Commission has taken over the matter.
It must not be possible to delay decisions concerning sanctions.
Citizens of the Member State concerned must have a guarantee that their cases will be referred to the highest level and that this will result in a decision.
A very broad majority of the committee was in favour of this policy.
A number of MEPs preferred the present mechanism, however, and considered that it would make for a better result.
I myself believe that the reportâs recommendations will lead to greater efficiency and better results, strengthen the Commissionâs negotiating position in respect of third countries and, through the European Parliamentâs involvement, give people more insight into the process.
The report also has a new element, and one that I believe the Commission and the Council should ponder carefully.
There are countless cases, mainly at the EUâs eastern border, in which a third country has, with very little warning, tightened up the conditions for issuing visas.
There are examples of travellers being required to have travel insurances with only Russian insurance companies.
Lithuanian motorists have been required to have special motor insurances in order to be able to drive over to Kaliningrad, and they have had to register with the local authorities within three days.
In the same week that a shipping company was to begin operating ferries to Saint Petersburg, the visa rules were altered, with the result that the shipping company had to withdraw the service.
Our students at Russian universities are not automatically given a visa for a year, and anyone who has his or her visa stolen ends up on an exorbitantly expensive bureaucratic merry-go-round.
To give just one example: even small children have to present the results of an HIV test in order to obtain a Russian long-term visa.
From a Brussels perspective, these issues may appear trivial, but they cause a lot of inconvenience and financial losses for those affected.
A very large majority of the committee believed that the Member States should be able to refer such cases to the Commission if the requirements introduced led to substantial limitations upon peopleâs opportunities to travel.
In actual fact, these cases almost always involve a lack of reciprocity.
Because the EU has to operate in the interests of our citizens, it is, as Commissioner Frattini asserts, extremely important that these problems be taken seriously, even though they may appear less serious than the main issue of whether or not there is a visa requirement.
When Parliament â presumably with a clear majority â now approves the report, this will be a clear signal to the Commission and the Council of Ministers to begin outlining a mechanism that takes account of peopleâs everyday needs when there are visa requirements.
My report contains a proposal that may serve as a point of departure.
If this matter had been brought to our attention at the beginning of the year, the codecision procedure would have applied.
In spite of the fact that the consultation procedure is now being applied, the Council and the Commission have cause to ponder the significance of the fact that account is being taken of Parliamentâs amendment.
What is also important is that the Commission quickly initiate a review of the consular instructions so that the common visa rules are applied in the same way in all the Member States.
The furore surrounding Germanyâs Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, emphasises the need for this.
In saying that, I still wish to thank all those who have helped with the work, including my fellow MEPs and the Commissionâs and Parliamentâs officials.
I am looking forward to the debate that is now to follow.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the reciprocity mechanism that has applied to date under the European Unionâs visa policy meant that extremely harsh sanctions could be imposed on third countries if a country reported that the mandatory use of visas was placing them at a disadvantage.
On 7Â JulyÂ 2004, after the ten new Member States had joined the EU, the Commission relaxed the rules contained in this regulation in such a way as to do away with the reciprocity mechanism that had featured in the draft regulation.
This resulted in an absurd situation whereby 9 of the 10Â new Member States were forced to accept citizens of third countries, for example the USA, without visas, whilst citizens of the Member States in question needed visas to travel to these third countries.
I believe that MrÂ Lax has drafted what is, on the whole, an excellent report, but although this report introduces a number of additional procedures and deadlines that can be enforced by diplomatic means, it does not oblige the Council or the Commission to impose more stringent sanctions.
The report leaves it up to the Commission to decide whether to introduce mandatory visas for the citizens of a third country or to impose other, much less effective, measures.
In my opinion, allowing the Commission to decide in this way shows a lack of resolve, and would mean inadequate protection for the citizens of the new Member States.
Such an approach would send out a clear signal that mutual solidarity between EU Member States and towards third countries has been thin on the ground since the accession of the new Member States.
Since the latter joined the EU, dual standards have been applied, with one mechanism for the 15Â old Member States and another, in which solidarity is rather less apparent, for the EU of 25.
The end result of this is that the difference in status between the citizens of the new and the old EU has become even more pronounced, as citizens of the new Member States are subject to additional restrictions when travelling outside the EU.
In view of all this, I find it astonishing that people can talk of a new concept of European citizenship, when some of the EUâs citizens will enjoy entirely different rights and duties to the rest, who are regarded as less worthy.
Seen from the new Member Statesâ point of view, the costs of enlargement have outweighed the benefits by far.
We were obliged to bring our legislation into line with the EUâs visa policy, which proved extremely expensive, and to introduce visas for our eastern neighbours.
The benefits we have derived, however, have been few and far between.
We are still unable to issue Schengen visas, and we cannot count on the EUâs help as far as visa reciprocity is concerned.
Furthermore, the EU Member States demanding that we implement the common visa policy are the very ones that are experiencing problems with the implementation of this policy, for example Germany.
Commissioner Frattini, I should like to make it known that if the amended mechanism comes into force, we will insist on the Commission discharging the duties incumbent upon it.
I should also like to receive a clear answer to the question of whether we can expect the Commission to present an action plan setting out clearly defined deadlines for the achievement of objectives relating to the abolition of visas for travel into the USA, and using the Schengen assessments of the new Member States as a frame of reference.
This would be in the vital interests of all the citizens of the new Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first wanted to thank, in particular, Mr Lax for our excellent collaborative effort.
Parliament is about to establish its position on a crucial issue: the reciprocity mechanism on visas.
Behind the dryness of technical terms lies, in fact, a very vital reality: that of giving substance to, and advancing, in a tangible and positive way, cooperation between Member States, in the face of the complex relations of an enlarged Union with third countries on the subject of visas.
We are dealing here with something that lies at the heart of what constitutes the richness of Europe, namely respect for the law in all its forms in rediscovered peace and harmony.
We are attempting to build a harmonious space between Europe and the rest of the world, where borders are not walls rising up between one party and another, dividing people and nations.
We must ensure that Europe is a recognised space, where it is possible to come and go without interference, on good terms with third countries near or far.
It is also an act of confidence towards our 420 million citizens.
It has, furthermore, become necessary, in moving in this direction, to completely review a method that favours a too inflexible approach.
Ladies and gentlemen, the report that I call upon you to approve takes a fresh look at the amendments required for inclusion in the Regulation in force since 2001.
In this context, I express my full interest in the principle of pushing aside the systematisation of sanctions currently implemented in the event of a lapse from one side or the other, between the European Union and the third countries in question.
These reprisals often arise, either from a technical, or even an administrative, issue, or from inappropriate political decisions, which diplomatic efforts must crucially seek to resolve in the first instance.
In its current state, reciprocity of sanctions is neither desirable nor appropriate as a response to often complex issues occurring on a day-to-day basis.
In the last resort, in fact, it is our citizens who pay a high price for it by not being allowed to travel freely, not to mention the very costly inconvenience that that causes.
That is why, in accordance with a sensibly drafted plan, a forum for discussion corner needs to be created, where Parliament has its full place.
Our legitimacy as elected representatives of the citizens is also at the heart of this report that, in the course of the work in committee, has attracted a very large consensus on the new method for consideration.
In particular, we must succeed in guaranteeing all European citizens free, unimpeded movement outside the borders of the Union.
Parliament must, as a consequence, be closely involved in this process, as it is clearly the legitimate guarantor of transparency in assuming the rightful democratic responsibility it has been accorded by its electorate.
This in no way reduces the prerogatives of the Commission, whose role emerges very noticeably strengthened so that it may appear a credible negotiator to the third countries concerned.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is why I call upon you to vote in favour of this text tomorrow. It represents a successful combination of the roles of the European legislative and executive powers, which are united in the service of the citizens and the project we hold dear: that of building a solid European Union upon the values of freedom, security and justice.
Â Â  . Mr President, the reciprocity mechanism was introduced four years ago, but not even once has it since been applied.
This alone prompts us to consider renewing and amending it.
On the one hand, the system was too rigid; on the other hand, it has not been used, because it has not substantively violated any Member Stateâs interest.
However, things have considerably changed with the enlargement.
The reciprocity mechanism is not applied in the case of nineteen countries.
My colleagues have mentioned the United States, but there are other countries as well, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among others, where reciprocity is not applied.
Discrimination between EU citizens is simply unacceptable.
The basis for this mechanism â as well as the whole of the EU â is solidarity, but this solidarity has not worked so far.
We hope that adopting the new regulation will contribute to a more efficient application of solidarity.
If you talk to citizens of the new Member States, and I do not mean politicians, as they are not really the ones affected by this problem, but ordinary citizens, you will learn what an administrative and financial burden it is and how much time and energy is wasted in the process of obtaining a US visa â and that is if the applicant is lucky.
There are thousands of cases when people are turned down without any substantive reason, their cases are simply rejected.
It is high time the Commission acted firmly in the name of the Community on the basis of solidarity between the Member States and I hope that Mr Frattini will seize this opportunity and take appropriate measures.
This report serves as a timely basis for it.
I would like to congratulate Mr Lax on his excellent report and I would like to highlight three of its essential proposals that must be adopted.
It proposes an increase in the notification period from 10 to 90 days to allow for direct negotiations between the individual Member States, but after 90 days, the reciprocity mechanism must come into effect.
It is also important that it draws Parliament into this process not only because it emphasises the authority and importance of Parliament, but it also improves democratic transparency.
Another important point is that it not only talks about visa obligations, but also of any kind of procedure that becomes an obstacle to free movement.
We hope that with the adoption of the new mechanism and its amendments, the Commission will use its full authority in cases where the fundamental interests of the Member States are violated and today, the basic interests of the nine new Member States are violated, and we hope that the Commission will complete successful negotiations with regard to this new resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of reciprocity as a fundamental principle of visa policy and we feel that a common European policy on visas should always be founded on the principle of solidarity.
What is needed is a mechanism designed to ensure that European citizens do not have to obtain a visa in order to enter those third countries whose nationals do not require a visa to enter EU territory.
A number of third countries, however, require visas from EU citizens, and this runs counter to the principle of reciprocity.
The existing mechanism has not been invoked since it was set up in 2001 and Mr Frattini has rightly acknowledged that it suffers from being too rigid and unworkable.
Apart from the fact that the mechanism can only be invoked if requested by a victim Member State, the almost automatic nature of reinstating the visa requirement has had a discouraging effect; externally, because of the high risk of causing a crisis in relations with third countries, and, internally, because of the lack of solidarity if the Council blocks the process.
Victim Member States, such as my country, Portugal, have always held back from using it.
The situation has deteriorated since the enlargement.
It has already been mentioned that, for example, the United States requires a visa of nine of the ten new Member States and Canada seven.
Consequently, we agree that there needs to be a more flexible mechanism in order to ensure greater interoperability and more effective implementation, thereby enhancing solidarity between the Member States.
The Commission will also have a crucial role based on its competence in the area of visas.
Hence my support for this proposal and for the proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr Lax, whom I congratulate on his excellent work.
Â Â  Â Â Â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking MrÂ Lax for his work, which has made it possible for us to discuss the reciprocity mechanism and to take decisions on the matter.
I should merely like to draw the Houseâs attention to an issue addressed by MrsÂ Kudrycka, and which MrÂ Lax in fact also mentioned a short while ago.
There is a risk that the various Member States and their citizens will not be treated equally, particularly with regard to the granting of visas to enter the United States.
In principle, proposals to award the Commission and the Council powers in this field are an eminently good idea.
At the same time, however, the Member Statesâ competences should also be extended somewhat, as otherwise they are likely to feel hard done by.
I should like to reiterate a point made by a number of other speakers, namely that this is one of the many instances, and indeed perhaps the most important, where we should invoke a founding principle of the European Union.
I refer to the principle of solidarity and equal treatment for all Member States and their citizens.
After all, the latter are all citizens of the European Union, and as such on an equal footing with each other.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the concept of reciprocity is as old as the history of international relations.
It has its roots in the tradition of mutual respect and equal treatment for citizens of different countries.
Until 1Â MayÂ 2004, this was an obvious principle for the old Member States and was not open to question.
After the 10 new Member States joined the EU, however, peopleâs attitudes towards this principle suddenly began to change.
They began to practice , which essentially means watering down oneâs principles so that they correspond to reality, rather than changing reality so that it fits oneâs principles.
In my opinion, the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the reciprocity mechanism is a further example of .
These amendments are unacceptable to Polish citizens for a number of reasons.
Firstly, Poles have always regarded the lack of reciprocity in visa arrangements with certain countries, in particular the United States, as unfair.
Secondly, they had every right to expect that when we joined the European Union, which is a community of nations, this community would take on some of the responsibility for defending Polandâs interests, in line with the principle of subsidiarity in its broadest sense.
Once again, however, their expectations were dashed, and the musketeersâ magnificent cry of âone for all and all for oneâ, something I am sure we have all heard before, was consigned to the realms of fiction.
This is another reason why I cannot vote in favour of this report, even though, or perhaps precisely because, I hold both Polish and American citizenship.
On a loosely related note, I cannot help but wonder what has happened to the integrity of the European Unionâs policy.
I would ask the Commissioner and the President how the international European Community can be expected to wield any power on the international scene if we make such far-reaching concessions in a matter such as this, which appears to be quite straightforward.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have taken part and, once again, the rapporteur.
The Commission is fully aware that the issue faced today is a real issue for citizens, and that it is an issue leading to wasted time, expense and, above all, a sense of injustice.
It is a political matter that we take very seriously and the Commission will certainly take into account the decisions made by Parliament.
We are convinced that what is needed is speed and effectiveness.
You are aware that if this initiative is approved, as I hope it will be, and after the Member States have been notified, the matter will pass automatically to the Commission for negotiation, with greater speed and effectiveness than at present.
The principle of solidarity will be implemented and this too is an important political point.
As Mr Coelho has so ably stated, political and diplomatic responses are needed, and that is the road that the Commission intends to follow.
I can assure you that we have already established relations and contacts at a political level precisely with the non-EU countries that you have mentioned â the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand â in order to arrive at a system that will guarantee all Member States, whether old or new, free movement without a visa.
We will propose concrete action, as has been requested, in addition to firm deadlines.
Furthermore, we are making efforts for every new Member State to join the Schengen area by 2007.
You are aware that evaluation on a case-by-case basis will be necessary, but we are striving to help all the new Member States to be in a position by then to join a European area without internal borders.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0084/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14Â JuneÂ 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders as regards access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles (14238/1/2004 â C6-0007/2005 â 2003/0198(COD)) (Rapporteur: MrÂ Coelho).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we all want to combat theft and the illegal trade in stolen cars.
This is a growing form of crime, with more than 1 million cars stolen per year, of which fewer than 40% are recovered.
This is an alarming problem, not solely from an economic point of view, but more importantly because of its links with other forms of crime such as drug-trafficking, arms trafficking and the trafficking of human beings.
It is also a highly lucrative activity, which has become very attractive to organised crime networks, as it does not entail too much risk.
Fresh measures to combat crime of this nature must therefore be taken.
In a Europe in which internal border checks have been scrapped, a response must be found that involves effective action at Community level.
The purpose of this proposal is to provide the public vehicle registration authorities direct access to certain categories of data contained in the Schengen Information System (SIS) and, in turn, to restrict private vehicle registration services solely to the right to request indirect access through a public authority with access to the SIS.
The aim is thus to enable the SIS to be an even more important instrument in the fight against crime.
It is necessary to check quickly and efficiently whether vehicles presented to them for registration have been stolen, misappropriated or lost.
We have also improved the functioning of the internal market by strengthening the principle of free movement and, in so doing, we have fostered the gradual creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, along with the implementation of the common transport policy.
This direct access will ensure that cars stolen in one country cannot be registered â and thus made legal â in another, a process that sometimes takes less than 24 hours.
There are two reasons for introducing this measure: firstly, efficiency â there are millions of vehicles registered in the EU and direct access will make it possible to check the legal status of a vehicle quickly and easily; and secondly, transparency â at the moment, the various Member States have different ways of checking whether a vehicle has been stolen, at the moment when it is being registered.
All of these ways are, to a greater or lesser extent, opaque and complicated.
The proposed solution, within the scope of the Schengen Convention, is transparent and offers more guarantees than the current situation.
We want to maintain data protection and our citizensâ privacy.
We have therefore restricted the type of data that can be accessed and have proposed that access to data relating to identity documents and to blank official documents be removed, in line with the opinion of the joint supervisory authority.
The range of data to which the competent vehicle registration authorities will have access is clearly laid down and limited in terms of what is necessary and appropriate.
I should also like to point out that Directive 95/46 on personal protection data is applicable here, along with the specific rules of the Schengen Convention on data protection.
We should like to be sure that these rules are being effectively complied with and monitored.
The authorities in charge of data protection must therefore have sufficient resources at their disposal to carry out their work and the Member States must be firmly committed to upholding the fundamental right to data protection.
My report, which tabled ten amendments to the Commissionâs initial proposal, was approved at first reading in April 2004 and the Council common position was adopted in December 2004.
I wholeheartedly welcome this common position, and I am delighted that, in accepting seven of the ten amendments put forward, it largely took on board Parliamentâs recommendations.
As for the three amendments not accepted, I shall first mention Amendment 4.
I have dropped this amendment, because it is no longer relevant, given that on 24Â February 2005, the Council finally adopted the initiative by the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Decision concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, in particular in the fight against terrorism; secondly, Amendment 11, an attempt to amend the rules of data protection for the SIS, but I agree that this question should be addressed within the scope of the legal proposal on SIS II, the second generation of SIS; and thirdly, Amendment 10, which requested an annual report on the implementation of the proposed access for the authorities concerned.

I must stress that only if Parliament receives a report enabling it to assess the system will it be able to carry out its duties as a legislative body and a budgetary authority.
I propose a slightly different wording, which I presume the Council would be in a position to accept, following an informal meeting with the Luxembourg Presidency.
The conditions are thus in place whereby this legal act can finally be adopted and this useful measure can enter into force.
Accordingly, Mr President, we can help to fight crime and to make our citizens feel safer.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his report.
Our aim is to prevent and combat the illegal trade in stolen vehicles and improve the functioning of the internal market.
The proposal we are discussing today also offers a better use of the largest European database on stolen vehicles, the Schengen Information System.
The financial interests at stake are huge since annually millions of cars are registered and every 10 or 15 seconds a car is stolen, which has also been underlined by the rapporteur.
Since vehicle theft is one of the foremost crimes to affect citizens directly, our working together to reduce it will have an immeasurable impact on their security.
We propose that under certain conditions national vehicle registration authorities should be allowed to consult the SIS data registers on stolen vehicles and stolen vehicle documents, prior to registering a vehicle that is already registered in another Schengen state.
This information will make it more difficult to sell stolen vehicles in other Schengen states.
At the same time, it will increase victimsâ chances of reclaiming their lost property.
This is an excellent way in which Europe can serve its citizens and promote concrete operational cooperation.
Our proposal will also make the law enforcement process more manageable by facilitating access to information.
I agree with the rapporteur that the current situation is far from transparent.
In view of the millions of cars that are presented for registration each year, authorities lack resources to check all cars in accordance with current requirements.
Our proposal will grant this access on the basis of a transparent and common set of rules and data protection principles.
Compliance with the rules will be monitored in a manner similar to other searches in the SIS.
Data protection considerations made us differentiate between access arrangements for public and for private vehicle registration bodies.
Finally, the Commission welcomes the amendments proposed by the European Parliament, in particular Amendment 3, which allows for a reporting system with a view to collecting reliable data.
Obviously when the SIS II is in place a systematic reporting system will be guaranteed by the Commission.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to the productive working relationship we have in general with Mr Coelho. I was keen to point this out.
The proposal that we are examining today at second reading gives national vehicle registration authorities access to certain categories of the Schengen Information System.
The clear objective of this ruling is the fight against organised vehicle crime, which we all fully agree is one of our priorities.
We are, however, more reserved with regard to unlimited access to European databases.
In actual fact, we must assure ourselves that personal data are stringently protected.
In order to allow a balance between the fight against organised crime and the protection of the private lives of European citizens, every decision taken, moreover, must respect the principles of proportionality and finality.
I believe that we are very much in agreement on this matter.
I regret that the Council has been unable to incorporate all of our amendments at first reading into its common position.
In actual fact, registration of the people carrying out the research and people targeted by this research would, I believe, have allowed these abuses to be avoided.
In the spirit of compromise, we support the rapporteurâs stand in bringing in only one amendment that was not adopted by the common position.
An annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the implementation of this regulation is an absolute prerequisite, in order to assure the representatives of European citizens that the principle of finality is genuinely observed.
I should finally like to point out that my group was opposed, at first reading, to direct access to the Schengen Information System by any authorities other than those responsible for law enforcement.
I must add that we remain committed to this principle with the prospect of further discussions to come on the Schengen Information System II, which will therefore be a matter for codecision.
Whilst European databases can prove useful in the fight against organised crime, they must, in reality, be rigorously controlled.
Our priority is the effective fight against organised crime in Europe, but in observing the rights and freedoms of European citizens, it is not always a pointless exercise to reaffirm it.
Â Â  I made some rather sarcastic remarks about this proposal at first reading and, as a lawyer, I have objections to its being defined as an aspect of transport policy when, in reality, what we have here is an arrangement that extends what, fundamentally, is dangerous access to very extensive information systems and the most comprehensive system of police supervision and control we have, namely the Schengen system.
If it were a case of the supervisory authoritiesâ access to these systems helping to prevent crime in this area, it would be worth thinking about.
Even if that were so, however, there are such major reasons for concern about extending the access in question that we in our group shall vote against the proposal, irrespective of the fact that we very much appreciate the rapporteurâs very commendable efforts to have an obligation imposed to report on whether the system is of any use.
We have these reservations about the supervisory system because we see it as a further extension to a system of police supervision and control that, in all probability, will have no useful effect at all.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the question by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Commission, on the Commissionâs strategy for the first Conference of the Parties on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) (O-0042/2005 â B6-0171/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, with your permission I will also be representing Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
He should have been leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but cannot join us this evening so he has ceded his time to me in addition to my own time, so thank you for your patience on that.
The oral question before us was tabled by my colleague Mr Florenz and we also have a motion for resolution further to that oral question on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the EU strategy for the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
For the record, next week the first Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on POPs or Persistent Organic Pollutants, takes place in Punta del Este in Uruguay.
POPs are organic chemicals that break down very slowly in the environment and accumulate in our bodies; indeed they are in the tissues of every human being on the planet.
They are spread through the air and through the food chain very far from their sources, even to regions where they have never been used or produced.
They include insecticides such as DDT â perhaps the best-known POP â industrial chemicals such as PCBs and indeed the unintentional by-products of industrial processes such as dioxins and furans.
Once POPs are released into the environment it is almost impossible to predict where they will end up, so we have to apply the precautionary principle, but most importantly take steps to restrict their use and their placing on the market generally.
It is important, however, that the needs of developing countries are taken into account and that our response is proportionate and that we allow controlled exemptions.
I am thinking primarily of the use of DDT against malaria because, despite the best efforts of scientists and their redoubled efforts to find an effective vaccine, this is still many years away.
So our approach must be proportionate, particularly when we realise that every minute two children in Africa die of malaria.
Every day over 3Â 000 children in Africa die of malaria.
The mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria has proved extremely resilient to the various methods of dealing with it down the years.
To date the only effective method of killing the mosquito is by the use of DDT.
Although it is a very toxic substance, the benefit still outweighs the risk when your child is less likely to die of persistent organic pollution poisoning than of malaria.
So if we can save a childâs life, until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mosquito in question, we will have to allow controlled use.
However, we must double our efforts to find an alternative to DDT because huge damage is being done to humans â it is biocumulative â and to our environment by our need to look after the children who are here today.
We have nothing else to replace DDT to eliminate malaria and the mosquito involved.
I should like to put a few specific questions to the Commissioner.
Commissioner, you will probably be familiar with the resolution that is before you.
I should like to draw your attention to paragraph 9, which says that Parliament âbelieves that the Members of the European Parliament who are part of the EC delegation have an essential contribution to make and expects, therefore, that they will have access to EU coordination meetings in Punta del Este on the basis at least of observer statusâ.
The motion goes on to say âwith or without speaking rightsâ.
I should be quite happy with observer status without speaking rights.
Commissioner, I say this regardless of precedent or quoting interinstitutional agreements, because I would like to say yet again on the record that, just a few weeks after you were appointed, Commissioner, at the conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in relation to climate change, COP 10, you made great strides in including the Members of the European Parliament, both before and after various meetings, in terms of full briefings.
You even went so far as to ask us for our opinion on different issues.
That was very much appreciated by all of us across the Groups in this House.
I know you cannot join us in Punta del Este, but I would ask that you make it very clear to those honourable people who will be representing you there that you would like the precedent you created last December to continue.
It is one step less than we would like, because we want observer status and we request that.
There is little point in sending Members of Parliament half way across the globe, to be part of a Commission/Council/Parliament delegation, a Community delegation, if one third are kept outside the door albeit with briefings when the business is done.
Let us take it one step at a time, let us at least have observer status at the coordination meetings and at the meetings where the real work is done and of course be part of any press conference and press briefing that may wind up the week.
It is the first COP â I accept that â and perhaps we will not have as much to report as we would like because we are only developing structures and strategies to deal with this most important issue.
Those are my points.
At this hour of the night there is no point in underlining yet again how important a job the Stockholm Convention has to do.
I would like in conclusion to ask you, Commissioner, about the goals and the timetable for the addition of extra organic chemicals to the list of POPs as set out under the Convention, which were discussed last August.
The Commission suggested that seven new substances should be added to the list for eventual exclusion.
Somehow over the autumn and over Christmas and the New Year, by the time of the Council conclusions on 10 March, the seven had dropped to up to three additional substances.
We had gone from a worthy ambition of seven last August to up to three, plus of course Penta BDE, the Norwegian proposal, which might be a fourth one.
But up to three could be none, one or two as well as three.
I would just like to know where the Commission stands on this.
The European Community and the Member States wanted to forward an extensive list to be considered if possible before the first COP next week, but in any case in time for examination by the first meeting of the POPs review committee.
Are we going to have it before next week?
Why has it not happened?
What has happened to the goals and the timetables that were clearly set out?
Maybe you could tell us, Commissioner, what has happened between 10 March and today?
It is rather disappointing that our ambitions of seven to be added last summer have been reduced to up to three at this stage.
To me it sounds as though the urgency and the ambition that were initially there have evaporated.
It is almost as if air is being let out of the tyre of enthusiasm in relation to it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree with almost everything Mrs Doyle said and I should like to say that, with the entry into force of the Stockholm Convention, twelve of the most dangerous substances in the world will gradually be abolished.
Nonetheless, if this Convention is to come up to our expectations, it must be applied correctly and must gather momentum by including new substances as time goes by.
Numerous important issues will be discussed and decided at the first conference of the parties, which will also lay the foundations for the future development of the Convention.
The general objective is to ensure that the decisions taken by the first conference will allow for the effective application and further development of the Convention.
Of course, if we are to succeed, the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee must first be set up, so that it can start examining new proposals for the addition of other organic pollutants to the list.
The Commission has already determined other substances; as Mrs Doyle said, they were confined to three and, as far as I know, this has not changed since.
In all events, the debate is continuing on the timetable and for submitting proposals and I believe and hope that the European Union will table good proposals during the first conference of the parties.
Secondly, and most importantly, greater progress is needed with the gradual abolition of the use and release into the environment of the twelve persistent organic pollutants on the current list, especially DDT, which you quite rightly said is still needed to combat malaria in certain developing countries.
However, the first conference must find ways to help limit the reliance on DDT, such as by promoting research into alternative means and providing technical and financial support.
Similarly, the first conference must set further measures in motion in a bid to restrict the risks from the use and availability of PCBs, on the one hand, and to reduce and prevent the release into the environment of derivative organic pollutants, especially chlorinated dioxins and furans, on the other.
The third basic objective of decisive importance for the first conference is to complete the institutional framework needed so that the Convention can be applied in practice.
In particular, substantial progress needs to be made in developing suitable compliance mechanisms and procedures.
With regard to point 9 of the resolution, I think that it is the Commission's duty to include Members of the European Parliament in this sort of delegation and may I say that, from my own personal experience, we have cooperated excellently in two instances, once in Buenos Aires and once at the conference on sustainable development in New York last week which was also attended by Members of the European Parliament, where we managed through exchanges not only of views, but also of advice, opinions and, in particular, political judgments on certain issues, to promote the issues to which these conferences were devoted.
At the same time, we succeeded, with the three institutions, in projecting a very good and united image of the European Union to the outside world, mainly by using press conferences at which we appeared together and seemed united and unified in our opinions, thereby improving the image of the European Union.
In other words, we had both positive material results and results from the point of view of communications.
That is why I consider, therefore, that the participation of Members of the European Parliament is essential; I always think that it is absolutely crucial and I also recommend it to my other colleagues in the European Commission.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, world public opinion has slowly been waking up to the new problems that we face.
Environmental quality is not a luxury item; as a prerequisite for sustainable development, it should be a political priority.
Governments are, to a greater or lesser extent, coming to realise that the world has changed and that policy must change with it.
They are all coming to the realisation that attacks on the environment jeopardise the future of this generation and generations to come and do irreversible damage to peopleâs quality of life.
Environmental problems and health concerns must be addressed as a matter of urgency.
The ignorance of the past and the negligence of the present have come at a high price â environmental costs, financial costs and costs in terms of human lives.
Remedying the current situation is necessary, but taking preventative action is an even more pressing priority.
The chemical industry currently produces more than 1Â 000 compounds, some of which are very persistent, that is, highly resistant to environmental degradation.
Some of them are biocumulative, which means that they accumulate in the tissue of living organisms; they are also toxic.
The most prevalent of these toxic compounds are the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which have been linked to various health problems such as cancer, endometriosis, cognitive disorders and learning difficulties.
POPs are also responsible for reproductive disorders and hormonal dysfunctions.
Being resistant, POPs are passed down from generation to generation and contaminate the food that we eat, the air that we breathe and the water that we drink.
Being biocumulative, POPs accumulate in the environment and in the organisms of living beings.
With these characteristics, POPs can travel long distances and can be found in places as far apart as the Antarctic, in penguins, and in the Arctic, in polar bears.
There is therefore no point in Brazil stopping mirex production if Argentina does not follow suit; similarly, there is no reason for the EU to ban DDT if China continues to produce it and use it.
Accordingly â and I wish to stress this point â efforts must be coordinated worldwide.
It is also important to note that many of these substances did not exist 50 years ago.
In 1995, negotiations began to control the use, production and release of POPs.
12 pollutants were identified.
The Stockholm Convention, held in 2001, set out a range of targets and measures aimed not only at better management of POPs, but also at eliminating them and at promoting clean technologies.
Against the background of the decisions taken by the Stockholm Convention, which, as I said, took place in 2001, and of the aims and agenda of the first Conference of the Parties to that Convention taking place in Uruguay on 2 to 6Â May, we should like to ask the Commission what its objectives are for that conference.
I should also like to ask what it hopes to accomplish and how much progress it feels can be made.
Furthermore, given that everything has its cost, I should also like to know, Commissioner, what financial resources will be available to help those countries that most need to ban POPs.
I shall not be going to Punta del Este to take part in the conference, but I should like to say that I share the concerns expressed by Mrs Doyle and that I agree with everything she said as regards Parliamentâs delegation, which should be there on the basis of observer status.
It does not make sense if elected Members of the European Parliament are not able to take part in all initiatives, all conferences and all meetings.
Â Â  . Mr President, we could of course promote financing with regard to the Millennium Development Goals and the possibilities this provides.
On POPs, the Commissionâs proposal was ambitious, but so far the Council has not agreed to it.
We wanted a Council decision under Article 300 of the Treaty, i.e. by qualified majority.
The poorer result of the Council conclusions of 10Â March is due to the fact that these were adopted differently, through unanimity.
The Commission regrets this approach.
However, the process will be a long one.
There are political, economic and social considerations to be taken into account, but we shall pursue our line of argument.
Â Â  At the end of the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0061/2005) by MrsÂ KlaÃ on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the protection of groundwater against pollution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament, and especially the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur, MrsÂ KlaÃ, for their contribution to this report at first reading.
Groundwater is an important resource, which is used for drinking water, and by industry and agriculture.
It also has an important environmental value, given that it interacts with surface water and wetlands and, as such, forms an important part of the water cycle, which needs protection.
The protection of groundwater from pollution has been the subject of Community legislation since as far back as 1980; most recently, in the Water Framework Directive passed in 2000.
Nonetheless, there are still some gaps.
There are no clear criteria for defining targets for the environmental quality of groundwater; more importantly, there are no good chemical status targets.
In addition, special measures are needed to prevent and control the pollution of groundwater.
This was acknowledged when the Water Framework Directive was approved, article 17 of which calls on the Commission to submit proposals to address the relevant requirements.
Within this framework, and following extensive consultations with the interested parties, the Commission submitted the proposal being debated today, which includes the main following elements:
- a compliance procedure for assessing good groundwater chemical status, in order to limit the number of pollutants, where Community standards already apply;
- criteria for assessing the chemical status of groundwater on the basis of environmental quality standards, which need to be adopted by the Member States at the appropriate national, regional or local level, depending on variations in natural groundwater conditions, the pressures identified and the chemical substances connected with pollution;
- criteria for determining deterioration in the quality of groundwater and for reversing pollution trends and
- measures to prevent or limit the direct and, more importantly, the indirect discharge of dangerous substances into the groundwater.
The proposal contains clear specifications which will ensure that the environmental targets of the Water Framework Directive are met in respect of groundwater.
Similarly, the proposal strikes a satisfactory balance between issues which need to be addressed at Community level and issues which should preferably be left in the hands of the Member States.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is life, and groundwater is our main source of fresh water and hence also of drinking water, providing as it does 60% of the latter.
Groundwater is, though, not just a vital resource for the extraction of our drinking water; it is also essential to agriculture, industry and our eco-system.
However hard we try to keep our water â and our groundwater in particular â clean, and to restore its purity where it is already polluted, we must, not least at European level, strike a sensible balance between the requirements of the water industry, the needs of agriculture, the eco-systems and the resources available for maintaining and restoring the purity of water in the Member States.
As the re-purification of polluted groundwater is very difficult, very time-consuming and, in particular, very costly, prevention and the protection of the groundwater eco-system are particularly important.
On the European continent, at any rate, groundwater bodies, like rivers, know no borders.
It is for that reason, and also because differing requirements in the Member States inevitably lead to distortions of competition for industry and agriculture, that the protection of groundwater is a task for Europe.
Fortunately, though, we are not starting from nothing.
This proposal from the Commission is derived from the Water Framework Directive, which has been in force since the year 2000, and was meant to be transposed in all the Member States from the end of December 2003.
The primary task imposed on the Member States by the Water Framework Directive was the inventarisation of all waters by 22Â MarchÂ 2005.
If all the Member States have met that deadline â and perhaps Commissioner Dimas can tell us whether or not they have â then every one of them ought, by now at the latest, to know in what condition its waters and groundwater are.
The Water Framework Directive lays down quality and quantity targets for all Community waters, including groundwater, and specifies the means whereby they are to be achieved.
This daughter directive is intended to deal with two points that remain outstanding, firstly the criteria by reference to which groundwater is to be categorised as âgoodâ or âpoorâ and, secondly, the point in time at which action must be taken if deterioration is established.
We must also determine whether there is a need to enact rules on the indirect introduction of pollutants from point sources and diffuse sources.
We must consider in their context all the relevant directives: the Water Framework Directive, the Priority Substances Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive.
The costs incurred in administering and implementing them, and in monitoring their implementation, must be tolerable, without making it less likely that groundwater will be maintained in a good chemical status in all 25 EU Member States, for that is our objective.
We would, though, risk missing this target if we were to adopt the so-called compromise amendment 94 to Article 6, which has been tabled jointly by the PSE, the Liberals, the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group, and which would alter the fundamental direction not only of my report, but also of the Commission proposal and of the Water Framework Directive.
It seeks to overburden the Member States by drawing up new lists of what it describes as hazardous substances and by imposing tasks to be regulated by the chemicals policy now in REACH.
It proposes a new category of groundwater bodies mandated with the certification of safety zones with the chemical status of âvery goodâ, and calls for an array of new examination, reporting and supervision requirements, the additional costs of which would be borne by the Member States and by municipalities.
The amendment is also couched in very vague and repetitious terms.
It goes as far as to do away with all the derogations from Article 6(2) that water experts regard as necessary and that are also contained in the 1980 Groundwater Directive.
We must not accept this amendment; the laboriously-achieved compromise in the Water Framework Directive must not be altered by a daughter directive on groundwater.
There are two other amendments proposing uniform European standards on the quality of groundwater for important indicators and pollutants.
I think it very important, if we are to avoid distortions of competition and have a comparable standard of groundwater protection throughout our Member States, that we in this House should call for uniform European categories of this kind for the evaluation of groundwater as âgoodâ or âpoorâ, and so, with this in mind, I ask you to support Amendments 111 and 112.
We also have to draw a clear distinction between pollutants and indicators.
I have tried to separate them completely, for sulphate, chloride and aluminium are not in fact pollutants, but rather important indicators of the chemical status of the groundwater and of the possible presence of certain impurities and pollutants.
It is ultimately impossible to constantly monitor every conceivable pollutant, for there are hundreds or even thousands of them.
Let me conclude by asking the House to support Amendments 89 and 90, which divide the list into indicators and pollutants.
I ask you all to ensure today that our waters will, in future, be well protected by a Europe that acts together.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of difficult legislation.
However, groundwater is one of our most important resources.
Its protection should be taken seriously: indeed, wars are being increasingly fought over water resources.
I believe that this proposal for a directive to protect groundwater should come into force despite its shortcomings.
As has been mentioned, it will complement the Water Framework Directive.
This will be a difficult issue throughout the Union.
In my country, Finland, there are thousands of small groundwater areas, none of which will be sources of contamination in the near future, but which now need to be investigated.
We nevertheless agree with this law, even if it is not necessary for us.
I believe that it is now our turn to reach a reciprocal agreement.
Groundwater in Central Europe covers large areas, and these are being threatened by various chemicals.
The problem with the aquifers on the Iberian Peninsula is often to do with seawater.
We on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy managed to draw up a statement in a congenial atmosphere, for which I thank my colleagues.
Unfortunately, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the committee responsible for this issue, did not agree to support compromise proposal 94 as the other groups did.
This directive is needed.
The first reading is only an intermediate stage, as the Councilâs joint position is very different.
It is worth making a combined effort to ensure that groundwater is properly protected.
It affects our quality of life, it affects agriculture, and it affects human happiness and health.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs KlaÃ for the good cooperation I enjoyed with her.
As far as the Committee on Agriculture is concerned, two points stood out in particular, and it will not surprise you to learn that the essential one, to which previous speakers have already referred, was that the Committee on Agriculture is also, of course, in favour of clean water.
Since something has to be done about this, we can, in principle, support the proposals in this groundwater directive.
We consider it vital, though, that different measuring methods be introduced in Europe which reflect climatic and soil type differences.
The situation on clay soil is different from that on peat, or sandy soil, and one soil type can also differ from Finland down to the heel of Italy.
This will need to be taken into consideration when we measure the 50 mg.
Secondly, the Committee on Agriculture wanted to take existing legislation into account.
With regard to nitrate, it looks like two directives will be in place soon: the existing nitrates directive alongside the groundwater directive.
If, for example, a farmer somewhere in Europe complies with the groundwater directive and is, with 30Â mg, for example, below the 50 mg threshold, he will still be bound by the nitrates directive, and it is possible that a farmer with three cows per hectare will fail to comply with the provisions of the nitrates directive but will be complying with those of the groundwater directive, because if we measure the nitrate level, we are below 50 mg.
It is then illogical to my mind that we have to ask that farmer to reduce the number of cattle units per hectare.
It is one or the other.
That is why the Committee on Agriculture has proposed to assess the need for the nitrates directive in 2008.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety rejected two amendments in this connection; the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has subsequently re-submitted them, and I would now like to warmly recommend them to you.
Thirdly â and in this last minute, I am speaking on behalf of the ALDE Group â I go along with the idea that clean water should be available, but what we should take into consideration is the cost involved.
What are the socio-economic consequences if we introduce certain legislation?
This is also the subject of a number of amendments tabled by the ALDE Group, which, needless to say, I should like to see adopted.
It strikes me as being absolutely logical that the introduction of directives is not at the expense of everything else.
We must have a timeframe in which things are kept realistic and affordable.
Â Â  . Mr President, we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much welcome this Directive.
Nevertheless, from the outset, we found ourselves, at least in certain sectors within my group and certain countries, in a particularly uncomfortable situation, because the directive did not fulfil all the objectives we had hoped for.
For example, it did not deal with one fundamental issue relating to the control of aquifers â quantity â and focussed solely on quality, although, in reality, the water directive, in its respective annexes, talked about controlling quantities â volumes of water â and controlling quality at the same time.
The failure to link quality and quantity in a government measure, a management measure, is something we cannot understand.
Furthermore, there is no insistence on the need for control either on the part of the Member States or on the part of river basins, which is what the water Directive lays down for the management of water; it does not provide for control by means of river basins but rather by means of countries.
Furthermore, the artificial refilling of aquifers is not considered either, despite the fact that this is an essential phenomenon.
Finally, we must point out that we believe that many of Parliamentâs amendments make the situation worse, because they are intended to standardise all aquifers and all controls of substances, although we are well aware that European geology is very diverse and that the concept of Europe's geological diversity must be a fundamental consideration of this policy, because sustainable development must be appropriate for each location.
Furthermore, we believe that some of the amendments would be impossible to implement, such as Amendment 94, because a State cannot guarantee what enters its aquifers, since in many cases they are shared.
If Amendment 94 is approved, therefore, we are going to vote against the directive because it would be incomplete and would not provide for control of quantities of water.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, and all the honourable Members for the work they have done to complement the provisions on the protection of groundwater established by the framework directive with a view to preventing and controlling the pollution of groundwater and establishing criteria for assessing the chemical state of that water.
We must therefore take the view that, given that the possibility of purifying an aquifer is very limited, control and prevention are absolutely essential in order to ensure that polluting substances do not build up in groundwater.
We must not forget that groundwater is the European Union's most sensitive and important water resource and, in particular, it is the main source of public drinking water supply.
Furthermore, and given that the measures to prevent or restrict the introduction of pollutants into groundwater are a vital element of the proposed directive, it is very important, despite what the previous speaker said, that we approve the compromise amendment on Article 6, which we have presented jointly with other Members, in order to ensure that Member States control indirect dumping on the basis of best environmental practices and techniques that are sufficient to prevent such dumping.
Commissioner, I would like to point out that, in its proposed annex of polluting substances, the Commission has not taken sufficient account of the fact that, due to the geological nature of the existing sub-soils, there are certain substances, such as chlorides and sulphates, that occur naturally in many of the European Union's aquifers, and that, from a scientific point of view, it is arguable whether these salts should even be classified as pollutants.
I would also like to say that the proposal presented to us is not very ambitious, since it is limited to the minimum requirements of the framework directive, but, despite that, I am confident that the work of all of us will lead to a better directive.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree with the Commissionâs view that nitrates and pesticides, as listed in Annex I, should remain the two substances for which we have EU-wide standards.
We then should allow Member States to establish threshold values for a range of other substances.
In the longer term, in the light of experience and information as a result of implementing the framework Water Directive, we may then be in a much better position to translate threshold values at national level into EU-wide groundwater quality standards.
In my opinion this is a more reasonable and pragmatic way forward, but critically it is workable and achievable.
And when do we amend legislation in this Parliament?
It is essential that it is workable across 25 countries and it is essential that the subsidiarity principle is enshrined in our legislation so that we can achieve high standards that work at national level.
I am happy to agree with the opinion put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which suggests that the Commission should analyse whether the Nitrates Directive can be repealed from 2008.
I agree with this in the context of what I have just said.
Legislation should be adequate and workable, but most importantly it should achieve its stated objectives.
The Nitrates Directive is certainly not doing this with 12 of the 15 Member States being taken to court over wrong or inadequate implementation.
But the essential points are that it does not take soil or climatic conditions into consideration and, most critically, that the goal of the Nitrates Directive should be defined at Community level but not the mechanism to achieve that goal.
Yesterday evening I went to see the exhibition hosted by the Joint Research Centre.
One of the exhibits informed me that there are 28 different soil groups all over Europe and six of these soil groups are present in Ireland.
How can a one-size-fits-all directive, like the Nitrates Directive, work efficiently in these circumstances?
Moreover, it is not just soil that matters; it makes an important difference whether the area is grassland or ploughed land.
As to the issue of climate, all I can say is that in Ireland we do not have a climate, we have weather.
And if Irish farmers were to follow the letter of the directive and spread slurry when allowed, they would cause pollution rather than prevent it.
We all want clean water but the legislation we put in place must be adequate to achieve it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrsÂ KlaÃâs report on groundwater is an extremely complex one.
However, the question we could ask today is whether the objectives of the Water Framework Directive and the objectives of preventing and controlling groundwater pollution will be achieved by the proposals contained in the report.
The protection of groundwater is indeed a crucial issue, since it relates not only to our own water resources today, but also to those of future generations, and to the aquatic ecosystem as a whole.
We know how complicated the study of groundwater is, and we also know that, once a body of water is polluted, it remains so for years.
Today, these resources are threatened by a wide variety of forms of pollution.
Some aquifers have already seriously deteriorated due to the effects of intensive farming, with massive use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers, including nitrates.
The precautionary principle requires us to give a higher priority to the prevention of pollution than to the remediation or cleaning of groundwater, even supposing we could seriously contemplate easily cleaning an aquifer.
If we are to prevent groundwater pollution, our most urgent priority must be to eliminate sources of pollution.
However, certain amendments lead us to fear that, no doubt for reasons to do with sectoral interests, the urgent need to take a more radical approach to the prevention of pollution has not been grasped.
Specifically, certain indirect discharges have been excluded: fertilisers and plant treatment products used in accordance with good agricultural practice.
In fact, this comes down to official acceptance of agricultural pollution, which is unacceptable, particularly as we know that the main culprit in groundwater pollution is, of course, agriculture.
The position proposed in AmendmentÂ 45 must be rejected out of hand if we want to achieve results with regard to protecting our water resources.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, already disappointed that the Commissionâs initial draft did not go far enough to actually protect the quality of groundwater, is worried that this report is further weakening even the Commissionâs position.
If some of these amendments were adopted, this draft would amount to a licence to pollute and would, of course, in the end make European consumers pay the price of drinking water that would have been polluted practically legally.
In our view, ArticleÂ 6 and the compromise put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and ourselves are the most important, because they require a clear prevention policy that bans the most dangerous chemicals and strictly limits other pollutants.
That is why we call on Parliament to support this compromise.
Â Â  . â Groundwater is a unique natural resource of tremendous value, which is why it must be protected effectively.
In our opinion, we need clear criteria for examining the qualitative status of water and a common European denominator, so that these criteria are comparable.
We therefore support the need for the gradual elaboration of a common European policy for protecting groundwater, which will, however, also take account of the specific characteristics of each area.
We attach exceptional importance to the compromise amendment which we have signed together with other political groups on Article 6, in which we state our wish for intensive protection.
The scope of Article 6 must not be confined merely to indirect discharges to groundwater.
We also support the need for a list to be created by the Member States, which will include the pollutants which are of specific concern in a river basin district.
As there is no European definition of the best practice for farming, we call on the Member States to take additional measures to prevent pollution in this sector.
At the same time, farmers need to be supported in their effort to achieve a cleaner environment through rural development programmes, so that the objectives both of the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive can be achieved.
We also propose that the Member States list and conduct a midterm assessment of measures taken to prevent pollution.
In this way, prevention can be strengthened and irreversible consequences avoided.
The emphasis on prevention, the strict protection of groundwater and measures to prevent its deterioration are both necessary and an investment for future generations.
That is why I totally fail to understand those who say that they have no money to invest in the future, in the environment or in our children.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the eleven years I have been a Member of this House now, I have rarely come across a rapporteur who himself presented a minority view on a report.
In all honesty, I find it a bit strange that Mrs KlaÃ did exactly that.
Her point is that the amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety leave too much room for Member Statesâ own policy.
I can only stress at this point that I consider the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to have done the right thing in adopting these amendments; after all, groundwater is mainly a national issue.
When the framework directive on water was discussed, it was acknowledged that groundwater should be treated separately.
Not least because of the subsidiarity principle, there can be no legal basis for this daughter directive other than Article 175(1).
Groundwater is an endangered natural resource; we do well to give it our attention by exchanging best practice and encouraging better protection, but this is not the place for rigid Europe-wide standards.
We already know that it is extremely difficult to measure the content of a substance in groundwater objectively for a region, never mind a Member State.
For example, the concentration level of chloride can vary between 20 mg/l and more than 10Â 000 mg/l within a 10 km radius.
Finally, I should like to briefly draw the Membersâ attention to the issue surrounding the ban on dumping.
Amendment 43 is crucial in this respect.
Due to the way in which drinking water is extracted in some of the Member States, namely via infiltration of surface water, it is extremely important not to introduce an absolute dumping ban.
I would therefore ask you to vote against Amendment 43, while Amendment 103 of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is acceptable.
I eagerly await the outcome of the forthcoming vote, although I cannot guarantee that I will be very pleased with it.
That will depend on which amendments this House adopts.
Â Â  Mr President, groundwater pollution is caused by percolation from the surface, as a result of the use of chemical substances in agriculture, as a result of organic and inorganic pollution due to surface flows of waste water and sewage, whether free or channelled, and lastly, but no less importantly, as a result of the inadequate lining of waste disposal sites.
Illegal discharges, which unfortunately take place in various regions of the Union, both in the new accession countries and in the older Member States, like Italy, cause severe and uncontrolled groundwater pollution.
Introducing threshold values for pollutants at the discretion of the Member States is a serious step backwards as regards the protection of the environment.
Maintaining a gradual approach on this issue, as the Commission plans, does not in this case mean respecting the rights of individual countries, which is something that we would welcome in many other cases, but will result in harm to the environment and to consumers.
By looking at the labels on bottles of mineral water, consumers can perhaps judge whether or not to buy the product, but they cannot do the same for vegetables and cereals.
I therefore hope that, in the course of the legislative process, we succeed in amending the directive and establishing identical threshold values for pollutants for all the Member States, so as to guarantee the same levels of toxicity for human beings and the environment.
Â Â  Mr President, it would seem, then, that there are more lists in circulation, but I hope that you will not point the finger at Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a for not having taken the trouble to warn me.
I should like to echo the words of thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Klass, because although I know that she was of a different opinion on certain things, she had a constructive input and was prepared to help support positions that Members from other Member States saw as important.
This directive is important, because it is about achieving an ecological balance.
Moreover, groundwater is important for agriculture, industry and for drinking water.
In the framework directive, we have opted for a basin-led approach, which has a bearing on the assessment of the groundwater directive.
It means that it is impossible to apply uniform standards to certain substances, but that uniform measuring methods, and such like, must be established.
On a different note, I have tabled Amendment 110 in relation to indirect discharges, with which Article 6 of this directive concerns itself.
You may well ask what my intention was in doing so.
I am from a province which has to contend with floods on a regular basis.
As we are in the process of clearing space for rivers, we will have them widened and use some of the sediment in order to raise their banks.
If we adopt this framework directive on water, and certainly compromise amendment 94, which has been tabled by the Group of the Greens, that means that everything that is dug out of these rivers would have to be left beside the rivers for the sake of safety of the province and the Netherlands, and that it would have to be wrapped in foil.
The cost involved for the small region I come from is EUR 100Â million.
Since that cannot be the intention, I am urging you to vote in favour of Amendment 110 and reject Amendments 43 and 94.
Â Â  Mr President, today sees us facing a major political challenge.
It is our duty to prevent natural resources from being polluted and exhausted, and, as groundwater accounts for 60% of drinking water in the Netherlands, this is sufficient reason to do all we can to prevent pollution.
We must prescribe strict standards for the quality of our groundwater, but how strict should the threshold values be?
Should we impose them at European level or should we leave this up to the Member States?
There is quite a bit of concern in the Netherlands about European regulations, which often have repercussions for farmers, builders and companies.
The quality of air, manure and the protection of the environment are all areas covered by directives with major consequences and difficult to explain to somebody who can see their building project grind to a complete halt because of abstract European rules.
âThis is yet another example of Brussels interferingâ.
The Dutch Labour Party is clear in its own mind: we do not want common threshold values for our groundwater.
Major differences, brought about by natural circumstances, in the chemical composition of groundwater in the Member States make harmonised threshold values undesirable.
Threshold values that are too strict can lead to human activities being banned in certain areas.
The Dutch Labour Party does not say that the Netherlands should be behind lock and key, nor is there any political backing for rules that are all too obtrusive without there being any need for them.
That is why we are opposed to Amendments 111 and 112.
Rest assured, though, the Dutch Labour Part is as green as ever.
What we are in favour of, though, is an emphatic common conduct standard intended to prevent or limit the contribution of polluted substances in groundwater.
That means that each incidence of groundwater being polluted with a number of well-defined substances is inadmissible.
We also want the âpolluter paysâ principle to be taken seriously.
My amendment to translate the costs of pollution by herbicides into a levy has received broad support, which I welcome, because many town councils consider manual weeding too expensive.
To date, the cost of pollution has not been included in chemical control.
If that were the case, the use of harmful substances would drop.
Finally, I should like to mention a few amendments related to nitrates and the manure issue.
It is beyond me that precisely at a time when various Member States put a lot of work into the nitrates directive, a message is being sent that this directive might be superfluous.
That is why we do not back those amendments, although we will be happy to support Amendment 110 tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, groundwater is a basic and valuable resource which we need to protect.
Groundwater pollution affects rivers, lakes and valuable ecosystems, increases the cost of drinking water and threatens its secure supply.
The Commission proposal on the protection of groundwater needs to be improved, especially as cleaning up groundwater may take decades.
As far as prevention is concerned, our objective is to protect groundwater with preventive measures, not to try and simply improve the status of polluted water.
We need a proposal which protects from pollution with defined criteria and limits, while the Member States need to be forced to submit periodic reports on the status of their water and the effective measures which they have taken.
Amendment 94, which proposes preventing and limiting substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and introduces a procedure for controls by the Member States, is a positive effort to improve the report.
According to the European Environment Agency, 87% of European groundwater does not meet the criteria for nitrates, while 10 out of 11 countries report a risk of water pollution from pesticides.
We need strict criteria for nitrates and pesticides and I therefore call on you to vote in favour of Amendments 101 and 102.
Another point is the ecosystems in groundwater.
The microscopic flora and fauna help to improve the quality of groundwater and the quality of drinking water.
Amendments 96 and 98 introduce groundwater protection zones, while Amendments 95 and 100 call for more research into groundwater ecosystems, which is why I call on you to vote for them.
Â Â  The issue of protecting groundwater against pollution in connection with supplying homes and industry is a serious one for every country and conurbation.
Concerning the draft directive on protecting groundwater from pollution, it would seem that further work is called for, in particular as regards listing the pollutants that represent the main threats to the environment.
It is also necessary to set threshold values for those naturally occurring substances identified as active ingredients of biocides and whose natural concentration is higher than the values proposed.
Account should also be taken of the fact that these substances impact on the physiological activity of live organisms.
Monitoring and research are therefore needed to establish their impact on human beings.
I also feel it must be made very clear that in the interests of protecting groundwater, preventive and educational measures should be taken to make the population aware of the facts relating to water pollution, and to provide information on methods of protection and their implementation.
Water should not only be protected through payments for its use, but also through penalties for wasting and polluting it.
Furthermore, implementing measures such as legal rules and regulations need to be practical and workable.
Â Â  Mr President, the Nitrates Directive deals expressly with nitrates in groundwater.
Why, therefore, is it necessary for this groundwater directive also to deal with nitrates?
It is wholly unsatisfactory to have two directives addressing the same issue with different approaches and mechanisms and, for the hapless farming community, dual enforcement.
Either the Nitrates Directive should be repealed or compliance with one should remove the other from the equation.
The combined effects of this directive and the Water Framework Directive will make the Nitrates Directive wholly superfluous.
Under this directive there is a requirement to put in place trend reversal measures once pollution levels reach 75Â per cent of the decreed quality standard.
This is more demanding than the standards required under the Nitrates Directive in the nitrate-vulnerable zones.
Again, we have conflict, contradiction and dual standards.
We need cogent, slimmed-down regulation, not costly duplication.
Â Â  Mr President, when Mr Dimas replies to the debate in a moment, I would like to ask him if he can specifically reply and give us the opinion of the Commission on Amendments 111, 112 and 94 and the amendments that the previous speaker has just mentioned about nitrates?
It would be very interesting for all of us to have the opinion of the Commission specifically on those.
I would like to focus quickly on 111 and 112, the two amendments which the rapporteur appeared to endorse in her opening speech, which deal with the application of the universal standards through the groundwater directive.
As she knows, this idea was rejected in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in favour of the framework approach of the Commission on the basis of river-basin management.
Are those of us who oppose universal standards correct in saying that river-basin management or local management of the groundwater directive would mean that you do not need universal standards?
Many speakers have commented on how important it is to recognise that it would be crazy to try to implement universal standards.
Forty per cent of European groundwater is already well over the standard set in the Florenz amendments.
I am sorry that as rapporteur Mrs KlaÃ used her time as speaker to endorse amendments that she knew the committee had rejected.
Just a quick second point.
The origin of the groundwater directive is really the impact of landfill sites on groundwater quality.
Can the Commissioner reassure us that the Commission really is following up the landfill directive?
We are told that there are still thousands of illegal landfills in France, Italy and other countries.
If this is the case it makes nonsense of our trying to get better standards for groundwater when the origin of the trouble is still in place.
Â Â  Mr President, after the many criticisms that certain Member States have levelled at the rapporteur, it is time for some more praise for her, and from the mouth of an Austrian Member at that.
I believe she has done a very constructive job of work, and the issue with which she is dealing is one for which it is not only necessary to get a majority in this House, as the dividing lines really do run between the various groups.
I believe it to be important that these uniform standards, as proposed in various amendments, should apply to the most important pollutants right across Europe in order to avoid not only distortions of competition, but also environmental dumping.
Article 6 of the Groundwater Directive contains additional provisions on the protection of groundwater bodies, for the Water Framework Directive has nothing to say about how the indirect introduction of pollutants is to be addressed.
In that respect â and as regards the way in which it enables us to send out a very penetrating and clear signal about the protection of the environment â I regard Article 6 as very important, and I also hope that this House will reject any attempts at watering it down.
Amendment 45, which envisages a general derogation for good agricultural practice, I regard as counter-productive in terms of groundwater protection.
Despite the provisions on adherence to good agricultural practice, which have been in force for years, the agricultural sector is still the most significant source of impurities in groundwater.
According to the latest report by the European Environmental Agency, every groundwater body in the EU exceeds the threshold values for nitrates, and these make up 87% of the groundwater in agricultural areas.
Although some Members â it appears to me to be a large number of them â have come to the conclusion that the Nitrates Directive is superfluous, I believe that conclusion to be false; what is superfluous, in my view, is todayâs debate.
Â Â  Today, we are to vote on a directive designed ostensibly to protect and improve groundwater in the EU.
That is something it may, in some places, achieve, moreover, by means of limit values on the quantity of, for example, spray pesticides in the water.
In Denmark, a decentralised system supplies us with groundwater that has not been chemically purified and that we drink directly.
For us, it therefore seems wrong to allow poison in groundwater. We need to react not only when a limit value or upper limit has been reached.
We must react as soon as we can measure the fact that a pesticide or its breakdown product has penetrated the root zone of the earthâs crust.
Pesticides should only be approved specifically on condition that they cannot penetrate the top stratum of the earth and so reach the groundwater.
When we can measure the pesticides and their breakdown products in the water, it was a mistake to have approved them, and they must immediately cease to be used.
In Denmark, we have by far the most bans on the use of pesticides, but the EU now wishes to lift some of these.
This shows that, despite the Constitutionâs talk of a high level of protection, the most stringent protection can be removed.
It also shows that the so-called environmental guarantee is, for the most part, propaganda.
Groundwater is, of course, one area in which special rules in Denmark can be justified, because we drink non-purified groundwater.
Not even in the light of this will it, however, be accepted that we are entitled to special consideration.
How are we supposed to prove that Danes are more vulnerable than Germans to, for example, allergy-producing and carcinogenic substances.
The June Movementâs amendment is designed to ensure that intervention takes place as soon as there is a measurable level of pollution.
If this amendment cannot be adopted, I would call upon the Commission to declare that countries in which non-purified groundwater is drunk directly can introduce a higher level of protection.
Thank you, MrÂ President, even though there is not so far a very great deal to say thank you for.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though two thirds of the Earth is covered with water, we can still use no more than 1% of it for drinking â that we know.
We find clean water from the tap the most obvious thing in the world, but elsewhere thousands of children are dying every day as a result of waterborne diseases.
What that clearly shows is that drinking water is first among all foodstuffs, and that we must, of course, protect our groundwater throughout Europe, so that we do not end up in future turning our own tap off and sentencing future generations to a similar fate.
Although the quantity of water in the world remains unchanged, the quality of groundwater is impaired by pollution from agriculture, building work, landfill sites, residual contamination and increased traffic.
It follows that it makes a great deal of sense to lay down uniform standards and measuring procedures for groundwater quality throughout the EU, and, inadequate though this report is in my view, it is for that reason that I, too, will be voting in favour of it.
As the report itself observes, impurities can become apparent as long as decades later, and so it is absolutely vital to handle these living resources with care.
The increased value attached to organic agriculture as a consequence of the reform of the CAP was a step in the right direction, but if we promote such things as transport or trans-European convoys or the intensive use of insecticides in the cultivation of maize or tobacco, for example, we are also making it more likely that groundwater will be polluted.
In the light of this, we should therefore take a critical and penetrating look at our support schemes.
For me, as a Member from Austria, a country with large reserves of drinking water, which are vital and precious to us, careful handling of water, particularly of groundwater, throughout Europe is important.
If we do not, it is inevitable that many more people will be casting covetous eyes in the direction of our water, and that is something we want to avoid.
Â Â  Mr President, the first thing I would like to say is that the problem that has arisen in relation to speakers is solely and entirely due to an error within my groupâs whip services, and it is therefore their responsibility to explain the situation to the Members affected.
Turning to this report by Mrs KlaÃ, I would like to point out that farmers will probably be the sector most affected by the Directive on the protection of groundwater that we are discussing, and that, despite this, their opinion has not been taken into account when producing the draft we have on the table.
In many European regions, agriculture guarantees the existence of plant mass that prevents the desertification of the land, a phenomenon that leads to a significant increase in the natural pollutants in groundwater.
The drastic reduction in this agricultural activity, which some people apparently want to see, would therefore run counter to the very objectives of the Directive that we are debating today.
Secondly, I would like to express my disappointment at the lack of interest shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in the amendments presented by this Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in particular those that call for âquantity of waterâ to be taken into account when establishing the factors that contribute to the pollution of groundwater.
The smaller aquifers, such as those often found in many southern regions of Europe, particularly during dry seasons, reach higher salinity levels and hence greater concentrations of sulphate; I would insist that this salinity is closely related to volumes of water, and this has not been taken into account in the report we are dealing with.
I also reject the establishment of Community standards to replace national thresholds with quality standards, since that would introduce a static element which is incompatible with the diversity of soils and waters in many European regions.
Furthermore, the farmers will be the main victims of these measures, because the tolerance levels of certain substances, in particular sulphates, which are generated by nature itself in many areas, depend on the characteristics of soils and crops, and there are examples of crops, such as rice, which endure higher levels of sulphates than other plant species.
Therefore, to establish Community standards for this type of substance, which at no point endangers the health of consumers, could lead to unjustified halts in irrigation.
Â Â  Mr President, groundwater is a priceless natural resource, not a national resource, and it should be treated as a resource without which humanity cannot survive.
Consequently we have no right to compromise on the quality of water or to cut deals here on the quality of water.
We must err on the side of precaution, not on the side of cost.
I have no confidence at all that Member States will maintain or indeed establish adequate standards.
They have failed to do so up to now.
They have allowed thousands of illegal dumps right across Europe, including in Ireland.
Ireland has not yet implemented the 1992 Nitrates Directive.
Thirteen years later it still has not implemented that directive, not because it is not necessary â it is absolutely necessary in Ireland â but because it is afraid of the Irish Farmers Association.
I want to conclude by saying that we must not only set stringent standards, we must set strict and severe penalties for those Member States which fail to meet those standards and we should not hide behind the principle of subsidiarity, which is simply escaping from our responsibilities.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, groundwater can be polluted in a great many ways and the man in the street is unaware of most of them, hence the importance of measures concerning education and prevention.
Schools need to be targeted, and also the main users of water, who are intent on poisoning the environment as if they themselves were immortal.
It is crucially important for the Cohesion Fund to remain at the level initially proposed by the European Commission, as it is supporting the enormous task of protecting the waters of the new EU Member States.
We should not skimp on building infrastructure, sewage systems and treatment plants, because this is the only way of evening out the enormous differences between the various countries.
The natural environment of Central and Eastern Europe was abused by heavy industry working to meet the demand for armaments.
It is vital that the Member States meet the deadline for submitting data concerning the condition of groundwater, as such an overview is essential for precise and efficient monitoring in the future.
Parliament has raised the issue of the quantitative status of groundwater.
The draft directive sets out to deal exclusively with the chemical condition of water, with reference to ArticleÂ 17 of the Water Framework Directive, so this is not the right time to introduce provisions concerning the quantitative status of water into the draft.
AmendmentÂ 7 and AmendmentÂ 10 should therefore be rejected.
AmendmentÂ 54 concerns new provisions for the protection of spas and medicinal water sources.
It should be supported, as to date EU legislation has not dealt with the protection of these special high-quality waters.
Provision does need to be made for them, and I would ask the Commissioner and the European Commission as a whole to pay particular attention to this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, the proposed directive is intended to ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and evaluated across Europe in a harmonised way.
The proposed approach to establishing quality criteria is both flexible and iterative, taking account of local characteristics and allowing further improvements.
This directive responds directly to Article 17 of the 2000 Water Framework Directive, and we have been waiting for it for some time.
The approach of the Commission is to establish groundwater quality standards at EU level for nitrates and pesticides â on which many colleagues have commented â and to allow Member States themselves to establish threshold values for a range of other substances such as arsenic and cadmium, a minimum list of which is set out in the directive.
I agree with that approach, as there is no need for any further harmonisation across Europe.
We must respect differences in climate and soil type.
I shall go one step further.
Eventually that approach, which allows Member States to decide on the basis of river-basin management plans â which under the Framework Directive will eventually manage all freshwater sources once they are put in place â will also allow Member States to manage their nitrate and pesticide pollutants.
We should eventually take this approach to everything.
The Nitrates Directive has been mentioned.
Farmers also need and want clean water.
Nobody can be allowed to pollute our groundwater or freshwater with nitrates or anything else.
However, a one-size-fits-all policy has proved extremely difficult, as colleagues have said, with 12 out of 15 of the older Member States currently in court for non-transposition or improper transposition of the Nitrates Directive.
It was never a comfortable directive.
It never fitted properly, because we did not respect the differences in Member States and we did not trust Member States to monitor their own pollution in that area.
I wish to ask Commissioner Dimas specifically why he continues to allow the Irish Government to add a pollutant, fluoride, to our public drinking water supply.
I know it is not directly an issue for the Commission, but how can we stand up here and wax eloquent about water safety and about water being essential for life â on which we all agree â if we continue to allow a Member State to pollute the public water supply with fluoride?
I ask the Commissioner to do something about that urgently or all this legislation â framework directives, water directives and so on â will come to nought.
Â Â  Mr President, just a few days after April 22, Earth Day, it is perhaps no exaggeration to claim that water, which covers most of our planet, and is the largest component of all living organisms, and which can also be found in solid form in the polar regions and in gaseous form in air, is the most important component of our life and our greatest resource.
This directive is aimed at protecting one of the most important treasuries of this resource, groundwater, and although we have a common goal, our solutions differ.
It is my belief that norms need to be established at a Community level, as the good quality of continuous bodies of water, that reach beyond state borders, can only be guaranteed if neighbouring countries are all bound by strict provisions.
Of course, when we talk of qualitative norms, the different natural characteristics of the soil and bodies of water must be taken into consideration.
Naturally occurring substances in water must be examined when setting limit values; the high arsenic content of groundwater in the Southern Plains region in Hungary is a good example.
The proposal for a directive continues to prohibit direct discharge of pollutants into groundwater.
In the case of permitting indirect discharge, I find it crucial that the presence of other pollutants encumbering the given environment is taken into consideration.
I was glad to find that my relevant proposal for amendment was welcomed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Another valuable part of the report is that it promotes the definition of protection areas for aquifers which supply medicinal water sources.
In order to improve the quality of groundwater, current agricultural practice must be changed, contamination from disused waste disposal plants, for instance, must be dealt with, and action plans and resources are needed.
Let us clearly define now how vital these issues are so that Member States will take this important environmental task seriously.
Finally, let me congratulate Commissioner KlaÃ on this excellent report on the proposal for a directive, that after its adoption, will play a crucial part in the protection of groundwater after 2003.
Â Â  Mr President, everyone agrees with the objectives of this proposed directive.
Differences exist as to how we are going to achieve those objectives: the optimist in me says we are almost halfway there.
Groundwater is a major national resource.
In Ireland groundwater and aquifers provide one quarter of our drinking water.
Monitoring of Irish groundwater by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that there is no widespread contamination of individual aquifers.
Most samples taken by the agency reflected unpolluted conditions.
This is as it should be and it is good news, but we need vigilance.
We need uniform measurement techniques across the EU, but we do not need common threshold values other than for nitrates and pesticides.
Soil and subsoil types are important considerations in characterising the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination.
These vary considerably throughout the Union.
Equally, however, allowing for different threshold values in Member States to take account of these local natural conditions must not lead to unacceptable differences in the protection level or distortions in competition and trade.
As we have already heard, experience with the Nitrates Directive has not been good and it should guide us in how we frame the groundwater directive.
The Nitrates Directive fails to take account of climate or soil conditions in Member States.
It prescribes a very rigid regime of farming by dates: not exactly as nature intended.
It may well do more harm than good.
The debacle over nitrates does little to endear the Commission to EU citizens.
A similar fate must not befall the groundwater directive.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to add my thanks to the rapporteur for her commitment.
Good though it was that she should be so committed from the start, the report now produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety appears to tend towards tightening up the Commissionâs original proposal; Amendments 43, 103 and 94 to it certainly do.
I wonder how Parliament intends to deal with those.
Acceptance of those amendments will once again result in an increase in the burden and cost, particularly for European agriculture and horticulture â two areas that are self-evidently bound to benefit from clean water.
Although the proposal, fortunately, also leaves sufficient room for subsidiarity, it cannot be denied that when the budget for European agricultural policy is reduced and the markets become more deregulated, it will drive up still more the cost price for European agriculture and horticulture.
It is unacceptable that this House should on the one hand increase the burden and on the other hand deregulate the markets even further, it thereby puts the European countryside in an impossible position.
I would like to urge this House in any event not to make the Commission proposal any more stringent, and certainly to vote against Amendments 43 and 94.
I should also like to back Mrs Oomen-Ruijtenâs Amendment 110, which would make the groundwater directive considerably more workable with regard to river policy in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I, too would like to join in thanking our rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, who was very cooperative in drafting this report.
One of Europeâs greatest treasures flows in our innumerable springs, streams and rivers, and so it is our responsibility to protect our water resources.
It is for that reason that the protection of groundwater must be among the Communityâs foremost environmental priorities.
We also have to bear in mind the fact that it is much harder to remove impurities from polluted groundwater than from surface waters.
It is also often used to provide drinking water, and, if it is polluted, those pollutants can be a hazard to human health, which will in turn impose a burden on our healthcare systems.
By adopting the Water Framework Directive, we agreed that Europeâs waters should be of good chemical status by 2015.
These daughter directives which we are now to adopt must lay down procedures and parameters whereby this high quality standard may prevail throughout the Community.
Amendments 111 and 112 are intended to enact annexes stipulating the level of these parameters.
Were we not to lay down such values, this Water Framework Directive would be toothless and hard to apply.
We are not, however, trying to apply the same standards to everything in the Community, but rather to ensure a high standard of quality in groundwater for the good of the public, while very definitely taking account of local and regional differences, particularly geological conditions.
It is for that reason that we have tabled Amendment 91, which takes account of differing conditions throughout Europe.
What we need, though, is precise procedures and not the vague approaches that the Commission has proposed, if we are to be able to lay down these parameters.
I therefore reject the Commissionâs proposals for this.
As for the demand for the revision and possible suspension of the Nitrates Directive, which is what is sought via Amendments 108 and 109, I am opposed to this principally on legal grounds.
What agriculture throughout Europe needs is not distorted competition, but a level playing field.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission believes that, given the current lack of knowledge about the environmental quality of groundwater and the huge variety of natural conditions which exist in Europe, it is not technically feasible, nor is it desirable to introduce on this basis new standards for a more comprehensive list of substances at the level of the European Union.
That is why the Commission proposed a small number of quality standards at European Union level and took care to ensure that the Member States would adopt appropriate threshold values for other dangerous substances which are considered to be a risk to groundwater.
The term 'threshold value' was used purely and simply to distinguish the national standards in question from the standards at European Union level.
Nonetheless, we accept that the adoption of the term 'threshold values' may cause confusion.
That is why we are prepared to accept in principle Amendments 17 and 57 and the related Amendments 30, 31 34, 69, 70 and 71.
Using the term 'groundwater quality standards' throughout the text clarifies at the same time that, for certain substances, the quality standards in question will be adopted at European Union level and that, for other substances, the standards in question will be adopted by the Member States.
The Commission likewise welcomes Amendment 65, which calls for the adoption of a common methodology in the proposal, so that groundwater quality standards are adopted on the basis of common criteria.
As far as the compliance procedure is concerned, the Commission is in a position to agree in principle with Amendments 28, 29 and 58, in order to allow some degree of flexibility when the good chemical status of groundwater is defined.
However, greater flexibility cannot mean compromise as far as environmental targets are concerned, and the text must be absolutely clear on this point.
Amendments 1 and 2 propose that it should be clarified that the directive concerns the protection of groundwater against chemical pollution and deterioration, a proposal which we can support.
Nonetheless, the references to parameters relating to drinking water, as defined in Amendments 3 and 4, would appear to be off the mark, given that the proposal focuses on environmental targets relating to groundwater, while the measures for drinking water are satisfactorily covered by ArticleÂ 7 of the Water Framework Directive.
As regards Amendment 94, which numerous speakers referred to today, I should like to clarify that the Commission cannot accept it.
The proposed changes may cause confusion and water down the arrangements which already exist in the Water Framework Directive.
Similarly, I am not in a position to accept amendments touching on matters which are already covered by the Water Framework Directive.
This applies to Amendments 7, 10 and 15 relating to the quantitative aspects of groundwater management, Amendment 16 referring to the characterisation of groundwater and Amendment 52 referring to the 'polluter pays' principle.
Amendments 21 and 22, relating to the new definitions of deterioration and background concentration, are acceptable to the Commission.
However, acceptance of Amendments 23 and 49, which propose a new definition and separate system for historical contaminated sites, cannot be supported, given that management of the sites in question does not come within the scope of the present proposal.
As far as monitoring is concerned, the Commission agrees with Amendments 14, 41 and 43 on the need to tighten up demands in relation to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive relating to the harmonisation of measurement methods and the compatibility and pertinence of the related data.
As regards preventing and limiting discharges to groundwater, the Commission is in a position to accept in principle the majority of the clarifications proposed in Amendments 19, 20, 43 and 48.
As regards determining and reversing trends in the quality of groundwater, the Commission agrees with Amendment 37 on the attention which needs to be given to increases in concentrations as a result of human activity.
Other amendments, including Amendments 38 and 39, concerning the reference to baseline concentrations and the special assessment of trends in relation to point sources of pollution, are accepted by the Commission.
Finally, Amendments 74, 75 and 79 concerning technical specifications are acceptable to the Commission, whereas others, such as Amendments 76 to 78 and 83 to 85, are acceptable in principle but require further clarification.
Amendments 108 and 109 on the possible review and repeal of the directive on nitrates cannot be accepted by the Commission.
The directive on nitrates has helped to reduce pollution from farming and will continue to help in future.
The Water Framework Directive, the directive on nitrates and the present proposal for a directive on groundwater are complementary and mutually supportive.
In reply to the question asked, I wish to emphasise that the directive on nitrates only covers zones which are sensitive to nitrates, while the directive on groundwater will apply to the whole of Europe.
Amendments 111 and 112 are not accepted by the Commission, because they introduce standards at European level for various pollutants, which the Commission believes should be left, for the time being, to the Member States.
To close, I should like to emphasise that many of the amendments are useful in clarifying the proposal and improve how it stands in relation to the Water Framework Directive and the previous directive on groundwater.
I am pleased to say that the Commission is in a position to accept 31 amendments in full and a further 44 amendments in principle or in part.
Nonetheless, 48 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission.
I am giving the Bureau a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments(1).
Finally, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur for her efforts.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle Amendments 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 97, 103, 106, 113.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 16, 18, 21, 23, 27, 40, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 62, 80, 88, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0068/2005) by MrsÂ Handzlik, on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the internal market in the new Member States: situation, opportunities and lessons to be learnt.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking all those whose valuable remarks helped to improve the quality of my report.
Ladies and gentlemen, your interest in this issue, which has been apparent from the amendments you have tabled and the numerous debates and conversations that have taken place, has made it clear that the subject of my report is of great importance to many of you.
It is worth mentioning that this report did not simply involve data collection and the analysis of statistics; it also drew on my personal experience.
I have managed medium-sized enterprises for the last 15Â years, and learnt at grass roots level what conditions are required for the sustainable growth and development of such enterprises.
The internal market must become a single economic entity and a driving force for the economy, and this will only happen when all the Member States fully implement the directives concerning the internal market and all the others aimed at improving its operation.
A situation in which certain countries move forward by transposing and implementing directives, whilst others drag their feet, is simply unacceptable.
The success of the internal market is closely bound up with cooperation between countries, and a concerted effort is the only way of achieving the results we all long for.
With this in mind, the European Council suggested a 1.5% limit for the transposition deficit of directives to apply to all Member States.
Research contained in the report concerning transposition of the directives by individual Member States, and in particular by the new ones, is surprisingly encouraging.
At the beginning of NovemberÂ 2004, the lowest deficit concerning transposition of directives was 2.1%.
