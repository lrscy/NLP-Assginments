As Mr Howitt has just said, it was very much a look back at the past and a debate about future partnership agreements.
But the real benefit of visiting these developing countries is not just the Assembly, it is speaking to people involved in development work there and speaking to those who are helped because we in Europe give that development aid.
At the Assembly in Brussels we took the first steps towards realigning the Assembly to fit the Cotonou Agreement.
As co-president I am determined we will have a workshop and not a talking-shop from now on.
We have built many of Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez's ideas into the new rules.
We are now a parliamentary assembly.
We can involve civil society - this is desperately important.
I want to see standing committees that do real work rather than the workshops that we have.
I want to see a real North-South partnership leading to poverty eradication and I want to see the assembly take a leading role in conflict prevention and conflict resolution.
Mr President, let me take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent and innovative report and to congratulate the Joint Parliamentary Assembly for its hard work in the year 2000.
I am pleased to confirm that I will be attending the meeting of the Assembly in Gabon next week.
This evening I will be driving back to Brussels and flying out tomorrow morning to learn about our host country and do some political work there.
I look forward to a frank and open exchange of views with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and I agree with the rapporteur that this exchange of views should be more than just rhetoric.
I also think that the efforts of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in these last few years have been aimed at that.
2000 was a significant year in many ways, not least because with the signing of the Cotonou Agreement in June we entered an exciting new phase of partnership with the ACP states, one that will last for the next twenty years.
It is therefore fitting that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should begin to reflect on how it will adapt to the changes introduced by the next agreement, particularly in promoting increased dialogue with our development partners on such topics as peace-keeping and good governance.
We are raising the level of ambition in the new Cotonou Agreement and everybody is looking at this with great excitement.
The rapporteur suggests that in this new context the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is now ready to take its place as a true parliamentary authority and welcomes the changes introduced by the Cotonou Agreement to strengthen the Assembly.
The Commission clearly supports the Assembly's wish to take on a more politically ambitious role.
This is very much in line with what we would like the Cotonou Agreement to contribute generally in North-South relations and giving that a parliamentary accent is also very desirable.
I fully agree with the rapporteur on the role that political dialogue can play in the ACP regions and countries, which can often be characterised by a climate of instability.
It is therefore important to take advantage of the possibilities for peaceful and constructive exchanges of views as part of a process of dialogue within ACP regions and countries involving government and civil society.
The report also contains many other useful suggestions that can only make the Assembly's work more interesting and efficient and the Commission awaits with anticipation the implementation of these changes.
This is a meaningful and necessary meeting-place between North and South in the world.
As Europeans we can be proud that we are able to play this role.
I am looking forward to the cooperation within this framework.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Life assurance
The next item is the report (A5-0072/2001) by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive concerning life assurance [COM(2000) 398 - C5-0351/2000 - 2000/0162(COD)].
Mr President, on behalf of Lord Inglewood I should like to say that he is extremely sorry not to be here, but he is unavoidably detained in the UK for family and business reasons.
This report, which I am pleased to present on his behalf and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is an important part of the Legal Affairs Committee's remit on behalf of Parliament to encourage simplification and good-quality drafting of Community legislative instruments.
In this particular case, quite a lot of important work has been done by the Commission in incorporating and simplifying three texts related to life insurance.
The source text dates as far back as 1979 and, apart from the codification process of incorporating amendments that have been made over that period into the legislative text, the reason for this more substantive report is that the Commission has found it necessary to propose a number of amendments to reflect changes that have taken place in the market since that time and to improve the overall quality and integrity of the text.
I do not need to detain the House with a lot of the technical details relating to those texts.
Those of you that are experts on the subject will clearly want to refer to the Commission's own text and the Commission has provided an extremely helpful and clear explanatory statement for those of us who are not, unlike Lord Inglewood, distinguished lawyers - which is why he has been able to make such a good job of scrutinising this text on behalf of Parliament.
In view of the work that has been done, our job here is just to ensure that there are no political issues arising out of what is largely a set of technical amendments.
Lord Inglewood has taken soundings of the industry.
He has looked particularly at the texts of the six amendments, to make sure that they do not introduce any principles outside the directives' original political remit and he is satisfied in this case.
Therefore, so far as his report is concerned, he is pleased to recommend adoption of the Commission proposal to the House without any further amendments.
By way of general conclusion, we in the Legal Affairs Committee regard the quality of drafting and simplification of legislation as an important remit.
It is worthwhile reminding colleagues throughout the House who are working on legal texts that this is a principle that we all need to bear in mind when we are amending legislative texts of any kind.
When we see and look at work in other committees it is not entirely clear that colleagues bear simplification in mind.
In many cases we see far too many complicated texts coming out of work done by this House.
It is an important principle - maybe this is an uncontroversial issue but the principle of the quality and clarity of legislative instruments is important.
I commend this report as a good example of that process.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make two comments on the Inglewood report.
Firstly, I welcome the Commission' s basic principle that legislation that has already been amended several times and no longer gives a clear and coherent picture should have to be codified.
In connection with my recently completed report on the pension funds directive, I also believe that simplification and consolidation of the life assurance directives is urgently required, because that will create clearer distinctions between the different activities and pillars.
It is possible that when the pensions fund directive is accepted, insurance companies that are active in the third pillar and therefore also subject to the life assurance directives will in future be subject to the pension funds directive for their company pensions business.
Since this likelihood will exist, it is important that what we are doing should be as clear, simple and transparent as possible.
The Inglewood report and the simplification and transparency it initiates are therefore a welcome contribution to making things easier for the citizen to understand and therefore a contribution to a living internal market.
On behalf of the European Parliament I would like to welcome to the official gallery the European Affairs Committee of the Nordic Council, led by its Vice-President, Mr Ãysten Djupedal.
We are delighted to welcome these fellow parliamentarians who represent the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.
We hope that your visit to the European Parliament will be both enjoyable and fruitful and we look forward to seeing you again soon.
(Loud applause)
The proposal for a directive recasting the three generations of life insurance directives is a response to pressure from Parliament, Council, industry and consumers, in fact anyone who has to deal day-to-day with the complexities of the Community insurance legislation.
Your objective is to facilitate the comprehension and application of the insurance directives by setting them out in a legal text that is clear, coherent and complete.
Mr Karas has just asked for texts to be as clear and transparent as possible and that was the Commission's aim in the text which is in front of you.
In addition to the codification of the provisions, some minor amendments which do not affect the substance of the texts were considered to be necessary.
The exercise has gone beyond a pure codification and that is why this is a 'recast' version.
A purely recodified text would have included a considerable number of repetitions, inconsistencies and obsolete provisions.
I intend shortly to present to the Commission and, if the Commission agrees, to Parliament, a parallel proposal for a recast - again recast - version of the non-life insurance directives.
Clearly the Community's insurance legislation is not going to be stopped because of the codification exercise.
New proposals are being discussed which, once they have been adopted, will require new amendments to the recast directives.
We cannot stop the legislation tree growing but we can prune and train it so that it does not become an overgrown tangle as it has been in the past.
I am extremely grateful to Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and particularly to the rapporteur, Lord Inglewood, here represented by Mr Harbour, for their efficient handling of this matter.
Mr Harbour also just said that this is a good model for other legislation and I entirely agree with him.
It is an example of efficiency which Parliament may well want to adopt in other instances as well.
They have appreciated the fact that, although the proposal exceeds the limits of pure codification, it does not really contain any legislative change.
It therefore calls for more expeditious consideration than a normal legislative proposal and that is what has happened.
They have recommended to Members of Parliament that you should approve this proposal without any amendment and I invite Parliament to follow the recommendation of the rapporteur and approve the proposal without amendments.
The Commission hopes a directive will soon be adopted, if possible with only one reading by this Parliament.
That would be a very good example of a fast-track procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken today at noon.
Water management
The next item is the following oral questions to the Commission:
B5-0015/2001 by Mr de Roo and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
B5-0020/2001 by Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mr Moreira Da Silvara, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group,
B5-0153/2001 by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the ELDR Group,
B5-0154/2001 by Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group,
on water management in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have an excellent framework directive on water, stipulating that water management should be conducted in terms of individual river basins.
This sound ecological principle is enshrined in European law.
The Spanish government tried in vain to block this framework directive on water because of its National Hydrological Plan.
This megalomaniac and wrong-headed plan of the Aznar government aims to pipe water from the River Ebro over 900 kilometres down the coast to Southern Spain.
The cost will be in excess of EUR 18 billion between now and 2008.
The Aznar government wants Europe to give an annual subsidy of EUR 1 billion.
This injudicious plan contravenes both the spirit and the letter of the framework directive on water.
It contravenes the habitat directive on 82 counts and the birds directive on 108 counts.
Of course the Aznar government will label this plan a national economic priority, but it will also have to prove to the European Commission that there are no alternatives.
However, there are alternatives!
Desalination of brackish and salt water will be 50% cheaper for Central and Southern Spain than the Aznar plan, and apart from that is much more flexible, small-scale, and demand-oriented.
Another method would be to introduce cost-covering prices for water and to irrigate plants individually rather than submerging the fields and allowing between 90% and 95% of the precious water to evaporate.
Israel provides a good example of this.
This is why the European Commission should reject the Aznar plan and stop the flow of EU funds into it.
This Aznar plan is 200 times worse than the plan for an industrial estate between Aachen and Heerlen.
On the German-Dutch border the European Commission has rightly cut off the flow of EU funds because of the threat to the hamster population.
Surely it cannot be that the European Commission as the Guardian of the Treaties is operating a double standard?
Is the Commission aware that the Aznar government asked 83 Spanish scientists to carry out studies into this injudicious water plan and that that same government is now refusing to publish results it deems unfavourable?
Does the Commission approve of 60 villages in Spain being wiped off the map?
Does the European Commission find it acceptable that a landslide could dislocate the operation of the Itoiz dam and threaten the AscÃ³ nuclear power station?
Mr President, we are not here to criticise a particular country or a particular government.
I think that we are here to try to provide some answers and, more importantly, to be able to discuss with the Commission a particularly important subject, which is the uneven distribution of water resources on European territory, which is related to variations in geographical, geological and climatic conditions, but which also results from human activity such as urbanisation, deforestation and pollution.
With regard to uneven distribution, it is logical to consider the possibility of carrying out water transfers in some regions.
It is unacceptable to let some areas run dry, when other areas have adequate resources to help them.
The European Parliament mentioned this idea in January 1998 in its resolution on the technological feasibility of trans-European hydraulic networks.
My fellow Members in the European Parliament and I believed, quite rightly in my view, that trans-European hydraulic networks, which would carry out large scale inter basin water transfers, could perhaps be an appropriate solution, enabling water resources to be shared within the European Union.
In addition, however, and it is important to stress this, it is obviously completely out of the question to take over a Member State' s water resources unless that Member State gives its express consent.
Almost three years after the vote on this resolution, questions are still being asked.
Basically, the European Union has no experience at all in establishing such networks.
In order to bridge this gap, prospective studies should be carried out on the feasibility of this work, as well as an analysis of the physical impact that this type of trans-European hydraulic network would have on aquatic environments and other areas protected under Community legislation.
To this day, information on possible conclusions of these studies has not been passed on to us.
I find this deplorable, and I do not know if the Commission will have anything to tell us today about this matter.
It is also important to bear in mind the irreversible nature of any projects that might be undertaken.
It is hard to imagine these facilities being challenged in the short or medium term.
It is, therefore, essential to investigate every possible way of improving existing structures and, wherever possible, to apply the principle that it is advisable, first and foremost, to optimise our water management, rather than to invest money.
It is, therefore, important, in the long term, to establish a system in which responsibility is assigned for the quantity and quality of the water transferred, if there is a need for it to be transferred, and to establish a process to monitor this.
Lastly, and I am in agreement with my fellow Member on this particular point, we have the framework directive on water, which has come into force.
We must ensure that it is implemented correctly in national law and that it is respected in the potential and more technical context of water transfers being carried out between Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although officially this debate came about as a result of the recent floods in various Member States of the European Union, it has quickly moved towards a debate on Parliament' s support for the Spanish Government' s plan to make a series of major changes to the water management system in Spain, which we know as the national water plan.
As spokesperson for Convergencia DemocrÃ¡tica de CataluÃ±a in the European Parliament, I would like to express that my party, and also the Catalan Government, of which we are a part along with UniÃ³ DemocrÃ tica de Catalunya, do not agree with the proposals from the Spanish laid down in the aforementioned plan.
In the case that most directly affects Catalonia, we suggest an alternative based on transferring one fifth of the volume of water proposed by the Spanish (specifically from the river Ebro, which has been mentioned here) the use of desalination plants (which have also been suggested here as a valid alternative), better use of what is available in the current channels and finally, transfer from the RÃ³dano.
And this is where this plan enters into a European dimension.
We have been saying for years that one of the most serious problems that the most-developed societies, such as European societies, have to solve, in the medium and long term, is the shortage of water caused by the development of our urban centres and the locations of our new economic activities, which requires a new type of water management.
We cannot escape from this reality and we also need to consider it from a European perspective, because the situation demands it.
We do not understand the resistance against limiting transfers between basins, while maintaining State borders.
In the case of Spain, there is complete opposition from the Spanish to this possibility, but it is, however, accepted for Portugal.
We therefore stress that water management needs to have a European perspective, that transfers from basins irrespective of the borders between the Member States need to be considered because, among other things, the aim of the European Union is a Europe without borders.
Mr President, I am going to take the liberty of reading a few paragraphs from a communication from the European Commission relating to the discussion that is going to take place in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy:
'Much of the policies, legislation and standards needed to achieve our objectives for water quality and use have already been put in place.
The main challenge is ensuring the full and proper implementation of the existing legislation and achieving the integration of the Community' s water quality objectives into the other sectoral policies such as agriculture, industry and regional policy...
Member States also need to take steps to ensure that they are integrated into local planning and land-use decisions... national, regional and local authorities need, amongst other things, to introduce measures to improve the efficiency of water use and to encourage changes in agricultural practices necessary to protect water resources and quality.'
It goes on to cover some aspects of saving water, efficient use of water, land-use planning and other aspects. It is true that this debate has arisen here because there have been a great number of floods in Europe that are probably the result of bad water management, but it is also true that currently the biggest plan proposed in Europe for radical change in water management is in our country.
We are focusing on saving water, efficiency, different agricultural practices and land-use, which is what the forthcoming Spanish water plan should be.
We are very concerned, Commissioner, that directives such as the framework directive on water, the habitat directive, the directive on environmental impact assessment and the birds directive can be violated.
These four directives are now the backbone of the forthcoming sixth environment action programme.
If they were violated, the European Commission would be helping to make it impossible for the sixth plan to be implemented.
Mr President, the water framework directive will protect all our waters and improve the quality of the environment, for example through environmental quality standards, mandatory participation by civil society and tackling pollution at source.
It applies the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle.
The directive does not prohibit water transfers per se.
However it imposes a binding legal requirement that they should not harm the environment.
It seems particularly important in this context that since the directive entered into force on 22 December 2000 a strict non-deterioration clause has applied, which should prevent a repetition of past errors.
The possibilities for derogation are restricted and subject to mandatory conditions.
The directive points out the importance of integrating the protection and sustainable management of water into other Community policy areas.
When a Natura 2000 may be affected, the normal procedure as provided for in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive should be applied in sequence: a search for alternative solutions, assessment of the overriding public interest and as a last resort, compensatory measures.
Mr President, may I introduce a further thought?
The water framework directive will bring radical changes to Europe' s water industry.
But the directive is also an opportunity for a thorough rethink of our various national water industries and water legislation and for opening up new fields of business for national suppliers and undertakings.
Water offers industry tremendous opportunities to create more value added for all by opening up the markets.
Increased efficiency through new forms of cooperation between private industry and municipal suppliers in the planning, construction and operation of plants is the first essential step in that direction.
A second step must then be to increase value added through exports.
Know-how in particular, where some Member States already have a number of strong undertakings, offers the opportunity of increasing exports by paying more attention to canvassing foreign markets - but obviously exporting only to an ecologically acceptable extent.
Everyone would gain from that.
Municipalities and consumers would save on costs.
Producers would find new markets.
I believe everyone would gain from exporting water in the same way as other countries export their gold in the form of oil; we in Austria, for example, have white liquid gold in the form of water.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that this House has had another opportunity to talk about the Spanish water plan and about Community legislation, and I say another opportunity because, as you will recall, a total of three oral questions have now been put in my name on this issue, but I also regret that in the end the initial question agreed with the Verts/ALE and GUE/NGL groups was not included on the agenda in its original form, and was replaced by these individual questions.
Returning to the content of the previous answers from Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, I must point out to Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen that I am surprised at the sudden change of position that there appears to be between the Commission' s reply to us and what the honourable Member says she was told.
I would like to ask Mr Liikanen to clarify this on behalf of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen said, as was reported by various Spanish media, that the Commission had answered to her that the Spanish plan did not violate Community legislation.
I must ask you, honourable Member, not to distort the Commission' s position.
What Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has been saying is that the Commission has not made any statement on whether or not the Spanish national water plan violates Community legislation because it considers it to still be a draft and that it cannot therefore make a decision, as it does not have all the necessary information to rule on this.
I ask you please, Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen, not to say something that is not true.
However, regardless of whether or not the Spanish national water plan, as it stands, violates Community legislation, we are going to take a brief look at it, not only because of the effects of the planned work on LIFE areas, on fauna and flora (and I thank the GUE/NGL group for picking up this issue from my previous questions) but also because of many other aspects that can be seen.
Would you like an example?
The framework directive says that no movement of water can take place unless there has been a rigorous prior assessment of the need for it and unless all the possible alternatives have been exhausted.
Yesterday in Spain we found out that the government is now considering reducing the transfer from the Ebro by half through measures such as saving water in agriculture and re-using it.
We strongly doubt that this reduction is a counter-proposal.
It seems more like an alteration of concessions in order to ultimately distribute the same volume of water. However, whatever the case, it goes without saying that measures such as saving and re-using water are considered to be fundamental in the alternative plan put forward by our party the Partido Socialista.
If the transfer could supposedly have been done from the start with the same amount of water that is now being proposed - i.e. half the amount - does this not show that the government did not look into all the socio-economic implications, the alternatives and the availability of the resource in detail before its proposal?
Meanwhile, you are aware that the framework directive says that participation from citizens is very important and, so far, associations such as ADENA, Ecologistas en AcciÃ³n or groups of experts have not received an official response to their very well-documented allegations.
Let us also talk about the deterioration of water, which is dealt with in Articles 1 and 4 of the framework directive.
These articles establish the objective that the current state of water should not deteriorate, and it also says that this should be complied with from the entry into force of the directive, i.e. 22 December 2000.
This implies that the current Spanish national water plan is not compatible with the framework directive because, as the work involved is planned, there will undoubtedly be serious changes to ecosystems and to the quality of the water.
Finally, allow me to briefly explain the Group of the Party of European Socialists views water management.
We believe that water is a common resource and therefore something that is governed more by solidarity than by market forces.
Any water plan should be more than a series of infrastructures and transfers.
Transferring water should be the last resort, to be done only when all possible alternatives have been exhausted and when it has been proven that it does not damage the environment.
Any water management measure should be accompanied by parallel plans on irrigation and forest resources, and taking into account climate change.
I am aware that there is a great deal more that I could say, but I can assure you that what Mrs WallstrÃ¶m did say in the February part-session is that the European Union will never fund, and will never agree with, any plan that does not respect the environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, debates that should really be technical are often political, such as the one that brings us here today: water management and water plans, which are necessary to support and develop our communities, but not at any price.
Plans cannot be established by law behind citizens' backs and without taking into account their opinions, the opinion of social agents and of the scientific community, the territories affected, through development considerations, which focus more on concrete than on where to get water from and actually assessing who needs it and why.
As Andalusians, from one of the driest areas in the European Union, with very considerable water requirements, due to the two main economic activities, agriculture and tourism, and with absolutely unpredictable weather, we are concerned about the efficiency of the project, the cost/benefit relationship, the real possibility of these projects supporting the area and not causing conflict between communities.
Our hydrological plan would always start with the word 'save' , and the last words would be 'transfer' and 'desalination' .
Ladies and gentlemen, the best reservoir is saving.
Our duty is to ask for water, but also to demand that efforts first be made to make the best possible use of the existing resources, valuing this scarce resource as it should be valued, improving irrigation in agriculture, investing in optimising the efficiency of distribution networks - which are in many cases obsolete and have major leaks - regaining control of hydraulics and regenerating soil and vegetation.
Special attention needs to be paid to underground water, preventing it from being over-used, to sewage treatment and to the essential environmental impact studies, particularly in areas such as mine, where specially protected natural areas are a precious asset to be preserved.
These plans also need to be in line with the Community directives on water, Natura sites, habitat, birds, etc., in conjunction with the national irrigation plans that should be in accordance with the forthcoming review of the common agricultural policy and rural development in order to deepen essential sustainable development.
We have the opportunity to draw up a sustainable, innovative and model plan.
Let us do so.
Now, more than ever, we can' t please everyone.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating those who have formulated the oral question that has been tabled on its relevance, importance and timeliness.
Water is a product that is essential to life itself.
It is also a strategic factor for development and, as such, is an issue that concerns everyone, a point that has already been emphasised here and rightly so.
If we accept this view, then today we must develop a joint vision for the planning and management of shared rivers.
At European level and within the United Nations, the Helsinki Convention and, more specifically, its protocol on the protection and use of cross-border rivers and international lakes, represent a framework of international law that contains this vision and these new principles.
As is well known, Portugal has played an active role in the drafting of the directive on water management, in an attempt to ensure that priority was given to fundamental aspects concerning the protection and sustainable use of water, bearing in mind the climatic and geographic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula.
It should be understood that Portugal has indeed played this active role.
Portugal and Spain are in quite unequal positions, given that we are a downstream country, in other words, Portugal has no rivers that flow into Spain, but Spain does have rivers that flow into Portugal.
Furthermore, when managing their water resources, our neighbours may adopt measures that affect Portuguese interests, but there is nothing that we, on the other hand, can do in terms of our water resources that would directly affect Spanish interests.
The joint management of shared hydrological basins within the framework of international law imposed by the directive that I have already mentioned, is therefore a fundamental approach, which must govern the behaviour of those with political responsibility for this particular sector, both in bilateral negotiations and in a multilateral framework.
I feel that Spain' s new hydrological plan is a step in the right direction, since it has stopped decanting water, mainly from the Douro and Tagus rivers, which are shared between Portugal and Spain.
The directive in fact constitutes an extremely important protection network, since it adopts the coordination of the measures for hydrological basin management from the standpoint that these are not considered to be units defined by administrative or political borders.
With the aim of establishing an integrated water management system which will make the best use of the appropriate objectives for the specific conditions of the European Union' s regions, the regulations of the framework directive will facilitate the implementation, both now and in future, with the cooperation of national governments, of hydrological plans that take account of such important factors as water quality, the preservation of sufficient water flows, the climate and the protection of biodiversity and the environment.
Mr President, I think we are agreed that water will be a key issue in the European Union this century.
We can also be sure that we are far from paying the subject the attention it deserves.
Of course it would be an illusion to think we can solve water problems by pumping water from areas of supposed surplus to areas where there is a shortage.
If we are saying that parts of Europe sometimes have floods and that the water could perhaps be more fairly distributed, we must bear in mind that those floods are themselves the outcome of mistakes in water management.
It is high time far greater attention was paid to local and regional water management.
Water problems must, as a rule, be solved where they arise, and there they must be dealt with within an acceptable financial framework.
The neglect of one potential source of water has been criminal: the conversion of salt water into industrial and process water.
The prospects in this sector are tremendous.
Complete liberalisation of water will result in it being used by industry in a way that will bring enormous ecological problems in the long term.
We must stop that before it happens.
Mr President, I would first like to answer Mr de Roo, because it is the second time (the first time was in writing and the second was orally) that I have heard him make inaccurate statements about the position taken by the Spanish Members - without exception - and the Spanish Government regarding the framework directive.
Mr de Roo, about two months ago you said that the Spanish Government and the Spanish Members voted against the framework directive.
Either you were not at that vote or you did not realise that, without exception, we voted in favour of the framework directive.
I think that this is a framework directive that - and I agree with what has been said here by several speakers - is going to promote a new culture in terms of water in European countries, based on criteria of efficiency and quality of water resources.
No one can deny this, much less so the Partido Popular or the Spanish Government.
It seems to me, Mr de Roo, that your Group is particularly interested in the Spanish water plan.
You could have put the question more directly from the start.
First of all, I would like to know if you have read it.
Do you have precise knowledge of the Spanish water plan or are you echoing other people' s positions and a political opportunism that could of course be risky?
Secondly, I think that Mrs Sornosa should tell me where she has seen me saying that I said that the Spanish water plan might contradict the framework directive.
The water plan is currently an open draft, in the process of consultation with all the parties concerned, although none of them has wanted to make use of this facility.
It is therefore difficult for it to violate any directive, and therefore, any information either for or against this - such as some that has appeared in the press - is absolutely unwarranted.
This is what I interpreted from the Commission' s position and what I have maintained throughout.
I never said anything else, Mrs Sornosa.
There has also been talk in this debate about the matter of alternative plans and desalination plants.
Unfortunately, I cannot answer all of that in detail due to lack of time.
Mr President, I am sure the Spanish project is a highly emotive issue in Spain and I can understand that.
But it is first and foremost, of course, something that must be decided in Spain itself.
Taking a longer view, however, I have to say that the south' s water supply is our concern too.
A question as important as this cannot be left to the Spanish alone.
I can quite imagine that in 10 or 20 years' time we shall have to be dealing with very different projects about which we dare not even think today.
But there is something else I should like to mention briefly, that is the growing willingness to privatise the water industry.
People are thinking about it, and I expect the Commission is too. The Ministry of Economy in Berlin has now made a study of the pros and cons of these issues.
Personally, I would be very reluctant to privatise water.
I know that Great Britain already has experience of this, but it is at least a subject we should approach very cautiously.
It would raise problems with far-reaching constitutional consequences for our Member States.
To give just one small example, in Germany we have around 4 000 municipal water companies, in France 2 or 3 large companies.
When we go for privatisation, this means that the small undertakings are simply bought up. That cannot be what such liberalisation is all about.
It is something we surely do not want.
I do not want to go into any more detail now, I have no time to do so, but I believe it is a subject we shall have to deal with more closely in the months or years ahead.
Mr President, I just wish to clarify a couple of points.
The Spanish national water plan is a general policy document to be followed by a large number of detailed projects.
The national water plan is not comparable with a river basin plan under the water framework directive.
Such river basin plans require as their basis a thorough analysis of the environmental impact and economic aspects - a task to be completed under the water framework directive by the end of 2004.
At the same time, a strict deterioration clause applies; impacts and measures that cause deterioration of a water body are prohibited, unless the Member State invokes one of the limited derogation clauses, which in turn are subject to meeting a range of conditions, including the environmental impact and economic analysis mentioned.
Only on the basis of those facts will the Commission be able to fully assess whether the operational measures under the Spanish national water plan comply with the water framework directive and other directives, such as the bird protection or habitats directives.
The debate is closed.
Biotechnology industry
The next item is the report (A5-0080/2001) by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the future of the biotechnology industry (2000/2100(INI)).
Mr President, we live in exciting times.
In our own lifetimes there have been massive and amazing advances in science and technology.
New industries have appeared, become commonplace, and have provided a better quality of life, higher standards of living, new and better jobs and better working conditions.
For Europe to keep its position in the economic forefront globally and to provide the standards we have come to expect, it has been essential for us to grasp these new technologies.
Biotechnology is yet another of these industries.
We ignore or side-step it at our peril.
Like all new technologies, there are bound to be concerns: environmental, ethical and safety concerns.
They must be fully and very openly discussed and studied with the public; they must be monitored and safeguarded by effective regulation.
Issues such as privacy and confidentiality in an era of genetic predictions require further study and perhaps specific legislation.
We signal this need in the report and take no predetermined position.
This is for later, after proper debate.
I would suggest that Amendments Nos 9 and 27 are premature in that they seek to close off such consideration and decision.
It is incumbent on us to encourage our scientists, entrepreneurs and business managers to take full advantage of the potential of biotechnology and bring this potential to the people of Europe and to the world, especially the less well-provided developing world.
Biotechnology - the life and plant sciences which it encompasses - offers major advances in medicines and health care, to prevent and cure diseases and disabilities which for so long have blighted the lives of so many men, women and children in our constituencies and world-wide.
Biotechnology offers major advances in the production of food in Europe to the advantage of farmers and consumers alike and benefits those parts of the world which struggle against drought and saline soils and fast-increasing populations.
It offers crops that eliminate vitamin A deficiency and blindness for millions.
It will use fewer pesticides and herbicides and therefore improve the environment and natural habitats.
With valuable opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural and Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I sincerely thank their draftsmen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has considered all the implications and decisively calls for us in Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Member State governments to give this industry the support and commitment which it deserves and so badly needs.
Following several years of reticence and indecision, we are well behind our main competitors in the USA.
American R&D expenditure on biotechnology is three-and-a-half times that of Europe, employment is over three times and biotech revenues four times.
It is not only the USA: Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, Thailand, Singapore are all embracing biotechnology and actively promoting their indigenous industries.
There is no time to lose if Europe is to take its proper place.
We have the scientists, the research establishments and the scientific capability.
We have the basis of a successful industry, with entrepreneurs, investors and business managers.
But, for too long, these have been discouraged by negative and sceptical attitudes in government and political circles, public opinion and the media, by unsympathetic fiscal regimes, by a risk-averse culture and cumbersome legal structures.
The Lisbon Council promised to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
Now we look to the Stockholm Council to fulfil that promise on biotechnology, which is precisely one of the most important means for reaching that much-quoted target.
We look to the Commission to rouse itself, to shed its reticence and give a resolute lead with a bio-Europe action plan.
We look to the Member States to get on with the job of implementing the outstanding directives and providing the positive environment for their biotech industries to develop and prosper.
Our scientists and entrepreneurs are watching intently.
What happens here today, in Stockholm this month, in Brussels and the Member States in the next few months, will decide whether they emigrate elsewhere or seek their futures here in Europe.
I ask my colleagues in Parliament to give this report their full support.
I ask the Commission to respond to it with vigour, determination and singleness of purpose.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Purvis, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has participated with interest in this work aimed at the future.
We have produced an opinion that is forward-looking and constructive, and, at the same time, balanced.
We wish to take into consideration the principle of safety when it comes to consumers, the work of farmers, and the whole food processing chain.
Our first message is that biotechnology is one way of developing agriculture, which is now struggling with problems.
It offers opportunities for the production of non-food goods, such as new biofuels, plastics, and so on. It offers opportunities for using fewer pesticides and having a positive impact on the environment.
What is essential for farmers is that they should derive some financial benefit when the new technology is introduced.
That has not happened in the United States with regard to what are called first generation genetically modified products.
The European aim must be to improve the financial position of farmers by achieving better quality and efficiency through the use of technology.
Biotechnology could have immense importance for regional policy.
It offers opportunities for regions where natural conditions are harsh.
This also applies to the situation in the developing countries.
On the other hand, there are dangers associated with new technology, which are worth bearing in mind as early on as possible in any decision-making policy of the EU.
Farmers may become dependent on large, multinational companies in the processing industry.
To prevent the concentration of development, the EU must guarantee there are adequate public resources available for research, and support research and development in small biotechnological enterprises and plant-breeding institutes.
It will be very important to guarantee competition.
Our committee is satisfied with the work of Mr Purvis and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as our amendments were taken account of at the committee stage.
We would hope that the Commission will read carefully those requests that appear in the report inter alia to measure the net impact on the environment.
Mr President, just as the rapporteur points out, biotechnology offers enormous opportunities for good.
That is probably most obvious of all within the medical sphere, but there are also opportunities in a number of other fields.
However, biotechnology also raises a series of new and very difficult issues to which we must respond.
These include ethical issues within the medical sphere, environmental and consumer issues in connection with the cultivation of genetically modified crops and global issues of justice in connection with patent rights and the dominance of the industry by large multinational corporations.
These issues must be taken very seriously if a credible overall policy is to be drawn up in this area.
The opinion of the Committee on the Environment indicates some key areas.
Patent law must respect the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity which establishes developing countries' - indeed, all countries' - right to their genetic heritage.
There must be strong, independent and open public research in the field so that there is also research into areas which are not of immediate commercial interest and into the problems and risks posed by the technology.
There must also be public control of the research.
As far as the controversial issue of the cultivation of genetically modified crops is concerned, it has to be appreciated that the adoption of Directive 90/220/EEC does not mean that there is at present adequate legislation in this area.
We still do not have the necessary regulations on labelling, traceability and responsibility.
Such regulations must be a precondition for considering whether to embark upon the large-scale commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops.
Furthermore, we would point out the risks of genetic confidentiality not being respected and of genetic profiling being misused, for example to refuse people jobs or insurance.
That would lead, of course, to an increase in social inequality.
We think it crucial that problems of this kind, too, should also be clarified, precisely so that the positive potential of biotechnology can be developed.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Purvis, the rapporteur.
He has presented a remarkable report and drawn attention to the great potential of biotechnology.
We note that biotechnology is unable to develop that great potential particularly well in Europe.
There are a number of hindrances to it in the European Union.
The greatest one in my opinion is the de facto moratorium on the release of genetically modified organisms.
We do not investigate which plants or organisms are particularly dangerous and therefore should perhaps not be approved; instead we do not approve any at all and no distinction is made between different organisms.
This arrangement was a problem from the start.
There was never a proper basis for it in law, and now it is even more of a problem because the Council and Parliament have adopted new rules for the release of genetically modified organisms, and I cannot understand why some Member States still do not want to end the moratorium.
It is particularly harmful to small and medium-sized enterprises that are unable to transfer their work abroad.
We have good rules for release and we can therefore end the moratorium now.
I believe the dangers of green gene technology are much overstated.
I also believe the prospects for medicinal use are overstated, that things are being painted in black and white - genetic changes in farming are bad, in medicine they are per se good.
I think there are opportunities and risks in both, and that is also what the report says in item 32.
Now that we have good rules for plants, we also need good common rules in medicine.
There is room for improvement there.
I also believe that we must set ethically-based limits for gene technology and biotechnology.
We have already gone some way towards that in Europe and there is now a Committee on Human Genetics that must look particularly at this area again, because Europe is a community of values.
This does not mean that we have to have the same laws everywhere, that we harmonise everything, but we must agree in Europe, too, on certain basic principles and I would like to press for that strongly.
Mr President, this report should be welcomed for its well-rounded approach.
It highlights in a factual and non-alarmist manner the enormous potential of the European biotechnology industry for assisting economic growth, for encouraging job creation and improving the competitiveness of our industries.
But it is not all about growth.
As we live longer we also need to ensure that we live better and the infirmities of older people have to be addressed.
Diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer have yet to be fully challenged by the biotechnologists.
It is not only a question of living better, we have to be fitter so that older people can continue by their work to contribute to the wealth of society.
Long life and a healthy life have to be earned.
I am convinced that in plant, animal and human biology lie the biggest challenges of the 21st century.
I very strongly support that section of the report which calls for more concrete proposals for action from the Commission and Council.
We need the Commission to report on the present state of the industry and the comparisons between Member States and to give us better data for future action.
The development of a plan for a bio-Europe - paralleling the e-Europe - for activities of the Commission and Member States to make the Union a competitor for the biotechnology industry is a worthy aim.
The Council should also commit to biotechnology as a key new technology and the Stockholm Summit would be a useful time for them to do this.
The region that I represent has the lowest GDP per head of any region in the United Kingdom.
It is not a comfortable position and one of the key developments in the regional economic planning is to support a company to stimulate growth in biotechnology industries.
We call it Bio-Science-North.
The aim is to draw on research in university departments, to establish incubator companies and stimulate growth in those that are already established.
We believe that this is one of the most important instruments that we have been able to put in place in the last two or three years, with of course support from the European Regional Development Fund.
I know that our region is not alone in that but I believe that this is something that all regions in the Community should be examining.
The final point I would like to make is that we must reinforce the environmental possibilities of biotechnology.
It should be recognised that it gives us tremendous opportunities for tackling pollution and reducing resource depletion and gives us opportunities in the food sector to improve the output from our agricultural industries.
I hope that the biotechnology industry will get a tremendous boost from the adoption of this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I compliment Mr Purvis on his own-initiative report, which in terms of content does justice to the importance of the biotechnology sector for the European economy but which in the view of the ELDR Group could have been more balanced in its choice of words.
For that reason we shall support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 25 and 27.
Biotechnology, along with information and communications technology, is among the most promising technologies of the twenty-first century; in the years ahead these sectors will provide much new employment worldwide.
A precondition for this will be that the European Union develops a transparent and innovation-promoting regulatory framework, as well as an encouraging entrepreneurial climate.
Up to now, the biotechnology sector has been the lame duck as regards legislation facilitating economic support.
Consequently, I welcome the Anglo-Dutch initiative to make biotechnology a key priority on the Stockholm agenda.
If the European Union wishes to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy, it is now time to create a 'B-Europe' alongside an 'E-Europe' .
I am glad that the Dutch Prime Minister has realised this.
Perhaps he can also persuade his party in the Netherlands parliament to withdraw its appeal to the European Court of Justice against the directive protecting biotechnological inventions.
Because without sound patent legislation there will be no new investment by companies, no biotech start-ups and hence no innovation or employment.
Finally, I hope that our Commissioner will inform Parliament speedily about the Stockholm summit and what has been decided there with regard to biotechnology.
Perhaps he could suggest changing the acronym GMO to GEM, genetically enhanced materials, since 'gems are precious stones' , and that is what biotechnology must become in Europe.
Mr President, the rapporteur is aware that the Green Group has criticised this report as unbalanced and it indeed is unashamedly pro-biotech industry, doubtless because of the explicit involvement of Glaxo Wellcome - or whatever they are now called - in preparatory meetings.
However, the report in no way affects the legislative programme, which is addressing such issues as traceability, labelling and liability.
The report has not dealt with serious concerns such as ethics in biotechnology, public health, consumers' concerns regarding food, and indeed the effects on the environment.
However, the most extraordinary thing in this report is the reference to the market and the creation and availability of new financial resources and the rationality of European stock markets.
I thought Mr Purvis clearly understood that stock markets are beyond the control even of a powerful Commissioner like Mr Liikanen and I urge him to ignore this extraordinary interventionist proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is the custom here to praise and thank the rapporteur.
I will say this: Mr Purvis is right about one thing. Biotechnological applications will develop rapidly in the next few years.
But we do not need everything that industry would like to see for that to happen, such as patenting genes that already exist in nature, the free trade in manipulated genes, tax concessions for stock options for companies and their directors, the liberalisation of product labelling, subjective information, and the handling of biotechnology as an exclusively industrial operation, for which the EU' s Directorate-General for Enterprise in the has responsibility.
Mr Purvis' s report contains many views that point in this direction, and our group cannot, therefore accept it.
We wish to see biotechnology as an opportunity that will open up new dimensions in science.
The manipulation of nature must be approached in a more careful way than that which Mr Purvis is proposing.
We have to set aside time to examine all the effects of unborn - and possibly unheard-of in nature - species and varieties on people and the rest of nature.
We support the development of biotechnology and research in the field must not, for example, be allowed to be trampled on by information technology.
The IT stock market bubble has now burst.
We do not want biotechnology to become another such bubble, built of false expectations and empty promises.
As this is a matter of basics, issues relating to the genotypes of people and the rest of nature, politicians must bear the responsibility, because industry will not. Industry only maximises the value of shares.
Mr President, the rapporteur displays too optimistic a view of biotechnology.
Based on a one-sided industry-oriented approach he calls on us to support the biotechnology industry.
That is understandable from his perspective, in which the aim of Europe is to create wealth and employment.
However, I have a number of peripheral comments to make.
There is no sign in the report of a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of biotechnology.
The rapporteur calls the development of biotechnology good for the environment, the quality of food, health and the developing countries.
However, it is very doubtful whether the developing countries will benefit.
Probably they will become more dependent on the mainly Western suppliers of seed and pesticides.
After all, food provision, besides being a problem of technological and biological shortcomings, is mainly a distribution issue.
Unfortunately, the rapporteur imputes an exemplary function to the United States.
Biotechnological agriculture there announced that it can no longer guarantee that its products are GMO-free because of cross-pollination.
Information on biotechnology should also reflect an even-handed balance.
Leaving it to the sector leads to an entanglement of ethics and economic interests.
Ethical decisions should be taken as close as possible to the level of the citizen.
That also applies to the direction of development in biotechnology.
The report, on the other hand, instructs the Member States even on financial support, tax measures, education and immigration.
In addition, it is premature for the rapporteur to call upon Member States to agree with a patent on life, to which there are ethical and legal objections, such as conflict with international treaties.
The Netherlands and Great Britain have appealed to the Court and it is better to wait for the judgment.
The report gives responsibility for authorising GMOs to the European Food Authority. However, the latter has only an advisory function.
Politicians remain responsible for the decisions.
Policy for the biotechnology industry in the European Union should be based on the views of the Member States.
In the light of this poor coordination, it is telling that this report should appear before the temporary Committee on Human Genetics has reported on the matter.
Apart from that, it is odd that Europe, usually averse to state aid, should be calling upon the Member States to support an industrial sector.
It is unclear for what reason this industrial sector deserves to receive support.
At this stage it would have been better if the report had been restricted to cross-border industrial aspects, such as development barriers or a survey of options within the various possible policy directions, without simply advocating support.
Because of the above misgivings, I am unable to support the report.
Economic motives must not dominate moral considerations.
Europe, which claims to be a community of values, should show greater sensibility in dealing with this question.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Purvis on his excellent work in committee.
It was an intelligent, integrated operation which interpreted and respected the different stances of the members of the committee, including their ethical concerns.
For my part, as a scientist, I greatly welcome both the specific intrinsic value of the report, which, at last, places Europe on a level with the countries which invest more in scientific research, and the new horizons which are appearing in the fight to eradicate terrible diseases such as certain neurodegenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system.
Moreover, in the agrifoods sector, the adoption of my amendment, which stipulates that genetically modified foods must be subject to obligatory mutagenisis, carcinogenesis and toxicity tests before they are placed on the market, will go some way towards restoring the citizens' confidence at last, especially their faith in the institutions and the political world.
I would like to thank John Purvis once again for consenting to the adoption of a number of amendments I tabled, which seek to ensure that our human resources are properly valued and enhanced, particularly young researchers, and that young researchers are offered attractive career prospects which are on a level with those offered by the United States of America.
To sum up, I feel that the Purvis report can be considered a valuable contribution to that complex, diverse mosaic which is the European Research Area, which, together with Mr Busquin and Mr Liikanen, we are doing an excellent job of establishing in Europe and which will make us competitive and enable us to take up this world challenge.
Mr President, Mr Purvis has done a good job as several speakers have already said.
I think it is a good report.
Imagine if we could understand how algae produce oxygen from sunlight.
Such things exist.
We could imitate it.
It would transform our energy industry completely.
To understand that, for example, is an enormous challenge.
Or look at a sea urchin' s spine under the microscope.
You get a fantastic picture of how new materials might be built.
To understand how that is made could dramatically change our industrial culture.
We will only understand it if we are curious enough to find out, if we approach new technology, new science with curiosity and not with fear.
That is John Purvis' message and I would like to endorse it.
Moreover, as regards developing countries I would like to point out that there is one developing country that has made enormous strides in biotechnology.
That is Cuba.
For 40 years, Cuba has been investing in biotechnology like hardly any other country and today has a turnover in modern biotechnology of well over USD 100 million.
I only want to mention that because other countries are named here.
Despite all the criticism that can be levelled at Cuba in other respects, I think that is a major achievement.
In the energy industry we have tended to go the way of conventional thermodynamics.
No living creature operates according to conventional thermodynamics, otherwise we would not live as long as we do.
Irreversible thermodynamics, small changes, will perhaps show us a completely new way forward in energy.
That is also something we need to understand.
Then what we have been doing hitherto will perhaps one day be seen as an aberration.
I think we should be showing a little more courage with this technology, paying attention to the risks of course, but there has never been any progress made without curiosity or courage, and the same applies for biotechnology.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Purvis's report is an excellent document.
Biotechnology offers great opportunities, but also considerable risks.
We live in a democracy.
That means that our citizens' fears and anxieties must be taken seriously.
We can only succeed in doing this through debate and by making information easily accessible.
However, we must not allow these fears concerning the risks involved in the new technology to overshadow what it potentially has to offer humanity and the environment.
We are told that we can reduce the number of pesticides used in farming.
I should prefer to focus on the possibility of using biotechnology to design new pesticides and chemicals which work where they have to work and are broken down when they have to be broken down.
We must have a truthful and open-minded attitude both to opportunities and difficulties.
As far as food and agricultural production are concerned, we must have a deep respect for people' s clear right to information about the food they eat.
Responsible and informed freedom of choice is fundamental to a democracy.
I am very glad that the report is to include paragraph 62 which addresses the protection of the individual's personal integrity whenever genetic information is used.
Used properly, biotechnology can contribute to ecological, economic and social growth.
Used improperly, it can, like any other technology, be dangerous.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the gene technology industry has been promising us much for decades.
It is supposed to heal diseases, solve the problem of world hunger and create better people.
What have we seen in that time?
Many dangers have appeared, people have already died in experiments, hunger has not been wiped out and better human beings have not been created.
I think these problems are the result not of a technology but of the power structures prevailing in this society.
Firstly, there is twice as much food in the world as would be needed to feed everyone adequately.
It is a question of distribution.
Secondly, sickness is caused by environmental conditions, and these cannot be changed by technology but by changing the conditions.
Thirdly, we will only get a better human being if we allow more self-determination, if we allow people more freedom, but we will not do it simply by means of a new technology.
Biotechnology on the other hand creates more selection, has already resulted in a new form of genetic racism, and we must resist that with all our might.
This report puts all the power in the hands of the gene technology industry and we can therefore only reject it.
/NGL). (EL) Mr President, every new science that emerges significantly improves our quality of life but generally harbours the danger of innovations being hijacked by groups of interests.
In the case of biotechnology, we must not forget that life is an exceptionally complicated physical system which has evolved over a timescale of millions of years and that, consequently, interventions which provoke change over a timescale of a few years may have unforeseen repercussions on the balance of the overall system.
The Purvis report completely ignores the risks and endeavours to ensure that biotechnology serves the monopolies' interests.
According to the report, the biotechnology industry should operate without restraint and beyond any form of control and its interests should come before any public interest.
The interest in third world countries is hypocritical in the extreme, now that the pharmaceutical industry is dragging the South African government through the courts and the third world is overburdened by debt.
The overall stance of the European Union is hypocritical because it has abandoned its earlier reservations precisely when the European monopolies are at the point at which they can compete with the American monopolies.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report, not just because it is unacceptable, but because it is dangerous for the future of mankind.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, John Purvis' s report is a particularly good - by this I mean complete and well balanced - review of the situation surrounding the biotechnology industry in Europe.
This is shown not least by the very large majority in support of the report in committee.
In particular, the call for a coordinated European action plan was backed on all sides of the House and evidently also fell on fertile ground in the Council of Ministers and the Commission.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
At its meeting this week, the European Commission reaffirmed its desire to develop a consistent overall strategy for supporting and developing biotechnology in Europe and to present it to Parliament and the Council by the end of this year.
I am particularly pleased that it is Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin who have stressed the importance of this technology for our economic and scientific future.
At the same time or more or less at the same time, Heads of Government Tony Blair and Wim Kok sent a joint letter to the Swedish President of the Council calling for an economic action plan to promote the European biotechnology industry and giving due emphasis to that call with a raft of suggested measures.
Mr Liese has already said that we are dealing with other issues besides economic matters, and as a Parliament we shall be following all these actions closely.
It is an important, essential prerequisite for the success of this action plan that all decisions should be taken on the basis of the best information available.
We are therefore particularly anxious that full use should be made of the various advisory and scientific committees through which scientific and economic expertise is fed into the preparation and taking of decisions.
I therefore most especially welcome the report' s call for greater use to be made of all these committees and would like to call on the Commission to make greater use than before of all the possibilities for consultation and groundwork, as we should do, too.
Mr President, as many fellow Members have already stated, I believe that the biotechnology industry can bring about improvements, particularly in medicine, but I think that it would be naÃ¯ve to believe that it can solve all the world' s problems.
When I hear what some Members have to say, or when I read certain passages in the report, I am stunned and astounded.
World hunger, unexpected climate change, protection of the environment, all these problems could be resolved tomorrow thanks to the benefits of biotechnology.
I think that it would be just as naÃ¯ve to simply disregard the possible risks, excesses and abuses, all the more so because we are already seeing some of them taking place.
The risks and excesses could either be curbed or increased depending on developments in legislation both in the European Union and internationally.
I would like to make just two points. The first relates to drug patenting.
We are now seeing the problems of access to generic drugs to combat AIDS in the African nations, Brazil and countries in Asia.
Given the pharmaceutical industry' s propensity for the use of biotechnology in future drugs, I think that this problem will only grow worse and that we will therefore have to ensure that patent legislation does not prevent production and parallel imports of generic drugs to combat great scourges and serious diseases, which threaten the poorest nations.
My second point relates to patents on genetic discoveries.
I think that a clear distinction must certainly be made between patents on inventions and patents on discoveries, especially since biological riches are concentrated in the countries of the South, in tropical areas, because, otherwise, we will once again see the countries of the South being plundered so that major laboratories of industrialised nations can benefit.
In any case, we must put an end to the 'patenting of life forms' .
The third point, which will bring me to my conclusion, is that I believe fundamental decisions, particularly on releasing GMOs, must continue to come under political responsibility.
The European Food Safety Authority will most probably play a crucial role in providing expertise, information and recommendations, but it is the competent authorities which must, on a political level, continue to authorise the release of GMOs.
As long as problems such as traceability, labelling and determining responsibility for damage persist and as long as we have no guarantees on risks, I believe that we are justified in continuing the moratorium.
Mr President, the biotechnology industry in fact provides us with an important means of combating certain diseases, reducing the use of chemical products in agriculture and of protecting the environment.
Mr Purvis quite rightly emphasises all these developments.
However, by almost exclusively falling into line with the approach of biotechnology companies, and by giving priority to economic and technological aspects, the report pays minimal attention to the major questions of ethics and safety, which are giving the general public so much concern.
There is a risk that the biotechnology industry, seen from a strictly industrial and mercantile point of view, will make all these problems worse; for example, unfair trade, environmental disasters, industrial mergers and unemployment and the increasing power of multinationals.
I do, therefore, find the report is too partial by far and is even prejudiced.
It disregards the concerns that were even expressed in this House on GMOs.
It questions the moratorium imposed by several Member States, one of which was France.
I agree with what my fellow Member has just said.
I think that, given all the problems we face - and since I heard you mention courage earlier - it would show courage to persevere with the precautionary principle and take time to verify the facts of the situation.
While I do, therefore, acknowledge the advantages of biotechnologies, I cannot support the report as it stands.
I hope that it will be amended, particularly in the light of the conclusions of the SjÃ¶stedt report, which is, in the main, based on respect for the precautionary principle.
In its Sixth Framework Research Programme, the Commission made biotechnology and genetic engineering priority areas.
It is preparing a strategic communication on biotechnology to be completed by the end of 2001.
I call on the Commission to do all it can to take full advantage of the contribution that biotechnology can make to economic growth and to the protection of the environment, but also to take full account of ethical, environmental and social issues, which I believe require dialogue between politicians, scientists and citizens.
Mr President, the report of Mr Purvis on biotechnology comes at just the right moment.
Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world and threatens to miss opportunities.
The causes are mainly a fairly weak strategic vision, laborious approval procedures and non-transparent coordination between European and national legislation.
The great value of this report is that it clearly describes where additional guarantees are required for producers, consumers, environment and health care.
In that respect the report stands in a number of areas in glaring contrast to the letter addressed by the British and Dutch prime ministers Blair and Kok to the European Council.
This letter is too bogged down in rather hollow rhetoric on opportunities, whereas Purvis rightly speaks up for the small and medium-sized business that is so important to Europe.
In that respect, the government of my country has depressing examples of a zigzag policy, as was shown, for example, only last year in relation to the use of GM potatoes for non-food production.
Mr President, the FAO has calculated that world food production will have to increase by two-and-a-half times in twenty years, and that there is insufficient scope for opening up new agricultural areas in the world.
And those who, like the present Minister for Agriculture in Germany, Mrs KÃŒnast, retreat into small-scale production and organic farming, are in fact turning their backs on international society.
A good balance between new techniques such as biotechnology, sustainability and their accommodation within a strategic food policy is indispensable.
As far as that is concerned, a strong European food authority with supervisory and monitoring powers is in fact also indispensable for such policy.
Mr President, I must say that with his report the honourable Member has taken an excellent first step towards a new discussion in Europe.
Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Purvis on his report on the future of the biotechnology industry.
As Mr Purvis makes clear, it is a vital industry for the future of the European Union.
It will provide jobs and opportunities for innovation with new products and new processes in such fields as agriculture, medicine and pharmaceuticals.
In the Fifth Framework Programme we are already putting EUR 2 billion into the biotechnology industry and I hope that in the Sixth Framework Programme that will increase.
But despite all that we are behind the United States, which dominates the biotechnology market in terms of revenue, R and D expenditure and even number of employees. It is between three and four times bigger than the industry in the European Union.
If we are going to benefit from the biotechnology industry, we need to nurture the industry.
We need to invest through the Sixth Framework Programme and other R and D funds. Balanced regulation is important.
It is clear there has been a public loss of confidence in science and technology, scientists and engineers.
The BSE and foot-and-mouth crises indicate a lack of confidence.
It is also clear that there is an ethical dimension.
We need public accountability and clear guidelines that command public support.
In terms of research and genetic manipulation, many of us would support somatic cell repair but might have doubts about somatic cell enhancement or germ cell repair and certainly there will be grave concerns about germ-cell enhancement.
It is not acceptable for insurance companies to refuse cover on the basis of genetic profiling or for manufacturing companies to recruit those with a low propensity to cancer for dirty jobs.
We need to strike a balance between introducing regulations that will allow the biotechnology industry to thrive in the future and maintaining public confidence.
Otherwise public concerns may well drive economic activity across the Atlantic.
Mr President, Commissioner, research and society face great scientific and ethical challenges in the 21st century.
Genetic engineering applications will play a key role.
I would like to thank Mr Purvis sincerely.
In the last legislative term I drew attention to the importance of genetic engineering in my report on genetic engineering and its impact on agriculture.
We must now at last give the green light to green genetic engineering.
To stick with this theme of colours, consumers have long since given the green light to red genetic engineering, i.e. the application of genetic engineering in medicine.
The advantages are tangible and easy to understand.
In green genetic engineering, its application in agriculture, consumers are, as I say, sadly still showing the red light.
We must also show the red card to extremists.
Biotechnology and gene technology must cease to be the poor relation.
The EU must get on board the moving train of research and application or it will leave without us.
I am worried by the trend of more and more small and medium-sized enterprises pulling out of green biotechnology and gene technology.
The present EU moratorium means that while research is taking place the subsequent application of the product is not being allowed in individual countries.
Undertakings, and with them jobs, are leaving Europe.
In my view, the lights are on amber here.
They must be allowed to change to green.
Of course, whether we are talking about red or green genetic engineering, the ethical bounds to biotechnology and gene technology must be clearly formulated.
I would like to say to the opponents of research that we have a moral obligation to use the opportunities this new technology offers for medicine and for caring for the world population as a whole.
The public will give the green light to biotechnology and gene technology only if they have information and transparency with clearly marked out ethical bounds.
I also appeal to industry to do their part in helping us with the public relations work so that acceptance will increase.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Purvis on his comprehensive report.
The Commission supports the basic thrust of the report.
We can only welcome it as a recognition of the economic, social and environmental impact of biotechnology.
Biotechnology has a very important role to play in fulfilling the commitment made by the Lisbon European Council to develop a competitive, knowledge-based economy.
That is also the basis for creating employment in Europe.
The Commission has already indicated the priority it attaches to biotechnology in its proposal for the next research framework programme.
Therefore we share the report's view on the need to promote a competitive European biotechnology industry.
A study on the position of the European biotechnology industry should be ready later this spring, and I shall make that available to Parliament.
Further, let me say how much the Commission appreciates the report's particular merit of taking a comprehensive view on all major issues related to biotechnology.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this successful attempt.
In its report to the Stockholm European Council, which takes place next week, the Commission underlines the importance of biotechnology as a frontier technology for growth and employment, and as a tool for sustainable development.
The Commission also announces a broad policy paper setting up a strategic vision for life sciences and biotechnology after 2010, which will be ready by the end of this year.
The policy paper and action plan will be the Commission's response to Parliament's wish for an initiative.
Obviously, in preparing this policy document we can now carefully take into account the views of the European Parliament as expressed in the report.
I agree with those who say that we need a broad debate on the ethical and societal impacts of the issue.
If and when we want to promote the biotechnology industry and its possibilities, we must always be open about it, otherwise we will not be successful.
We will also base our report on the indications from the Industry Ministers' informal meetings on 16 February and possible indications from the European Council next week.
I expect the European Council will take a very strong position on this issue.
It is also clear that we will have to build on expertise in many fields, as well as consulting a wide range of stake-holders.
We need to hold discussions with a wide range of people: scientists, experts and citizens.
There are no simple answers to the needs and questions raised by biotechnology, but it is the Commission's intention to provide - with you - a considered and comprehensive strategy before the end of this year.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I propose that the sitting be suspended until the votes are taken.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and resumed at noon)
Madam President, yesterday in this House the chairperson of my delegation, Rosa DÃ­ez, reported another leak of a written answer from the Commission to a question in Question Time, before Parliament officially received the answer from the Commission.
It was the answer to Question No 91 from Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen about the national water plan.
Having received the press release that the Group of the European People' s Party in the European Parliament distributed yesterday to the Spanish media in Strasbourg, dated 13 March, half an hour before Question Time finished, I would like to inform the President of the European Parliament that as well as the answer to Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen' s question, the joint answer to Questions No 92 from Mr Agag Longo and No 94 from Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea was also leaked.
Therefore, on behalf of my delegation, I once again ask the President to investigate what happened and to take every step to ensure that this situation does not reoccur.
Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop, I shall do whatever needs to be done.
I listened to your point of order because it gave Members the time to arrive in Parliament.
Madam President, as it is the second time in one month that there have been leaks, and they are always to do with questions associated with Spanish Members, I would ask you to inform the House as soon as possible of the result of the investigation that you promised to carry out at my request.
I also address this to President Prodi, who promised to investigate it within the Commission.
I think it is absolutely scandalous that this should happen again.
I agree with you wholeheartedly, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
This is utterly unacceptable and I shall, of course, let you know the results of the enquiry.
We cannot enter into a debate, Mr Galeote Quecedo.
I am allowing points of order because we are still waiting for some Members to arrive. Generally, points of order are always heard after the votes.
Madam President, since Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has recently been so obsessed with receiving all sorts of regulations, I would also ask you to send him the regulations on the questions that Members put to the European Commission, and he should not be surprised that the answer was received by the person who asked the question.
Once this person has received the answer he can do what he likes with it, and can therefore give it to the media, and what is more, I would say that it is his duty to do so.
These, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, are the rules of democracy.
But as you like receiving documentation, please, Madam President, send him the regulations governing this event.
Madam President, I addressed you regarding an unacceptable leak of questions put by Members from my Group.
Now I know who was responsible for the leaks.
Mr Galeote has just told us.
Ladies and gentlemen, you accepted the rule that I put before you, in other words, to deal with points of order after voting.
We shall proceed to the votes, and then we can come back to deal with this issue in full, if you wish.
VOTE
Very well, Mrs Kauppi, thank you for making this clear.
We shall look into this.

Motion for a resolution (B5-0172/2001), by Mr Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on developing the Union's capabilities in conflict prevention and civil crisis management
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I am not going to raise a point of order, under Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure, because, as you said, we leave this until the end of the debate, but I do want to speak under Rule 122 due to personal allusions.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo has made a completely unfounded accusation here, and I ask you, Madam President, to ask Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to retract it.
No, Mr Galeote Quecedo. Any Member wishing to speak on a personal matter can do so when the current item on the agenda has been discussed.
The item that we are currently discussing is the votes on the reports.
You will, therefore, be able to take the floor as soon as we have finished, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I apologise for interrupting proceedings, but I think that this situation justifies my action.
We will be voting, this afternoon, on a motion for a resolution condemning a political group now active in Angola for having taken eight Portuguese citizens hostage.
It so happens that representatives of the group which is alleged to be responsible for this act are amongst us here in the European Parliament.
I consider that this situation is unacceptable and that measures should be adopted to ensure that this cannot happen.
We cannot accept the presence in the confines of the European Parliament of representatives of a group that is holding eight Portuguese citizens hostage and which today we will be condemning in a resolution to be adopted by this Parliament.
I therefore ask you, Madam President, to take measures to ensure that the individuals representing this group leave the European Parliament immediately.
I understand what you are saying Mr Miranda.
Obviously it is totally unacceptable that these people should be in the building.
If they are here, I shall do what is necessary to ensure that they leave.
Madam President, following on from what Mr Miranda said, I would like, if possible, to ask the European Parliament' s services to inform us, at a later date and in writing, how these gentlemen were able to enter the buildings of the European Parliament.
Absolutely, Mr Seguro, we must definitely look into this.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Kauppi Report (A5-0071/2001)
Madam President, the document we have voted on concerns the amendment of the regulation on the reclassification of settlements under swaps arrangements and under forward rate agreements.
While making an appeal for the Italian version of the documents to contain the Italian translation of all the terms contained therein - despite my love of the English language, and of French, for that matter - I would like to say that I voted for Mrs Kauppi' s report. On this, as on many other occasions, Mrs Kauppi has demonstrated her competence and her abilities in analysing the financial and economic problems of Europe, particularly the problems of pensioners and elderly people who invest their money in banks and various funds for their future.
In fact, she has done so well that I could appoint Mrs Kauppi honorary Chairman of the Pensioners' Party, which, given the fact that she is one of the youngest Members of the European Parliament, would bring honour to our party. If only more Members would concern themselves with the elderly!
Madam President, the reclassification of financial swaps and forward rate agreements has been delayed for more than a year, while the Council of Ministers of Finance of the European Union made it clear when it met that it would not accept the initial proposal from the Commission because, with the method of accounting for these transactions, possible situations of excessive public deficit might not be detected.
In order to avoid this dead end, two amendments have been approved so that, in the reports that the Member States have to send to the Commission in accordance with excessive public debt procedure, payments resulting from swaps and forward rate agreements would be considered as financial burdens incorporated into interest or debt servicing.
However, from now on, the main amounts of these transactions are going to be considered as financial assets that do not count as public debt, which could enable the net debt, and therefore excessive public debt, to be disguised or hidden, which is unacceptable.
Inglewood Report (A5-0072/2001)
Madam President, I voted in favour of the directive on life assurance.
As you are aware, during the course of their working life, one reason why many people take out life assurance is in order to receive a pension when they are older.
As I was about to vote, I remembered my daughter, Cristina Fatuzzo - now 24 years old - who, when she was still a small child of eight or nine and already interested in my work and pensions, asked me: 'Why is it that when pensioners receive their pension from the State, they have to give some of it back in the form of tax?
Would it not be simpler to give them a little less money rather than making them pay tax?
Why do they have to pay tax?'
In her naivety, she said something which I am now putting to you: why do we not help pensioners in matters of taxation by exempting them from paying taxes?
Stockholm European Council
In his presentation, the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, spoke at length about the elderly in Europe and about how to resolve the problem of pensioners.
Now, I would like to inform Parliament that the Pensioners' Party and I personally will not be satisfied until we ensure that pensioners receive a pension which is 100% equal to their salary.
Can anybody explain to me why a pensioner who stops working should receive a lower pension than the salary he received when he was working?
Furthermore, I have to say that I am tired of hearing people say that there is not enough money for pensions because pensioners are living too long.
We predict what the weather will be doing in 20 years and we worry about all those who are going to die of BSE, so do you really think, Madam President, that we did not know that people would be living longer?
We are trying to deny the obvious! The truth is that there is not enough money because it has been badly managed, not because we are living longer.
I deplore the fact that the European Parliament has not acknowledged the need to argue the case, to the Commission and the Council, for a new type of sustainable development which creates high-quality employment and which guarantees a high level of social protection as called for in the motion for a resolution tabled by my group.
The guidelines contained in the Commission document designed to prepare for the Stockholm European Council insist on the need to give priority to completing the internal market by speeding up the process of liberalisation, to strengthening the financial markets by instituting pension funds, and to increasing the competitiveness of businesses by reducing wage costs and by increasing flexibility and mobility at work.
Nevertheless, the guidelines do not add to the main legislative initiatives laid down in the Social Agenda, specifically those that provided for increasing workers' individual and collective rights and for improving their working conditions.
Furthermore, social and employment policies still take a clear second place to respecting the Stability Pact and the arguments continue to be presented for liberalisation in sectors such as gas, electricity, postal services and transport, which undermines the objectives of high-quality employment that gives workers rights and which meets the basic needs of the most vulnerable sectors of the population.
The European Council is changing its presidency but liberalism is still in control.
The Swedish programme talks enthusiastically about competitiveness, competition and free trade.
This time around, there is hardly any mention of the social agenda and other nods in the direction of solidarity, the favourite alibis of the outgoing French Presidency, and the emphasis is purely on economic criteria.
The criteria for an antisocial Europe which will mean insecurity and poverty for the workers of both Member States and candidate countries, taking as its slogans the 'flexible organisation of work' and the 'modernisation of social protection' , just the kind of thing to encourage the mediaeval ambitions of the bosses.
Nor does this document make any secret of its desire to 'create a business-friendly climate' .
With feigned piety, the EU is preparing itself for a regal handout of new markets in energy, transport, and even intellectual property.
And also the criteria of an imperial Europe, the kingpin of capitalist globalisation, which intends to 'move, within the WTO, towards specific liberalisation measures' .
Today, just like yesterday, in Nice as in Gothenburg, we shall oppose this policy in order to create a social Europe, a Europe for workers and peoples, which will begin by levelling upwards the best of the European acquis.
I wholeheartedly welcome the Council and Commission statements on plans to be discussed at the Stockholm Summit on 23/24 March.
Stockholm will build on what was set out at last year's Lisbon Summit which outlined plans for a dynamic, knowledge-based and competitive economy.
I have said it before and I will say it again, jobs, jobs, jobs. That is what it is all about.
Lisbon set far-reaching goals for the next decade - to create the world's leading knowledge-based economy by 2010, to create 20 million new jobs across Europe by 2010 and to promote economic and social reform which combine competitiveness and social cohesion, investing in people and raising skill levels.
In simple terms, this means increasing the skills and mobility of Europe's workforce, encouraging enterprise, helping small firms and improving EU regulation.
It also means boosting the EU's research and development effort and ensuring lifelong learning.
This Summit is incredibly important to our citizens and we have to set out what Stockholm means for them.
First and foremost, jobs is our top priority.
We aim to establish a business-led skills taskforce and a jobs database to overcome the skills shortage.
We must make full use of Europe's older workers, increase gender equality across the labour market, and encourage women to become entrepreneurs.
Supporting SMEs is crucial for the EU to meet its employment targets, as small and medium-sized businesses provide two-thirds of all private sector jobs across Europe, and make up 98% of all businesses in the UK.
The right regulatory environment, including cutting red tape, is of paramount importance to small firms and to job creation.
Furthermore, we need to accelerate economic reforms and full energy liberalisation by 2003 is a priority in this agenda.
Not only will this bring down prices across Europe, but it will encourage energy suppliers to be more efficient.
Madam President, all this is just a small sample of what we want to achieve at Stockholm.
I very much hope that we can achieve our goals, so that, our citizens will benefit from a dynamic and competitive economy.
Situation at the border between FRY/Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Madam President, I believe we are in a very dramatic situation; on the one hand we have the nationalist policy of Mr Kostunica, and on the other, the very European, moderate attitude of the Macedonian Government that is doing magnificently well and deserves our full support.
But in between lies Kosovo, and we must at last make clear that a few extremists, extremists whose background is unclear, do not represent the Albanian people.
That is why elections must be held in Kosovo without delay in order to strengthen Mr Rugova' s position and make clear where the majority of Albanians stand and where the democratic forces stand.
That is missing from our resolution.
That is why I wanted to vote against our resolution.
I fear I voted wrongly and I would ask you to please correct that, and I would like to say clearly that this resolution is unbalanced because the crucial point, namely elections in Kosovo, is missing.
The joint resolution on the incidents at the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia/Kosovo-Macedonia border is a pathetic illustration of the European Union' s inability to tackle national questions positively.
Yet it has tried everything: force, with the NATO bombings, and negotiations, with a number of plans for the 'ethnic' sharing of the region.
But still the disputes continue, and a lasting solution in the Balkans will not be found by criminalising this or that community, labelling it as terrorist, or by bringing in the Serbian army to enforce a bad compromise.
The prerequisites for a settlement of the conflict in the region are to condemn the policy of Milosevic and other war criminals, and also to condemn any military intervention from outside, in particular that of NATO.
It is the responsibility of these peoples themselves to choose their own destiny in complete freedom and independence.
In our opinion, the processes of self-determination, of independence and freedom to associate as desired, should take precedence over the territorial integrity of this or that entity.
It is only by respecting all the elements involved, including minorities, that the Balkans, and Kosovo in particular, will be able to emerge from this crisis.
Real conflict prevention comes from below, from people who do not feel oppressed by anyone and the great majority of whom are satisfied with the national unit to which they have been assigned.
On the other hand, you cannot keep any state lastingly together from above against the will of the majority of the inhabitants of a region, or maintain internationally recognised borders.
Right across the area populated predominantly by Albanians run national borders they never wanted, and within Serbia and Macedonia they find themselves against their wills in the position of an ethnic minority.
The Albanians believe they suffered an injustice in 1913 when a large part of their native region was not assigned to the new state of Albania that had just seceded from Turkey.
Since then this has created a breeding ground for popular uprisings which aim at finally creating a Greater Albania.
One way of avoiding this might be to quickly introduce a federal constitutional regulation into Macedonia, along the same lines as that which enables Flemings and Walloons to live peaceably side by side again since Belgium' s federalisation.
Anyone wishing to combat nationalism must first remove its breeding ground by offering people a solution acceptable to them.
Because the resolution gives people no hope of improvement and does not remove the causes of violence, I am unable to support it.
Conflict prevention
The British Conservatives support the use by the EU of certain civil instruments to help head off or alleviate crises in third countries.
These include humanitarian and development aid, mine action, election monitoring, financial and practical assistance to strengthen the judiciary and the rule of law and the civil administration, and well-targeted economic sanctions where appropriate.
The EU institutions should focus their efforts on improving their efficiency in delivering these.
However, we are firmly opposed to any idea of developing a 'European Police Force' , we believe that the European contribution to military rapid reaction forces should be conducted through NATO, and that 'operational capacity' that relates to either of these aspects is a matter for individual nations and not a matter for the EU.
Property values
A month ago, the Lamfalussy Committee of Wise Men presented its final report on the regulation of the European securities markets.
Apart from the many advantages that an integrated internal market for securities would bring, the report also contains a proposal for reform of the legislative process in securities matters which I consider to be a major step in the right direction.
The present legislative process is much too long-winded and inflexible to be able to adapt to the much more rapidly changing securities markets.
We simply cannot always be lagging behind market trends while at the same time setting ourselves such ambitious targets as the one decided in Lisbon, of becoming the world' s largest and most dynamic economic area within ten years.
I agree with the broad outlines of the Lamfalussy Committee' s proposal, but I must insist on the 'call-back' mechanism proposed in Parliament' s resolution, which allows the European Parliament to call on the Commission to withdraw the proposals put before the Securities Committee concerning implementing measures in the event of a negative position being taken by itself or the Council.
The Commission would have to comply with such a request and put forward a legislative proposal as part of the codecision procedure.
But the most important thing in all the squabbling about power sharing between Council and Parliament is that we should not lose sight of the objective of an integrated European securities market.
We have set ourselves the year 2005 as a target date for an integrated internal market in financial services.
Time is ticking by and rival markets and economies are not asleep.
von Wogau Report (A5-0082/2001)
Madam President, yesterday afternoon I met Mr Karl von Wogau, who is a good friend of mine and whose abilities and intelligence I admire, and I said to him: 'Mr von Wogau, tell me why I should vote for your report?'
'But Fatuzzo,' he replied, 'are you asking me this because you want to know whether the report concerns pensioners in any way?' 'Well done, Mr von Wogau.
You have hit the nail on the head!'
Then Mr von Wogau said to me: 'Have a look at page 7, paragraph 12.'
I did this and, indeed, page 7, paragraph 12 states that the European Parliament 'insists on the need to adapt the present social security systems with a view to ensuring they perform safely.'
Therefore, how could I have voted against such a fine, clear document which does so much for pensioners, who have been longing for so long for one thing alone, for just one result: to have safe pensions.
I regret to say that this safety has been lost: let us hope that it will soon be reintroduced.
This sort of report necessarily refers to 'averages' , rounds figures up and down and hence conceals economic divergences in certain economies.
While, for example, the report considers that there are high employment rates and that unemployment has fallen at European Union level, the Commission itself highlighted the increase in unemployment, the high rate of structural and long-term unemployment, the low productivity of labour, the high level of taxation on low incomes etc. in Greece at the beginning of March.
Today the governor of the Bank of Greece presents his report to parliament, in which he highlights the huge increase in Greece' s balance of trade deficit, which almost doubled in 2000 and now exceeds EUR 8 billion, compared with about EUR 4.5 billion in 1999.
This huge increase in our balance of trade deficit has little to do with the increase in oil prices.
The statistics show a significant increase in the number of imports penetrating traditional manufacturing sectors of the Greek economy with all that this implies for production, inflation, employment and incomes.
I would have expected this report to take a stand on the Ecofin 'recommendations' against Ireland.
Would there have been 'recommendations' if it were France or Germany in Ireland' s place or would we be talking about a 'steam engine' of Europe?
This sort of report cannot, I think, hide the fact that there are economies in the EU which are still a long way from 'real' convergence.
Despite its title, the von Wogau report does not analyse the EU' s economic and social situation. Instead, it limits itself to repeating generalisations and to focusing on the sole objective of monetary policy, price stability and keeping inflation below the 2% limit set by the European Central Bank, without taking account of considerations concerning the real economy, particularly employment.
The report insists on the need to speed up the liberalisation of telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport, regardless of the consequences for employment, regional cohesion, working conditions and a high-quality universal public service.
It continues to predict a healthy economic situation, despite signs that the EU' s economy is slowing down, as the rapporteur himself states, when we should be thinking about the slowdown of the US economy, the economic recession in Japan and the effects of these trends on the European economy.
The report insists on the need for greater flexibility in the labour market, at a time when there are more than 14 million people unemployed in the EU and around 65 million living in poverty. There are striking inequalities in income and employment is becoming increasingly insecure, with the majority of new jobs created being temporary or part time.
The report continues to insist on moving towards the euro without creating the mechanisms necessary to minimise the economic and social risks.
This is all being done in the name of the inviolable principle of competitiveness and the abstract concept of the social economy of the market.
I have therefore voted against the report.
The economic and monetary policy of the EU and its Member States should be directed towards continued improvements to the quality of their citizens' lives and meeting their needs to an increasing degree.
This document is a complete hotchpotch, which resuscitates the old concept of the 'Social Market Economy' so as not to have to adopt a deeply neo-liberal position.
Its first recommendation, and the only specific one, is to 'demand' that 'all necessary steps be taken' to keep inflation below the mythical threshold of 2%.
But how can anyone have confidence in experts who think that investments represent 5,3% of the GDP in Europe, whereas, in the year 2000, the accurate figure is 20,5%?
How can we accept this insistence on demanding, yet again, as always, these 'suitable reforms' of social security systems, and a 'more flexible' labour market?
The political hypocrisy of using the word 'social' to dress up an increasingly rampant capitalism is compounded here by a very foolish error.
By making inflation the absolute barometer of good economic health, there is a risk that the current recovery will be stifled, and that the prospect of a return to full employment will be put off to a time which is decidedly not 'reasonable' .
That is where it leads, this alignment of socio-liberals with liberalism pure and simple.
We are voting against it.
I voted in favour of the resolution on the state of the European economy proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in a report preparatory to the Commission recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines.
The resolution contains a number of sensible statements that I would like to underscore here too, especially because they are not always written so clearly.
It is quite amazing that Members of all groups are saying that the present demographic trends make suitable reforms necessary to guarantee the benefits of social security systems in an efficient and safe way and that incentives must be provided for older workers to opt to extend their working lives.
I would also like to stress how welcome it is that this Parliament takes the view that the economic and monetary policy not only of the European Union but also of the Member States should be guided by the principles of the social market economy, the main elements of that economic system being named as freedom and democracy, competition, price stability, sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity and private property.
I also find it good, given the worrying inflationary trends in many Member States, to reiterate that all necessary steps must be taken so that the inflation rate can be kept below 2% in the second half of 2001.
I am particularly pleased that my motion that the liberalisation of the telecommunications, post, energy and railways sector must not be hasty but balanced was accepted.
The explicit call for a more flexible labour market, a labour market that must have the necessary human capital with the best possible education and training to satisfy the demands of the international knowledge economy, which presupposes consistent investment in the fields of education and new technologies, is particularly important if we are to achieve the ambitious objective of becoming the locomotive of the world economy in this decade like the American economy was in the 1990s.
I wanted to express my satisfaction with this, and I hope that not only the Commission but also the governments of our Member States will follow this sound advice.
Fava Report (A5-0060/2001)
Madam President, it is not because I represent the Pensioners' Party that I am knowledgeable about the issue of the election observance by our missions in the other States, but because I established the Pensioners' Party in Italy and, for almost 20 years, I have been surrounded by papers, regulations and elections: indeed, not a year passes without me being involved in some election or other.
Well then, I would like to stress that I voted for the motion, but, in particular, I would call not just for missions to be sent to the various States holding elections to check that the right voting procedures are being followed, but for the voting rules themselves to be controlled as well.
In fact, there are States where only the wealthy are allowed to put candidates forward for elections, only those who own television networks can succeed in winning elections, or only those who are able to collect thousands of signatures from a certain notary, and so on and so forth.
This is not true democracy.
Therefore, the voting rules themselves must be controlled in those States.
We think it is legitimate for Members of the European Parliament to participate in election observation. In several places in the report, however, the impression is given that these observers' task as missionaries for the EU overshadows their role as election observers.
The impression is given that the most important thing is to raise the profile of the EU and preferably overshadow observers from other parliamentary assemblies, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
We find this competition for media attention highly inappropriate. What would be far better, in our view, are collaboration and coordination, taking into account the expertise of the aforementioned organisations, which both have great experience in this area and a wider circle of members.
It is precisely because we are in favour of promoting human rights, and in particular the observance of democratic elections, that we are abstaining from voting on this report.
Besides, the report itself recognises that the aim of these parliamentary missions is really to ensure 'the best possible visibility' of the AEU.
And yet we are well aware of the role played by European States and industrial lobbies such as Elf, in assisting dictatorial African regimes which systematically violate basic rights and are involved in widespread corruption.
Finally, as the parliamentary missions plough their way through the world, 'illuminating' it with the light of Europe' s example, they would do well to stop off in France, and investigate the rumours of the hidden funding of certain parties.
In Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, a form of participative democracy has been in operation for over ten years.
It gives the workers who live there not only a voice, but also the power to draw up, decide on and control the major budgetary priorities to be used to meet social needs.
A European stopover there would probably be instructive.
VÃ€yrynen Report (A5-0083/2001)
Madam President, you will not believe this but, the day before yesterday, I met a group of young Ukrainians who, when they heard that I often talk about the problems of pensioners, almost begged me, with one voice: 'did you know that in the Ukraine pensioners are really, really badly off?
Why is it that you in the European Union are not doing anything about the fate of the pensioners in Ukraine?
The pensioners in our country lived under the communist regime for many years, when they were young workers.
They had neither freedom nor democracy, their lives consisted of work and nothing else.
Now communism has fallen and they are left with a miserable pension which is not even enough to buy a couple of pints of milk a day.
We expect a great deal from you: you must concern yourselves with our elderly people as well as our economy, or else they will wish the communists had never left.'
We Swedish Social Democrats believe that nuclear power is not an ecologically sustainable source of energy.
We cannot therefore support the financing of new nuclear plant, as provided for in paragraph 26.
However, we support increased safety for existing nuclear plant.
The Common Strategy of the European Union on Ukraine is merely a programme for accelerating the introduction of liberalism.
Considerations about supporting the process of democratic transition do nothing to disguise the fact that the principal aim is to introduce a market economy and free trade.
We are radically opposed to this way of thinking, which asks the Ukrainian authorities to give priority to encouraging 'private enterprise' and 'internal investments' , to establishing in Ukraine, obviously with the help of European and international financial institutions, 'a foreign investments promotion agency' , or to accelerating 'agricultural reform' and 'the transition to private ownership of the land' .
As for those recitals which ask Ukraine to strengthen its system of border controls, so as to push out even further the barbed-wire fences of Fortress Europe, they can only aggravate the tragic refugee situation.
This Common Strategy will bring with it only unemployment, social and economic catastrophe and poverty for the majority of the Ukrainian population, and will enable European investors to become even richer.
That is why I voted against this report.
For centuries, there have been attempts to join areas inhabited by Ukrainians and to divide them off from Austria-Hungary, Russia, Poland and Turkey.
In 1991, to everyone' s surprise the moment suddenly arrived.
The new, independent Ukrainian state, comparable in area and population with France, is now unfortunately a country in crisis.
I visited the country in 1995, and saw factories at a standstill, stinking trains, dilapidated trams, beggars, money that had become worthless, and political polarisation between the Central Europe-oriented west and Russian-oriented east of the country.
Things have not improved since then.
A power struggle is going on uninhibited by any sense of decency, and parliamentary democracy is being given no chance to develop seriously.
In general, I see no point in giving oppressive regimes money and simply hoping that things will improve as a result.
The rulers of these countries are keen on the advantages of trade and subsidies, but absolutely refuse to allow openness or democracy.
But the abuses in Ukraine are still less serious than those in Russia or Turkey, and resistance to them is greater.
I agree that we should in this case take advantage of the opportunities for improvement.
The report underlines the importance the EU attaches to the Ukraine.
It highlights the progress made in the country' s development and in the partnership between the EU and the Ukraine, but is not afraid to refer to matters of criticism.
I would like to discuss three aspects.
Firstly, the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1989 led to the rapid formation of sovereign independent states, a process that happened quickly, almost overnight, but which could not change the specialisation that had developed over decades or the cooperation between the various countries' economies.
Although at a different pace, the process of transformation, for which the EU also pressed, went hand in hand with social breakdown and unknown poverty for large sections of the Ukraine' s population.
The EU ought to attach greater importance to dealing with this problem in its cooperation with the Ukraine.
While the EU and the Member States pursued primarily market interests under the slogan of stability, little attention was paid to the cooperation established over many years between the CIS states, one might even say it was torpedoed.
In its own interest, the EU should pay greater attention to this factor in future and, in its understanding of how the Ukraine fits into the world economy, should also bear in mind that other CIS states are engaged in a similar process.
Secondly, the Ukraine has been given a lot of advice, and in many areas this has no doubt been legitimate and helpful.
But politics is always tied up with interests.
And if the shaping of partnership shows a strong tendency to benefit one particular party, then there is a problem.
Partnership with the Ukraine ought to promote economic stability and social security and prevent or help to reduce tension.
This is where the EU' s and the Ukraine' s real common interests lie.
Thirdly, no-one will dispute that the OSCE played an important role in maintaining stability in Europe during the cold war.
Both sides were involved in this process and both sides gained from it.
The cold war ended ten years ago, and the OSCE should now be developed primarily into an instrument for the peaceful political resolution of conflicts.
But NATO is pursuing the opposite course, basing its new strategy on strength and displays of power outside the alliance' s borders, which are steadily moving eastwards, and the EU is following in its wake.
I consider involving the Ukraine, which has a long frontier with Russia, in this strategy to be a very serious matter.
The Ukraine - and other CIS states as well - ought to be more closely involved than in the past in political processes for the resolution of conflicts.
The OSCE would be the appropriate framework for this.
With the Union acquiring new external borders, this factor will be of increasing importance not least with regard to the Ukraine.
Carraro Report (A5-0063/2001)
Madam President, the Carraro report contains the mysterious English word 'cybersquatter.'
At first sight, this would appear to be an endangered species or something of that sort, whereas it actually refers to pirate web surfers.
When you surf, you go into the sea, where there are always pirates.
And these are bona fide pirates: if Mr Fatuzzo were to take it into his head to set up a website www.fatuzzo, somebody might register his name and set up the site before he did, and then he would have to pay to be able to use his own name.
Why, though, is it that nobody has thought of distinguishing between addresses by using numbers, like telephone numbers, for that would avoid Internet piracy?
The report that we are discussing today concerns the place the Member States of the European Union should occupy in the ICANN system.
It is important to know that ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) was created in October 1998 in order to address American dominance in internet control, including DNS (Domain Name Systems) and the allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers.
ICANN consists of a 19-member Board of Directors, whose directors and external members are selected on the basis of criteria that will ensure a geographical balance.
ICANN consists of four advisory committees, including the GAC (Governmental Advisory Committee), which includes representatives of the European Commission and the Member States.
Taking these factors into consideration, it would seem obvious that the European Union must invest in order to play a crucial role in the international management of the internet, and in order to strengthen the neutrality of ICANN by means of a strong presence from the European Union, in collaboration with the United States and other governments, through the Governmental Advisory Committee.
It is also important that the Board of Directors of ICANN should be geographically representative.
Its representatives should be elected, and Africa should now be represented, so as to ensure that all continents are represented.
I must emphasise that the management structure and legal field in which ICANN develops must be based on transparency, neutrality and independence.
This means that the budgetary and financing system of this organisation must be based on criteria of clarity.
It is only in these conditions that the viability of ICANN can be guaranteed.
The Union must make sure that ICANN observes the protocols of WIPO (the World Intellectual Property Organisation) and cooperates with WIPO in its role as a negotiator and protector of rights.
I welcome the fact that the rapporteur reminds us about the importance of closing the digital divide, and of providing the widest possible access to the Internet.
In effect whenever we talk about developing new telecommunications networks, we cannot come to a deadlock on this essential objective.
Martinez-Martinez Report (A5-0057/2001)
Madam President, I greatly welcome the Cotonou Agreement, which establishes the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
As representative of the Pensioners' Party, I hope that this example will be followed by other interparliamentary assemblies, but I call, in particular, for a Working Party to be set up on the situation, standard of living and problems of the pensioners and elderly people in the ACP States.
It is of great concern to us European pensioners that the pensioners of the States who have confidence in the European Union should also live comfortably and that they should come together in joint parliamentary assemblies to resolve common problems.
Purvis Report (A5-0080/2001)
Madam President, I voted against the report on biotechnology because it pays no attention to the fundamental interests and concerns of agriculture.
That does not mean that I am against innovative access to biotechnology in general, but agriculture requires special treatment and can in no way be compared to the situation in industry.
The questions of labelling, traceability and liability are of crucial importance for farmers.
Farmers have to buy products of impeccable quality such as seed for their production.
Farmers cannot assume any civil liability for any harm caused by genetically modified products.
There must be clear rules about this.
Since this House has not come out in favour of accepting the amendments tabled in the matter by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I could not vote in favour of the report.
The principle of case-by-case assessment must apply for agriculture.
An objective and comprehensive examination must weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of introducing genetically modified plants.
Madam President, I voted for the report on biotechnology.
The Pensioners' Party and the pensioners expect a great deal from biotechnology.
They know that research is being carried out on extending the life span of human beings.
I know that this is a problem for the governments who say that there is not enough money, but we have the pleasure of living long, comfortable lives.
Mr Purvis is a living example of this: just by drawing up his report on biotechnology he has become younger, if that is possible, for he is always youthful.
We all admire him for his vivacity and his enormous enthusiasm for his parliamentary work.
He is the epitome of eternal youth and he has become even younger in the drawing up of this report, so it is true that, thanks to biotechnology, we will be able to live longer in the future!
The resolution which the European Parliament has adopted following the Purvis report on the future of the biotechnology sector seems to us to be too soothing, and often even full of pitfalls.
This is why the Movement for France delegation has not voted.
The resolution, particularly in paragraph 32, attempts to amalgamate the issue of genetic engineering in the medical sector with the issue of biotechnology in the agricultural sector, perhaps in order to make the latter more acceptable.
In reality, although both cases involve manipulating genes, the problems that arise are different.
In medicine, it is a question of helping certain individuals whose lives would be seriously compromised if they were not given such treatment.
In agriculture, on the other hand, the target is broad, or even undefined and infinite, since it involves setting in motion production methods which may affect the environment in general or the health of millions of consumers.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that genetic engineering in the medical field gives rise to ethical problems which are more serious than those elsewhere, and we note that the Purvis resolution, in paragraph 61, takes cover behind pious generalities, while avoiding specifically tackling the problem that is currently the most urgent: that of cloning for therapeutic purposes.
When voting took place, Parliament did not wish to ask directly for the abolition of the de facto moratorium on the authorisation of genetically modified organisms.
Nevertheless, it adopted a paragraph 34, which 'regrets government actions to block or delay authorisation of GM products for reasons not based on objective scientific opinion' , which may amount to the same thing, depending on what one understands by the phrase 'objective scientific opinion' .
We would feel more reassured if the resolution had clearly said which government, in its opinion, was holding up these authorisations in such a blameworthy fashion.
Another defect in this resolution is the fact that in paragraph 36 it congratulates itself on the subject of the agreement drawn up a month ago between Parliament and the Council, on the procedure for authorising GMOs.
Yet we ourselves criticised that agreement, on the grounds that it establishes authorisation procedures without establishing traceability, liability or compulsory insurance on the part of distributors.
Admittedly, the resolution also calls for testing and labelling guarantees, but Amendment No 6, which lays down liability and insurance obligations, was rejected.
Finally, as if this were not enough, the resolution calls for the European Food Safety Authority to be responsible for authorising GMOs, which we totally disagree with, because we would like each State to retain the right of international safeguard in this important field.
In the Purvis report, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy asks the European Parliament to support the major private companies in the biotechnology sector and to promote their individual interests.
It demands that Member States encourage private industry to penetrate further into universities and public institutions.
It calls upon researchers to participate in setting up private businesses.
It wants more mobility between universities and the private sector.
It welcomes the progress achieved in the financial markets and is in favour of stock options.
It invites businesses to play an active role in 'informing' the public about GMOs - as if we were not already subjected to massive ideological publicity campaigns from these industrial groups!
The resolution tabled by the Committee on Industry leads the way in favour of GMO production.
It claims that there is no objective scientific opinion on which to base their non-authorisation.
It calls for the immediate lifting of the 'effective moratorium' that is holding back the marketing of these products.
It wants field trials to be authorised, even though this would mean the inevitable uncontrolled spread of GMOs.
A few considerations on the need to draw up 'ethical guidelines' do nothing to hide the essential nature of this resolution, i.e. to oppose all the public movements that are currently campaigning on this issue.
Advocates of the further development and use of biotechnology expect all kinds of benefits.
However, they cannot prove that there are no major drawbacks attached.
Nor can opponents of a rapid deployment of biotechnology prove that the drawbacks are such that no deployment should ever take place.
The truth will only emerge in the long term, perhaps in 30 or 50 years' time.
In the meantime, patience and research are called for.
It is precisely that kind of patience that is lacking in Mr Purvis' s proposal.
On the contrary, following on from what was discussed here last month in relation to the Bowe report, he wants to make it difficult for Member States to maintain the moratorium independently.
His aim is to give scope for rapid commercial use wherever possible.
It is remarkable that the parties grouped in the PPE, which call themselves Christian, are here throwing the door wide open to something, while they are still completely unsure as to whether they will have to explain it in retrospect as an improvement on God' s creation or as a further contribution to its progressive destruction.
Instead of focusing all criticism on therapeutic cloning and voluntary euthanasia, it would have been more natural for these parties to be more critical on this of all points.
I reject the Purvis report even more emphatically than I previously did the Bowe report.
We Swedish Christian Democrats wish to emphasise that we voted against the second and third parts in the split vote on paragraph 36 which asserted - mistakenly - that 'a clear framework now exists for the release of genetically modified organisms in Europe which will ensure maximum consumer protection and environmental protection' and - also mistakenly - that 'it would therefore not be justified to continue the de facto moratorium on the release of GMOs' .
We have also actively supported, inter alia, Amendment 8 which warns against a development leading to a situation in which individual farmers or entire nations become dependent on certain large corporations dependent in turn upon gene patents.
The Swedish Christian Democrats wish to stress that personal genetic information falls under the heading of fundamental rights of privacy and that it must therefore be protected so as to prevent third parties such as private insurance companies, employers, public authorities, commercial interests and others from gaining access to it or being able to make use of it.
We have therefore supported amendments along these lines, especially Amendment 27.
As a Europe of Values we are committed to ensuring ethics, accountability and transparency as integral parts of all our dealings.
Our citizens have challenged us in the field of food production to safe food, with the guarantee of adequate precautions to ensure this goal and proper liability and penalties in place for any violation resulting in damage to the person on the environment.
We are presently living with the tragic devastating results of BSE and FMD and there is a consensus in the EU that we must re examine the very basic of our agriculture industry: There is presently a united call for re examination of the CAD and organic food production in being promoted and supported within our institutions.
In light of these considerations, I believe the EU must exercise extreme caution in embracing the biotechnology industry without the outmost care and precautions being in place.
The US, a front runner in the field of biotech Industry is itself dealing with the difficulties of rapidly progressing GM food production sector where private sector involvement has lead to a market place dominated by global companies and the devastation of small producers who cannot compete with 'corporate' farming.
The SME's of Agriculture do not appear to have been protected or supported in the world of GM food production.
I must vote against the Purvis report on a number of points.
I believe that the promise of solving illnesses, increasing yield and cleaning up the environment etc remain to be proven.
Indeed in the US, it is my understanding that many GM crops have been shown not to increase yield but even to possibly decrease yield.
Widespread genetic engineering of crops and food will surely lead to further intensification of agriculture and what of the health risks from GM products; the EU Commission has banned the use of BST (genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone used to increase milk production in the US) for health reasons.
BST is not allowed in any other country apart from the US.
There is a documented large increase in allergies to Soya which is now 50% GM.
Regarding the suggested lifting of the Moratorium on GM crops, gene transfer is now a proven fact.
In my own country of Ireland what hope is there of protected non-GM crops from contamination of this kind?
How will we be able to pursue organic food production in crops such as wheat and the cereals?
How can we determine if future proposals for labelling and monitoring are adequate when we do not, as yet, know exactly what they are to be?
Regarding the Cartagena Protocol, it must be aid that our own European Commission tried to resist clauses to introduce Cartagena into the Directive 90/220.
This report unfortunately dismisses organic food, as being at present incapable of providing enough food for Europe as it's not cost effective.
Organic producers assure me that they refute this statement.
There are many other points including an almost unrestricted Patenting system that force me to vote against this report.
Finally, as far as the ethical problems surrounding genetic engineering, the US model we are using as a benchmark has without doubt, led to the breakdown of the protection of the dignity of the human being. We are now faced with some members of our human family being used as objects for research, and the cloning of children at the embryonic stage is imminent within our own European Community.
I should like to start by paying my sincere respects to our rapporteur, Mr Purvis, who has submitted a very comprehensive report containing a very detailed analysis of biotechnologies in their various applications, from medicine to agriculture, and their various aspects, from the industrial to the ethical.
However, having said that, I must admit that I am suspicious of a certain utilitarian philosophy which tends to affirm that the ends justify the means and that, ultimately, we should just let the operators get on with it and the market will sort it all out.
I am also suspicious of an ideology of progress, which was what also inspired the Nazis and Stalinists, and feel that the ethical concerns surrounding this issue are not of secondary importance but should take centre stage because biotechnologies touch on the very heart of life in all its mystery and sanctity.
Biotechnologies are a vast sector, which ranges from the innocent use of natural fermenting agents, used since the dawn of mankind to make bread and beer, to the genetic engineering of human beings, which touches on the very essence of mankind in all its intimacy and heredity, leaving behind individuality in a bid to achieve immortality.
Mr Purvis' s report is immensely enthusiastic on the subject of biotechnologies, from which he expects wondrous benefits for mankind; to be fair, he does refer to the risks inherent in biotechnologies and to the ethical problems which they raise, but I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, so far, these benefits have yet to be proven. For now, the benefits seem to be assets for the companies alone and the risks appear to be liabilities for our citizens and the environment.
I shall close by quoting from two small articles in Mr Purvis' s report which deserve to be highlighted:
Article 60: [the European Parliament] wishes the technology to be exploited to the benefit of society in accordance with the fundamental values and ethical principles of European citizens, their culture and civilisation, and to this end sees the need to develop ethical guidelines;
Article 61: stresses that the public' s wish for ethically-motivated limits on genetic engineering and biotechnology is justified...
It is important that the European Parliament states its position on the future of the biotechnology industry, not only because this will be a key industry in the future but, particularly, because of the ethical and socio-economic issues that it raises, such as those of genetics and medicines, for example, in the case of GMOs.
Unfortunately, Parliament' s report, drafted by Mr Purvis, does not address these issues and, dangerously, acts as a biased mouthpiece for all the interests of the huge multinationals in the sector.
It follows an approach that supports, in the name of good causes, the liberalisation and increasingly widespread use of products, not all the consequences of which for the environment and human health are known, quite apart from the fact that these actions also raise far-reaching ethical issues, such as genetic modifications and the patenting of life and the environment, which is the heritage of everyone.
The approach of squeezing profit from everything, without careful assessment, leads the industry, in order to compensate for high research costs, to try to put onto the market products whose safety cannot be guaranteed and which, furthermore, create an economic dependency on the part of their users, which is what is happening in agriculture with GMOs.
Furthermore, in terms of medicines and patenting them, developing countries and the poorest parts of the population are being excluded, which is what is happening, unacceptably, as a result of the behaviour of multinationals in Brazil and South Africa.
I therefore reject this report.
This is an area in which research should be in the public domain, not controlled by private interests, since the fair distribution of the benefits and the necessary risk assessment must be guaranteed.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Access to medicaments for AIDS patients in the third world
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:
B5-0182/2001 by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, Mrs Kinnock, Mrs Carlotti and Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on access to drugs to treat HIV/AIDS in developing countries;
B5-0195/2001 by Mrs DybkjÃŠr, Mrs Thors and Mr Maaten, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on access to drugs for HIV/AIDS victims in the Third World;
B5-0202/2001 by Mr Rod, Mr Lannoye, Mrs Lucas and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on access to drugs for AIDS victims in South Africa;
B5-0212/2001 by Mr Wurtz, Mr Miranda, Mrs Eriksson, Mr Vinci, Mr Manisco, Mr Alyssandrakis and Mrs Frahm, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on access to drugs for AIDS victims in the Third World;
B5-0221/2001 by Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Johan Van Hecke and Mr Corrie, on behalf of the PPEÂ­DE Group, on the proceedings instigated by 30 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government concerning the importing of cheap drugs to treat AIDS.
Mr President, fair access to drugs to combat HIV and other diseases is, I believe, a very important issue.
If we consider that in South Africa 50% of new AIDS cases are young persons under the age of 25, that means that a 15 year-old in South Africa today has a 50% risk of infection, and if we consider the effects of that situation - that the most active section of the population is affected - on those young people and also on the country' s development, then I think it is long overdue that we say something on the subject and send a signal in the right direction.
We wish to encourage and create fair access to medicines and vaccines.
We therefore greatly welcome Commissioner Lamy' s position and that he will give his backing to the developing countries and their right to a protection clause in the WTO and TRIPS Agreements.
We must press for these life-saving drugs to be made available as cheaply as possible.
For Europe, this means supporting the transfer of technology and local production capacity.
If we are serious about global development, these are important demands and important steps that must be taken by Europe and all concerned.
Mr President, the results of drug therapy against AIDS partly depend on the question whether those drugs are administered in the correct way, at the correct time, in the correct dosage and under expert supervision.
In this, preconditions, such as a sound local infrastructure and stability play a crucial role in the approach to health care.
Drugs have an optimum effect if continuity in dispensing and expert supervision in treatment are guaranteed.
Otherwise there is a real risk of incorrect or inadequate treatment.
The combating of AIDS requires the structural improvement of local health care conditions and support from the World Health Organisation, and the work of the European Union directed to that end is therefore of the greatest importance.
Only these factors will guarantee long-term development.
In the short term many people are already dying, and for that reason a priority choice for affordable drugs now is advisable, as is rightly argued in the resolution.
This resolution refers to a greatly impoverished Africa.
The Caribbean region and South East Asia, where the problems are also considerable, must not be forgotten in this discussion.
Mr President, I feel that we can be satisfied - at least my group is satisfied - that not only is this debate being held at an important juncture when a process is under way to mobilise the international press, a process which has currently been suspended in South Africa, but it also has a symbolic value: do poor communities have priority access to medication which can relieve their suffering and delay their death or not?
This is a fundamental problem and I am doubly delighted that the main groups in Parliament have agreed on a joint text which sends out a very strong message.
The first message is directed at the pharmaceutical industries, calling on them to withdraw their case against South Africa, which is important, and the second message is that we want a clear interpretation within the framework of the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, or even for the agreement to be revised.
We must certainly welcome the fact that the European Commission, represented by Mr Lamy, has undertaken to pursue this course and I therefore subscribe to what the previous speakers have said.
One last figure to conclude: as far as AIDS is concerned, patented drugs cost about one hundred times more than generic drugs, which have the same effect but which are manufactured in countries where patents are not yet the norm.
This applies to India in particular.
This should make us seriously aware of the advantages of having a system to protect intellectual property in an area such as this, where it is vital for people to have access to medication.
I think that this process will re-launch the debate, as will the interesting position to be taken by the European Parliament.
Mr President, the French constitution which emerged from the 1789 revolution contains a duty to revolt which appears to sum up our debate perfectly.
A duty to revolt for the 34 million people with AIDS, most of whom - over 4 million sufferers - live in South Africa.
What could be more normal, in the face of a catastrophe which everyone agrees is a humanitarian, health, demographic, economic and social catastrophe, than to want to do everything to save one' s own people.
Must we reiterate that, thanks to various treatments, we have considerably prolonged and improved the life of patients in the west, while in Africa and Brazil AIDS sufferers are dying because only 5% of them can obtain treatment due to the excessively high cost of drugs.
That is why South Africa passed a law in 1997 so that its sufferers could benefit from suitable care.
I think it is irresponsible for the pharmaceutical industry to block this legislation.
During this period, 400 000 South Africans have contracted AIDS.
In using the WTO to attack Brazil, which - by using its own treatment - has almost halved its AIDS epidemic, the United States have demonstrated an equally unfortunate cynicism.
Not only should these proceedings be abandoned; more importantly, we should urgently help revise international trading rules so that they benefit human health.
Mothers of families with no access to AZT are bringing babies into the world who already have AIDS and are condemned from the day they are born.
