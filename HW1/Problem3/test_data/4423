Do we know?
We need to determine this space.
A few months ago a Turkish military aeroplane shot down a Greek military aeroplane southwest of Rhodes in European airspace, while a passenger aeroplane from Egypt was flying overhead within eye contact.
Can you imagine what might have happened?
How, therefore, shall we determine its scope, when the Turkish FIR rather than the Nicosia FIR apply when you pass over the northern section of Cyprus, which is a member of the European Union.
First determine the scope and then we shall welcome the SESAR which, in all events, is designed to speed up passenger movements.
Fine, we shall succeed in the air, but what is happening on the ground when, for various bottles, perfumes and so on, we delay another half an hour so that someone does not take an extra gramme of deodorant.
This is all stupid and ridiculous.
If you want to determine something properly, go the whole way.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of its contribution to employment and to doubling GNI in the next two decades, the new generation European air traffic management system (SESAR) will be one of the priorities of the EU and its Member States and a vital factor in meeting the challenges of the decades ahead.
It will deliver security and fluidity in air transport at European and world level, and improve the functioning of the market, competitiveness, environmental impact management and European cohesion.
I should like to mention some important points.
Firstly, the legal basis should not only be Article 161, but should be based on both Articles 161 and 163, with a view to increasing and enhancing Parliament's involvement.
Secondly, as you suggested, Commissioner, with a view to delivering efficient air traffic management and technology, without placing too great a burden on the taxpayer, private initiative, the industry, the operators and the scientific community should be guaranteed a role in the management model, and an absolutely central role should be given to the Commission and Eurocontrol, which are the partners with the biggest public responsibility in terms of financial contribution and participation in the vote.
Mr President, the European Union had to develop this system of air traffic control, bringing together the 40 different networks currently in place in the EU, as a result of the projected increase in the volume of air traffic.
That is why I believe the SESAR system to be of tremendous importance, and I congratulate both rapporteurs on their work.
As an aside, I do not believe that an EU-US open skies arrangement will be possible in the near future, owing to the outcome of the recent elections in the United States.
European governments will therefore have to strike individual agreements with the American Government in this area.
Indeed, a member of the Irish Government has signalled that this is the route it will have to take in order to put in place an aviation agreement.
I would also like it to be put on record that any such arrangement should guarantee the future of Shannon Airport in the west of Ireland, in its present form, owing to its importance to that region as a vital economic hub.
Mr President, I must thank the speakers who have all shown Parliament's interest in the SESAR project, which will have a highly beneficial effect not only on air transport, but also in terms of environmental quality and energy savings.
I should like to say to Mr Bradbourn that we have chosen the legal basis that we felt was most suitable for the purpose of this regulation.
The objective at hand is to set up a joint undertaking charged with managing a technological research and development programme.
This legal basis is Article 171 of the Treaty, as Mr Fernandez has just said, and this has been confirmed by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and by the Commission.
I wish to stress the point, as mentioned by Mr Rack, that this is an example of a good public-private partnership (PPP), with, of course, the support not only of Eurocontrol - something on which you insisted - but also of the whole air transport industry, which of course will be the main beneficiary and is therefore very interested in seeing SESAR get off the ground.
Even though this procedure provides for consultation with Parliament, rather than codecision, it goes without saying, Mr President, that I shall make it my business to keep Parliament regularly updated, in a most transparent way. As Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, the rapporteur, emphasised, we must of course do everything to prevent any delay to the programmes in question.
This is what I wanted to say. I extend a warm vote of thanks to Parliament for the invaluable help it has given us in implementing this project which, as I said before, should give the EU the best possible air navigation system.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Measuring devices containing mercury (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury - C6-0064/2006 -.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez, for her work on this proposal for what is a very important directive, forming part of the Community action to deal with mercury, the Community strategy on which was debated in this House only recently.
This has to do with our common desire to prevent more mercury finding its way into the environment, and, in order that we may have no misconceptions about this, what we are talking about here is not just any old poison, but a particularly dangerous one, for mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human health and the environment.
The object of the directive we are debating today is to prevent new measuring devices containing mercury getting into circulation, and, if we were to succeed in that, we would prevent 30 tonnes of mercury - which adds up to a very considerable health hazard - getting into the environment.
The proposed directive will prohibit outright the placing on the market of clinical thermometers containing mercury, the reason being that alternatives to them have been available for some time.
It will also prevent the sale to the general public of all other measuring instruments containing mercury.
These proposals were put together on the basis of a risk assessment and an extensive impact assessment devised for the mercury strategy, followed by consultations with the industry and with other interested parties.
The proposed directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment, but also serve to maintain and strengthen the internal market, as harmonised rules for the marketing of measuring devices containing mercury apply throughout the Community.
Members of your House have now tabled a number of amendments aimed at securing derogations.
I agree with you that the marketing of antique measuring instruments should indeed continue to be permitted, 'antique measuring instruments' being those that are at least 50 years old, and, being in the main collectors' items, they are, by reason of their value, handled with very great care, traded only in very limited numbers, and the risk of such items ending up in waste is minimal.
I can also support a time-limited derogation for new barometers containing mercury and manufactured by a few small specialised enterprises.
A transitional period of two years will enable these businesses to adapt their production arrangements to the new rules without a disproportionate risk being presented to the environment.
While I regard two years as appropriate, I have to make it clear that there is no reason for mercury to be used in the devices produced by these manufacturers, for they are capable of producing the same results without it, and, under certain circumstances indeed, a better one.
There is no argument to support the idea that newly-manufactured devices of this kind must contain mercury.
It is not the case that new technology needs to be developed first; the alternatives have been in existence for some considerable time.
These manufacturers must be expected to comply with the demands of European legislation, and I am going to be very strict about this; two years really should be enough time in which to adapt.
The situation is actually rather different as regards the use of measuring instruments in the health sector.
It has been proposed in your House that there should - subject to a review at a later date - be a derogation from these restrictions for devices for measuring blood pressure, and I do in fact believe that there should be one.
Sphygmomanometers are, in any case, used only in certain medical applications, and are absolutely indispensable in certain medical situations in which measurements are required to be of the utmost exactitude.
We have examined this question in very great depth.
Members of the medical professions regard sphygmomanometers of this kind as indispensable, especially in certain life-threatening situations, and so we should wait until safe and equally reliable alternatives to these devices have been developed before extending the provisions to the health sector.
It follows that we have not reached the end of this process; on the contrary, more work is needed in this area.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the negotiation process was characterised by close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and so the Commission can therefore agree to all the compromise amendments proposed by your rapporteur, that is to say Amendments 12 to 18.
I very much hope that we will be able to get this directive adopted at first reading.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House all agree that it is necessary to reduce the demand for mercury in the manufacture of products and to speed up its substitution.
It would be appropriate to introduce Community level marketing restrictions on mercury-containing measuring and control equipment for consumer use and, with some exemptions, in the healthcare sector
We must prevent considerable amounts of mercury entering the waste stream.
In that way, we shall contribute to guaranteeing a high level of protection of the environment and human health, whilst preserving the internal market, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty.
Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife.
Initially seen as a diffuse local problem, mercury pollution is now understood to be global, chronic and serious.
As regards a potential blanket ban on the use of mercury in all devices, which is the aim of this proposal, it should be emphasised that the experts the Commission consulted came to the conclusion that hospitals need a high level of accuracy to treat life-threatening conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmia and pre-eclampsia.
Mercury sphygmomanometers provide the appropriate level of accuracy and reliability to ensure patient safety.
We are therefore currently proposing that these instruments be exempted from the ban until there are complete guarantees with regard to the functioning of possible alternative instruments.
I would also call on the Commission to adopt short-term measures to ensure that all products containing mercury currently circulating in society are collected separately and safely processed.
Otherwise, this Directive will be less effective in practice.
Its dumping in rubbish tips or its inappropriate disposal causes waste mercury to infiltrate waste water and to be dispersed into the environment.
Mercury is therefore found in foodstuffs, posing a particular risk to the aquatic food chain, making consumers of fish and molluscs particularly vulnerable.
You said it, Commissioner: 30 tonnes may remain inadequately treated in rubbish dumps.
Furthermore, I would call upon the Commission to increase awareness within the population, through the organisation of information campaigns on the health risks resulting from exposure to mercury and the environmental problems it may cause, since I fear that the citizens are not sufficiently well-informed about its toxicity.
With regard to the amendments presented, like the majority of political groups, I hoped that there would be an agreement, as there has been with the Council and the Commission, with regard to barometers.
The agreement we have reached relates to the exemption from the obligations laid down in this Directive for scientific instruments containing mercury, such as barometers over 50 years old intended for sale or marketing on the international antiques market.
With regard to the production of mercury for new traditional barometers, we proposed an agreement: that there should be a transitional period for manufacturers to allow them time to conform to the new rules.
Unfortunately, not all of the political groups have agreed to this, although I believe that we will have a sufficient majority in this House to adopt it.
Finally, I hope that Parliament will sign up to the agreement with the Council at first reading, so that it can be applied as soon as possible and so that, in this way, the industrial demand for mercury can be reduced, speeding up its substitution with other materials that are not harmful to human health and do not prejudice the conservation of the environment.
In summary, Commissioner, I entirely agree with what you have said.
I would like to thank the Commission for its work and for the possibility of reaching an agreement at first reading.
Thanks, too, to the Council and to the political groups that have agreed with this proposal.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, may I first of all pay tribute to the work that Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez has done on this report, even though I do not agree with all of her conclusions.
Nevertheless, we have worked very well together on this.
In March this year the House debated the Commission's mercury strategy.
It asked the Commission to restrict the marketing and use of mercury in all measuring and control equipment but to allow for some exemptions.
It also called on the Commission to permit the use of mercury by the small number of professional companies in the EU that produce traditional barometers.
Nevertheless, I am sorry to say that the Commission completely ignored Parliament's wishes at that stage and went on to propose the directive that we are debating today.
This directive will ban the production of all new barometers.
As Members will be aware, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety subsequently adopted an amendment, which I tabled, introducing an exemption for this long-established traditional European art.
Along with Mr Blokland, we have retabled that amendment for plenary to consider.
I would point out to the Commissioner that we are not talking about the general introduction of new mercury into the environment - the vast majority of these makers actually use recycled mercury taken out of the environment in the production of these new instruments.
There are a very small number of SMEs throughout Europe that continue this traditional art, mainly in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Portugal and the UK.
If this directive is implemented as the Council wishes, those businesses would almost certainly be forced to close, thus eliminating places where consumers can take their existing instruments for repair and for maintenance.
Let us not forget that there are hundreds of thousands of traditional barometers hanging on people's walls all over Europe.
This directive would of course not affect that, but it could potentially remove places where people could get those instruments repaired and maintained.
The banning of new barometers will not stop pollution; in fact it could become more prevalent as the general public would have nowhere to take their instruments.
There are also some enormous loopholes in the legislation.
It is only the marketing of new devices that is prohibited.
There is nothing to stop manufacturers from selling new barometers without any mercury, along with a set of instructions on how consumers can fill them themselves.
That is surely more hazardous than allowing them to continue production in carefully controlled and licensed circumstances.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I think the case for this legislation is compelling.
The Commissioner said that there are alternatives to mercury barometers and I therefore support everything my colleague Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez has said.
Mercury is extremely toxic.
It is bioaccumulative and persistent in the environment and there is no safe exposure level.
I ask the PPE-DE Group to think again.
To Mr Callanan and the Conservatives I say that at your party conference your leader said that you want to replace dangerous chemicals with safe ones.
The Tory Party website says that you are going to do that.
You have to vote to change things and not just say you are going to do so.
I hope that the PPE-DE Group will support this very sensible measure to phase out an extremely dangerous chemical from our environment.
We have given a two-year extension to companies to phase out their production.
That is not what the Council wanted, but we have 25 governments here, experts from 25 countries, the European Commission and the majority of political groups, and I hope that the House will support the report and be consistent with the principle of substitution of dangerous chemicals.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez for her excellent report and her cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs.
I also want to note the very helpful assistance of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as well as that of the Commission and the Council in formulating a small number of necessary final compromise amendments.
Mercury, as you will all know by now, is a highly toxic substance that we all want and need to get rid of from our lives and the lives of generations to come, as soon as and as effectively as possible.
The legislative proposal will begin to put into effect the mercury strategy that we endorsed in March this year and will ban or substantially reduce the presence of mercury in various non-electrical and non-electronic devices.
Instruments containing mercury such as the household thermometer will be replaced by more accurate and versatile, quicker and safer measuring devices that do not contain mercury.
As with most pieces of legislation, some differences of opinion were encountered in the examination of this proposal.
Thankfully, a sensible compromise agreement was reached by most groups, but there are certainly still objections from some MEPs.
The problem has been the insistence, mainly by a few English, Dutch and Belgian colleagues, that modern antique-looking barometers manufactured by a very small number of SMEs in England, Holland and Belgium should still be allowed to contain mercury.
This is despite the fact that a two-year transitional derogation period has been allowed after the entry into force of the directive; despite the fact that, at the end of the two-year derogation period, the Commission is to review the availability of reliable safer alternatives that are technically and economically feasible for use in such instruments; despite the fact that barometers that are genuine antiques, i.e. more than 50 years old, would be exempt from this directive; and despite the fact that, if the compromise agreement in respect of barometers falls through, the whole legislative proposal effectively falls and has to go back to the drawing board.
Do not allow yourselves inadvertently to be used by those who might want to kill the legislation as a whole and those who might want to use the issue of barometers to promote their Eurosceptic views.
Please vote in favour of the compromise amendments and help get rid of toxic mercury, for health's sake.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, mercury thermometers have been banned in Sweden for more than 20 years now.
At long last it is time for the EU to follow suit.
Mercury measuring instruments are the technology of yesteryear.
Mercury is a gravely hazardous chemical that we must stop using as soon as possible.
Any claim that mercury is not dangerous is absurd.
Even worse is mercury that leaks, finds its way into combustion plants or in some other way is disseminated and converted in the environment into readily absorbable forms that are yet more harmful to people and animals.
We cannot, for reasons of nostalgia, continue to produce barometers that are environmental hazards.
Anyone who wants to can buy an electronic replica that looks exactly like an old-fashioned barometer.
Alternatively, they can buy a second-hand one, as the directive is about the release onto the market of new barometers.
In the compromise, barometers have been given a two-year reprieve, which is completely unnecessary from a technical point of view, as the Commissioner said, but was unfortunately necessary from a political point of view in order to make it possible to reach a compromise in the light of far too much readiness to be persuaded by industry lobbying.
Anyone voting in favour of anything other than the compromise will be sabotaging this entire piece of legislation and will be preventing any phasing out of mercury thermometers at all.
We would then have to start again from the beginning within the REACH framework.
The Commission is due to put forward proposals within the next two years for the phasing out, if possible, of other measuring equipment, in particular blood pressure gauges.
I would like to remind the Commission that the compromise states: as soon as reliable alternatives are available.
This is the case for blood pressure gauges in many instances.
Go straight home to Brussels and compile a report on restricting the marketing of blood pressure gauges as soon as possible.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, I too should like to take my turn, having thanked and congratulated Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez on her work, to urge you to support the compromise amendments designed to remove mercury from measuring devices used by European consumers.
The compromise amendments are the minimum and most realistic approach for protecting consumers and reflect the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council.
As regards the proposed exemption from the directive for barometers, I call on you to reject it.
Any such exemption jeopardises the final opportunity to limit mercury in measuring devices for which there are alternative solutions before the legislation is adopted for the REACH programme.
This specific action is of paramount importance in order for the legislation on measuring devices containing mercury to be adopted as quickly as possible.
At the same time, I should emphasise that, if the amendments on barometers - with the exception of those in the package of amendments - are accepted, the barometer industry will not achieve anything substantial other than, perhaps, gaining one or two years.
It is almost certain that the Commission, either through REACH or through comitology, will revert to its initial position, which makes no provision for barometers to be exempted.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that the package of compromise amendments follows our previous cohesive resolution on mercury for which Mr Marios Matsakis acted as rapporteur.
Our aim must again be to protect the environment and public health and European consumers.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, although mercury and the compounds produced by it, in particular methyl mercury, are highly toxic, banning the sale of mercury thermometers, including specialised thermometers and other measuring devices with just an eighteen-month transition period is excessive and unreasonable, particularly for Poland and other countries where mercury thermometers are universally used not only in hospitals but for basic home diagnosis.
Such a short transition period may have negative effects by compromising diagnosis, with the attendant health risks, and may impose additional financial strains on hospitals and household budgets, especially those of the less well off.
In Poland we have a saying, 'when man hurries, the devil smiles'.
Evidently the devil wants to get rich selling electronic measuring devices, while speaking fine words about people's health.
We are in favour of a longer transition period.
- (SK) I also welcome this report on mercury in the environment and on ways of reducing it.
We all have to agree that where a substitute for a measuring device containing mercury exists, such a device must be removed from the environment.
There is enough mercury in a single thermometer to contaminate fish in a twenty-hectare lake.
However, it is also necessary to realise that there are other devices used in the healthcare sector that contain mercury but that as yet have no equivalent substitute - for example, pressure gauges, barometers and manometers.
Mercury sphygmomanometers used in the treatment of high blood pressure or arrhythmia do not have an equivalent substitute capable of equal accuracy, and alternative methods would be extremely expensive.
Therefore, I support the rapporteur's opinion that the directive should not apply to such healthcare-sector instruments, because while we might be decreasing mercury in the environment we would also be jeopardising patients' lives.
The priority we must focus on in this legislative proposal is to reduce the amount of mercury in household waste.
It will be probably difficult, particularly in the new Member States, to ask all households to replace the thermometers they use for measuring body temperature; however, we should be able to limit their use.
Mr President, it is high time we acknowledged that mercury can and indeed does cause serious health problems.
Mercury poisoning through the ingestion of mercury-contaminated food - usually fish - is the main source of contamination in the general public.
Mercury and its compounds are not only toxic for humans: they also have very negative effects on wildlife and ecosystems.
Therefore, the restriction of the use of mercury is highly desirable.
However, I acknowledge the need to be realistic in the restriction of certain measuring devices containing mercury.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that some medical devices are being excluded for the time being from the scope of the directive.
Medical experts have indicated that in certain cases non-mercury devices may not be fully accurate, for example, for some cardiac conditions and in cases of pre-eclampsia.
It is therefore preferable to continue to use mercury devices in these limited situations until suitable alternatives are fully examined and endorsed by the medical professions, but with a time-limited review clause for suitable alternatives appropriately validated.
Given the toxicity of mercury, that is a reasonable demand to make on the industry, and I invite the industry to respond.
I support the amendment originally tabled by my colleagues, which allows for a derogation for antique barometers and scientific instruments intended for sale or trade on the international antiques market and for the production and servicing of traditional barometers using small amounts of mercury in controlled and licensed environments.
It is worth noting that traditional barometer-makers do not introduce new quantities of mercury into the marketplace but recycle existing mercury and, in this way, help to control and limit the substance - not to mention the fact that antique barometers are usually highly valued items and so even more unlikely to end up in our waste streams.
Remember that the purpose of this directive is to ban the marketing of mercury-containing devices.
It will allow the sale of a barometer with a separate phial of mercury to be added later by the consumer if we do not have a derogation for these antique barometers - a far less hazardous option in my view.
(NL) Mr President, first of all, I too should like to express my support to Mrs Sornosa who has written an excellent report.
As all speakers have said before me, given that mercury is very toxic, we must ban its use in all unnecessary applications.
Given that alternatives are available, it is to be welcomed that the mercury thermometer, for example, is consigned to the past.
Barometers are the subject of much debate, as we witnessed a moment ago.
In the Netherlands, the use of mercury has been banned since 2003, but barometers were exempt until 2005 and then, pending fresh European rules, until 1 January 2006.
This House is now arguing in favour of another two years' delay for traditional barometers, which is incredibly lenient of it.
Whilst I can, of course, imagine that this is hard news for producers of barometers to take, if we want to banish mercury altogether, we must in any event ban consumer products that contain it.
Products may break or leak, so that mercury ends up in the environment anyway.
I hope we can finalise this legislation so that the mercury ban can be introduced as soon as possible.
Mr President, across Europe barometer manufacturing has been part of our heritage for many centuries.
It often involves the recycling of mercury from old instruments.
The environmental and health threat posed is, I would suggest, so miniscule as to be out of all proportion to the devastating ban which this directive would impose on future production of barometers.
It would kill off an historic skill in return for no meaningful gain.
Thus I strongly support Amendment 19 to exempt barometer manufacturers from the ambit of this directive.
Seeking to include barometers epitomises in a way the fanatical and irrational dogma that all too often drives and brings ridicule to otherwise sensible Commission proposals.
I trust that in the name of common sense we will say no to the ban on the production of barometers.
The Commission informs me that it does not wish to speak again.
The debate is therefore closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Mortgage credit (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Purvis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on mortgage credit in the EU.
rapporteur. - Mr President, what I was trying to tell you before was that Mr Allister's speech was coming through in a foreign language on the English channel, so the English was being translated into something else, I do not know what.
I am sorry Mr Allister, but we could not make out what you were saying!
European mortgage loans outstanding amount to some EUR 5 trillion, or 45% of the EU's GDP, and mortgage lending has grown by 9.4% per annum over the past five years.
A home is usually the largest purchase made in a lifetime, and the related mortgage is the most important financial obligation most people ever have.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the Commission has focused on this area as it shifts its attention to retail financial services.
The mortgage market is fragmented along national lines and opening up this market should lead to consumers being offered better value and a greater choice of mortgage products.
There could be more opportunities for those people who currently find it difficult to get a mortgage, such as first-time buyers or people with fixed-term contracts.
It should make it easier for people moving to another EU country for work or retirement or wanting to buy a second property abroad.
For lenders, a more integrated market would offer greater economies of scale, reduce costs and lower rates for the borrower.
On the other hand, local culture and traditions have shaped the products available and consumers will not want any diminution of existing consumer protection standards.
Full harmonisation would be expensive for the industry and could limit the range of products it offers.
The industry is highly competitive within most of our Member States, so we must not take heavy-handed action that might damage this booming sector.
We want to see a European mortgage credit market with a broad range of products at competitive prices and any changes must benefit mortgage borrowers above all.
We are therefore against a grand harmonising piece of legislation.
It would be bad for consumers and bad for business.
Instead, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agrees that we should focus on targeted measures aimed at removing specific barriers to cross-border mortgages.
Any measures should only be taken after impact assessments have shown that the benefits outweigh the costs.
Non-legislative means are to be preferred wherever possible.
Our first priority should be to bring about a better European funding market.
There are a number of obstacles preventing this.
I would therefore like to see a database covering the various mortgage markets and mortgage securities, so that investors can better evaluate and price mortgage pools.
We suggest a range of standardised packages of European mortgages for trading on the capital markets.
Mortgage brokers could play an important role in helping borrowers access mortgage credit from domestic and non-domestic lenders.
I am pleased that the Commission has undertaken to assess any problems related to those credit intermediaries.
On the issue of the annual percentage rate of charge, we need an EU standard.
The majority in the committee wanted an EU standard comprising all the charges levied by the lender, but with information as far as possible regarding any other costs.
The report considers that restrictions on early repayment charges and interest rates are likely to restrict the development of new products, especially those for higher risk borrowers, as well as the development of the funding market.
Among other issues we raised are removing obstacles to the transfer of loans across borders and assessing the potential of the Euro-mortgage.
The law applicable to mortgage credit contracts should be addressed, with the revision of the 1980 Rome Convention.
On credit databases, we want to see a consistent format and non-discriminatory cross-border access to both positive and negative credit data, always subject to privacy protection.
In the area of forced sales, we support the idea of a scoreboard, comparing the length and costs of judicial processes in the various Member States.
Various professional bodies should agree on common property valuation standards.
On land registers, the report favours improving access to standardised information, as well as supporting further work on the European Land Information Service.
Tax barriers remain a problem and need to be looked at, even if their resolution is dependent upon the Member States under subsidiarity.
The European Central Bank and the Commission have the important job of monitoring the potential risks of the massive and increasing levels of mortgage debt and their potential impact on capital markets.
I much appreciate the support and input received from my colleagues on all sides of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The Commission seems to be set on much the same line as we propose.
We look forward to the White Paper next year and we hope we will be able to continue the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed so far on this important subject.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, the White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 sets out a roadmap for opening up Europe's fragmented retail financial services markets.
One of the core elements of this strategy is our ongoing initiative on mortgage credit.
The challenges of integrating European mortgage markets should not be underestimated.
Differences in product characteristics, distribution systems, consumer behaviour and many other economic, structural and indeed social factors all have a significant impact on the sector.
We should not forget that for most European consumers, taking out a mortgage is perhaps the most significant financial decision in their lives.
Given the economic and social significance of mortgage lending, the Commission has adopted an open and consultative approach.
Deliberations began in 2003 with the establishment of a forum group on mortgage credit, and a Green Paper was published in July 2005.
A cost-benefit study was published in August 2005 to provide insight into the potential benefits of initiatives in the field of mortgage credit.
The public consultation that followed the publication of the Green Paper confirmed that the Commission was on the right track.
At the same time, however, it identified areas where further analysis was required, for example on mortgage funding, before the Commission could decide on the appropriate policy responses.
Your report comes at an important moment in our deliberations.
The consultation phase is drawing to a close and we are fast approaching a time when the Commission must decide how to proceed.
I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work in preparing what I believe is a carefully thought-through and pragmatic report.
I would like to focus on some aspects of the report.
I am pleased to read that you also believe that there are benefits to be obtained from integration.
This position is consistent with our own analysis and the feedback that we have received in the Green Paper consultation.
As the responses to the Green Paper consultation illustrate, there is a lot of debate on what the right means to achieve these benefits are.
You propose a pragmatic and nuanced approach calling for focused measures accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments.
As you know, I have a strong personal commitment to better regulation with a full impact assessment identifying the problems and setting out objectives and options.
We in the Commission will be looking at the full range of tools at our disposal, not just legislative ones, in finding the most appropriate policy response to each issue addressed in the Green Paper.
I welcome the fact that the report underlines the benefits from enhancing product diversity and asks the Commission to ensure that actions do not hamper innovation and competition.
A wide range of products is currently available to borrowers in the European Union.
However, in no single country can consumers have access to a complete range of products.
In some markets, certain groups of borrowers - for example, the self-employed, or borrowers with low or incomplete credit profiles - find it difficult to obtain mortgages or are even excluded.
Barriers also exist that limit mortgage lenders' incentives to operate cross-border, thus preventing new and innovative products and processes from being introduced in other markets across Europe.
In this respect I think our goals fully concur with those set out in the report.
Mortgage credit covers many contexts and technical issues ranging from consumer protection, through mortgage funding, to property valuation and land registration, to name but a few of the issues to be addressed.
I look forward to continuing our very fruitful dialogue with Parliament on how best to address the policy challenges emerging from this in the interests of assisting the development of a genuine single market for mortgage credit that creates new opportunities for lenders and borrowers alike, and that ensures appropriate protection for what remains for the vast majority of Europeans the most important financial decision the make in their lives.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that the Commission has taken the right approach in relation to mortgages, because, as the Commissioner has said, it is probably the most significant commitment European citizens make in their entire lives: the loan to buy their own homes.
We must therefore bear in mind that we are moving towards a single market and, within that single market, it does not make much sense to have 27 different national legislations or 27 different mortgage systems.
Furthermore, it is an issue that relates to the most essential elements of the legal system of each State.
Results will not be achieved either easily or immediately; it will take some time.
In any event, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection wish to stress the importance of making progress in the legislative field.
It is not of course possible to adopt complete European Union legislation on mortgages, but it is possible to make some progress, in the field of information, for example, maximum permitted rates, repayment of mortgages at a given time, so that, when a citizen moves from one European Union country to another, they do not find themselves in a legal framework completely different to the one they are used to.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the mortgage credit market continues to be divided up along national lines.
Why is this so?
Is it because of difficulties with language, because of the different financial cultures, the legal framework, or is it because people have confidences in lenders with which they are familiar and which are on their doorstep?
What the Commission is proposing to do is to examine the possibility of harmonising the legal framework in order to increase the volume of cross-border lending and borrowing.
Such an inquiry is to be welcomed.
Even more to be welcomed is the statement in the Green Paper to the effect that extensive studies are still regarded as necessary before proposals for regulations can be made, and the Green Paper's own emphasis on the difficulty of the matter in hand.
Legal differences in the Member States are not to be found in one area alone, although they certainly are present in mortgage law, but - as both Commissioner McCreevy and Mr Medina Ortega have just pointed out - they affect many aspects of the law, among them land registration, the practices of notaries, the law in relation to forced sales, the law of contract and the protection of consumers, all of which areas of the law are interconnected.
In some of them, the European Union has no power to enact regulations, and harmonisation from the centre in one area could have seriously detrimental effects at the national level, doing, in fact, more harm than good.
What is unreservedly to be welcomed, though, is further promotion of the refinancing markets, and so I want to say an unreserved 'yes' to this being investigated and analysed and to the efforts at achieving integration, albeit primarily through convergence.
While I do not want to exclude the possibility of Europe-wide regulation, we do take a rather sceptical view of European legislation as a consequence of its capacity for destroying functioning markets.
Extensive studies are, in any case, still needed.
We also, perhaps, need to face up to the fact that this is where we reach the outer limit of what can be standardised in Europe through legislation at the European level.
I do not think this House's role as legislator is without its problematic aspects, since it, when the Commission itself says that more extensive investigations are needed, must, to some degree, stay its hand and should not be precipitate in calling for legislative initiatives - and, indeed, has not done that.
I endorse the essence of the report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to Mr Purvis for the work he has done.
The Green Paper on mortgage credit that the Commission published in July 2005 triggered intensive debate on whether the EU's legislators should initiate action, and, if so, in which areas.
Attempting to enact regulations applicable across Europe as a whole would seem to run up against very considerable differences between legal systems, and, above all, between financial cultures, but buying real property is the biggest decision on matters of expenditure that many households will take, and so the mortgage credit required to fund that is of commensurate importance.
Studies show that private customers still - despite the euro and the internal market - have recourse to a credit institution they trust, as a rule to the bank with which they have an account, and that does of course have something to do with the fact that, of all financial markets, that for mortgage credit is the most complex.
The giving of mortgage credit is therefore still carried out on a largely national, or indeed local, basis.
Of all mortgage credit, only 1% is taken out across borders, not least - or so one surmises - as a consequence of the market and tax barriers involved; further integration would represent an estimated net 1% gain for European mortgage markets - a not inconsiderable sum that would be achieved over no more than ten years.
If, then, we want an internal market in mortgage credit, we will have to guarantee that new rules applicable to it will result in a measurable added value for private customers.
One of the most important things from the consumer's point of view is the ability to compare the various credit offers before signing a contract, along with the option of early repayment of part of the loan and the conditions subject to which variable or fixed interest rates may be agreed.
The ways in which various associated charges are calculated must also be both comparable and transparent.
Any new rules must also improve the situation of borrowers with poor or incomplete credit ratings, above all by enabling them to afford mortgages.
Persons in this category include workers on short-term contracts and younger workers in particular, and these potential borrowers should not be excluded from the mortgage market.
Experience has shown that the voluntary code of conduct to which over 3 000 lenders signed up in 2003 has not, in fact, been complied with, and here too there is a need for the Commission to review the situation and take action.
In any case, though, the further integration of the EU's mortgage credit market would be beneficial not only to consumers but also to the economy.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to thank the rapporteur for a well drafted report and to emphasise the importance of the initiated discussion on a common European mortgage market.
New needs in the mortgage sector are emerging due to the rapid integration of the EU labour and capital markets, and the development of the internal market.
We think it is extremely important to duly assess the emerging challenges.
First of all, there is a need to reduce the costs related to capital increase by creating a common market for mortgage financing and offering attractive and safe investment products.
Secondly, there is a need to create favourable conditions for transition from the mortgage market of one country to that of another country in view of the increasing mobility of the labour force.
Thirdly, there is a need to suitably organise the network of brokerage consulting services in order to provide the population with better choices and better access to more flexible and modern mortgage products.
Fourthly, it is very important to enhance market transparency, as well as competitiveness, by unifying the payment procedures for various mortgage products and disclosing all costs related to the purchase of mortgage products.
Acquisition of housing is one of the major and most significant life investments; therefore, the impact of all proposals must be thoroughly assessed and considered.
Presently, mortgage crediting is mostly developed within domestic markets and is very fragmented, while development of a common mortgage market is considered to be a possibility for the banks to offer their mortgage products via their branches in other European Union countries.
Therefore, the creation of a new mortgage market will be a serious and demanding challenge for all of us.
(PL) Mr President, it is at present difficult to speak of a common European financial market.
The financial market is highly fragmented, which causes legal, fiscal and regulatory problems.
The majority of mortgages on the market are financed by the savings of small savers.
Less than 40% of mortgages are financed by the capital markets, whose share is growing slowly, although this growth is insubstantial.
In Sweden and Germany there are quite extensive markets in mortgage bonds.
In Denmark, for example, mortgage institutions issue bonds to the entire value of the mortgage credit.
While the market for mortgage credit-based bonds is strong in many EU countries, there are some countries where they do not exist at all.
Over the last decade or so this market has also advanced a great deal in Poland, and this has had a substantial effect on economic growth.
Seeing what a great impact this has had on the markets in our countries, I support the establishment of a legal framework allowing for effective portfolio transactions to be carried out.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, we are completing the consultation process launched by the Green Paper.
Creating cross-border opportunities for lenders and borrowers raises important, but also very difficult, policy questions.
There is no easy or quick fix.
Over the next couple of weeks, I will be discussing with my services the options available for moving forward.
Parliament's balanced report is an important contribution to this.
I thank Mr Purvis and Mr Medina Ortega.
The debate is closed.

United Nations Convention against corruption (vote)
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs on this report, in particular, Mrs Mastenbroek and Mrs Kudrycka, who have contributed to the final draft.
Corruption represents a serious problem for the transparent management of public affairs: it undermines credibility, increases distrust of democratic institutions and jeopardises human rights and the rule of law, allowing organised crime to prosper.
Corruption is an age-old problem of which there are many literary accounts: Cicero spoke of it as early as 70 BC.
Unfortunately, the cancer of corruption has also gained a foothold in the workings of the European Institutions.
It is worrying that the European Union Court of Auditors refuses to approve the Community budget because of serious doubts held over the proper use of funds, and it is equally embarrassing that the Belgian judiciary has opened legal proceedings against Commission employees for alleged payoffs for the acquisition of funds allocated for the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
In the same way, we see the problem of corruption in the use of the Structural Funds, as the funds are often managed for individual gain, or, as is the case in my region, the classifications are falsified, to the extent that the European Commission has had to impose fines of EUR 75 million.
This is why we believe that problems of corruption are both subtle and dangerous.
The fight against corruption must be a priority for the European Union, and, in our opinion, this Convention should also be signed by all the Member States of the European Union.
In addition, we call on the Commission and the Council to take action so that, as well as this Convention being signed, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime is also signed.
I believe that this represents a significant contribution towards the fight against organised crime, which is, unfortunately, still on the rise in the European Union.

(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Formal sitting - Georgia
Mr President of the Republic of Georgia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you most warmly on behalf of the European Parliament.
Three years ago, following parliamentary elections annulled by the regime of the time, the Rose Revolution took place in your country and history will associate your name with that revolution, Mr Saakashvili.
Led by yourself, your compatriots demanded fair elections and an end to the corruption and bad governance that was ruining your country.
(Applause)
Although the previous regime refused to accept your demands, it was brought down without a single drop of blood being shed.
'People power' prevailed and the Georgian people were able to elect you en masse as the new President.
Mr President, the European Parliament has supported democratic change in your country.
We sent a mission of observers to the elections and our Committee on Foreign Affairs had the pleasure of receiving you soon after your inauguration as President, not here in Strasbourg but at our site in Brussels.
The Rose Revolution reawakened hopes for real and free democracy in areas even further east of the Baltic, of Central and of Eastern Europe.
A year later, the Orange Revolution took place in Ukraine.
At that time the future seemed full of promise, but we are now seeing that many problems and obstacles have arisen on a journey that is certainly no easy ride.
You have achieved a great deal over the years that have passed since then, but the conflicts in the break-away regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have become worse.
It is clear that Russia is now putting great pressure on your country - I can tell you that your country was discussed at great length at the dinner with President Putin - and you now have a great opportunity, on addressing the European Parliament, to explain the situation so that the representatives of the peoples of Europe can hear directly from you about the difficult circumstances being experienced by your country and the problems relating to energy dependency on your great neighbour.
The European Parliament and the European Union as a whole fully support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of your country; there is absolutely no doubt about that.
We have also said that the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia must be resolved at the negotiating table, and by exclusively peaceful means.
There can be no military solution to that problem either.
In a resolution that we approved last month here in Strasbourg, we called upon Russia to put an end to all acts of repression and harassment against people of Georgian origin living in Russia and to revoke any measures recently taken against your country, including the suspension of all transport links and postal services.
Nevertheless, we would also call for restraint in any verbal comments from all sides that may raise the tension unnecessarily.
We believe that the Council and the Commission must find a way to help your country to overcome and compensate for the economic and social effects of the Russian measures against you.
Mr President, we would like to express the European Parliament's support for the approval of the Action Plan on the European Neighbourhood Policy by the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council, which has taken place today in Brussels.
We welcome you once again and I hope that your presence here will give us the opportunity, through dialogue, to overcome the problems faced by your country and which affect all of us.
You have the floor, Mr President.
(Applause)
(in Georgian) Thank you very much for your words, Mr President.
(Applause)
As you can see, my Georgian is far worse than your Spanish.
It is, in any case, a way of showing you how warmly you are received by the European Parliament.
The European Parliament is a friend of Georgia. It demonstrated that in its recent resolution calling for an end to attacks against Georgian citizens.
Furthermore, it hopes that your presence and your words in the European Parliament will contribute to improving the situation in terms of relations between your country and Russia.
You can count on us, Mr President.

Explanations of vote
(DE) Mr President, experts agree that the trend towards flight from the land will intensify still further over coming years, and the high death rate among farmers is a factor in that.
This disturbing tendency has also been encouraged by our misguided subsidy policy, from which, as a rule, only the big players benefit, not to mention the long years over which rural areas have been neglected.
It follows that we have to ensure that small farms and those in mountainous areas can survive, with the creation of equivalent living conditions in town and country, and that we must press on with the development of the infrastructure in individual regions and the establishment of links between them.
It is for that reason that I have voted in favour of the Daul report's adoption.
in writing. - (EL) The Commission proposal on the development of energy crops and biomass production crops endeavours to mitigate the impasses created by the new CAP in the rural economy, for workers in agricultural product processing industries and for small and medium-sized holdings, from its first year in application and which will intensify on its completion.
However, the incentives contained in the proposal and the preconditions for paying them benefit large farm holdings in the northern countries of the ÎU which have a comparative advantage due to their soil and climate conditions and size, but do not benefit countries with a dry summer climate and small holdings, because they are of a horizontal nature and deliberately overlook these differences.
In our country, for example, there are no areas which were entered into the set-aside scheme in order to be cultivated with energy crops, with the result that there is no benefit from this measure, while the surface area subsidy of 4.5 euros per decare is insignificant and is not therefore an incentive of any substance.

That is why we disagree with the proposed regulation, despite the fact that we consider the Commission proposal for the new Member States as regards energy crops to be positive in principle, because it moves in the direction of equal treatment, even though it does not constitute equal treatment.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed colleague, Mrs Descamps. on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of Canada establishing a framework for cooperation in the fields of higher education, training and youth.
This report is entirely in line with a very long-standing tradition of cooperation, and it is logical that we should create privileged relations by means of the youth of the European Union and of Canada, who are the sons of Europe.
The aim of these agreements is to strengthen our cooperation in the fields of higher education and training with Canada, on the one hand, and with the United States, on the other.
The texts therefore renew, for an eight year period - from 2006 to 2013 - the cooperation programmes previously concluded with the European Union, in 1995 and in 2000.
The cooperation agreement negotiated with Canada is designed to strengthen and expand the scope of the previous agreement, by providing a new framework for cooperation in the sphere of youth.
Renewing the previous programme in part, the new agreement concluded with the United States establishes innovative programmes leading to the creation of Transatlantic Degrees.
It aims to promote exchange schemes for students and teachers, strengthen the Schuman-Fulbright programme and encourage closer institutional collaboration in higher education.
These two agreements have proven their usefulness in the past.
Implementing them should improve the openness and competitiveness of our higher education systems for the future, while building bridges between our peoples and promoting mutual understanding.
I am delighted that our Parliament has voted in favour of the conclusion of these agreements, thereby enabling the relationships linking our two continents to be strengthened.
(DE) Mr President, the public are becoming more and more mobile; there is no longer anything exceptional about working or studying in another EU Member State, or about living in one in retirement, and so a number of complex issues and problems - which we have not yet resolved - arise with regard to social security.
Although a certain amount has been going on since the first Community rules and regulations on this subject were enacted over 30 years ago, there is still a need for action in this respect, to which I do not believe the Matsouka report does justice, and it is for that reason that I abstained from voting on it.
Businesses in the aquaculture sector, following the rapid development of the sector in indigenous species of fish and shellfish, want to get into the cultivation of non-indigenous species.
The proposal for a regulation makes provision for certain safety procedures because there is a clear danger of disrupting the natural biodiversity in an area once non-indigenous species have been introduced and released.
Nonetheless, there can be no full safeguard, especially as the data needed have been requested from the interested parties, as was the case with GMOs.
Historically, of course, for species such as carp, trout and so on, there proved to be no repercussions in the areas in which they were released.
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that this historic precedent will be repeated, whatever the efforts and safety valves.
On the other hand, the facility to import such organisms and the possible economic benefits which will accrue can be counterbalanced by fishing and/or cultivating them in countries where they constitute natural populations - in other words, with no danger to natural ecosystems.
This would also allow these countries to develop, for the benefit of their peoples too, in direct disproportion to any economic results there would be in the Member States of the EU.
In other words, the business interests would win, but [not] at the expense of the peoples in the countries of origin of the non-indigenous species.
in writing. (SV) I am of the opinion that the EU's financial aid to the fishing industry should be abolished as soon as possible and that those Member States responsible for overfishing should themselves compensate the developing countries affected by EU fisheries agreements.
Such compensation should not be paid for from the EU budget.
I have, despite everything, decided to vote in favour of the report, as it reduces the chances of national special interests influencing aid.
The United Nations Convention against Corruption is in fact the first global instrument designed to prevent and combat corruption.
The purpose is thus to create a global strategy and framework, with a range of minimum, but significant, standards, which must be applied to all parties to the Convention.
The standards should help in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of corruption and the freezing, seizure, confiscation and return of the proceeds of these offences.
The Commission negotiated this agreement, which is based on elements of the Convention that fall within the scope of the Community's competences, and concluded those negotiations in September 2005 on the Community's behalf.
I therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement. I am very disappointed, however, that three Member States - Sweden, Slovenia and Estonia - have yet to sign up to the Convention.
I hope the ratification process carried out by the Community, and by the Member States that have yet to do so, is concluded at the earliest opportunity.
I wish to highlight the vital importance of this Convention entering into force as quickly as possible.
Once this happens, more effective action can be taken to prevent and combat this type of crime.
in writing. (SV) It is unacceptable for the EU now to attempt to bind all its Member States to a third party in an international treaty.
The whole idea of the United Nations Convention against Corruption is one based on voluntary participation and respect for the national right of self-determination.
The rapporteur, Mr Catania, has chosen to cite 26 assorted articles in his report as support for the proposal.
None of these articles accord the EU the power or competence to enter into a legally binding treaty with a third party.
The EU should instead focus on the widespread corruption within its own institutions. Internal corruption within the EU is a growing problem that is in the process of eroding citizens' trust in the whole European idea.
The June List believes that the EU is exceeding its powers and is therefore voting against the proposal as a whole.
This report is one that, naturally, I voted in favour of.
The battle against corruption around the world is an essential objective for the good governance of all members of the international community, and in turn, a key factor in peace and development.
Quite apart from ethical and economic considerations, there is a salient point that makes the fight against corruption on a world scale a key factor in international relations.
Countries with corrupt governments are governed by rules, criteria and interests that are incompatible with those of sustainable development, cooperation and peace.
To tackle them is to tackle one of the causes of conflict and poverty.
It is not enough, however, for us merely to sign up to conventions of this nature.
What is needed is for this fight to form part of our criteria for action at international level, not least in the area of cooperation in which the EU plays such a significant role.
That is why I voted in favour.
in writing. - (PT) The Commission's proposal, on which this report is based, is aimed at bringing Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 into line with the European Council Agreement of 15/16 December 2005 on the financial perspective 2007-2013, as regards the capping of allocations from the Cohesion Fund, and as regards the exemption of Portugal from the application of the cofinancing requirement for the amount of EUR 320 million.
Under the terms of this agreement, the amount of EUR 320 million to be awarded to Portugal would not be 'subject to the requirement of national cofinancing' 'in light of the specific difficulties of Portuguese farming'.
The provision of a 'national envelope' in the context of a global appropriation provided for by the new rural development instrument (EAFRD), and the doubling of the originally proposed amount, increased on account of the exemption in recognition of the difficulties faced by Portuguese farming, were, for Portugal, among the most positive aspects of the new political agreement that was reached under the UK Presidency as part of the lengthy and difficult negotiations on the financial framework for the next period 2007-2013.
I therefore voted for the Mulder report, which advocates the adoption of the Commission proposal before us.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the common agricultural policy (or 'rural development', as we will be calling it from 2007 onwards) should be abolished.
This week (the week commencing 23 October 2006), the EU's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth time in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EUR 105 billion from EU budget had been used correctly or for the purposes intended.
Aid under the agricultural policy is one of the biggest problem areas to monitor, and there are great problems with monitoring in certain sectors, such as aid for olive oil production.
This cannot go on.
The running tap that is EU funding must be turned off.
We have therefore voted against this report.
in writing. This report approves the Commission's proposal to make two changes to the rural development financing mechanism in line with the December 2005 European Council's agreement on rural development funding for the period 2007-2013.
Conservative MEPs condemned the December 2005 agreement and therefore cannot support proposals originating from it.
The British Government squandered a golden opportunity to achieve a fairer distribution of rural development funds and allowed certain Member States, even at that early stage, to allocate for themselves substantial sums of the already reduced amounts.
Ultimately, the UK ended up with only 3.5% of the funds available for the EU-15.
The proposal in question allows Portugal to exempt itself from the obligation to cofinance the amounts it secured for itself at the December Council.
Conservatives believe that this sets a dangerous precedent.
In addition to general considerations concerning the need to bring agricultural policy and the funds awarded to farmers increasingly into line with the objectives of rural development, a further reason for my vote in favour of this report was that the exceptional situation faced by Portugal has been acknowledged and that the requirement of national cofinancing has accordingly been removed.
Clearly as a consequence of the question I put to the Commission, Portuguese farmers, Portuguese farming and the potential for rural development have recently been hindered by the Portuguese government's inability or unwillingness to take action, with large amounts of funding going unused.
For this reason, this special case is well justified.
I voted in favour of the Lienemann report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy, because this Marine Strategy Directive will duly implement the proposals of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme on promoting the sustainable use of the seas and marine ecosystems.
A significant proportion of European citizens live in coastal regions and depend on the sea for their livelihood, whereas for others it is a place of leisure.
Developing national marine strategies - aimed at achieving good environmental status, and at protecting and preserving the most vulnerable marine ecosystems and biological diversity - will make it possible to maintain activities in the marine environment at levels that are sustainable and that compromise neither the uses and activities of future generations nor the capacity of marine ecosystems to respond to natural and human-induced changes.
in writing. (PT) We welcome the initiative to establish an action framework in the area of marine environment policy, with the appropriate financial resources.
Given its strategic importance, the Member States must set out assessment strategies and environmental objectives for their marine environment, in collaboration with the other Member States or with third countries, this after all being an issue in which one country's actions may have a knock-on effect in other countries.
There is a key question throughout this process, and that is who owns and manages the sea areas to which this directive applies.
Both the proposed directive and the amendments adopted today in the Lienemann report begin with the definition of 'European marine waters', which fails to clarify what our exclusive economic zone is and what the role of each Member State is in this context.
As regards the creation of supranational bodies, there is no indication as to whether this is a decision that can only be taken unanimously on the basis of the principle of sovereign States with equal rights or whether, contrariwise, this can be imposed by a majority as proposed in the so-called European Constitution.
Given the lack of clarity on these issues, we abstained from the final vote.
The purpose of the 'Marine Environment Directive' is to establish a high level of protection for Europe's seas and oceans, to extend our knowledge of this heritage, on which there remains a great deal to discover, and to define a management strategy based on an integrated approach, with qualitative and quantitative objectives aimed at reducing the pressure on marine resources and their ecosystems.
I wish to highlight the reference to the need for EU cofinancing of measures to be carried out in order to enforce the directive, and their inclusion in the budgets from 2007 onwards.
This measure is very important for Portugal given that it is a country with an enormous exclusive economic zone, the largest in the EU, which therefore involves high costs.
Approving the change to the deadline for achieving the objectives set out - from 2021 to 2017 - as proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is indicative of Parliament's ambitious attitude to this issue and the extent of its commitment to seeking 'good environmental status' for the marine environment.
The remaining measures provided for, which are aimed at ensuring the sustainability of economic activities involving the seas and oceans, protecting biodiversity and preventing pollution, also proposed by the PPE-DE, are also highly important, improving substantially upon the Commission's proposal ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption at first reading of Mrs Lienemann's report on the 'Marine Strategy Directive', an essential document that is in line with the Framework Water Directive (FWD).
However, I would like to say that I am not convinced of the feasibility of the timescale that has just been adopted.
Indeed, we do not yet have sufficient knowledge of the marine environment in order to reach a true assessment of the environmental situation of European seas within the shortened period.
As we are witnessing with the implementation of the FWD, the preparation and analysis phase is always difficult and longer than anticipated.
Moreover, the marine environment is by no means characterised by rapid change.
I therefore feel that the timetable proposed by the Commission is already sufficiently ambitious.
in writing. - (PT) We welcome the initiative of a marine environment policy as part of the cooperation and coordination that is needed between different countries, whilst ensuring that full sovereignty over territory and resources is safeguarded for each country, and that economic, social and environmental aspects are taken into account.
The preservation of fisheries resources has been put in jeopardy particularly by marine pollution and by the large volume of shipping, both of which affect fishing.
Fishing itself is just one of many factors, and certainly not the most significant one.
Fish stocks, and the regeneration thereof, are an indispensable component in ensuring the future of fisheries; without fish there is no fishing.
Fishermen are therefore the most important stakeholders in protecting and regenerating the marine environment.
Against this backdrop, stock recovery measures must, with appropriate funding, involve much-needed economic and social compensation for the sector and its workers.
The key issue is respect for the Member States' sovereignty, in particular over their exclusive economic zones and their ability to implement independent measures to defend their fisheries resources.
Lastly, although the marine strategy and the CFP need to be closely linked, the latter must not impose its structures on fishing structures.
in writing. The marine environment requires protection and conservation.
The conclusion of Good Environmental Status should be welcomed.
However, in supporting Amendment 91 we clarify that oil and gas exploitation in the marine environment can continue, subject to international rules.
The contribution of the oil and gas industry to the Scottish economy is important to recognise.
Mr President, mercury is a highly toxic and dangerous substance.
Eliminating it from all uses, especially household uses, where there are adequate substitutes is an eminently sensible proposal, supported by all 25 governments in the Council.
Yet the PPE-DE Group, egged on by the British Conservatives, has voted to allow extra exemptions for precisely those products which are likely to find their way into household use, which is the most dangerous place for them.
That does not square with what David Cameron is saying back home in Britain, or even with what the Conservative Party website says about its commitment to phase out dangerous chemical substances.
I hope at least that the British Conservatives, after weeks of campaigning against so-called 'diktats' from Brussels, will now refrain from using such language.
They will have seen today that the outcome of European legislation is being determined by a democratic vote in this Parliament, rather than by European Commission 'diktats'.
Even if they express no regret over what they have done today, I hope they will at least desist from using that sort of vocabulary when campaigning on such issues.
in writing. - (PT) This proposal follows on from the 'Community Strategy concerning mercury' adopted in January 2005 and is aimed at reducing the use of products containing mercury by banning the marketing of devices containing mercury.
Once this report is adopted, the marketing of all measuring devices will be banned and the Commission's original proposal will be amended so that the new regulation can enter into force as quickly as possible.
Excluded from this regulation are products that are already on the market, devices regarded as antiques and collectors' items, and barometers, the manufacture of which should be duly licensed, and which may be phased out.
The use of traditional barometers in Europe is very low, as is the total amount of mercury that they account for.
Their exclusion and that of measuring instruments over 50 years old from this proposal is an important measure, because it protects existing small manufacturers, and because the mercury is usually recycled and reused.
Had they been included - thereby hammering the final nail in the coffin of the traditional barometer manufacturing industry - there could have been contamination and unforeseen flows of mercury...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
I voted in favour of the Sornosa MartÃ­nez report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury.
In view of the highly toxic nature of this substance for human beings, ecosystems and nature, restrictions are needed on the marketing of these products.
This will help prevent substantial quantities of mercury from entering the waste stream and will contribute to a high level of protection of the environment and human health.
Devices containing mercury must be replaced wherever there are safer alternatives on the market.
Exceptions may, however, be authorised in cases where there are no alternative solutions yet available and in rare cases of keeping traditional barometers, museum collections and industrial heritage.
in writing. I voted for this report to limit the use of mercury - a highly dangerous substance.
I was astounded to see the British Tory MEPs vote against a ban.
This runs counter to their leader David Cameron's explicit commitment to banning dangerous chemicals.
It is sad to see that the Tories hold the health and safety of future generations so lightly.
Once again they say one thing at home and another thing abroad.
in writing. A Lancet report published in the UK last week highlighted the dangers of toxic chemicals for the health of the unborn and young children.
Mercury is extremely toxic, bioaccumulative and persistent in the environment.
There are no safe exposure levels and yet mercury is getting into our waste stream from discarded household products containing mercury.
That is why Labour MEPs agree with the 25 EU governments and the Commission that mercury should be phased out in all but essential uses.
We are opposed to a permanent exemption for mercury barometers because substitutes are available, but we proposed and will support a longer, two-year phase-out period for mercury barometers to allow industry to adapt to the new law.
in writing. - (FR) In January 2005, the European Parliament approved my report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 by a very large majority.
Its recommendations included the progressive banning of a number of chemical substances which, like the mercury used in dental amalgams and in non-electronic measuring and checking devices, are extremely worrying in terms of human health.
They need to be replaced by safer alternatives.
Indeed, the 33 tonnes of mercury used each year in the European Union are, like other heavy metals, the cause of neurological illnesses affecting children, in particular.
In our societies, where chemicals are ubiquitous, public health absolutely must from now on be the first consideration.
That is why I regret that - notwithstanding the opinion of our rapporteur, Mrs Sornosa - 327 of my fellow Members have seen fit to limit the bans whereby items such as thermometers and barometers that contain mercury and are intended for the general public could no longer be placed on the market.
Tomorrow, however, it will be necessary to go further and to call for the 25 Member States to take ambitious measures to ensure that mercury in all its forms disappears from public places as vulnerable as maternity hospitals, day nurseries, hospitals and schools.
Mr President, this vote shows that reform of the common agricultural policy still faces stiff resistance from vested interests every step of the way.
Despite such resistance, step by step reform has already led to a relative decline in CAP spending and a switch from spending on price support to support for more environmental improvements, income support and rural development. Export subsidies will also be phased out.
But further steps down this path remain necessary.
They will be achieved, despite the resistance displayed by the votes today.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party today refused to support the Goepel report on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments.
The report rejects the proposal tabled by the Commission, on the basis of an agreement with the Council, to increase the flexibility of the common agricultural policy (CAP) basing it more closely on actual national conditions.
This is a ridiculous position for Parliament to take, and one that we cannot support under any circumstances.
The CAP currently discriminates against all of the new Member States including the Czech Republic.
The rapporteur's reference to the principle of prohibiting discrimination thus makes a mockery of all farmers in the new Member States. Discrimination against these farmers is actually taking place.
This year they received 35% of appropriations in direct payments, as opposed to the 100% received by farmers from the old Member States, and this explains why we voted as we did.
(DE) Mr President, my apologies for not having been paying enough attention earlier on.
What I wanted to say was that I very much approve of Mr Goepel's - our rapporteur's - approach and the line he has taken, and that I do not quite understand why the Commission is being so stubborn in holding to its own.
I hope that we will, over the next two months, which the new timetabling arrangements have now made available to us, be able to find ways and means of preventing any renationalisation of agricultural policy at a time when money is needed right across the Community, and I will endeavour to work towards that end.
I believe there should be room to negotiate, and I hope that the Commission will have a more sensible attitude to that.
It goes without saying that the Dutch Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of more modulation, of transferring funds from the first to the second pillar of the agricultural budget.
Modulation is, from a social democratic point of view, a considerable improvement on the unfairness of the present income subsidies.
Indeed, the biggest farmers receive disproportionately a great deal more than the others.
Moreover, income subsidies are inefficient, because they insufficiently increase farmers' spending power.
Rural development offers more opportunities for all people living in the countryside.
Young and old need good facilities, a strong infrastructure and a diverse economy.
Rural development is also in the interest of the large majority of farmers.
Although voluntary modulation is less desirable than compulsory modulation on account of the possible distortion of competitive relations between European farmers, the Dutch Labour Party can go along with it nevertheless, because it represents a step in the right direction.
The Council has taken a decision, though, without walking the most basic democratic path first.
The European Parliament has not been heard about this major intervention in the budget.
The unfortunate fact is that, due to this democratic deficit, it is impossible for us to support the motion for a resolution, and we have therefore abstained.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against the rapporteur's position and therefore in favour of the Commission's legislative proposal because 'modulation' - that is to say, the possibility of transferring up to 20% of appropriations granted to farmers receiving more than EUR 5 000 per year from the first to the second pillar of the CAP - is an essential instrument for introducing a measure of justice into the distribution of agricultural aid.
We wish to point out that in Portugal only 5% of farmers receive more than EUR 5 000 per year.
We fail to understand how the current situation can be preferable to the alternative proposal of 'voluntary modulation'.
We, the undersigned to this explanation of vote, advocate that the ideal solution would be 'compulsory modulation', which we believe to be inevitable in the short to medium term.
Given the alternative put forward, we find its rejection by Parliament incomprehensible.
In Portugal's case, the proposed mode of application would make it possible to increase rural development aid by some EUR 50 million per year, which would benefit many farmers who are currently excluded from any support.
The central thrust of this report is that the Commission's proposal is not a proposal for genuine modulation.
Such a proposal would increase aid to those who receive the least, or receive nothing, at the expense of those who receive a large amount, the purpose of which is to ensure greater fairness in the distribution of aid among producers, countries and holdings and to support small and medium farmers and family farming.
We feel that the Commission should table a fresh proposal in order to create genuine modulation, which would guarantee greater fairness and release financial resources by introducing a maximum limit to aid per holding (capping) and a percentage increase in aid for farmers who receive the least from the CAP (modulation), for example, by proposing a 15% to 20% increase for farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 in aid and, in addition to this figure, taking various circumstances into account.
Without this, there is a risk that existing inequalities will be exacerbated.
We therefore urge the Commission to recast the proposal in order to ensure that a decision on this issue does not ultimately lead to the renationalisation of the CAP.
Hence our vote against the report, in the hope of paving the way for a new proposal.
in writing. - (FR) At a time when the EU is facing an upsurge in nationalist sentiment, the Commission's proposal to introduce a voluntary modulation of direct payments within the framework of the common agricultural policy signals a new stage in the disintegration of Community solidarity.
Faced with this danger, Parliament had to respond and make its voice heard in order to reaffirm the commitment felt by the representatives of the European nations to defending the 'common' character of the EU's public policies, of which the common agricultural policy is the most potent symbol and the most successful achievement.
With this in mind, I voted in favour of the Goepel report, which was presented today in plenary, and, in particular, in favour of the explicit request outrightly to reject the European Commission's proposal.
This position, which expresses the opinion of the majority of Members present today, reflects Parliament's clear and unambiguous desire not to betray its vision of the future Europe and not to make of the CAP an adjustment variable intended to compensate for the reprehensible weaknesses of a European budget crippled by the EU Member States' lack of ambition.
It signals the demand to retain a system of support for producers. Based on the principle of equity, this alone is capable of guaranteeing the future survival of viable and competitive European agriculture characterised by solidarity.
in writing. (SV) We are voting against this report, but we are abstaining from voting on the Commission's proposal in this area.
The explanatory statement in this report contains a number of views such as criticism of the common agricultural policy being abandoned or renationalised - something which the June List would find desirable - and of it contravening the European Parliament's right of participation, a view that the June List does not share.
In addition, the explanatory statement maintains that the 'health check', or the 'mid-term review' as we prefer to call it, of the long-term budget planned for 2008/2009 should only form the basis of proposals for the financing period after 2013.
The June List absolutely does not share this view.
We believe that the mid-term review must lead to cuts in the agriculture/rural development budget as early as in the budget period currently at issue, 2007-2013.
Following the Council's offer to the Member States of the option of voluntarily modulating 20 per cent of the agricultural direct payments from the first to the second pillar, this was incorporated into the Commission's proposal and will, without doubt, have cuts in agricultural subsidies as a consequence.
The Council, Parliament and the Commission had, in the Financial Perspective, agreed to review the EU's expenditure on - among other things - the common agricultural policy, but not before 2013.
Our farmers need the security to plan ahead if they are to remain competitive, and so it is now that we must ensure that the money set aside for the agricultural budget until 2013 remains unchanged, and that those funds will indeed be spent on agricultural activity.
It is unacceptable that farming families should, through compensation payments, get better financial support in one Member State than in another.
The object of European agricultural policy is to secure European farmers comparable economic conditions in a single market.
Since the Commission's proposal was not preceded by an impact assessment that might have brought to light any unequal treatment, it is impossible for Parliament to endorse it.
I voted 'no' in the hope of making the farmers' demands felt.
The Commission is preparing a new attack on small and medium-sized farm holdings in its proposal to reduce direct payments by 20%.
Transferring 20% of resources from the first pillar, in other words direct payments, to the second pillar, which is basically reaped by businesses and large holdings, means a reduction in income support for small and medium-sized holdings.
The result will be to speed up the eradication of small holdings and the concentration of agricultural production in fewer hands.
In numerous cases, agricultural production and employment will even shrink, without being compensated for by the development of second pillar activities.
As regards the proposal for this transfer to apply voluntarily, on the one hand this will create twin-track farming and, on the other hand, the prospect in the immediate future will be of the voluntary transfer becoming compulsory.
This sort of modus operandi has been used in the past.
Farmers in Greece are experiencing the adverse impact of the new CAP.
Tobacco production has fallen by 70% and sugar beet crops by 40%.
The completion of the CAP will have the same adverse impact on other basic crops in my country.
Today's proposal will be yet another blow to the cumulative and major problems of farmers, which is why we reject it.
The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the Commission proposal whereby it would be possible for the Member States to apply voluntary modulation within agricultural policy, and we have thus voted against Parliament's report, which rejects the Commission proposal.
It must be emphasised that the Danish Social Democrats would prefer to see comprehensive, compulsory modulation.
Since, however, it has not been possible to reach agreement to that effect, we see voluntary modulation as a serviceable alternative.
It must be emphasised, however, that compulsory modulation - involving the long-term abolition of direct subsidies - continues to be the objective.
in writing. The CAP requires continued reform.
It is disappointing that the Commission's proposal to introduce voluntary modulation of the CAP has been rejected.
The introduction of voluntary modulation of the CAP would have provided for a sustainable approach to rural development.
I hope that all those Members who have a direct interest in farming declared their interest and did not vote on this measure.
in writing. The Conservative delegation voted for the rejection of the modulation proposal presented by Lutz Goepel to give the Commission a chance to come forward with something better.
We strongly object to the deal that Prime Minister Blair cobbled together last Christmas at the European Council which reduced the single farm payments made to English farmers in order to fund rural development schemes.
My farmers in the Witham and Maldon area - around Coggeshall, Terling, the Teys and the Tolleshunts - as in other parts of England, want a fair deal from the common agricultural policy.
Voluntary modulation of 20%, top-slicing the single farm payment, will mean that our farmers are likely to be 20% worse off than even their Welsh, Scottish and Ulster counterparts, let alone the French.
My farmers have no confidence in the British government, through either DEFRA or the Rural Payments Agency, being able to make payments on time, accurately or indeed to be able to make the payment at all to many individual farmers.
Furthermore, there is now a danger that the UK will be fined by the European Commission for its ineptitude, and farmers will pick up the tab.
Our rural community needs a fair deal and they are being completely short-changed by an incompetent Government.
in writing. (PT) The purpose of this Commission proposal, as confirmed in this report adopted today, is to set up a public-private partnership (PPP) to create a European air traffic management system.
Such a PPP would set a dangerous precedent, given that it would be the first European PPP with the European Community's participation.
We do not wish to call into question the need for air traffic management systems to be constantly updated and enhanced, in order to make them more reliable, more accurate and, most importantly, safer, given their importance for the safety of all those who work in and use air space.
We feel, however, that this objective is not best served by subjecting it to the interests and pressures of the private sector.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
We are very disappointed at the rejection of the draft amendment to which we put our name in the Committee on Transport and Tourism (the committee responsible for delivering an opinion), which was aimed at safeguarding the interests of bodies representing employees in the air traffic management sector in decisions taken in the Board of Directors of the joint undertaking.
Consequently, we could not support this report.
The joint project for a new generation European air traffic management system gets my vote.
It is particularly in my capacity as rapporteur on the extended powers of the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) that I wholeheartedly endorse the Community's declared objective of guaranteeing a high-performing air safety infrastructure that will make possible the safe, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly development of air travel while making use of the technical advances of such programmes as GALILEO.
According to current predictions, the volume of air traffic in Europe is set to double by 2025, and this makes it necessary that communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, which are still transmitted via radio, should be brought up to the latest state of the art.
I also advocate a public-private partnership, in which the European Community would participate, in order that SESAR's long-term success be secured.
I have abstained from the vote on the report by my esteemed colleague, Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil on the euro zone in 2006 since, though it puts forward some very interesting analyses, I regret the fact that it does not raise the issue straightaway of the development of the euro from a technical currency to a political tool benefiting growth and employment.
The monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) seems to be at odds with reality: the exchange rate should normally be strong when there is strong economic growth and should depreciate when there is weak growth.
The fact is that, in Europe, the opposite has been true since the start of the 1990s.
While the Member States are undergoing reforms, the quest for zero inflation through an inappropriate monetary policy is leading Europe to record mediocre results in terms of economic growth.
If this state of affairs continues, at a time when the price of raw materials and of energy is rocketing worldwide, we will have zero inflation and zero growth, and manufacturers will end up setting up their businesses in the dollar zone.
With everything that is happening, it is as though the ECB is disregarding economic policy, while its US counterpart is thinking of nothing else.
As we know, the creation of the euro was a political decision that took no account of the specific needs of the members of the euro zone. This view is borne out by the differences, in relation to 2005, among those Members as regards economic growth, unemployment rates and inflation.
We have always stated that, with a single monetary policy, given the budgetary restrictions arising from the Stability and Growth Pact, the workers would have to carry the can for the problems associated with adopting the euro, in order to serve the interests of economic and financial groups.
The report before us makes this very clear: 'Labour markets should be made more flexible and those aspects of the legislation on permanent employment that may act as a barrier to labour market adjustment should be removed.'
In other words, it is promoting the liberalisation of redundancies and fixed-term contracts.
It also calls for 'wages to respond more rapidly to changing economic circumstances', or in other words for wages to be reduced depending on the cycle.
These intentions could not be clearer.
Not satisfied with this, the rapporteur also promotes the liberalisation of services and energy, the strict application of the Stability and Growth Pact and compliance with the Lisbon agenda: the very blueprint for the European neoliberal consensus.
Hence our vote against the report.
in writing. (SV) Even though Sweden decided, through a referendum, not to participate in economic and monetary union (EMU), we have chosen to vote against the report and would like to take the opportunity to explain why we have done so.
The report provides a clear picture of how EMU goes hand in hand with the creation of an EU state.
According to the report, macroeconomic policy between the countries of the euro area is to be coordinated, and the euro area is to speak with one voice in international financial institutions and fora.
The report advocates better fiscal, especially budgetary, coordination and the coordination of national fiscal calendars.
Moreover, the objective of introducing a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in Europe could be achieved through the mechanism of enhanced cooperation if Member States were unable to reach unanimous agreement.
We can only conclude that the representatives of the 'no' campaign in Sweden's EMU referendum in 2003 were entirely correct in their argument when they pointed out that EMU was a major step on the road to a United States of Europe.
in writing. The Conservative Party policy in relation to the euro is clear and unequivocal: we are firmly committed to keeping the pound.
We have no desire to be part of the single currency, but neither do we have any wish for the project to fail, as we believe that there is a UK national interest in there being a strong European economy with a stable currency that provides a good trading environment for British business and industry.
In line with our long-standing position on matters relating to the euro and euro area, I and my British Conservative colleagues have abstained on this report.
in writing. As an oceanographer, I am delighted to support this report on the Strategy on the Marine Environment.
The EU has for too long collapsed rural policy into agricultural policy.
Finally this has begun to change in a positive way to recognise that farming is only a minority, if important part, of the rural economy.
We face an identical problem with respect to maritime policy.
It has been seen as fisheries policy writ large, but now, with the Commission Paper on maritime policy currently out for consultation - I recently participated in a conference on the subject in Weymouth organised by the South West Regional Development Agency - this report and the Lienemann report voted earlier today, it looks as if we are going to finally move away from a one-dimensional maritime policy to a policy that embraces our seas, oceans and coasts as vital for food and the environment, transport and tourism.
in writing. (SV) In this commentary on the strategy on the marine environment, the rapporteur brings up many interesting and important issues.
One example is when he states that the Common Fisheries Policy must meet the requirements for sustainable development, whilst those Member States that wish to adopt more urgent measures in order to protect a particular stock should have the opportunity to do so.
Amongst the negative aspects of the report are the comments on funding; the rapporteur is concerned about the lack of resources with which to implement the strategies, the implication being that resources from the Community budget should be contributed for this purpose and that it would be a good idea to use resources from, for example, the Structural Funds.
We have made the judgment that the positive elements in the report outweigh the negative ones and we have therefore voted in favour of the report in today's vote.
in writing. (PT) This own-initiative report is aimed at creating a single European market for mortgage credit and the promotion thereof at cross-border level.
The banks and the capital markets have a major interest in this issue given that in 2004 the volume of outstanding loans was EUR 4.7 billion, equivalent to 45% of the EU's GNI.
This is very much a growth market.
The report follows the neoliberal line.
It provides for more competition in the sector, European or cross-border mortgages, a secondary market for mortgage credit and the possibility for it to be negotiated on the capital markets, cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the financial services sector, the opening-up of this market to institutions other than credit institutions, guaranteed freedom to provide services and the liberalisation of these services, restrictions on the State's ability to regulate, online marketing of mortgage credit and access for foreign organisations to customer credit databases, including non-compliance.
It is not difficult to see the risks involved with all of these proposals, in terms of market volatility.
This would jeopardise mortgage assets, that is to say, the savings of many workers and other home buyers.
We therefore voted against the report.
It goes without saying that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of opening up markets, including the market in mortgages.
I am therefore well disposed towards the Purvis report, which suggests investigation into different measures that might benefit the consumer through, for example, competition among mortgage lenders, but I have no choice but to vote against it on the grounds that the report is not very clear about the different systems of tax benefits when mortgages are concluded, and particularly harmonised.
This is an exploratory first proposal in which, above all, the call for further analysis is prominent.
The legislative phase is a long way off.
Since the mortgage market falls within the scope of the free movement of services, I support the creation of an internal market for mortgage lending.
I refuse, though, to lend my support to the harmonisation of the system of tax deduction of mortgage interest via a backdoor in Brussels.
Time after time, politicians stress that Europe must look after the core themes and cross-border issues, but this statement by the European Parliament is at odds with that.
Most of its Members do not appear bothered about the fact that tax policy is not one of the EU's competences.
That is why the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy delegation in the European Parliament deemed it necessary to vote against paragraph 45 of the Purvis report and, indeed, against the report as a whole.
I find it regrettable that, since none of the big groups dared apply for a roll-call vote on this matter, the European citizen can only guess how individual MEPs have voted.
in writing. I welcome the Green Paper on Mortgage Credit, which explores how competition in the EU mortgage market could increase consumer choice and reduce costs.
Consumer confidence in banks is of paramount importance.
Therefore the willingness of a borrower to deal with a foreign lender will be determined not only by the competitiveness of the mortgage, but also by the level of consumer protection that will apply to the foreign lender.
Ireland enjoys a relatively sophisticated mortgage credit market in EU terms, including access to the full range of competitively priced mortgage products.
Expansion of this market across borders may develop naturally through subsidiaries or branches abroad on a more widespread basis, if the market is encouraged in other areas.
Therefore I believe that legislative intervention should only be used as a last resort and to address proven market failure.
I fully encourage the Commission in creating electronic land registers which can be accessed online.
The fact of the matter is that lenders cannot enter other markets without absolute certainty regarding the security of their collateral.
Given the experience that many citizens have had purchasing overseas property, an online register reflecting all relevant charges affecting property ownership rights is vital.
in writing. - (FR) There are 25 national legislations governing mortgage credit, and soon there will be 27 standing in the way of a common European approach.
This Green Paper issued by the European Commission will finally make it possible to carry out proper studies of this issue and to go for the sensible options.
Any Community measure concerning the European mortgage credit market must, above all, be of direct benefit to the public. However, consumers often come up against too many obstacles, be they legal or economic.
In voting in favour of the report by Mr Purvis, I opted for making the mortgage credit market accessible to a larger number of potential borrowers.
In the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I had, in this connection, personally pushed for its rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, to take account of borrowers with insecure and insubstantial credit profiles, workers on fixed-term contracts and first-time buyers.

Legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2007 (debate)
The next item is the debate on the legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2007.
President of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, when the lights went out across Europe last week, our interdependence as Europeans was laid bare for all to see.
In a flash, greater integration ceased to be some abstract ideal. For millions of our citizens, it became a necessity.
The incident - dare I say it - was illuminating.
The argument for more Europe has not so much been won, as rendered superfluous.
It is now clear to everyone that we face more shared challenges than ever before - thanks in part to the forces unleashed by globalisation.
And shared challenges demand shared solutions, whether they relate to growth and jobs in an increasingly competitive world, climate change, energy security or, indeed, international terrorism.
We can be proud of our response so far to this rapidly changing landscape.
First, we renewed the Lisbon Agenda and placed the emphasis squarely on growth and jobs.
As a result, it was possible to restore confidence in the Stability and Growth Pact, putting it on a more realistic and workable footing.
Europe's leaders agreed to put globalisation at the centre of its policy agenda, and the Commission has been busy equipping the European Union with the tools it needs, and using those tools, on a whole range of concerns that European citizens share.
To boost growth and jobs, the European institutions have continued work to unleash the full potential of the single market.
At the same time, we have renewed our commitment to social solidarity, including the setting-up of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, a useful shock absorber for the powerful motor of globalisation.
To ensure that Europe thrives in the knowledge economies of tomorrow, innovation became a central part of our economic and social strategies and today innovation is at the core of the concerns of European leaders.
The establishment of the European Institute of Technology will help reverse the fragmentation of research, education and innovation efforts, which has stunted progress so far.
The document 'Europe in the World' tackles the need to develop a global voice which matches our economic weight in the world.
This will also reinforce our efforts in areas where we have already exerted leadership, notably in the debate on a future international climate change regime.
And we have successfully steered Romania and Bulgaria towards European Union membership.
We have proposed the two new Commissioners and allocated the portfolios.
One will be responsible for consumer affairs and the other for multilingualism, to protect and to reinforce European cultural pluralism and diversity.
Intercultural aspects are more and more important in the Europe of today.
I am very proud that this further step - Romania and Bulgaria joining the Union - has taken place and that my Commission has made an important contribution to it.
I think we should all be very proud of what has been achieved through successive enlargements.
Let there be no doubt: in centuries to come, historians will say that enlargement was the greatest instrument for peace, prosperity and stability of our generation.
(Applause)
On that note, I would like to say it is more than time we stopped talking about 'old' and 'new' Member States.
More than ever before, we are now one Europe, united in all our diversity, and that is something we should celebrate.
We have also laid the groundwork in many other areas that concern us all - sustainable development, maritime policy, and energy efficiency, to name just a few.
We still have much to achieve by the end of this year.
I hope that the European Council will approve the enlargement package we adopted last week.
We need to move forward on immigration and innovation policy and we still have important proposals to adopt in areas like labour law, copyright levies, neighbourhood policy, CO2 emissions from cars and emissions trading.
So the first years of this Commission, working in a spirit of partnership with this Parliament, have meant renewing, reorienting and re-tooling, to create a Europe of results, a Europe fit to face the shared challenges of the 21st century.
These efforts are already bearing fruit: growth has been revised upwards to its highest level in six years; unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since we started collecting EU25 data in 1998.
Now 2007 - the year we celebrate 50 years of European construction - will mark a turning point.
It will mark the moment when a Europe of 27, after careful preparation, throws the full weight of the Union's re-tuned machinery behind the delivery of solutions to our citizens' shared concerns.
It will mark the moment when a new budgetary framework unlocks modernised financing programmes, which move towards Europe's new agenda.
So this is the context for our 2007 Work Programme.
It is a new type of programme that has greatly benefited from input from this Parliament, the Council and the other institutions: valuable input that will continue with this debate and the resolution you adopt.
This Work Programme addresses many of Parliament's concerns that have been conveyed to me and to the Commission.
This new Work Programme is more political.
It is focused on a smaller list of 21 strategic initiatives.
The Commission is committed to delivering all of these next year, and they will not be subject to a mid-term review.
A second list of priority initiatives fills out our work in other important areas.
In addition, we have responded to calls from Parliament to include a list of simplification measures and withdrawals of legislative proposals in the Work Programme. This underlines the message that Better Regulation is now an integral part of the Commission's day-to-day tasks.
Today, in the College meeting, we adopted our strategic review of Better Regulation that takes stock of progress to date and sets out an ambitious programme of new initiatives. This includes new action in the following areas: impact assessment, where we will establish an Impact Assessment Board; simplification, where we will add important new initiatives to our rolling programme; and administrative burdens, where we will suggest a target to the Spring European Council next year to cut such burdens at European Union and Member State levels by 25% by 2012.
In parallel, we will present an action plan in two months' time defining priority areas for action.
We are also continuing to screen, and in a number of cases withdraw, pending proposals.
We are recommending that future Commissions do the same at the beginning of their mandates as an expression of the changed political composition of a new Commission, so showing the importance of political legitimacy and political leadership.
This review responds to a very large extent to the priorities of the European Parliament, as expressed in several reports earlier this year.
I hope you will give your full endorsement to this package, including to its practical implementation.
So what does the 2007 Work Programme feature?
Let me highlight some key areas, those I believe to be politically very sensitive.
First, energy.
Building on our Green Paper and measures for greater energy efficiency earlier this year, we will present the first ever Strategic Energy Review for Europe.
This will include the building blocks for an integrated European Union energy policy, for example measures to complete the internal market for electricity and gas; to accelerate take-up of new low-carbon technologies; and to diversify and secure supplies both within and outside Europe.
The goal is a common European energy policy that will ensure our security of supply, while maintaining Europe's competitiveness and safeguarding our environmental objectives.
Closely linked to this - in fact I could say they are two parts of the same agenda - will be action on climate change.
We will put forward options for a European Union climate change policy and perspectives for international cooperation post-Kyoto.
A revision of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will provide greater stability for investments and accelerate the momentum to cut greenhouse gases.
Europe's demographic squeeze calls for greater efforts to attract economic migrants, particularly those who are skilled.
A European regime for labour immigration will give such migrants a secure legal status, while clarifying their obligations and their rights.
In order to reduce illegal immigration and exploitation of workers, this will be coupled with a clampdown on unscrupulous employers of third-country nationals who enter Europe illegally.
European public policy can have a fundamental impact on the way people live their lives.
To be effective, it must be properly attuned to the needs of modern society.
The Commission will undertake a fundamental stocktaking of European society, which will serve as a basis for European policy-making into the next decade.
As I have said several times, Europe is more than a market.
Europe without the concept of solidarity is not really a European Union.
(Applause)
Our core business, in terms of our competences under the Treaties, will not be forgotten either.
The Commission will continue to defend, extend and modernise the single market.
A key target for 2007 will be the defence industries and markets, which have been fragmented for far too long.
We will also set out the way forward on services of general interest in the coming weeks.
A final area of concern to all our citizens is security.
The Commission will bring forward additional measures to combat terrorism, with a particular focus on fighting terrorist propaganda and the sharing of expertise - on explosives for example - for terrorist purposes.
The year 2007 will also mark a turning point in our search for an institutional settlement.
The Berlin Declaration, marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, will allow Europe's leaders to renew their commitment to an enlarged, global and competitive Europe, where solidarity is a central principle.
I believe it should be a short, sharp political declaration, affirming what unites us and - above all - making clear where we want to go and what we want Europe to be for the next 50 years.
Following my initial proposal, I am happy to see that everything is now moving in the direction of having a joint statement, a statement by the Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament, thus showing that the commitment to the European Union is today a shared commitment of the main political institutions of our Union.
I am pleased to see that the search for an institutional settlement is also a priority for the German Presidency.
So I am confident that the elements are in place for an important breakthrough.
This is important, because Europe needs an institutional settlement.
There are indeed serious costs derived from not having a constitutional treaty.
We need the constitutional treaty because, as a European Union, we need to be more effective in our decision-making, more coherent in our external action and more transparent and democratic in our working.
Make no mistake: the Commission will be an active player in the search for solutions here.
When this Commission took office, there was unfinished business to deal with and to reform.
With the help of this Parliament and the Council, these things have been dealt with, put behind us, or turned around: we now have the financial perspectives; we now have the revised Stability and Growth Pact.
In fact I hope tomorrow we can say we will have the revised Services Directive, to be approved by a parliamentary vote.
That shows that we are solving some of the planning problems and proposals.
It has been hard work, but it is already bearing fruit.
The 2007 Work Programme builds on these new foundations.
So we can conclude the work on decisions that were already in the pipeline but also launch new, very important, projects for the work of Europe, such as energy policy.
For the first time we have the chance to have a real common approach to energy, to be more ambitious in the fight against climate change, to look at the entire field of justice and at the fight against illegal migration.
This is a new frontier for Europe and we need to take a European approach.
So we see that Europe is on the move.
There are problems.
We know the problems that exist, but there are great possibilities and there is, more than ever, the need for a strong Europe.
So as we celebrate Europe's 50th anniversary next year, we can do so with much greater confidence.
Once again, I believe Europe will be able to show its relevance by reinventing itself for the 21st century.
To show our commitment to practical results and to working hard for a stronger European Union, this can be a fitting birthday present for the 50th anniversary of Europe, a birthday present for Europe and all its citizens.
(Applause)
- Broad policy guidelines
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, I should like first of all to congratulate the European Commission, which is presenting us with a much more political programme today and which, for the first time, is going all out for simplification by presenting a reduced number of priority sectors in its legislative and work programme for 2007.
That will be useful to us in a year that promises to be crucial for the European Union, as it is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome.
It will indeed be necessary to breathe new life into European integration by renewing the link with our fellow citizens.
You are, indeed, presenting to us a series of 21 strategic initiatives - perhaps rather too many for some people - which will be at the heart of the Commission's activities in 2007, as well as a series of priority initiatives which will have to be adopted in the course of the next 12 to 18 months.
This legitimate demand for flexibility appears, at least to our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to entail two possible disadvantages.
Firstly, the drawing up in parallel of two lists of priorities inevitably creates some confusion concerning the relative importance to be attached to each type of objective and concerning the links between the two categories.
Secondly, spreading the programme out over 18 months means that there is a danger of slowing down the work of the Commission. Our group therefore believes that it would be more appropriate to retain annual, twelve-month, structuring and, above all, to require ourselves to respect the deadlines, something that does not always happen at present.
We also need to remain alert to the fact that many of the ambitious objectives announced by the European Commission need to take account of the budgetary provisions in force.
Nor must pointless structures constantly be created.
I am thinking, for example, of the creation of new agencies in order to solve this or that problem.
One has the impression in the end that, when no solution is found to a problem, the decision is taken to create an agency.
That being said, a number of agencies manifestly continue to be effective, on the model of the European Medicines Agency.
Before going on to create other structures, however, let us firstly take stock of the existing structures. Otherwise, you are in danger of one day proposing to us the creation of a new agency designed to divide up and supervise the agencies in each Member State.
Do we really need to have 27 agencies because we shall have 27 Member States?
Costs must remain reasonable and produce what our Anglo-Saxon friends call proper value for money, that is to say a sound cost-benefit ratio.
The Commission's work programme also emphasises the importance of impact studies and re-states the Commission's intention to create a new body responsible for supporting such studies and monitoring their quality.
Parliament will keep a watchful eye on these impact studies and emphasises the need for objectivity so that they are carried out with the greatest possible transparency.
In order to improve European competitiveness, we shall ensure that there is a reduction in all forms of bureaucracy and that any superfluous legislation is done away with.
In this area, it is important to involve the European Parliament more and to improve the ex post evaluation of the measures adopted.
For this reason, Mr President, our group believes that the number of strategic initiatives needs to be reduced so as to avoid the pitfall of having too many of them. There is indeed a risk of moving away from a practical work programme - a development that could harm the European Union.
Our group is nonetheless very pleased with the six priority areas defined by the Commission for 2007.
I shall not go back and list these priority areas, but I should like to emphasise a number of points, including the energy issue.
The European Union's growing dependence where energy is concerned is a factor of which account needs to be taken from now on, and that is all the more the case since last week's power failure.
The EU will have to seek other means of reducing the harmful effects of energy dependence.
Our group believes that energy efficiency, the increased use of renewable sources of energy and a structured dialogue with the producer countries and with consumers will enable this objective to be achieved.
A number of studies suggest that the European Union could create a million direct and indirect jobs in the energy efficiency sector.
Thus, not only would the search for greater efficiency enable the European Union's economy to save considerable sums. It could also make a major contribution to competitiveness and employment, which are key objectives of the Lisbon agenda.
We would also ask the Commission to continue to play a pivotal role in the fight against global warming, which has consequences in economic and social, as well as strictly environmental, terms.
The European Union will have to bring all its weight to bear in requiring the use of certain ecologically more effective products.
What is more, 2007 will be the year of an important new stage in the historic process of enlargement of the European Union, as it is then that our Bulgarian and Romanian friends will join us. Moreover, you yourself, Mr President, have just told us that enlargement of the EU is the most important tool for peace of the last fifty years.
It is therefore essential for these priority areas to be seen as challenges that will have to be taken up. It is also, however, a question of communicating more with all Europeans.
Our group welcomes, moreover, the Commission's initiative in making communication one of its strategic objectives.
In conclusion, I would point out to you that, having arrived at the half-way point of our term of office, we almost want to say: let us stop talking about programmes, as our fellow citizens hate lists of promises.
The watchwords are: action, more action and still more action.
Mr President, we are ready to support you as we go down that route.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you, as I have done, read the Commission programme for 2007 carefully, you will actually say, with some satisfaction, that this is a good programme.
If all this becomes reality, we will be able to be satisfied, proud and happy.
Nevertheless, though, one gets, on reading it, the feeling of having been here before, of having read it already.
Where, though, I asked myself, and so I had a look in my archives and dug out the legislative and working programme for 2006. Aha, I knew it: I really had read all this before!
I then came to the conclusion that this is not an argument against the 2007 programme; on the contrary, indeed, it is actually evidence of continuity in the ideas that the Commission is putting forward to us today, and there is nothing wrong with that; it is not a bad thing, for the goals set out in the working programme are good ones.
Yes, indeed, climate change is the number one challenge; that energy policy must be central in the coming year is not a matter of doubt.
Since all those who hold power under you are present here, Mr President of the Commission, let me tell you and them, speaking as a father, that the safety of children's toys is indeed important, and vitally so.
Doing away with roaming charges will be a tremendous thing; as one who uses the phone a lot, I am behind you all the way on that.
Reducing bureaucracy is vitally important if we are to make the EU more efficient.
All these things are important, and I could turn to any and every one of your Commissioners and tell them: 'your portfolio is the most important of all!'
Nevertheless, I ask myself the question as to why, when we are doing all these good, right and important things, we are not getting through to people.
Why is it, then, that, despite all these things, people are not enthusiastic about the European project?
I think I have found the explanation for that.
For years on end, the radical free-marketeers, not least in the Commission, have been telling us that all that is needed is to deregulate, to do away with the rules and regulations, and leave it to the market to sort everything out.
They have been telling us that the internal market will create the economic dynamism that we need in order to create jobs, to guarantee living wages on which people can live securely, but reality is something else!
Yes, go on, applaud!
It is you radical free-marketeers who, with the deregulation of the European internal market, have enabled us to achieve the highest unemployment figures that Europe has ever seen; that is what the reality of this internal market has turned out to be.
(Applause)
That, Mr President of the Commission, is why something you have said, in this debate, something you have said for the first time in a long time, may well be more important than the work programme as a whole, and the important statement that you made was that, without solidarity, without social responsibility, the internal market will not come to be.
If that is the line that the Commission is taking, if that is the spirit motivating your working programme, then you have our backing.
Mr Poettering's spontaneous applause shows that he is both Christian and social, and I think your statement is one of the most important that you have made to this House for a long time, and it is for that reason that the approach you have set out today is a good one.
(Interruption: 'CDU, not CSU!')
While we are talking about this strategic work programme, perhaps I might say something else to the President of the Commission about his new Commission, for the Commission sitting here is an old one, to be joined by two new Commissioners.
I have read, Mr President of the Commission, that you want to give the Romanian candidate the job of Commissioner for Multilingualism.
I am sure that, as the hearings progress, I will find out more about what is meant by that, but I have to say that I think it rather insubstantial.
The multilingualism portfolio is not worthy of Mr Orban, nor does it make sufficient demands of a Commissioner, and so I do not understand why he is being given such a thin portfolio.
I surmise that it reflects the view that we have to watch out for Europe's diversity, that we have to safeguard and sustain the European Union's multilingual character, and that we think is absolutely the right thing to do, so why not create a proper portfolio for it?
Something that this House has had to discuss over and over again during the last few plenary sessions is the threats facing minorities in the European Union, among them a growing potential for extremism, not least of a right-wing nature, for xenophobia and anti-Semitism, for minorities, even in the European Union, are increasingly under threat, under attack, and in need of protection.
Minorities, and, for example, their languages, are a sign of the diversity that makes Europe so strong.
It is for that reason that I recommend to you that you give some thought to expanding this portfolio and including within it not only multilingualism, but also the protection of minorities in general.
That would make it all the clearer what you intend to achieve by it, and then - or so I could well imagine - you could get even wider support for this proposal in this House.
Speaking in general terms, I would have been glad if the Presidency of the Council had been present to take note of the Commission's strategic work programme, for many, many things that the President of the Commission has come here with his Commissioners to put before us can be realised only if the men and women in the individual governments of the EU, whom the Council represents, put into effect those things that the Commission proposes and we enact.
Their absence from this debate is symptomatic of their attitude towards this European Union.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioners, researchers into time found out this past week that the second half of life passes much more quickly than the first, and that which is true of life is also, of course, true of the lifetimes of legislatures, so, since your Commission has not much time left, it should be all the more ambitious in its approach to doing its work.
What that means in terms of the work programme is that it ought to have been the prelude to a final spurt, aiming high and promising speed.
Can that, though, be said of this document?
The Liberals and Democrats take the view that it cannot, for it ushers in nothing of the sort.
Let me begin, though, by talking about the good things we have found in your programme, like the focus on the reduction of bureaucracy, on the assessment of the costs that legislation will entail, on simplification, in other words the emphasis on better lawmaking - and certainly on less of it; that is a very good thing to aim at, and in that respect we are wholeheartedly behind you.
What I want to say for the benefit of those who fear that the EU is turning into a neo-liberal, completely deregulated market economy - and in saying it, I will also highlight Mr Poettering's spontaneous applause for something Mr Schulz mentioned as an example of what the Grand Coalition is all about - is that those who think the EU is a neo-liberal market economy probably also think that Cuba is a democracy.
Now for my second point: you prioritised communication with the public, and that, too, is something we think is a good thing; we are glad that you are doing this, for, if the EU loses its basis and fails to build a citizens' Europe, then it will not achieve anything worth mentioning either.
The EU needs the public as its constant partner in dialogue; it is on them that a single European Union will be founded.
If I may turn to the structure of the document - and Mr Schulz should read it more carefully - it differs substantially from last year's, in that it is clear how the text and its annex fit together, whereas their failure to do so last year was something of which we were critical.
We urged to you to make the connection between the two clear, and you have managed to do so, so many thanks for that.
It even specifies the legal basis for each legislative initiative, and that, too, makes a great deal of difference - and you provide explanations of them, which makes the whole thing so much more manageable.
Why, though, are the existing legal acts, the ones to be continued in 2007, not listed alongside them?
Why, too, does the structure not make it even clearer what is about legislation and what is not?
Why, then, are you - in essence - changing the picture?
Let me add something on the subject of multilingualism.
I have heard speculations in this House to the effect - Mr Barroso - that this was your very subtle way of highlighting the possibility of there being too many commissioners, and that this portfolio was intended to show this up in, so to speak, a symbolic way.
In the course of this debate, my colleagues will be discussing the various policy areas, energy, climate change and legal policy among them, but I would like to take this opportunity to give you an idea of what overall impact your programme has had on our group.
We very definitely see ourselves as having the role of accompanying you in your work in a spirit of constructive criticism, and that, of course, means cooperating with you, but with an emphasis on constructive criticism.
We see this programme as a puzzle with many individual pieces, one that cannot really be put together in such a way as to produce a big picture.
We cannot find in it any clear policy guidelines, nor any answers; not even attempts at answers to the big questions facing the EU in the shape of enlargement and the constitutional treaty.
Nor can we understand why it is that there is not one word in the whole document about humanitarian aid and help with development, areas in which the EU is the biggest player on earth, so why are they not mentioned?
Even though your Commission has not achieved much - to put it politely - where the completion of the internal market is concerned, you are carrying on down the same path, and there is no evidence we can see of a holistic and comprehensive approach.
Innovation, too - which is quite crucial to Europe, being at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy - is mentioned, so to speak, only in passing and in terms of the European Institute of Technology and the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
Our view is that what innovation needs most of all is freedom and the right conditions rather than institutions and more support measures, which tend to take us in the wrong direction.
This year's programme does not, in fact, have a title.
Why not, then?
It does rather give the impression that not only are the pieces of the puzzle difficult to put together, but also that some of them may well be missing.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in drafting these few lines on your work programme, I wanted, in the brief time allotted to me, to draw attention to the draft Constitutional Treaty's motto, 'Unity in diversity', as I think that, in the current international and European political context, we have more need of unity than of diversity in the European Union.
We need unity, and it is for the Commission in particular to be the standard bearer for this unity.
I also believe that, in view of the current weakness of a divided Council - I am thinking, for example, of the failure of the Working Time Directive - we do not expect the Commission to anticipate the divisions of the Council but to be bullish in the proposals it is to put to us.
When objectives are not achieved and when self-imposed obligations to produce results are not met, there must be no question of lowering one's sights or reducing one's targets. On the contrary, more resources have to be demanded and, in these conditions, I think that you will have Parliament's support.
Of a number of areas to which the strategic priorities shared by ourselves apply, I want specifically to quote the example of the subject on which my group has probably worked most during the last two and a half years, namely that involving the climate, energy and transport.
We have sent to your department and to the departments of your colleagues details of an energy policy strategy that would enable us to achieve a 30% emission rate for CO2 and greenhouse gases between now and 2020.
Mr Barroso, the European Union must fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, but it is not at present doing so.
That is why we think it necessary to put restrictive arrangements in place, similar to those with which we are familiar in connection with budgetary discipline. By that, I mean that the European Union should not only assume obligations in terms of results but also give itself sufficient resources.
That is why we think that the emissions trading system needs to be improved and to be coordinated by the Commission and that it needs to be possible under the system to impose sanctions on Member States that do not respect their own objectives.
In the case of renewable sources of energy, we think that the Commission needs to propose sectoral objectives and not only general objectives.
As for energy efficiency, we are waiting for the Commission to propose a revision of the 'Buildings' Directive to cover all buildings. As Mrs GrossetÃªte has indicated, the construction industry also creates economic activity, as you well know.
In this area of the climate, energy and transport, we must, in other words, reduce gas emissions, reduce dependence on energy imports and reduce the risks.
It is because of this last concern that we continue to be opposed to nuclear power.
We must finally, in Nairobi, make serious preparations for 'Kyoto 2'.
I should like to quote another example where European unity should be in evidence: the imperative need to introduce common minimum social standards at European level.
We cannot give up this commitment.
That is why we want the Commission to propose a framework directive on services of general interest.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, even though I do not doubt that the Commission's staff, in drafting the work plan for 2007, did their work with great exactitude and precision, I have to say that I do not think that either the priorities for the work to be done or the tendencies it highlights really respond to the demands of the present time.
They have to do with problem areas for which the EU does indeed bear responsibility, but which go well beyond its bounds.
I am thinking here of such priority areas as poverty, social exclusion, growing inequalities and divisions in society, or, indeed, the commercialisation of social life, the destruction of nature and culture, and of such issues as the loss of democracy, repression, war, militarisation or, speaking more generally, the way in which global problems are addressed and commitment to the achievement of the millennium development goals - something that we ought particularly to care about in view of the fact that the UN has again found that the number of people going hungry is increasing further.
The fact is that these problems and conflicts are not at the heart of the work programme, and it is not on them that the Commission is concentrating its efforts.
Despite the good things in the working programme, which we certainly endorse, I do believe that its being put into effect will entail these problems getting worse, for what is still central to the Commission's efforts is the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, which has competitiveness as its objective, and I believe that will lead to global social and economic problems becoming more acute.
There is no room in all this for the question of social models, which we in this House have debated for so long.
What that ultimately boils down to in the Commission's work is the issue of greater flexibility, and I have to tell Mr Barroso that such a narrow view will not, I think, enable the social dimension of the European Union that he has announced to become reality.
There is a second priority area that I would like to address.
It is stated in the programme that what economic life demands is more internal market rather than more regulation, and the programme prioritises the creation and development of a European internal market for armaments.
Perhaps I might make bold to ask that someone might tell me of just one deficit within the European Union that this European internal market in weaponry, thus created and brought in through the back door, might actually remedy, and also inform me as to who actually authorised the Commission to develop one.
It was, after all, not least because of something of that sort that the draft constitution failed and was rejected.
I regard this as irresponsible, and I think that adjustments are needed here as a matter of urgency if policy is actually to be developed in the European Union instead of people merely throwing slogans around.
These adjustments must result in people once more being able to identify much more strongly with the European Union.
General statements about people's fear of the dismantling of social services are of no use to us: we have to actively do something to counteract it.
What people need is real projects and initiatives; that is why we have to address the real issues.
There are alternatives, though, and I believe they can be summed up in three projects: making the EU democratic, making it socially and environmentally sustainable, and making it into a force for peace, one that endeavours to resolve global problems democratically and in a spirit of solidarity.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome President Barroso and the Members of the Commission to the Chamber.
Two points struck me immediately in the speeches and comments I heard earlier on.
Firstly, when did it become a sin to be radical; when was it ordained that we should not try to create something new and different and, when we see mistakes, not try to right them?
In particular, the fact that we live in such a rapidly changing world brought about through innovation and technology requires a more rapid response from the European Union to ensure that we can defend as best as possible the interests of all EU citizens.
Secondly, there are obviously going to be carry-over issues from one year to the next on which agreement has yet to be reached.
We have already seen this when dealing with the Services Directive over the last six years, where even now we are only at second reading.
We will have to deal with many more issues like that.
I would, however, like to make three points.
Firstly, with regard to the Lisbon Agenda, there is still so much lacking in terms of the necessary legislative framework that must be put in place to make Lisbon a reality.
The whole area of innovation, research and development is one that we talk about a lot, but in which concrete legislative action to protect design, patents and copyright, and to allow for proper investment in research and development, in financial terms, is still lacking.
I have spoken many times in this Chamber on the European Institute of Technology and the wonderful advance and focal point for excellence that would represent.
However, this is the positive side of things, and we seem to be regressing in other areas.
The Commission is talking about a harmonised taxation system, but wherever harmonised taxation has taken place it has been contrary to good competition, economic growth and employment growth.
Tax competition within the European Union has been healthy for growth and has been beneficial and of assistance.
One must of course have a level playing field as regards state aids and other similar areas, and we do have this.
We can quite rightly bring Member States under control when they go above and beyond what is allowable as regards assisting industries or assisting employment creation opportunities.
However, taxation is solely a national interest issue.
It is one that still requires unanimous agreement, and I think it behoves us to stand up and say that the legal bases of the Treaties do not allow the Commission to come forward with a proposal for tax harmonisation.
They do not allow it to force countries to increase taxes, and they do not allow it to force countries to lower taxes.
Finally, the CFSP has been one of the European Union's key successes.
Take Kosovo, Africa and other developments around the world, where the European Union has responded positively to putting peacekeepers and police forces in the field and to promoting other constructive developments on the ground.
We must continue to enlarge and expand that role.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is just as well that the Commissioners do not have voting rights. Otherwise, we could soon be voted down in this House.
It is also good that the Commission is proposing more voluntary coordination through communications instead of binding rules, but I fear that the compulsory dimension will, rather, come from the European Court of Justice and from the Commission's own use of rules governing competition and state aid.
That is, of course, what the Commission has done, for example, with its communication on music rights.
Parliament had adopted one position, which the Commission did not like.
The Commission then turned to matters relating to the abuse of monopolies and adopted a communication instead of rules, which it would perhaps never have been possible to adopt.
The European Parliament and the national parliaments should demand that all draft communications be submitted to them.
In that way, we can make it known whether we want to have binding rules or a cocktail of communications and of decisions by the European Court of Justice.
I wish to commend the Commission for having, every week since 15 September, sent proposals to the Member States for submission to the proximity and necessity test.
As far as I know, the parliaments have not, however, responded once.
How lazy can they be as representatives of the people?
On Monday and Tuesday, the national parliaments will come together for the COSAC meeting in Helsinki and they should not miss the opportunity to put some order into the jungle of laws from Brussels.
Let all the specialist committees and European Affairs Committees colour-code every single proposal: black, if the national parliament wants to see binding EU laws; green, if there are to be minimum provisions with the option of better protection for welfare, health, the environment, the working environment, security, consumer protection and animal welfare; yellow, if the desire is merely for voluntary coordination instead of binding laws; and red, if the EU is to steer completely clear of a matter.
With colour-coding like that, it would be very easy for the Commission to see at a glance what is wanted.
In this way, it would be possible to obtain bottom-up European cooperation instead of the centralism that we have at present.
(NL) Mr President, I gather from the work programme that the Commission - and I quote - would like to listen more to the citizens in order to involve them more in the policy process.
As the Dutch cabaret artist Wim Sonneveld might have said: nou breekt m'n klomp, 'that takes the biscuit' - or something very like that.
Perhaps I might remind the Commission that the European public, to whom it is referring, has already made its opinions abundantly clear, for example about the so-called European Constitution, and that they have, by means of referendums, consigned this project to the wastepaper basket in the Netherlands and in France, and that the Commission, despite everything, repeated only a few weeks ago that the spirit of this Constitution - whatever the citizen may think - should in any event remain intact.
Listen to what I have to say about citizen involvement but do not, whatever you do, judge me by my actions.
Incidentally, there is no reference in the document to the petition of a million European citizens about the travelling circus, swallowing up millions, that is the European Parliament.
I know, strictly speaking, it should be the Council that should be lectured on this, but the Commission - which interferes in God knows what anyway and whose own budget, moreover, is being slated year after year by the Court of Auditors - could have sent out a signal about the fact that the European citizens are fed up to the back teeth with the Eurocrats' squandering of money and enjoyment of privileges.
We should no longer keep quiet about this.
Then there is public opinion to consider.
It is indisputable that the European citizens reject en masse the accession negotiations with Turkey - which is not a European country - and yet these negotiations are simply continued, undoubtedly also beyond December.
