The aim of my report is to minimise the dangers and risks to health and environment that arise from the use of pesticides.
Firstly, I would like to stress that the use of pesticides is linked to the development of malignant tumours or immunological and other neurotoxic defects.
That is why I found it surprising (unfortunately it was a bad surprise) that in its text the Commission mentions only in passing the health risks posed by the use of pesticides, in particular by their cumulative effect.
Pregnant women, children and foetuses are the group most at risk.
Although I am in favour of protecting plants, I think that first and foremost we have to protect people's health.
There is clearly a connection with climate change.
Global warming will bring more pests: we cannot continue endlessly to increase the amounts of pesticides used.
The National Action Plans containing the Member States' individual targets in terms of risk reduction are the most important part of the whole process.
I consider the proposal in which the Commission rejects the quantitative use reduction targets to be insufficient.
The phrase 'to reduce hazards, risks and dependence on pesticides' is imprecisely defined and will not prompt the Member States to lower the amount of pesticides used.
The Thematic Strategy is a general text and does not offer a detailed solution for calculating the amounts.
However, my colleagues and I propose the following for the directive: a 50% reduction in the most dangerous substances that are, if used in certain large quantities, carcinogens and mutagens; the use of biological pesticides and pesticides that present little danger does not have to be reduced at present; the so-called frequency of application index will be used for other pesticides.
The individual characteristics of, and conditions in, each Member State will be taken into account.
It must be emphasised that quantitative indicators in the National Action Plans do not impose equal reduction of pesticide use on all countries.
They will take into consideration the specific geographical conditions and arable farming systems of the given country.
It is true that an automatic reduction in quantity does not necessarily lead to risk reduction; however, it does so in many cases.
The Thematic Strategy and the directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides.
Protection of the aquatic environment from contamination by pesticides must be strengthened through the establishment of buffer zones along watercourses.
Although I support the ban on aerial spraying, I accept that it will be possible to grant an exception under certain circumstances, in the absence of a more viable alternative.
When aerial sprayings take place, the general public will be informed, by suitable means, about the time of spraying, the place and the substance used.
The Strategy is not directed against farmers.
I believe that all these measures can be taken without radical cuts in farmers' budgets.
This was proved by the Danish experience.
All of us have to realise how important it is for farmers to be competitive, and we have to make sure that their products will not be replaced by products of farmers from developing countries.
To conclude, allow me to express my opinion on the amendments.
I cannot agree with Amendment 4, which seeks to change the name of the entire Thematic Strategy.
Although I want pesticides to be used with care, I think that we should leave the official name of the entire document as it is: after all it is an official name in the Official Journal and I think that it is suitable.
I also want to mention Amendments 3 and 5, which deal with residential zones.
Amendment 3 proposes to add the term 'urban': to me this means 'suburban zone' and thus excludes those who live in rural areas.
The term 'residential zones' is both vague and imprecise.
I also propose to amend paragraph 8 linguistically because the term 'practitioner' is a bad translation; in French it is even 'mÃ©decin'.
I am going to finish, Mr President, and to conclude I would like to thank sincerely all those who worked on this report.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the privilege of introducing a report that will offer Parliament the opportunity tomorrow to vote for a breakthrough towards greater health, and environmental and consumer protection.
According to the Eurobarometer, the use of pesticides is the foremost concern among European consumers, and the Committee has taken that into account.
More than 220 000 tonnes of pesticide are applied in Europe every year.
This represents 25% of global pesticide use on only 4% of the world's farmland.
In our view, the eradication of high-risk pesticides should be the core of this regulation.
These are pesticides which have carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic properties as well as those with neurotoxic, immunotoxic or hormonal effects.
This regulation would be a huge contribution to making pesticides safer, but we must also incorporate rules for less dangerous pesticides.
The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more, because they have thereby proved, I am afraid to say, that they are uncontrollable.
We are also pleased that the substitution principle, which already represented a crucial step towards better health protection when it was incorporated into the EC Chemicals Regulation, is to be enshrined in the proposed regulation too, because substitution is a particularly powerful stimulant of competition in the pesticides industry.
It is scandalous and nothing short of scaremongering to sound warnings that up to half of all pesticides could disappear from the market.
May I thank the Commission for establishing such stringent substitution criteria, for pesticides need to be improved tenfold.
They should - and this is a proposal made by Parliament's Environment Committee - be authorised for a period not exceeding five years.
The Commission's proposal, however, also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance.
Another key feature of the proposed regulation is better protection of sensitive groups.
As we know, foetuses, babies and children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of hazardous chemicals.
For this reason I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has proposed that decisions on the authorisation of active substances and the assessment of the risks they entail be made by reference to the more vulnerable groups in society.
I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that we have also introduced rules on labelling, because food products that are not compliant with Directive 2006/215 must carry an indication to that effect.
That is a giant step towards greater transparency, for studies, and in particular a study conducted by environmental NGOs in the parliamentary supermarket, have shown just how risky products, notably everyday products, can be.
Measured values were up to 200 times higher than the levels normally prescribed for infant and baby food.
Greater transparency for the sake of these vulnerable groups, but also for consumers and people living near farmland, means greater support for Europe as a whole too, because there must be no more prodding about in the dark when it comes to traceability.
Reports, lists of licensed pesticides, residue readings and, above all, toxicological and ecotoxicological data must be made accessible to everyone almost in real time, and local residents must be informed of imminent crop-spraying through a central information system.
The pesticide passport will make it possible to trace, through wholesale and retail outlets, which pesticide was used when.
That will create competition, and consumers, of course, will be the main beneficiaries of competition between manufacturers producing only safe products.
Another of our aims is that this regulation should ensure high environmental standards.
This is why the Environment Committee came out against the idea of dividing Europe arbitrarily into three zones that are not based on any environmental or climatic criteria or on landscape types.
Moreover, Commissioner, the idea did not win majority support in the Council.
Like the Council, we advocate better voluntary cooperation in Europe on product licensing.
Let me also reiterate that there are strong legal reservations, because no intergovernmental agreements exist within these zones to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences.
Such provisions exist in the EU context on the basis of the European treaties, but there is no legal framework for mutual recognition within the defined zones.
People in Europe do not want poison on their plates.
I hope that this regulation will also improve Europe's standing as a business location, because it will make Europe a better place for consumers to live, and it will be universally beneficial - not only to the environment and consumers and in terms of animal welfare, but above all to manufacturers and farmers, since they will receive more incentives to innovate and become more competitive.
In conclusion, I would like to express my warmest thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, who have collaborated on this report in a truly cooperative manner.
I hope that this new pesticides regulation will enable us to raise health and environmental protection to new heights in Europe.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, we have to face up to the very practical idea that we need to produce food in Europe - last month we reduced set-aside to zero to bring 10% of land back into production - and we need the necessary tools to do that job.
We are all quite happy to want safe food and safe chemicals, but - and the Commission is dealing with this in the right way - this has to be done on a risk-based system similar to that used for REACH: if a chemical is safe to use then it can be used, but if it is not safe to use then it should be taken off the market.
That is how we should deal with this the whole way through.
Climatic conditions make a great deal of difference to when you should spray, so you need flexibility in when and how you spray.
There are now satellite systems which can introduce the spray at the right time, and you can actually reduce the amount of spray and chemical you use.
Take for instance this year, which was an extremely wet year in many parts of Europe.
In my own country, Britain, you cannot buy organic potatoes because you could not spray them and could not keep the blight away from them.
There are, therefore, very few organic potatoes to be had.
We need the necessary tools, and that is why we cannot go for a percentage-based reduction each year.
We have got to go for a sensible, risk-based system.
Also, when it comes to the 10-metre strips, there are - believe it or not - chemicals that you can use in water courses.
There is a chemical called Roundup which can actually be sprayed on the banks of a river or a stream.
Are we going to ban its use on a 10-metre strip next to a stream when it can actually be used on the banks of a stream?
Let us be sensible about this.
We need food security, we need food production and we need safe food in Europe.
Let us all work together to achieve that.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (NL) Mr President, I think that one minute for two opinions is very short, but all right, I shall try and keep it as brief as possible.
Pesticides are useful and necessary and without these products it is becoming difficult to feed 6 billion people.
Certainly there is still a great deal to be done to combat the harmful environmental and health effects of pesticides.
Bringing new products onto the market is a long and always expensive process.
It is good for the industry that approvals can be dealt with more quickly, but Parliament is rightly asking that Member States should have the right to refuse products in their territory.
The industry is focusing increasingly on the major crops, the 'big five', rice, corn, maize, soya beans and cotton, because with those they can recover a lot of the cost.
But it is of course important for the minor crops to be properly protected and the Committee on Industry has made a number of good suggestions for that.
The Committee is also making a number of good suggestions to introduce incentives to switch to more sustainable products.
That is also very important.
I have another comment to make on the use of pesticides.
The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States.
I therefore welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on that point.
Surface water is now one of the assessment criteria for approval and on that basis Member States have the right to establish a buffer zone for products themselves.
All in all, I think that this is a balanced and workable position for Parliament.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission proposal on this report had a dual legal basis, namely Article 37(2) on agricultural policy, and Article 152(4)(b) on health protection.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied these proposals.
For example, a proposal was made by the Committee responsible to remove Article 37(2) and incorporate Article 175(1), by removing Article 37(2), retaining Article 152(4)(b) and adding Article 175(1).
The key aspect as far as the legal basis is concerned, is for the debate to be geared to the aim and content, and the Committee on Legal Affairs is of the unanimous opinion that the applicable article is Article 152(4)(b), there being no need to refer to Article 175(1).
In our view, this is perfectly clear and there is no need either for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Commission or for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Committee responsible; all that is required is a reference to Article 152(4)(b), because the purpose of this proposal for a directive is the protection of human health.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Mr President, as draftswoman of my Committee's opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, I should like to comment on the proposal.
In this proposal for a regulation, it is important that we should strike a balance between the following interests: on the one hand, there are the interests of consumers in healthy food without residues, in other words in safe plant protection products that do not endanger public health and the environment, and in clean drinking water; on the other hand, consumers also have an interest in a reliable supply of fresh and affordable products, and they want home-grown fruit and vegetables rather than those from countries outside the EU, given that there are scarcely any checks on the pesticides that have been used those countries.
Our farmers need certain plant protection products if they are to combat resistance.
That cannot be done, however, without a certain number of protection products.
At the same time they want safe, risk-free protection products.
This is why we also believe that demonstrably carcinogenic substances must be banned.
As regards the other licensing criteria, however, we intend to rely on scientific evidence and base our approach on maximum values.
That is a balanced midway position that protects our consumers while guaranteeing that home-grown fruit and vegetables are affordable as well as being subject to adequate testing.
As far as informing neighbours is concerned, if we have stringent licensing criteria and if we test plant protection products properly, I cannot see why we have to go through bureaucratic procedures to alert neighbours and local residents to the use of plant protection products when they have not even asked for information.
What are consumers supposed to make of such information?
How, in practice, are farmers supposed to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before they apply plant protection products?
It is for these reasons that I argue passionately against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would impose this very requirement, and I also advocate rejection of the Commission's proposed public information clause at this point, for if we have safe plant protection products we have no need for these bureaucratic procedures.
Let me make a very brief comment on the zonal approach.
We are seeking greater harmonisation.
That is the main point for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection too.
The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones.
Our aim, after all, is harmonisation with due regard to the opinions of the Member States, which could adapt this authorisation to their own conditions of use.
I therefore urge the House to support this harmonisation effort and to back the Commission's zoning proposal.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Mr President, the subject being discussed, the use and placing on the market of sustainable pesticides, is a very important one.
It embraces both the practice of sustainable agriculture and matters of public health.
It is therefore regrettable that the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development should not be taking part in this debate right now.
Over the millennia mankind has had to contend with pests, vermin, weeds and plant and crop disease.
They have reduced harvests and rendered them unfit for human consumption.
In recent decades the struggle has been overcome to some extent, mainly on account of new plant protection products.
At the same time, however, there has been a threat to health.
The proposals for a directive now before us are very rigid.
Generally speaking, the purpose of the new regulations is to improve the situation regarding public health.
However, no clear analytical illustration of the dangers of plant diseases and weeds which pesticides are used to try and prevent has been put forward.
This is a huge drawback because in this case what is best may not be what is right.
The sustainable practice of agriculture could be set back years.
Not using pesticides is not necessarily a good option, even as far as public health is concerned.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, this is an important, complex and tricky subject that we are debating today.
Combating the pests that devour and damage crops is a necessary challenge in terms of both food security and the protection and improvement of our environment.
Sensible recourse to pesticides is therefore unavoidable.
It is essential, however, that the associated risks should be assessed in a balanced way, particularly with regard to human health, and that measures to scale down pesticide use should be properly planned.
The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is, in my view, a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face, and I should like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Irena BelohorskÃ¡, and to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that went into the drafting of the text.
Certain comments are called for: the core problem of risk management is inseparable from the question of how much pesticide is used.
The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle.
In respect of other pesticides, we have to apply subsidiarity.
Working within a common European framework, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used.
National action plans will also facilitate adaptation to particular circumstances in each country.
It is extremely important, too, to protect the aquatic environment and we must be rigorous here by establishing buffer zones fixed in accordance with local conditions.
Finally, I would point out that the system we wish to implement is a logical follow-on to the REACH directive.
With regard to pesticide quantities, the thrust of our argument should be 'as little as possible and as much as necessary'.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Mr President, my British fellow Members sometimes use the expression 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'.
This is the way it should be!
Fruit and vegetables are normally healthy types of food, but unfortunately this is not always the case.
In far too many cases there are pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables and naturally this has direct negative consequences for human health.
The subject that we are concerned with here is therefore very important.
Consequently, it is very important that we use these substances in a sustainable manner, so that we can reduce their usage in those cases where we use too many pesticides.
Our nature, environment and health are being damaged, and groundwater sources may also be contaminated.
Therefore, I also believe there is reason to criticise the Commission, particularly because you, Mr Kyprianou, are known (in my country, too) as a man who is very concerned with consumer interests and have done a considerable amount to safeguard the environment and health.
I do not understand how you can stand here today and defend a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and will also force European countries to reduce their levels of consumer protection.
Allow me simply to give a couple of examples of what this will mean if we accept the proposal that you have put forward.
In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted.
We have reduced the use of pesticides by around 50% since the beginning of the 1980s.
I am sure you will agree that this is a very sensible thing to do.
If your proposal is implemented, we will be forced to double the number of pesticides permitted in Denmark.
Double the number of pesticides!
This will probably mean that we will find it very difficult to continue drinking our groundwater untreated as we do today.
I do not view this issue purely as a national one.
I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
There are many examples.
In every single zone, it is of course the case that every country apart from one will be forced to approve pesticides that they do not currently approve.
Let me give an example of one crop: maize.
In the UK a maize pesticide is used that contains around 15 active substances.
In Hungary 57 active substances are used, while in Poland 37 are used.
However, if the Commission's proposals are implemented every country will therefore approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances.
This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled.
It should not be the EU's task to force countries to use more pesticides.
It will affect the environment, it will affect health and it will affect groundwater.
Surely this cannot be the intention.
I hope that you will back up what we have proposed in the Committee on the Environment; this will also make life easier for the industry.
It is in the compromise that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment: we will say no to the mutual obligatory approval of pesticides, but yes to the mutual obligatory approval of data.
Moreover, we are talking not only about zones, but also about data throughout Europe.
This will make life much easier for the industry.
At the same time, we are actually giving countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so.
Finally, with regard to the reduction targets, I would like to say to Mr Dimas that it is unbelievably positive that we are getting rid of the most dangerous substances - substances that cause cancer, substances that affect child development, etc. Naturally we would like to remove these substances from the market.
They are also completely unnecessary.
In addition, I think that we should go a step further and also establish a general reduction target for all substances.
Of course this should be something that is determined individually in each country, but if we simultaneously link this with the European reduction targets of around 20%, I think we are being ambitious.
However, in spite of everything I still believe we are at a stage where it is possible.
It will be of great significance for health and the environment in Europe.
With regard to the justification that has been used by the Commission for not introducing these reduction targets, we have introduced a treatment frequency index that takes account of the points that you have otherwise emphasised.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that a number of Member States have already initiated measures to reduce pesticide-related risks, but trends in pesticide use differ from one country to another.
For example, certain substances, the use of which is banned in some Member States, are none the less on sale in those states because their use is permitted in other states.
There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union.
The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides, whilst recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality.
We have a number of amendments that are intended to make the text more easily applicable, while sticking to the principle that safer or non-chemical alternatives should be encouraged.
My group is keen to focus the volume-reduction targets on dangerous substances.
We co-signed an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans, setting as the EU-wide target a 20% reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50% rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013.
Some may think it paradoxical that my group has tabled a further amendment, also to Article 4, offering Member States the option of an approach based on risk reduction.
This is, in fact, a more realistic approach but the calculations are more difficult than they are with volume reduction.
We thought it was important to put forward this amendment because the question is one that we would wish to see addressed in the interinstitutional discussions after the vote at first reading.
I should now like to consider a few specific points.
For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment, rather than fixing a minimum buffer-zone area.
It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks, children's playgrounds and school areas because the use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary, or indeed be prohibited, and non-chemical methods should be prioritised.
On the fraught question of aerial spraying, the European Commission's proposal - for a ban in principal with exceptions that must be justified - made a lot of sense.
The text from the Committee on the Environment is, however, acceptable.
Whilst I understand the need to notify the public of pesticide spraying, I think it has to be left to the Member States to determine the nature and extent of the notification and the means of giving it.
We are dealing here with so many different types of terrain and so many different approaches that any attempt to standardise seems unrealistic.
The ALDE Group is thus seeking to achieve a balance, the essence of which is that no single party, whether user or manufacturer, should be penalised but rather that rigorous and consistent legislation should be introduced: allowing pesticide users to protect their crops; allowing manufacturers to sell products that will gradually become less harmful; and allowing consumers not only to eat safe food but also to live in a safe environment.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the three reports that have been presented are inextricably linked.
The European Union is trying to do as much as possible to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil, in water and in plants.
A great deal has been done in the last few years to minimise these effects.
A particularly important role in this work has been played by research organisations that have created modern preparations that work more selectively.
However, we should remember that in past years the quality of pesticides was much worse, they were used in much higher doses, many times higher, and, as a result, the pollution in our environment is a consequence of activities in years past.
For this reason, in addition to the new directives, we must supplement existing legislation with a directive on the deactivation and disposal of outdated pesticides.
I would ask for your active participation in this matter since, despite the passage of some years, problems are still increasing instead of decreasing, and the risks are increasing instead of decreasing, as was shown at the last NGO forum in Kishinev.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, whilst I should like to congratulate Ms Breyer on the excellent outcome she has achieved, I cannot support those who defend the use of pesticides, because it is absolutely vital that we rid our environment and our bodies of these dangerous substances.
I hope that the European Parliament may in future support the most forward-looking positions on this question, instead of yielding to the latest siren calls from manufacturers representing a deadly industry.
Eliminating carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic pesticides, and substances that weaken our nervous and endocrine systems and damage our immune systems, is an entirely healthy aim.
We should also welcome our fellow Members' efforts to ensure transparency in the provision of information for consumers, who are the 'innocent victims' of these dangerous substances.
Surely, Commissioners, it is high time that action was taken?
Never before have insecticides, fungicides and herbicides of various types been used as systematically as they are used today.
To look no further than France, a situation that can only be described as 'joint management' of public policy on pesticides by the state and the chemical industry has succeeded thus far in marginalising ordinary people's expectations about public and environmental health, regardless of research findings on environmental toxicity and at the expense of statistical studies if they establish links between chemical substances and pathological conditions: all this despite recent warnings from the medical profession, via the Paris Appeal for example, and the Grenelle Forum on Environment in France.
The industry is doing its utmost to play down the impact of pesticides.
Thus, after the pollution of water courses by the herbicide Atrazine, which everyone has heard about, and the decimation of bee populations, the chemical industry is trying to draw a veil over the fact that France remains the European Union's number one pesticide user.
Every year, between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France.
So, in relation to the 'pesticides package' - unlike the REACH directive - the Members of this House will not allow themselves to be discredited.
Ordinary people expect no less of us: that is clear from the mass of correspondence we receive, calling for swift and strong action.
We hear, for example, from people highlighting the dangers of inhaling pesticides that are sprayed by vegetable growers in the south of France, and from others concerned about heavy use of herbicides in public parks and gardens, prompting some to call for pesticide-free zones.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡, on her report on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
I believe that the rapporteur succeeded in preparing a document that makes provision for, and strikes the right balance between, the need for sustainable competitive agricultural production in Europe, and promoting the use of pesticides only where there is minimum adverse effect on human health and the environment.
I welcome the fact that the report incorporates the amendment on the precautionary principle regarding human health and safeguarding of the land and water ecosystem, which I co-authored.
Like the rapporteur, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡, I, too, regret that whilst the most important result to be expected from the thematic strategy is the reduction of adverse effects on human health deriving from pesticide use, the strategy deals with this heath impact only marginally.
I believe that it will be up to the Commission to complete the work in this regard in the future.
From the point of view of occupational health and safety, I welcome the points in the report that highlight the need not only for adequate information but also for appropriate protective means and regular checks of application equipment.
I believe that we have here an instrument with many concrete effective mechanisms to reduce, and improve the safety of, pesticide use.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, in the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand.
I should like to talk about several aspects of these reports in more detail.
One of the proposals is that the policy should be based on reducing use. I am very sceptical about this.
You can certainly reduce the total quantity of pesticides, but often it is the most used pesticides that are the least dangerous.
In that case the risks are still more or less equal.
I am much more in favour of a policy based on reducing the risk.
The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been found to reduce the environmental risk by 86%.
Another disadvantage of reducing use is that fewer different pesticides are available and resistance builds up more quickly.
Another point is the introduction of buffer zones around watercourses.
An amendment to create a 10-metre buffer zone has been approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
For a country with a lot of water like the Netherlands, that 10 metres is a problem.
It means in effect that 35% of agricultural land cannot be sprayed.
Finally I would like to point out that it is not only a standard that is important; enforcement is undoubtedly important.
At the moment that is lacking, as can be seen from the products intended for consumption we regularly come across that do not meet the standard, even in the European Parliament.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, as we all know, it has long been presumed that a connection exists between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on the one hand and various diseases on the other.
When pesticides are even being found here and there in drinking water, it is undoubtedly high time to make the slow-grinding wheels of EU bureaucracy turn faster.
It remains to be seen how far we can actually go towards achieving the present aim of reducing the application of plant protection agents.
We are all familiar, of course, with ambitious aims that are not achieved in the end.
I do believe, however, that the intended replacement of carcinogenic substances is far from the great achievement it is volubly proclaimed to be; on the contrary, it is, in my view, an immediate imperative.
In actual fact, the replacement of these substances is long overdue.
If we consider that the EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4% of the world's arable land, the problem becomes immediately clear.
These statistics also show that our EU support schemes have patently been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction.
There is, of course, a general suspicion among consumers - and it is not entirely unfounded - that resourceful farmers are trying to circumvent the prescribed ceilings with combinations of authorised plant protection products.
Given the lack of research into interaction between products, it is high time for intervention to curb such practices.
Moreover, the continual increases in maximum concentrations in recent years must be reversed in view of the greater danger posed to high-risk groups such as children.
Importing organic products from the opposite ends of the earth is not only inconsistent with various environmental objectives but is also one of the causes of increased traffic volumes and a perennial indictment of the Union's misguided support policy.
Our support schemes should therefore be rethought, particularly with a view to providing more support for those European farmers who refrain using pesticides.
If we choose instead to go on harassing farmers with bureaucratic obstacles, no one should be surprised if they ultimately throw in the towel in frustration while Brussels is bewildered by the chronic dwindling of the farming community.
Madam President, I am tempted to say that a political pesticide to deal with the rampant weed that is EU regulation would do us all a favour.
When I look at some of these amendments and proposals, a proposal like the 10-metre rule, I detect within it a gross degree of overkill.
I think we have to face some facts.
Without controlled use of pesticides in our agriculture, we will drive more food production to less regulated regions of the world, jeopardising quality and food safety.
Perhaps of even more interest to some, without fungicides and herbicides to protect and cure disease in fine turf, many golf and bowling surfaces would become weed-infested and unplayable.
Yes, pesticides must be controlled, but our measures must be based on sound science and be practical at farm and street level.
The strident codes of practice governing the use in my country are, I believe, adequate, and therefore I will vote against those dogma-driven changes which some would wish to impose.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, it is a pity that representatives of the agricultural sector have not been involved in this debate, as it would have been extremely interesting, in the light of the recent CAP reform, to hear the farmers' voice as well.
The task we face is not only to safeguard the future of farming in Europe and the quality and quantity of food production but also to promote research and to ensure that data are protected.
The greatest challenge, of course, is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and our environment.
We must also be concerned, however, with the health of farmers and their families, who need better protection as it is they who come into direct contact with these products and the advice they receive is often the advice of the companies marketing the pesticides. The companies are hardly likely to tell them that researchers have started asking questions about the link between exposure to pesticides and the steadily increasing incidence of certain conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, prostate cancer, brain tumours and congenital deformities.
It will therefore be absolutely essential to establish strict rules for the placing of products on the market.
We should also encourage research through proper provision for data protection, and promote research programmes on biological means of pest control - a useful example of innovation.
At the end of the day these products should also be affordable for farmers.
My final point, Commissioner, concerns the protection of bees: the long-term evaluations provided for in Directive 91/414 have not been carried out.
Simply having rules and regulations is not good enough: they must be applied and systems are needed to ensure that they are applied.
I agree that the most important thing is to regulate the placing of these products on the market but I would also make the comment, Madam President, that in the course of this impassioned debate the intrusions of lobbying by the chemical industry - although infrequent - have been disgraceful.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, all the health and environmental data now available, which I do not propose to list this evening, must necessarily prompt this House to take decisive action on pesticides and their conditions of use.
It is essential that such action is based on measurable targets.
It became clear in the discussions prior to the vote in plenary that there are major differences between the Member States in both their practice and their policy approach, so we ended up compromising on certain issues and relying on subsidiarity.
I hope we shall not be deceived here by subsidiarity, for it will entail flexibility that could easily become a pretext for watering down our policies to a very minimal expression of the political and public will being voiced here today, particularly on the issues of exposure to risks and the extent of the buffer zones beside watercourses.
If subsidiarity is to be meaningful in relation to pesticides, it must encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region.
That will mean stepping up research and the transfer of technologies; involving all the stakeholders, including farmers, researchers, NGOs, health professionals and representatives of the food industry; and carrying out thorough research in each geographical area, jointly identifying best practices and non-chemical alternatives that are suited to the soil, the climate and the crops.
There are a few regions in which this work is already being done.
I therefore propose that the Commission should encourage the introduction of such an approach and should facilitate inter-regional exchanges of experience, whilst at the same time ensuring that European laws are properly applied.
(DE) Madam President, many of my fellow Members believe we need strict rules for dealing with plant protection agents, and they are right, but at the same time we must not ignore the impact of the legislation we adopt.
The fact is that plant protection products are an important element of modern-day agriculture.
Take the example of the regulation on authorisation.
We are in the process of banning entire clusters of active substances on the basis of exclusion criteria, simply because of an abstract notion of hazardousness.
This approach ignores the actual risk involved in applying these agents down on the farm.
It leads us to ban active substances which do not pose any problem at all in practice.
As a result, not enough active substances will be available in future to combat pests properly.
If only a few active substances are used, resistance to pesticides will develop more quickly.
There will be no reliable means left to deal with many pest problems.
And these are probably the new heights to which Mrs Breyer just referred.
When that stage is reached, the security of Europe's food supply will plumb new depths.
Instead of imposing blanket bans we should be providing for a reliable licensing procedure that examines the actual risk involved in the use of each substance.
The next example relates to the strategic approach to this issue, in which we argue for an across-the-board Europe-wide reduction target for the use of plant protection products.
That, however, has nothing at all to do with the risks involved in their use.
The Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk.
That is a good idea, and we should retain it.
When all is said and done, we should focus on what is feasible, namely efficient pest control coupled with proper risk management.
After all, it is also a matter of establishing how the growing need for raw vegetable materials is to be met in future.
In the past innovative plant protection products have helped to make production grow faster than demand for arable land.
Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation.
- (LT) I do not think you could find a single person in this House, in this Parliament, who would claim that ecology, a healthy environment and human health was not important.
I do not believe that any European citizen would ever say that.
However, ladies and gentlemen, while making decisions, talking about legislation and making and implementing rules that hundreds of thousands of people would have to adhere to and that would no doubt have an impact on the lives of millions of people, we cannot base our decisions on emotions and good intentions.
We need to achieve this objective in a balanced and sensible way.
One of the key objectives set out for the EU agricultural sector is to supply good quality food at affordable prices.
The EU is known for the high standards of food production and strict farming regulations it lays down for its Member States.
On the other hand, there is constant pressure on EU agriculture to be competitive as well as to produce good quality food.
We are in no position to ignore these factors when discussing plant protection regulations.
The opinion expressed by the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has satisfied the expectations of all interested parties.
Nevertheless, the amendments proposed, or those introduced at the time of the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, have raised serious concerns.
If these amendments are accepted, the consequences could be unpredictable.
They pose risks not only for agriculture and the food industry, but also for nature itself.
Does it mean that genetically modified organisms will enter the EU market?
The impact on traditional crops would be huge if 90% of plant protection products were excluded from the market.
Ladies and gentlemen, once again I urge you to base your decision on sound scientific evidence and good practice, not on rumours and emotions.
I hope that your vote will reflect the opinion of all interested parties and that the outcome will be balanced and correct, so that agriculture is not destroyed, EU citizens are not left without European food and millions of people do not end up unemployed in the name of environmental protection.
(DA) Madam President, early tomorrow morning I am going to the grocer's to buy bottled drinking water.
In many countries people do this because the groundwater sources have been contaminated by pollution.
The water is subject to chemical treatment as if it were a dirty coat.
Then it is chlorinated and tastes as bad as it is expensive.
In Denmark we have a rich vein of gold underground: clean groundwater.
We drink it directly as drinking water without first sending it to a water treatment works.
It is healthier than bottled water, it tastes better and it is much, much cheaper.
However, this also means that we must watch over it and prohibit pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater.
Therefore, Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays, 12 of which are found in drinking water.
This is something that we would like to continue with and I therefore request that my fellow Members vote in favour of an amendment to permit protection zones.
We have already had the proposal adopted in previous regulations; these must now be repeated in order to prevent them from being annulled.
Finally, we have received support from a large majority here in Parliament and subsequently from the President of the Commission, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso.
Thank you!
We have received no support from the Danish Commissioner for Agriculture, who, together with the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (also from the Danish Liberal Party (Venstre)), would rather support the farmers' opportunity to ruin our drinking water.
It is sad that the Danish Agricultural Council would rather support Venstre.
It is very short-sighted to pursue slightly higher corn yields and then have to pay billions of kroner in order to purify the groundwater.
The Treaty states that polluters themselves will pay.
I have proposed this in an amendment and I request that my fellow Members support the requirements of the Treaty.
No-one has the right to poison our common earth and drinking water.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, the proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91/414/CE achieves greater harmonisation of authorisation procedures while at the same time providing for consumer protection.
However, the result obtained in the Environment Committee not only fails to have regard to the objective of greater harmonisation but unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment.
The report is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union.
Farmers, however, are not the only ones who will suffer: consumers are likely to suffer as well, because many crops will become unviable, making imports necessary, with a knock-on effect for food security.
Insufficient consideration has been given to the fact that the approval and use of plant protection products is already subject to strict controls, both by the European Food Safety Authority and by the competent authorities of the Member States.
Moreover, this proposal changes the number of active substances from 1 100 as authorised in 1991, to 148, which are listed in Annex I to this proposal.
Of those 148 substances, only 34 are insecticides, nematocides or acaricides, which are the substances most needed for cultivation in Mediterranean Europe where the level of attack by insects is the highest in the entire Union.
Insects are not only a menace to plants, but are also transmitters of very serious human illnesses.
The Commission proposal to divide the European Union into three zones for the mutual recognition of plant protection products should be reinstated.
Criteria for precluding pesticides must be based on proper risk analyses.
Without a risk analysis it is impossible to determine the effect of these substances on health or the environment.
Finally, I would like to point out that the dose makes the poison.
(FR) Madam President, I have been stressing the importance of this evening's debate because what we have at stake here today is nothing less than our vision of Europe's farming future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that clearly causes too much pollution, towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity.
This is a challenge to which Europe must rise for three reasons: firstly, as more scandals and more health risks are uncovered, public opinion is now set against the use of pesticides; secondly the majority of farmers themselves want the European Union to help them change their practices so that they no longer have to choose between keeping their health and boosting their profitability; and thirdly, bee-keepers all over Europe are calling for strict legislation to stop the sale of pesticides that have not been evaluated for their impact on bees.
It is therefore vital that the ambitious stance taken by the Committee on the Environment should be confirmed in tomorrow's vote on the three reports by Hiltrud Breyer, Christa KlaÃ and Irena BelohorskÃ¡.
We must confirm that health and the environment are foremost; that specific measures are needed to protect those most vulnerable to harm; that the most dangerous substances will be covered by the precautionary principle; that the use of non-chemical alternatives will indeed be encouraged; and that aerial spraying will henceforth be banned in principle. In short, we must translate into practical action the concerns voiced by the very many men and women in Europe who - as Mrs Isler-BÃ©guin has mentioned - have written to us urging that farming should not in future be dependent on chemicals.
(PL) Madam President, the use of plant protection products - pesticides - is essential in certain circumstances.
In Poland there is a preponderance of small agricultural holdings, where the owners, due to insufficient finance, economise on expensive pesticides and this sometimes results in losses as a result of pests.
I am in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products, including advice, training, research, subsidies for modern plant protection equipment, the introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health and that are compatible with farmers' interests, instead of the use of pesticides.
Where there is a risk that the harvest might be lost, ignorance and the lack of proper assistance to farmers can lead to the uncontrolled use of pesticides.
A problem that has been with us for a long time, but which has not yet been fully resolved, is the issue of the disposal of dumps of highly toxic pesticides that exist or existed in the countries of the former Soviet bloc, as well as the recultivation of soil.
They are poisoning both the water and the soil.
This baggage could reduce the effectiveness of the measures prepared in these documents.
(PL) Madam President, producers who are being forced to create food that looks perfect are introducing pesticides that are harmful not just to the environment and to the economy, but also to human health.
I hope that the documents under discussion will lead to an improvement in the quality of food consumed and will encourage more organic production methods, with greater use of natural fertilisers to nurture the soil.
In addition, as regards the unscrupulous and unethical practice of exporting substances known to be harmful to third world countries, I would quote a popular proverb from Poland: 'Do as you would be done by'.
This is even more important because the dangerous pesticides come back to us in the form of foodstuffs that are purchased cheaply by wealthy countries and destroy people's health.
In addition to the general guidelines, strategies for the sustainable use of pesticides should be developed at national level, where appropriate action can be taken.
Reductions in the quantity of plant protection products should be greater in areas where more pesticides are used.
(SK) I highly value the fact that all three reports require the personnel involved in all phases of pesticide handling to be highly qualified.
Action plans, integrated management and strict import measures: these are also examples of what is positive in all the reports.
However, both the bans on aerial application and, alternatively, the situations where aerial application would be possible must be articulated precisely, using clear wording.
Similarly, the notion of a quantitative use reduction is not clearly defined and opens the door to many risks because of its non-selective application.
For example, the Slovak Republic applies on average less than 1 kg of pesticides per hectare while other countries apply as much as 8 kg.
This means that there are countries where pesticide use must be genuinely reduced and countries where pesticide use should even be increased.
This is why I suggest that when voting we should take into account the recommendations of the European Crop Protection Association or alternatively, at first reading, not adopt reports and and keep the balanced recommendations of the Commission.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for us to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and it is also a good idea for us to put some of it into effect immediately.
In view of the considerable impact on food quality, public health, the environment and the sustainability of our farming - all matters of concern - our whole group, as well as our rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, have devoted a great deal of time to this package.
I should like to mention four points in particular.
Firstly, a further reduction in pesticide use is sensible.
This must then actually create less of an impact on the environment and for that reason we are against merely reducing the quantity used.
We want a reduction in the actual impact, based on a scientific risk evaluation.
Secondly, we take a similar view on non-spray zones around watercourses.
Here again we are in favour of a risk-based approach and we feel that the Member States are better able than we are to make responsible choices, based partly on the criteria laid down in the water framework directive.
Thirdly, I wonder why this Parliament, which is after all an advocate of an internal market with a high degree of protection for the consumer, health and the environment, would oppose a first step towards harmonisation in this area.
We are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would also like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones.
Finally, we are opposed to the general provision of information to neighbours advocated by Mrs Breyer in her report.
Not only is that information unnecessary for a strictly regulated activity, it also causes unnecessary anxiety and frustration.
Surely the aim cannot be to move towards a sort of private enforcement.
That is a society we do not want and do not support.
(PL) Madam President, today's debate is of enormous significance for European agriculture and for environmental protection.
There are many people in favour of the use of pesticides and many who are opposed.
However, I believe that the farmers' guiding principle should be: 'as few pesticides as possible, just those that are essential', and the guiding principle of producers and distributors should be the precautionary principle, which should be the supreme principle as regards the lives and the health of consumers in every case where the introduction of new pesticides raises concerns, either because there is some ambivalence in the results of scientific research, or if there has been insufficient time to be able to say categorically that a given product or substance is harmless to humans and animals.
In the context of sustainable use of pesticides, I believe that the following steps should be taken: first of all, the Commission as well as Member States should provide periodic training, and advisory and educational programmes that are financed at least in part by companies that manufacture pesticides.
There should be coordinated monitoring and data collection with regard to the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, and this should include long-term research programmes and the imposition of sanctions on polluters.
A coordinated system should be set up to collect data on the production, import, export, sales, distribution and use of pesticides, and this should be accessible to the public.
Agricultural practices that promote the use of low doses of pesticides should be encouraged, which will help change the overall usage of these preparations.
Appropriate checks should be introduced and the import into the EU of agricultural food products produced with the aid of chemicals should be banned.
(NL) Madam President, plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe.
The big question when we in Europe take particular measures is what kind of influence this has on competitive relations with the rest of the world.
If we are too strict in Europe and cannot impose the same rules on the rest of the world, that means that we in Europe can consume products that we are unable to produce here, which seems wrong to me.
Of course it is always essential for us to continue evaluating the harmful effects, but we cannot overdo it.
I agree with everyone who says that we should concentrate on the risk and not on reducing the quantity.
The 10-metre buffer zones will also be disastrous for the Netherlands and others and should be left out of the regulation.
Finally, information to neighbours.
If something is approved, why should the neighbours also be informed?
That is completely unnecessary regulation.
Madam President, UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985.
Firms like Syngenta say that farmers should not be denied the tools they need.
These regulations move us away from the principle of good, science-based regulation.
For example, pavement weed control is 400 times more expensive without chemicals.
The golf and field sports industry says that without pesticides it is not possible to maintain the turf.
The Crop Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means between 65% and 200% more land under cultivation, reducing productivity.
Corbett Farms say that this year has shown the value of spraying to prevent potato blight.
Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect our crop.
Decisions on how and when to spray must be taken on an individual field basis.
An arbitrary reduction in use cannot be scientifically based.
Madam President, please eradicate the EU's pestilent regulations.
UKIP will vote against.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.
It goes without saying that all of us care deeply about health and consumer protection, and the strength of feeling among the various Members of our House can be gauged from this highly charged debate.
It is nevertheless important that we really do decide on the basis of the facts and do not fly in the face of reality by creating scapegoats, as it were.
It would be very easy, especially with this legislative package, to pick on a particular occupational group and look no further.
That would be completely wrong.
It must be established from the outset that all of us in Europe need a functioning agricultural sector, which necessarily entails the use of a certain quantity of plant protection agents.
On specific aspects of the KlaÃ report, let me say that it is indeed a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets, but I believe the quantitative approach adopted here is simply too rigid.
Every Member State should truly consider what it can do itself, because merely reducing the overall volume and believing this will clean up the environment is downright unscientific.
As far as the buffer strips are concerned, there is nothing wrong with the Commission's chosen strategy of treating subsidiarity as the key element.
Every Member State should consider how it wants these buffer strips regulated.
Blindly imposing a Community-wide ten-metre border would be wrong.
Trying to find non-chemical alternatives in sensitive areas, such as habitats of rare flora and fauna, is also an approach that should be supported unreservedly.
As regards the Breyer report, it is important that we support the three-zone concept.
Restricting the scope of licences to single Member States would be an excessively narrow approach.
Special care is needed with regard to the exclusion criteria.
An unequivocal ban for CMR1-rated substances may be taken as read, but in the case of CMR2 substances I am also in favour of taking scientific data as a basis for licensing decisions.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the legislative proposal which we will be asked to vote on aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment by establishing Community models for the sustainable use of pesticides and rules for placing them on the European market.
I believe that by supporting the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety's proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20% in Europe, we are sending out a strong message.
We must strengthen checks on the rational use of pesticides, and, most importantly, promote research into safer alternative methods of plant protection.
At the same time, the proposal for abolition of the system of zones and mandatory mutual licensing is a balanced position.
In view of the concerns of farmers and industry, it seeks to enable Member States who so wish to implement higher levels of environmental protection in line with their local conditions.
Finally, let me mention the special need to protect secondary use.
I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research.
We will thus guarantee the prosperity of farmers and maintain our special national products, which are part of European agricultural tradition and significantly boost the European agricultural economy.
Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on these three reports.
Firstly, I believe that we in Europe need to be in a position whereby we can produce European crops and European fruit and vegetables that are safe for human consumption.
However, we need to achieve that objective in a balanced way and in a common-sense way, so that we protect human health without penalising agriculture.
What we do not want is to put restrictions in place that impact negatively on European agriculture and to end up having to import huge quantities of food with all the implications for food miles, and, of course, with little control over the quantities of pesticides used in the production of that imported food.
Secondly, I support the proposal for a risk-based assessment, which is based on science and will prove workable for Member States.
Finally, I believe a 10-metre buffer zone is a 'one size fits all' solution and needs to be modified to allow Member States to take local conditions into consideration.
As I said earlier, not even the European Parliament can legislate for climatic conditions and soil conditions throughout the entire continent.
(FI) Madam President, the Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products are challenging legislative projects and are a reflection of the fundamental challenge that EU environmental policy faces, which is how to combine the protection of the environment with that of health effectively in a policy which takes account of social realities
We need to recognise that the use of plant protection products and pesticides has major economic benefits.
The expert use of these substances is, to be honest, a crucial prerequisite for food production in the modern age.
At the same time, however, the adverse impact of plant production products on the environment, and on watercourses in particular, is a very real one.
How, then, can we use these substances in a way which still allows us to benefit from pesticides but which at the same time reduces the adverse effects?
I come from a country where farming is a respected occupation and where domestic agriculture is regarded as important.
On the other hand, the environment is particularly fragile.
For example, Finland has almost 200 000 lakes, hundreds of thousands of other watercourses, and one of the world's most polluted seas.
Diffuse water pollution is an immense environmental problem, and plant protection products are part of that problem.
It is a challenging equation and so it is only right that the directive should take the differences between Member States into consideration.
Obviously, we need certain EU-wide standards, but the remedies applied in Finland cannot be the same as those in Luxembourg, say.
Therefore, reason and environmental concerns dictate that we should concentrate on the targets and leave the means to the Member States themselves.
A good example of this is the 'buffer zones', which undoubtedly have an important part to play in the protection of watercourses.
I am confident that buffer zones suited to each situation and consistent with the Commission's proposals are the right way forward.
If we now decide upon precisely measured limits, applying the 'one size fits all' principle, there is a real danger that in many countries they will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.
Perhaps I should say, rather, that they would not be addressing the problem flexibly or satisfactorily.
(DA) Madam President, there are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today.
Therefore, I am glad to be able to speak for a second time.
There are three misunderstandings.
The first concerns a reduction target: some fellow members are saying that this is simply not possible.
There are differences between the countries and it is not possible to create a common European reduction target.
No, this cannot be done!
Nor is this what we are doing.
What we are doing is saying that the common European reduction target should be 20%.
However, this may of course mean 30% in some countries and 10% in others.
The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans.
Therefore, it is a misunderstanding to fear this item.
A key element is that we are taking account of the fact that a gram of one pesticide can sometimes be more dangerous than an entire kilogram of another pesticide.
Therefore, we have introduced a treatment frequency index as part of this reduction obligation.
I can well imagine that the Commission will also have something to say about this when you, Mr Dimas, are able to speak again in a little while.
The second misunderstanding concerns the zones.
There is a belief that if we do not have the zones it will almost be an insult to the internal market.
No, on the contrary!
By ending this foolish idea about zones and saying that we will gradually introduce mutual data sharing we are saying that the entire EU is a zone within which we share data.
However, it is clear that we cannot talk about mutual obligatory recognition of pesticides simply because there are different geographical, climatic and environmental circumstances in each individual country.
I think that almost everyone in this House who has spoken today will be in agreement on this point.
The third fundamental misunderstanding is that it will destroy the competitiveness of agriculture.
No!
In Denmark we have reduced the use of pesticides by 50% since the 1980s without any effect on agricultural competitiveness.
Pesticides are expensive to use and therefore, provided they are used correctly, the less they are used the better it is for competitiveness.
(SV) Madam President, time is short and I am speaking primarily to express my support for the co-rapporteur of the Breyer report in the PPE-DE Group, Erna Hennicot-Schoepges.
I think it is very unfortunate that the majority of my group chose to ignore Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges' advice on several important points, and not to support important proposals contained in the report.
Of course, I agree that the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work, but it is not reasonable to conclude that we do not need any information requirement at all.
Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges' proposal here, as a compromise, is well-balanced.
Another important issue is the cut-off criteria for particularly sensitive substances.
Above all, in our decision we must of course be consistent with the decisions taken by Parliament in relation to the new REACH chemicals legislation.
One of the fundamental principles there was to phase out substances where it is difficult to establish thresholds for risks in the case of high-level concern substances.
Obviously we must also follow that line here, particularly as we are dealing with substances that come into contact or are liable to come into contact with things we eat.
Another issue on which I support the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, is the proposal on zoning.
When I saw the Commission's proposal, I immediately found it interesting to try to divide Europe into zones that are relatively similar in terms of vegetation conditions, climate and so on. However, the proposed zoning is unfortunately too arbitrary.
I cannot support this approach and believe that the Member States must be allowed to retain a right to refuse different preparations even if countries nearby have given them the green light.
I would like to address other issues, but my time is over.
(NL) Mr President, when I walk out of my village I am in the middle of a unique agricultural area, the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht.
It is still green farming land at the moment, but the 10-metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the area, when it is specifically farming that keeps the area green.
Last week I put it to the test, but I was hardly able to find any pieces of land between the many ditches that were 20 metres wide.
Anyone who knows a bit about the Netherlands knows that it is not only in the green heart that this is true.
It is a characteristic of Dutch farming that there are many ditches between pastureland.
That means that, with 10-metre buffer zones, the Netherlands would lose 800 000 hectares of its farmland, 35% of agricultural area.
I am therefore asking Members not to support this proposal, also in view of the agricultural production that is necessary in Europe and the world, as the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has said.
That does not actually mean that I do not agree with the aim of protecting nature and public health.
We all share that ambition.
I just think it can be better achieved with an approach based on risk analysis and risk reduction.
The alternative, reducing use, certainly sounds nice and simple - a 20% reduction overall - but it does not provide the best protection for the consumer because it can be looked at only in terms of quantities and not the final effect, the final risk.
In that context, I actually find it difficult to understand the painful contortions of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which is in favour of a 20% overall reduction as well as a risk approach.
I have two final points.
All I will say about the licensing system is that three climate zones are preferable to 27 Member States, obviously taking national circumstances into account.
Finally, I would ask the Commission not to overlook minor crops in all these major areas of dispute.
(FR) Madam President, pesticide residues are now everywhere: in food, in water, in the air, in our body tissue and breast milk and - most frighteningly of all - in the bodies of our unborn children.
We are only just beginning to glimpse the long-term consequences of this omnipresence of pesticide residues: they include various forms of cancer, endocrine disorders, reduced male fertility, damage to our immune systems, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system.
So, yes and yes again: let us reduce pesticide use and let us reduce it quickly. I fully support the proposals made by my colleague Mrs Hennicot on the Breyer report and, in the interests of saving time, I will highlight a further point which I consider vital and which has been discussed in the PPE Group - namely notification of people living near areas that are to be treated with pesticides.
I believe that a section of our group is being unreasonable in recommending that no such notification is required, on the pretext that if the substances to be applied have prior approval it means they are not harmful.
Aerial spraying is commonplace, particularly in forests and vineyards.
It entails a risk of substances being carried into inhabited or sensitive areas, so it must be strictly regulated.
It is essential that growers should issue advance warning of pesticide spraying to people who live close by and are thus potentially exposed.
People suffering from respiratory conditions such as asthma could be severely affected if they have no advance notice of such spraying.
Conveying and presenting the information need not imply any additional administrative burden on farmers, as some of my fellow Members have suggested.
Simple notices, stating the intended dates of the spraying, placed close to human habitation in the areas at risk, may be all that is needed.
I would like to conclude by urging that it is time to move on to a new generation of agricultural practices that respect the environment and thus play a part in modernising the farming sector.
(PL) Madam President, the key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction.
We should achieve this objective by implementing the guidelines in the directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.
Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive.
Each country should be able to do this, taking into account local conditions and differences.
We differ, primarily, in the level of agricultural development, I repeat: the level of agricultural development.
Those countries that are new members of the European Union often have enormous work to do to catch up as regards the level of development.
A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries, as compared with the present level of their use, will, in the final analysis, work against us as consumers, unless, in reducing their use, we take into account the present level of use of these products, which is relatively low.
Our landscape is different, too.
In Poland enormous areas of woodland can be protected against pests only by spraying from the air.
It is a duty to the natural environment to protect these forests, and it is Parliament's responsibility to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment.
The directive speaks a great deal about the farmer's level of knowledge being the most important factor for the implementation of sustainable use of pesticides.
It is the responsibility of us all to support education and to create the conditions so that this information can reach every farmer.
In tabling an amendment concerning temporary national allowances for pesticides I am speaking in favour of the mechanism for exchanging older preparations for modern and safer ones as quickly as is possible. I would ask for your support.
The guidelines in the directive should encourage rational measures and they should not discourage Member States and farmers.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, I thank the speakers in tonight's sitting for their positive remarks.
Permit me to set out briefly the Commission's views on certain important issues that have been raised.
Let me begin with the thematic strategy and, in particular, with the points not covered by the directive.
First of all, I am pleased that the report supports the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides.
The proposal to bring in new legislation to deal with the risky of pesticide use is particularly good.
I agree with how important more research is into the impact of the combined and cumulative use of pesticides on health.
In my opinion, the principle of substitution is vital; it removes the most hazardous substances from the market and replaces them with safer alternative solutions, some of which are non-chemical.
Finally, the BelohorskÃ¡ report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety puts forward certain additional measures which are especially positive.
Let me now turn specifically to the framework directive.
Many of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament make useful clarifications and can be accepted.
Other amendments, however, are liable to bring about undesired results.
I should like first of all to comment on the basic amendments which the Commission can fully accept in principle or in part.
The Commission partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets in their own national action plans for the restriction of the use of the most hazardous pesticides.
Indeed, setting up such targets is consistent with the directive's general aim to reduce the risk of using pesticides.
Laying down an overall, permanent target for the reduction of pesticide use at EU level, however, in addition to national targets, is not necessary and is therefore not endorsed by the Commission.
In fact, the overall reduction of the quantity of pesticides does not necessarily entail a corresponding reduction in risk: the level of risk varies from one substance to another.
Thus action to limit risk must focus, in the main, on the most harmful substances.
The Commission can in principle accept the laying down of a minimum width for the buffer zones to be created in fields located next to water courses, because this will bring additional environmental gains.
Imposing a limit of 10 metres, however, indiscriminately and in all cases, does not seem appropriate.
The Commission would prefer Member States to have a margin of flexibility and set the appropriate width for buffer zones in line with their own geographical features.
The Commission can also accept certain useful clarifications on other issues, such as technical training and certification.
There are, however, amendments which the Commission cannot endorse.
Firstly, the Commission is convinced that mandatory adherence to common general rules on integrated pest management by professional pesticide users is a fundamental measure to reduce dependence on pesticides.
It is of important environmental benefit throughout the EU and will contribute to the development of a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector.
I cannot, therefore, accept the elimination under Amendment 86 of this exceptionally important measure contained in the European Commission's proposal.
Secondly, the European Commission agrees to take measures to protect populations living close to fields where aerial spraying is carried out.
Nevertheless, it considers that a complete ban on the use of pesticides in so-called 'sensitive' areas is disproportionate.
We must leave some discretion to Member States and local authorities.
If this it ever necessary, and in exceptional, rare cases, when only the use of pesticides are effective, they must be allowed to deal with risks to human health or biodiversity.
Thirdly, although the Commission has committed itself to looking into extending the directive's scope of application to biocides, such a decision requires careful study, as well as the implementation of certain aspects of the directive on pesticides.
When more data is made available to us through the revision programme envisaged in the directive on biocides, we will be able better to deal with the use of biocides.
Fourthly, the Commission cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 152(4) of the Treaty, since the proposed directive is clearly focused on environmental protection, which already includes public health issues.
Fifthly, although the imposition of taxes and contributions complies with the 'polluter pays' principle, there is no effective system at the moment for differentiating tax rates according to the risk posed by each pesticide.
For this reason the Commission prefers that taxes and contributions should be imposed at Community level not at the present stage but until such a time as a study has been carried out into the issue.
Madam President, the Commission can accept 121 amendments of the 166 that were tabled; of these it can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part.
I am lodging with Parliament's secretariat a full list of the Commission's positions on the amendments.
Let me once again to thank all those who have contributed to this evening's debate and in particular the rapporteurs for their work.
Thank you for your attention.
in writing. - Pesticides are among the most dangerous chemicals, as they are designed to kill and they are released deliberately into the environment and onto food.
Only about 1% of a pesticide actually reaches its target.
Therefore, when we prepare legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides, we have to keep in mind what is in the interests of the different stakeholders.
It is in the interests of farmers to have a high harvest and good quality products with low costs.
If they can attain this goal with less pesticide, they can save on costs and provide healthier products.
It is in the interests of citizens to have safe, cheap products and pesticide-free drinking water.
Therefore, using less and safer pesticides is in the interests of almost everyone.
If we want to achieve tangible pesticide use reduction in Europe, we need effective national plans for reduction, focusing on the local circumstances and using local opportunities.
in writing. -

I support the thrust of this report as it enhances the current legislation governing plant protection products in a way that should give consumers more confidence about the foods that they eat, it should give those in direct contact with these products such as producers, farmers, suppliers with clearer guidelines in relation to the use of pesticides and in general, it will provide for the safe production of agricultural products in the EU.

However, it is important to point out that increasing legislation in this area will only be effective if there are sufficient checks and monitoring in Member States.
Currently it would appear that while there is some monitoring for residues on food products, it may not be adequate to provide sufficient assurances to consumers of these products.
Steps need to be taken to ensure that the measures foreseen under this legislation are enforced through effective monitoring.
in writing. - (HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been debating the details of this legislative package on plant protection products for a good many months.
In this time we have examined numerous viewpoints and incorporated them into the text.
As a result of this process, I think the draft we now have before us is one that is based on compromise in many respects and that meets as many demands as it possibly could.
There are some issues, however, that should not be subject to compromise.
When people's health is at stake, economic interests cannot be allowed to take precedence.
This piece of legislation is not about the competitiveness of Europe's agricultural sector, but about protecting the health of European citizens.
We have also seen that current rules in individual Member States differ widely.
In my country they are among the strictest.
While here in Strasbourg we have been debating whether a buffer zone of 5 or 10 metres should be established beside watercourses, Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres, and in some places even 500 metres, in place for decades.
Moreover, although use of plant protection products by our farmers is 15 times lower than in the Netherlands, Europe's intervention stores, when they still existed, were bursting at the seams with Hungarian maize.
In view of all these things, I ask my fellow Members to use their vote tomorrow to support the introduction of strict cut-off criteria.
On the basis of the compromise draft text, this would apply to a mere 29 substances out of more than 600.
This is not too high a price to pay for ensuring that proven carcinogenic and toxic compounds stay off the menu.
Even if there are differences as a result of specific national situations when it comes to voting, we are agreed in this regard.
Let us use our vote, then, to enable us to sit down to eat with a good conscience.
in writing. - (SK) Just like we have medicines for people, we also have medicines for plants: pesticides can justifiably be called that since they are medicines in the fight against diseases, pests and weeds.
Of course they must be used in accordance with set rules.
Incorrect application results in organism failures that manifest themselves as cancer.
Ladies and gentlemen, our approach to this issue must be based on scientific analysis.
We must not succumb to pesticide hysteria unleashed in the European Parliament.
Food self-sufficiency in Europe is falling and this is increasing the dependence of the agri-food industry on world market supplies.
We must remember that a shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices.
Following a consultation with experts, I consider some amendments of EU Directive 91/414/EEC and the Framework Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to be unworkable.
These new components stray from the principle of focused and proportionate legislation based on a scientific approach.
I realise that we need harmonised European pesticide legislation to ensure that foodstuffs are safe.
That said, we must not prevent farmers from using the tools they need to produce safe, nutritious and accessible food.
I cannot support the reports by Mrs Christa KlaÃ and Mrs Hiltrud Breyer as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I will vote for them only if the amendments by my political group, the PPE-DE, are adopted.
Verbatim Reports (amendment of Rule 173) (debate)
The next item is the report by Richard Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure, which deals with verbatim reports.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I rise to propose, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that we change the way in which we in this Parliament keep a record of our debates.
We are all familiar with the verbatim report that we get the day after the debates, with each speaker's speech rendered in their own language.
That will continue as now.
There will be no change to the record, in the original language, of what everybody has said.
What the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is proposing is to change the way in which we preserve the multilingual record of our debates.
Instead of gradually translating the debates and then, some months later, having a full written translated record in every language, we propose a switch to a system whereby the debates are electronically preserved and where any citizen can access them through the internet the very next day and see a visual record of the debate, with the soundtracks for every single language, preserved from the interpretation booths.
This will provide a more lively form of access to the debates than just a dry text.
It will be available immediately, rather than several months later.
I must confess that I was myself initially rather sceptical of this idea.
I always thought that keeping a full paper record of what everyone said, which was archived and which people could look at for many years to come, was an inherent part of being a parliament.
However, on reflection, and having listened to the arguments, I am now convinced that we can keep that multilingual access, albeit in a new form.
The problem with the old system is that the translations not only cost a substantial amount of money but also, more importantly, are only available several months later.
At the moment, they are placed on the web, where they are available electronically.
They are no longer printed in the Official Journal.
Very few people access them, look them up or use them, because of the time lag.
With this new system of preserving the debates, on 'web television' if you like, they will be available the very next day, when they still have political immediacy and when people are still interested in them.
We were also worried that historians, who, for all kinds of research reasons, tend to look back at parliamentary debates long after we have forgotten them, might be upset that we would no longer have a printed written version but only a visual multilingual version.
We wrote to various associations of historians and others, and to my surprise they replied that they, too, thought it would be much more interesting to have a more lively record than just the printed text in translation.
Viewing a debate on a monitor gives you the flavour of that debate.
You can see the body language of the speakers, and you get much more than by just reading a dry text.
Nonetheless, our report proposes a number of safeguards.
Firstly, the plurilingual verbatim report that we already get the next day will continue.
It will be there in all the original languages, as before.
Secondly, any Member of this Parliament will have the guaranteed right to request a translation, if he or she needs it for his or her political work.
The translation of any speech must be made rapidly available to the requesting Member.
Thirdly, we provide that the Bureau may decide to ask for a written translation of a particularly important debate, which will then still be published in written form in every language.
Fourthly, when extra language versions are available anyway, because they happen to have been translated - for instance, for a formal sitting at which a head of state is speaking, and courtesy translations have been provided - they too will be placed on Parliament's website.
Therefore, when translations are available in other languages, we will make use of them.
Finally, we ask the Bureau to look at technological developments to see if, for instance, in the future, computer translations can provide an extra tool, giving at least a rough idea of what was said in debates.
In conclusion, this is a fair proposal whose advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
It is not just a matter of costs; it is also about being a modern parliament and making our debates accessible much more rapidly, in a form which is much more useful.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we have a free vote in our group, so I have no authority to speak for all my colleagues.
We are again discussing the basic question whether a parliamentary service is worth the money or whether we must tighten our belt in response to the imperative of cutting costs.
Let me say at the outset that I also regard the new concept of video presentation as a good idea which should not be jettisoned.
Those people who want to have an immediate impression of our parliamentary proceedings can do so, and that is right and proper.
In my opinion, however, that is not enough, because the archiving of written records is quite simply an essential service.
Let me give you four reasons.
Firstly, all of the world's parliaments make their plenary debates available in written form and archive them so that people can consult the records to find out what has been discussed in Parliament.
Secondly, the video recording conveys a vivid and very interesting impression, but we also know that the hectic nature of proceedings often results in oral translations falling short of the quality we need.
We know this internally from our dealings with the tabling office.
We set up a tabling office ourselves to ensure that the formulation of motions and official documentation was absolutely correct.
Because we operate so multilingually, we must exercise particular care.
We want to continue taking the same care with our records of proceedings.
Thirdly, the researchers who expressed their views on this subject may not have been fully aware of the implications, for although they might obtain a lively record, there is an underlying lack of rigour in the proposed approach.
Besides, it is far easier to analyse a plenary debate if the researcher can enter a term, be it 'pesticides' or 'CO2', and be directed immediately to a debate on the matter in question.
It would seem that this cannot be done with video recordings.
In short, I believe that keeping written records represents value for money, and I am in favour of written archives in addition to video recordings.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that from a political viewpoint the subject we are debating today is about two objectives of equal importance, as the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, has said.
On the one hand there are the technical issues: how we can better implement translation in technical terms and economise on resources?
On the other, there is the issue of ensuring the greatest possible diversity of opinion, multilingualism and transparency in Parliament's work.
Here I have to say that in a political assembly such as ours, which is of course multi-ethnic and political, language is of very great importance.
Language is not just a means of communication; it is, as it were, a vehicle of culture, an expression of ideas, and long may this be so.
The technical issue must not be allowed to obscure the debate on equality and the coverage of all subjects by all the languages, and in full equality.
Let me point out that here we have another practical issue: how are we to achieve coverage in an economic way?
Various problems arise.
The first is the relegation of the written word, a matter already referred to as important.
I think that in politics we ought to preserve the written word.
The second problem to be taken into consideration is the lasting record of our Parliament's business.
Finally, if you will allow me to finish, Madam President: how can we make the work of our Parliament immediately available to the public, which I believe does not always have access to the internet?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Mr Friedrich and I have tabled some amendments, which are not seeking to substitute new technology for old but to supplement the old with the new.
It seems extremely unfair to stop the practice of 50 years of publishing a written script as soon as new Member States join Parliament, and it is, I think, essential for historians, for research purposes, that we carry on with our past practice.
The printed word is the primary source and must be kept for reasons of consistency, transparency and simplicity of research at a time when we are seeking to promote the study of the European Parliament.
We should show some self-respect as an institution and maintain forever the present practice.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Commission's initiative to amend Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament makes me think again about the European Union.
Who is the Union for?
Is it for ideologues or for the people?
If it is supposed to help people, then why is something being proposed that is against their interest?
What is it that we want to hide from people?
Yes, hide.
I say that because the intention to limit access to information in one's own language will mean that.
Why are citizen's fundamental rights being breached and why are people being discriminated against on the basis of the date they acceded to the European Union or the number of people in their country?
What is there in common between the principles of mutual respect and democracy and an attempt forcibly to bring about a situation where the inhabitants of the old EU Member States get materials, including written materials, in their own languages from the European Parliament, whilst the inhabitants of the new Member States are directed to websites to listen to recordings of debates.
At the same time no attention is being paid to the fact that, in the new Member States, there are many people who cannot afford to have the internet at home.
This affects millions of people; millions of people would be deprived of information.
Justifying the proposed decision on grounds of costs sounds like a joke.
Does this mean that we can afford to spend hundreds of millions of euros on unnecessary administration, on maintaining two or even three buildings for the Parliament, but we cannot afford to inform the people, the taxpayers, how the Union is spending their money and what are its plans.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we have any respect for ourselves and for other people, there can be only one solution, with no machinations.
We fulfil the instructions in Rule 96, which states: 'Parliament shall ensure the utmost transparency of its activities'.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, time and again this Parliament has had to struggle with a very lax attitude to democracy on the part of the European Council.
This can lead to the number of seats in Parliament being increased by one without consultation, whereupon they simply speak of 750 plus one and think this keeps them on the right side of the law.
What fills me with apprehension, however, is the thought that this attitude is taking root in such a way here in Parliament that some Members are seeking to put the most trivial pragmatic considerations before the most basic of principles.
It seems so simple at first sight.
The Rules of Procedure commit us to the utmost transparency in our activities - not to any old interpretation of transparency, nor to a form of transparency tempered by pragmatism or cost-benefit calculations, but to the utmost transparency.
The audiovisual presentation does not match that description.
An audiovisual presentation can be used for propaganda purposes or provide a quick source of information, but it does not offer a serious analysis of the words spoken in this House, of the discussions and debates that take place here.
Of that there can be no doubt.
Multilingualism is a guiding principle of this Parliament, and parliamentary debates form the core of our activity.
Being in touch with the people is our foremost duty.
If we give this matter even a moment's serious thought, we cannot deny that a parliament which sets itself apart from all other parliaments in the world by no longer archiving transcriptions of its debates is thereby sacrificing much of its parliamentary identity.
With regard to the cost factor, it would be very simple to cut costs by transcribing the interpretation of proceedings rather than translating them here.
That would also reflect the liveliness of the debate and reproduce it in the way in which it was actually understood and conducted.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, this Parliament is like the Tower of Babel, an allegory of the Habsburg Empire, which was full of sycophants.
It is the European Union's attempt to build an international empire based on a unified creed, with federalists, liberals, cosmopolitans and sycophant humanist thinkers.
The Tower was an idea of lunatics, however.
Its ultimate failure is attributed to linguistic differences, or what is called 'multilingualism' in the European Union.
The Corbett report seems to deny the nations of Europe to communicate effectively.
Mr Corbett's idea to draw up Europe as a multilingual document is like waiting for Godot, which is a communicative stagnation.
The report is a way to create a diversion from a real problem.
To communicate and understand one another, we need a dialogue, not a monologue.
The only instrument for this purpose is, therefore, translation into all 22 official languages.
Otherwise we are heading towards communicative chaos.
However, as the translation of my speeches into Polish sometimes does not even render 50% of what I have actually said, my Amendment 2 should therefore be included in the report.
I would urge all Members to vote for amendments that aim to preserve translation into all 22 languages and reject Mr Corbett's Amendment 1, which has been tabled as the committee amendment on the voting list.
rapporteur. - Madam President, Mr PodkaÅski seems to be implying that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was acting in violation of the Rules of Procedure.
The Rules of Procedure require every language to be treated equally, and what the committee is proposing is simply that, instead of a written verbatim translation in every language, we have an audiovisual translation in every language.
There is no discrimination between languages in this proposal.
It is simply a question of whether we have a written record or an audiovisual record.
In both cases, all the languages must be treated equally.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 October.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - We all know that Mr Corbett's report on the Rules of Procedure concerning verbatim reports is a sensitive issue.
Do we want all speeches translated into all languages or is an audiovisual record in all languages accessible immediately through the internet enough?
I will not repeat the arguments put forward by Mr Corbett, who I support in this issue.
I would just like to emphasise that we are in the heart of multilingualism.
The question is how we best endorse this core principle of the Union.
The options are spending at least EUR 10 million a year on translations that practically nobody reads, or spending that same amount on more important and urgent translations pending. Needless to say, I opt for the latter.
Therefore I support Mr Corbett's approach.
Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (debate)
The next item is the report by Chris Davies, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
rapporteur. - Madam President, let me start with an accusatory question to the Commissioner.
Some of us have pointed out repeatedly over the years that the car makers were failing to comply with the terms of the voluntary agreement to reduce emissions.
So, why is it that, some five years after this first became evident, we still do not have legislation before us requiring the manufacturers to meet the agreed targets, because with each month of delay it becomes harder to achieve the ambitions which were originally possible?
This sets the framework for today's debate.
Average emissions from new cars stand now at a little less than 160 g of CO2 per kilometre - a long way adrift from the target of 140 g by 2008.
Therefore, it is not surprising that Members here want car makers to be punished for breaking their commitment.
Yet the fact is that the manufacturers have broken no laws and, however much we may wish it were otherwise, the level of emissions is where it is.
The Commission has announced that it wants to stick to the medium-term target setting that voluntary agreement of 120 g by 2012, but says that 10 g of this will now be achieved by complementary measures.
I call this a political fudge: it has reduced the clarity of the target and encouraged some manufacturers to think that they can use biofuels as a means of avoiding significant design changes.
But, given where we are, are the target and the timetable set by the Commission still appropriate, because, of late, the reduction in average emissions has been hardly more than 1 g a year?
The Commission suggests that this should instantly be transformed into 5 g a year.
Well, that can be achieved - and the technology exists to do it - but at what cost?
Emission reductions must be made a priority for car makers, but they have to be achieved at the lowest possible expense.
That means giving industry specific targets and sufficient time to make the changes.
These improvements may increase the price of new cars but, then, reduced emissions mean improved fuel economy, so those who buy the cars will save money as they drive them.
Get it right and we can take action which will be good for the environment, good for the consumer and good for the future of car making.
There is a debate in this Parliament about whether, in a pre-legislative report of this kind, environmentalists should be pressing to send a strong signal to the Commission to be tough, or whether we should try to be realistic in framing measures which might actually be those that end up close to the final form at the end of the day.
That is why I am asking Parliament to break from the Commission position and recommend that the target for average emissions from new cars should be set not for 2012 but for 2015 and should be 125 g to be achieved by technical means alone.
By all means let us encourage the use of complementary measures to reduce emissions, but as an addition, not as a substitute, for these technical improvements.
For those Members who say this is not sufficient, let me just say that next month we will be voting on the CARS 21 report and, in that, the recommendation is 135 g by 2015.
We can end up voting for one thing this month and something else next month.
If I can help bring together the different positions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, then I believe it will strengthen Parliament's position and influence.
I believe that manufacturers should be set absolutely clear targets with no room for wriggling.
This report insists that failure to comply should result in the application of tough financial penalties.
I propose an internal trading mechanism to give manufacturers maximum flexibility and give incentives to the makers of low-emission vehicles.
But, ultimately, it is the penalty regime that matters and that, I suspect, will test the Commission's resolve.
Equally important is the need to set long-term targets to reduce emissions to below 100 g by 2020.
Given sufficient time, and an absolute requirement, I have no doubt that manufactures can achieve reductions of nearly 40% over the next 13 years.
Finally, let me just touch upon the way in which cars are promoted.
The manufacturers always claim that they respond to consumer demand, but I do not believe this.
I believe they shape consumer demand.
Studies have shown that a very high proportion of advertising expenditure goes towards the promotion of cars on the basis of power and size and speed.
The car industry is supposed to be drawing up a voluntary code of advertising conduct but we have had our fingers burnt through voluntary codes and any such measure should be regarded with suspicion.
It is time that advertisements give consumers more details of the fuel economy and emission performance of the vehicles on sale.
This information should be upfront and not buried away in the small print.
We need to encourage car makers to compete on the basis that their cars are safe and stylish and environmentally-friendly.
Let me finish with these remarks.
Europe's car makers produce fine vehicles.
The technical expertise of the companies themselves is much to be admired, but for too long they have ignored the contribution their products are making to the threat posed by climate change.
For the sake of the planet, for the good of an industry that needs to stay at the cutting edge of world-class technology, it is time now for law-makers to steer them firmly in a greener direction.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, road transport, along with the other sectors of the economy, must contribute to efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in a bid to achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets and our future commitments for 2020 and beyond.
Road transport is the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU.
Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12% of the EU's total emissions.
It is worth noting that while total emissions in the EU of the 27 Member States fell by nearly 8% in the period between 1990 and 2005, emissions from road transport increased over the same time period by 25%.
Here I should remind you that from 1995 the Commission set the target of 120 grammes, and the car industry was aware of it.
Let me also remind you that there was a voluntary agreement on achieving a reduction of CO2 emissions to 140 gr per km by 2008.
The Commission realised that this target would not be met by the car industry and the industry itself admitted this.
As a natural consequence, the European Commission carried out a re-examination last February of the Community strategy for the reduction of CO2 emissions by new cars, with mandatory legislation based on an integrated approach through which the European aim of reducing emissions by new cars to 120 gr. by 2012 would be met.
Dealing with the problem of CO2 emissions from cars is also expected to contribute to the hoped-for reinforced EU energy protection, by reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.
This, of course, will lead to a reduction in consumer expenditure on fuel.
Madam President, I am pleased to note that your report approves of our initiative in putting forward a legislative framework to reduce CO2 emissions by cars, and I thank the rapporteur, Mr Davies, for his efforts, as well as Mrs Harms and Mr Bulfon from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection respectively, for their suggestions on the subject.
The report sets out ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 and stresses that greater and more long-term progress will be needed.
The challenge is now to transform this political support into practical action.
The draft report proposes various important areas of work are, two of which I should like to comment on.
Firstly, your report points to the legitimate need of the car industry to have a time limit to be able to adjust smoothly to the new legislative arrangements.
Of course, as I have said before, this reduction strategy dates back to 1995.
Last month at the Frankfurt Motor Show, it was clear that the European car industry had made a significant response to the challenge of our new proposal.
Within a short period of time car manufacturers have managed to put forward economically affordable technical solutions, which are significantly fuel-efficient.
I am absolutely convinced that with our revised strategy and the imminent legislative framework we will offer car manufacturers equal terms of competition.
Environmental performance will be the motivation, not competition based merely on car size or engine capacity.
We can already see the first results.
Now that petrol prices are reaching record highs, we must waste no opportunity in setting ambitious targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the European car industry.
That will act as a strong incentive for innovation and renewal; it will also allow for major exports to emerging countries, where there is a great demand for fuel-efficient cars.
Secondly, your report points to the need for certain important parameters to take into account in future legislation, such as those determined by social impact and affordable prices for consumers.
Of course, fair treatment for all sides is very important.
I want to stress that we firmly intend to propose legislation to assess the situation of all car manufacturers and avoid any unjustifiable distortion of competition.
The overall target will be apportioned between car manufacturers in a sustainable and socially just manner.
The integrated approach that we are proposing will help the sector to prepare for the challenges ahead and will avoid an unfair burden on specific enterprises or on the sector as a whole.
These preliminary comments conclude what I have to say.
Thank you for your attention.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, may I say to Mr Davies that we should recall clearly why we have to discuss stringent binding emission limits.
The reason is that, following a voluntary agreement concluded between the Commission and the car industry more than ten years ago, the latter has knowingly and wilfully failed to meet its targets.
The present situation, as we know, is not down to bad luck or an unforeseeable turn of events but to decisions taken by the senior management of manufacturing groups.
For that reason, Mr Davies, I am somewhat stunned at the clear message you have now sent through your amendments - which I saw for the first time today, although they may have existed for longer - that, in spite of what was decided in the Environment Committee, you no longer have any interest in exerting pressure on the innovative potential and innovative power of the car industry in Europe
My opinion is that we can only achieve Europe's climate targets through the strict limits that were originally proposed by the Commission.
It is also my opinion - and you rightly addressed this point, Mr Dimas - that we shall not be able to obtain security of energy supply for our transport needs unless we ensure without delay that cars become more efficient, because we cannot stand by and watch as oil that is valuable and hard to come by continues to be squandered on our roads.
The third point, to which the Committee on Industry, whose opinion I drafted, attaches such great importance is the need to ensure at long last that the knowledge and ability of engineers and developers in the car industry are brought into play, and that these good engineers are not further stifled by misguided management policies.
I am firmly convinced that nothing but efficient, climate-friendly and affordable but stylish cars would be on the market within a very short time and that those who are easing the pressure for innovation today by setting what are truly very soft time limits for achieving reduction targets, Mr Davies, will bear responsibility if the European car industry proves uncompetitive in the long run and if jobs are lost in car manufacturing in Europe.
It goes without saying that the global car market will change out of all recognition - assuming we accept the underlying premises of our climate policy and our UN climate policy - and that those who are now applying the brakes to the process of reducing emission limits will then bear responsibility for the car industry in Europe going to the dogs and for a situation in which we ourselves no longer take our own climate policy seriously.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (DE) Madam President, I acknowledge the car as a universal means of transport, and I acknowledge the contribution of the car industry to the prosperity of Europeans.
I do not, however, believe in the car as a fetish.
For that reason it is incomprehensible to me that manufacturers should design cars to travel at speeds in excess of 125 miles per hour.
Building efficient, environment-friendly cars is a necessity, given all the evidence of climate change.
In addition, Europe is duty-bound to set a good example to the booming emerging markets.
It is ultimately the consumer's choice that will determine which cars are driven in the years to come.
This is why I argued in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for transparent and more easily understandable information on the emission ratings of vehicles.
I call on the Commission to take this report as the starting point for the presentation of an ambitious legislative proposal and to act quickly.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, can I first of all thank Mr Davies very much indeed for all the work that he has put into this report, and for his extremely constructive cooperation.
I am happy, on behalf of my Group, to endorse the target of 125 g by 2015 that Mr Davies has outlined.
It is a target which, I think, is extremely environmentally ambitious, but it is also achievable by what is a very successful European industry employing hundreds of thousands of people, and we must ensure that it remains a successful European industry.
I am convinced that those European car manufacturers will continue to produce some of the most environmentally friendly cars in the world, and these new targets - which, we should never forget, are the tightest in the world - will help them to achieve even cleaner cars in the future.
But the missing link in this debate is, of course, that of consumer demand.
We must make sure that consumers are demanding cleaner, more environmentally friendly cars, and, there, the Member States themselves have a very important role to play through their tax systems, which is, rightly, a matter for them.
They can, however, considerably affect consumer demand by introducing the correct environmentally friendly taxation schemes.
We also, in my view, need contributions to CO2 reduction from all of the related sectors: from the oil companies, from the biofuel producers, from the tyre manufacturers etc., all of whom have a contribution to make and can help us to achieve our ambitious targets.
I have also tabled some amendments to water down what I think are some very prescriptive requirements on advertisers, which Mr Davies has included in his report.
I think they are grossly disproportionate to the problem, and I am sure that, given sufficient opportunity, the manufacturers and the advertisers can come up with a binding voluntary code which would be equally effective.
I have also tabled - jointly with Mr Davies - an amendment to recognise the contribution of small-volume manufacturers who do not have a huge product range with which to average out the emissions requirements.
I hope the Commission will take those into account when formulating the legislation.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, Commissioner, this is a matter of urgency, as we all know.
Al Gore, who rang the alarm bell, has been awarded the Nobel Prize, and it is time for the European Union to stop talking and to act, because this is not a new issue.
There was a voluntary agreement entered into by car manufacturers to achieve average emissions of 140g of CO2 per kilometre by 2008, and that agreement was not kept.
I would remind you that the European Parliament itself fixed the target of 120g by 2005 or 2010 at the latest.
There is no justification today for backing away from those targets.
So what we need is an ambitious, unambiguous and binding directive and it needs to set targets in two stages.
First, in the short term, we need a target of 120g of CO2 for new cars and a 10g reduction to be achieved through complementary measures.
We need to move swiftly, however, and we therefore support the vote in the Committee on the Environment for the target to be achieved in 2012, with binding steps from 2009 onwards so that by 2012 the target will be met in full for all vehicles.
As the second stage, we believe it is essential to set targets of 95g for 2020 and 70g for 2025, with an intermediary deadline in 2016 to ensure that we are on track.
We therefore support the ambitious roadmap prepared by the Committee on the Environment because we think it succeeds in setting clearly visible standards, while at the same time confronting us with the technology gap that we need to overcome in order to meet our Kyoto Protocol commitments.
Yes, of course, it is going to be expensive and there will have to be negotiation about the price of new vehicles.
The first thing to note is that not all cars and not all manufacturers achieved the same effectiveness under the voluntary agreement.
Yes, we do need to favour small cars over large cars and we need to come up with tax measures, new practices and even bans in some cases, particularly in built-up areas, to prevent large vehicles, including 4x4s, from polluting our towns and cities all day long and producing huge quantities of CO2.
This question is particularly important because the bigger the vehicles that manufacturers produce, the bigger their profit margins.
We therefore need to guide the market in such a way that manufacturers producing smaller, less polluting vehicles can be more profitable than those producing big high-polluting cars and, as well as setting standards, we expect the Commission to propose strategies for moving in that direction.
The last point I should like to stress is the importance of proper information for vehicle purchasers to help them pick their way through this minefield, and specifically we need to get rid of misleading advertising.
That is why my group has tabled an amendment requiring a labelling system for all cars, based on an A-G format for energy efficiency, so that all consumers can make an active choice in favour of the environment.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, when it comes to discussing CO2 emissions, we are very quick to talk about cars, simply because the way to a person's guilty conscience is through their car.
That is why Mrs Harms, the Greens and many environmental organisations are particularly keen to talk about cars.
We are faced with a broken voluntary pledge - no doubt about that - and we therefore need regulation.
We have no alternative.
What you came here and told us, Mrs Harms, about the voluntary commitment being deliberately and strategically torpedoed by the car industry seems rather far-fetched to me.
Let me just remind you that a market comprises not only suppliers of products but also those who demand them.
We ourselves help to create demand too, and shortly, when we are driven home by the car service, we shall be using those very cars that do not meet the targets to which the car makers committed themselves.
I should like to see an initiative from the Greens.
If your intentions are honourable, please now make sure that the small cars which meet next year's voluntary target are ordered for Parliament.
In future legislation, it is imperative for us to ensure that the desired reductions stand up to cost-benefit analysis.
The Stern report which you and the Greens like to quote, Mrs Harms, calculates that, of 13 potential CO2-reduction measures, those targeting cars at the very top of the price range are actually the least effective.
Anyone making political demands for stringent emission limits and more efficient cars must recognise that the development and production cycle in the car industry takes five to seven years.
It is by failing to recognise that, Mrs Harms, that we put jobs at risk, not by recognising it.
I am therefore pleased that our rapporteur has done just this by saying that it is unrealistic to set any deadline before 2015.
Tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of one of the options on the table, and it must be said that, whatever it is, whatever year is designated and whatever average value is set, it will still be more stringent and ambitious than any other regime in the world.
We should not lose sight of that.
There is an extremely fine line between carrot and stick for our car industry, and at the end of the day we must take great care to ensure that we really do export the best products and not perhaps our industry.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I think this is the right moment to inform the outside world about what this Callanan-Davies deal is.
So, what is it?
It is delaying action from 2012 to 2015.
We have calculated the CO2 impact: 125 g in 2015 is worse than 130 g in 2012.
And the second part of the deal is exemptions for small-volume producers.
That is 300 000 cars a year, so that is not 'small volumes'.
I think that what we are voting on this week, Mr Davies' initiatives, are from a Green Liberal climate hero who has become a climate Judas.
It is really incredible: instead of using the possible centre-left majority in this House for 120 g in 2012, siding with reactionary Tories to help the car industry in Europe to win time - that is really not the way forward.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, in the past few months my fellow Members and I have met a great many representatives of the motor industry.
I do not think there has ever been so much lobbying over a report.
The industry has used every possible argument to prevent measures limiting CO2 emissions or at any rate to delay them.
It seems that they have won over many of my fellow Members, including the rapporteur, although fortunately the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was fully aware of its task.
Let me be clear: the motor industry is entirely responsible for this Commission proposal.
Attempts to agree on voluntary regulation were a miserable failure.
It seems that only compulsory standards are effective.
I find complaints that it all has to be done so quickly quite hypocritical, because the industry has known for years that these measures had to come.
The environment has to be cared for now, with drastic measures.
We have to do that, for ourselves and for future generations.
I am therefore urging a vote against Amendment 42, tabled by Mr Callanan and Mr Davies.
The amendment increases the maximum amount of CO2 and postpones the agreed date of 2012 to 2015.
That gives commercial interests priority over the environment and we absolutely cannot allow that.
What is Mr Davies trying to do to us?
Madam President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to thank Mr Davies for the way he has approached this, particularly his willingness to listen, and for a number of innovative approaches that we see in his report.
I also want to thank our rapporteur, Mr Bulfon, and to thank Mr Davies for adopting a number of our proposals in his report.
We have heard a lot of debate and discussion this evening about the car industry missing targets and about how we are going to move forward.
But I would like to echo what the Commissioner said and use the word 'incentive'.
This programme, and to meet the programme that Mr Davies has set out, is going to need billions and billions of euros of investment in new products and is going to tie up immense resources in engineering and product development.
(Objections)
I see my Green colleagues already shaking their heads; they seem to think that the technology is there, that overnight we can change a fundamental industry in that direction.
This is entirely unrealistic - where is the investment going to come from?
It is going to come from the profits of the car companies.
We need to sustain those profits so that they can reinvest them.
This demand here will be the biggest change and turnaround we have ever seen in a major industry.
Let us just remember that.
Let us not just sit here and make unrealistic demands.
This is a practical approach.
But, colleagues, let me remind you - and I refuse to accept this sort of crowing - I am absolutely not a lobbyist for the car industry.
I have argued for a long time that we need to set demanding targets.
We are moving towards a legislative approach for the first time.
But you should be listening as well.
And let me just make this other point.
Ideas about complementary measures and other things: what we are talking about here is a complete change in the way that people approach transport and motoring.
These new vehicles will come on the market over a long period of time.
But actually the complementary measures we are talking about - the consumer measures, the consumer information - those are the real incentives that we need to bring in.
I am sorry to overrun, Madam President, but you will admit I was interrupted by some colleagues in an entirely unnecessary way.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, this report, which Chris Davies has drawn up on the initiative of the Environment Committee, should signal to the Commission that the European Parliament is serious about reducing CO2 emissions.
When I see the amendments on the table, I start to wonder about that.
There are three points we should bear in mind.
Firstly, from 1 January 2012, new cars in Europe must not emit more than 120g of CO2 per kilometre.
We should not tamper with that date or the emission limit.
In 1998 the car industry made a voluntary commitment to reduce CO2-emission levels in its new vehicles.
In the light of news reports about the continuing advance of climate change, I see no reason at all for us to interfere with the deadline or the ceiling.
Secondly, future legislation must spell out clearly that the CO2 emissions of all cars must be reduced.
Large cars must make a greater contribution, but smaller cars must contribute too, so that we can achieve 120 grams by 2012.
My third point is that cars must remain affordable for people.
I agree with the previous speaker on that.
I come from a predominantly rural area, where people are dependent on cars to get them to their places of work.
For this reason, future legislation must perform a balancing act to reconcile the needs of the environment with those of the economy.
What good are strict emission limits if people can no longer afford new cars and drive about in their ageing vehicles?
It takes more than eight and a half years to renew the entire fleet of passenger cars on Europe's roads, and this must be in the back of our minds when we adopt new legislation.
Future legislation on CO2 emissions from passenger cars should be guided by the need to guarantee better protection of the climate as well as affordable driving.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I could begin like one of those old jokes: I have some good news and some bad news; which do you want to hear first?
I will start with the good news: the European Union is leading the battle to combat climate change; the 27 EU countries are now doing more than anywhere else in the world to halt climate change.
Now for the bad news: if the thousands of scientists around the world are right, then even this is much too little.
What then are we to do?
The answer leaves no room for doubt: we need a paradigm shift.
It is to be commended that Mr Davies' report highlights a number of important elements.
However, anyone who thinks that we will have solved anything by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the ever-increasing number of vehicles we use to 120g or 95g is gravely mistaken.
In my opinion, we can and must vote in favour of this report, and at the same time we must compel vehicle manufacturers to produce smaller and more efficient engines.
We must not stop there, however.
The European Union must commit itself unequivocally to technological change in the transport sector too.
Every means available must be used to promote research and development and innovation in this field, and we must stop providing any kind of support for conventional technologies.
Member States must borrow the best solutions from each other as soon as possible to provide manufacturers and consumers with legal, economic and other incentives.
Furthermore, while we are on the subject, I do not believe, for example, that biofuels are going provide the ultimate solution to our problems, especially not the current, first-generation biofuels.
They do seem, however, to be a necessary step on the way towards alternative fuels, as are hydrogen and electric propulsion systems and many other systems that are not yet widely used or have yet to be devised.
Let us help to foster these with the present vote and future legislation.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, I will not comment on this new cosying up between the British Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, as has been displayed by Mr Callanan and Mr Davies here tonight.
Maybe it is the new leadership battle for the Lib-Dems that has been going on, since some of their new leaders even have lookalikes!
What I want to talk about is the importance of sticking with ambitious targets.
I do not think industry can have been very surprised that the Commission talked about 2012 as a date for the targets or about the level of the target, because, of course, we know these have been mooted for many years.
Back in March, the EU leaders signed up to cut overall CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020.
If we are going to get there, we need to bring forward legislation which helps us to get there.
So, here we are at the very first hurdle towards that, and I do not think it is time now to fail in this European Parliament.
People out there are watching.
They want to know we are serious about tackling climate change.
Of course we have to work with industry, and Mr Davies talks about punishing industry.
Nobody wants to punish industry because the car industry, as Mr Harbour has just said, is a major European industry; it is a major employer and we have to work with them because only they can deliver these changes that we need to see.
So we need to work with them and we need to listen and I think what we need beyond everything else is a long-term project which everybody has signed up to so that everybody knows where we are going and everybody can try to get there.
Finally, on labelling and advertising.
We need a clear system, a green car labelling system, that every consumer can understand, just as they understand, when they buy white goods, how those white goods work.
The white goods manufacturers of inefficient goods have actually seen their products fall off the market.
We need to see the same for cars and I hope we can work together with industry to get a green labelling system that everybody understands.
(ET) So far our climate policy has focused principally on the energy sector.
Aviation is the next sector which will be incorporated into the European Union's emissions trading system.
Land transport, however, has a major influence on climate change and the Davies report is a thoroughly welcome initiative.
The car industry needs clear, long-term targets for reducing the level of CO2 emissions in exhaust gases and I support Mr Davies' approach whereby long-term limits will be established for CO2 emissions, for example for 2020 or 2025.
The car industry has had plenty of time to reduce the level of CO2 emissions.
We should not accept continued procrastination: the technological solutions already exist.
Similarly, I hope that Parliament will support the amendment I tabled to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Security, under which the car industry would have to reduce CO2 in exhaust emissions to 120g/km by 2012.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the report.
When discussing the whole issue of the Community's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions, it should be remembered that, in Europe alone, two million people are employed in the automotive industry, and another 10 million jobs are linked to this sector.
This industry represents 3.5% of European GDP.
The export value is EUR 33.5 billion and, what is no less significant, each year motor taxes generate EUR 365 billion for Member States.
The Community's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions will be successful only if it is thought through properly and provides sufficient time for producers to develop appropriate technological solutions.
I am in favour of introducing an appropriate transition period because the production cycle in the automotive industry is complex and needs a long time to adapt.
It would seem therefore that the best date for the introduction of the regulations would be 2015, also because the Euro 6 Regulation will come into force in that year.
I also think that there should be an integrated approach to CO2 emissions.
Research studies have indicated that to achieve the objective of 120g/km just through improvements in automotive technology will result in an increase of around EUR 3 600 in the average price of a car, which may result in many brands of cars becoming less accessible to the average EU citizen.
For this reason, basing CO2 emissions exclusively on engine technology is the most expensive solution.
One could achieve the 120g level by introducing additional solutions, such as introducing biofuels to a greater degree than at present, as well as by introducing additional solutions in vehicles, such as signals to change gears or low resistance tyres.
(NL) Mr President, road transport is a major source of pollution.
In 2005 transport, cars and lorries, accounted for 27% of total emissions of greenhouse gases.
If we want to tackle climate change, we cannot ignore the motor sector.
Unless action is taken, emissions will increase, not fall.
Unfortunately the motor industry has failed to take the initiative.
Years ago, motor manufacturers themselves made a commitment to reduce emissions.
The industry has built better and safer cars in the past few years.
A great deal of progress has been made, but unfortunately engine efficiency has been sadly neglected.
The target of 140g in 2008 will therefore not be achieved, certainly not on a voluntary basis.
Legislation is unfortunately not enough to achieve efficiency.
Legislation must be aimed at achieving an average emission of 120g in 2012, not in 2015.
A long-term target of 80g per kilometre is needed because we have set an ambitious goal for 2020 and that must also be reflected in the motor industry.
