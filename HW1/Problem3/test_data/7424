As the rapporteur, I hope that the negotiators will find, in the words of Jean Monnet, the inspiration for a final effort.
If not, the Republic of Cyprus would be admitted by the European Council of Copenhagen on the same terms as the other candidate countries.
Cyprus fulfils all the required conditions, and has now completed twenty-four of the thirty-one chapters of the accession negotiations.
There is therefore no doubt but that it will form part of the first wave of accessions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since time is short, I should like to focus on just one issue which has been mentioned several times already today, namely the presidential decrees.
In this context, the Czech Parliament's declaration of 24 April 2002 is helpful, since it states that the presidential decrees cannot be the basis for any new legal relations today.
However, there is one issue which concerns us, and that is whether discriminatory elements still exist in current Czech law, such as an act dating from 1992 on the restitution of property confiscated from its owners under Communism, which makes the restitution of property contingent on continuous Czech citizenship.
We must establish whether this provision conforms with European law. The same applies to what is known as the 1946 Criminal Indemnity Act.
In addition to clarifying these and other issues, a number of other problems will arise even after Czech accession to the EU.
I am convinced that a clear signal from those who were expelled in 1945 and from their descendants would be helpful.
This signal should make it clear that the property relations which emerged after the Second World War are inviolable, and should not be violated.
If this signal were sent out, Czech fears could be assuaged, and people who are currently consumed by these fears could use their energies productively to prepare the Czech Republic for EU accession in 2004.
Mr President, I have been a member of this Chamber for seven years and am now making my last speech because I shall be a candidate for the Swedish Parliament this autumn.
The fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Europe constitute the most important issue in my political work.
As rapporteur where Estonia is concerned, it feels good to be able to note that, finally, we shall now soon be there.
Estonia, which has closed 26 of 31 chapters, has fulfilled all the necessary conditions for becoming a member of the EU in 2004.
Estonia shows how quickly a country which has freed itself from a long occupation and has restored democracy has also succeeded in completely reorienting its policies and building up a strong, market-oriented economy with well functioning institutions.
The Estonian economy has produced fantastic results, and 4.5% growth is anticipated this year.
The Estonian kroon has been tied to the Deutschmark and, subsequently, the euro for almost ten years.
When Estonia joins the EU, I hope that the country will continue its work in favour of less bureaucracy and better basic conditions for businesses.
Estonia also has a belief in the future and a capacity for change that are needed by the EU.
During the Swedish Presidency, the Social Democratic Government spoke proudly of its timetable for enlargement.
We do not, however, build the EU with plans alone.
Timetables presuppose action.
That is why it is disgraceful that Sweden is now putting the timetable at risk and making enlargement conditional upon agricultural policy.
Agricultural policy is actually being reformed, albeit modestly, and it is important that there should be radical changes.
As the Council representative pointed out, those countries which are now using the agricultural chapter to delay the work on enlargement are assuming a big responsibility.
There can be nothing more important than that the EU honour its pledges and that the last chapter in the reunification of Europe be written in Copenhagen this autumn.
I want to express my congratulations to all those who have the privilege of working in the EU's different institutions and to express my thanks for some very close cooperation in the course of the last few years.
Mr President, this report represents a politically significant boost by the European Parliament to the enlargement process.
It is also a sign of encouragement at this crucial time when the Commission, the Council and the Member States, as well as the candidate countries, are preparing to open negotiations on the chapters which are most complex and which have the greatest budgetary implications.
We cannot ignore the fact that the chapters on agriculture and regional policy and financial and budgetary considerations alone account for 80% of the Community budget.
This was certainly what led the Commission prudently to propose a system of gradual implementation for the direct aid paid to farmers under the CAP and for the allocation of structural funds to the new Member States.
We are in no doubt that it was similar reasons that led some of the current Member States to call for a thorough restructuring of the CAP as a prerequisite for reaching a common EU starting position for negotiations on the agricultural chapter.
If we add to this the - to us obvious - need to continue to uphold the policy of economic and social cohesion between the current Member States, because otherwise enlargement could conceivably exacerbate existing disparities within the Union, it is easy to understand the words spoken on this matter this morning as a warning by the President-in-Office of the Council, RamÃ³n de Miguel.
The planning stage is over.
Where enlargement is concerned, real political planning has begun.
Mr President, the most significant landmark in Hungary's current political situation has undoubtedly been the legislative elections held in April.
In a coalition with the Liberal Party, the Socialist Party achieved a victory which gave it 198 seats in Parliament, as opposed to the 188 won by the party of the previous government.
It seems certain that the change of government will not affect Hungary's strategic objective of joining the European Union.
The winning parties have always maintained this aspiration.
Nevertheless, and bearing in mind the differences of opinion between the previous government and the election-winners on a whole range of issues, such as the Status Law, social dialogue and public procurement for example, the possibility of changes in Hungary's position on the accession process cannot be excluded, although I do not believe that they will jeopardise this process.
From the economic point of view, Hungary is maintaining a viable market economy and its economic performance is one of the best in the region.
Furthermore, Hungary has to date closed 24 chapters and has made more progress in negotiations than almost any other candidate country.
On the chapter dealing with culture and the audiovisual field, I am pleased to see that the government and the opposition have finally reached agreement on the representation of parliamentary parties on the Media Council - covering radio and television - which means that we will soon be able to close this chapter.
Let us hope - and we do hope - that the shortcomings seen in the field of public procurement will also be remedied and that the rules of competition will, at last, be fully complied with in the areas covered by this major market.
The announcement that anonymous deposits, even already existing deposits, are to be abolished, starting in the next few days, is also very much to be welcomed.
The adoption of such a measure demonstrates the consistency of the Hungarian authorities' initiatives to combat corruption and money-laundering.
It is this progress, of which I have given only a brief overview, and the trend that it reveals, which give us continuing grounds for optimism that the negotiations for Hungary's accession to the European Union will be concluded within the deadline that has been set and, consequently, that we will see its 22 Members in this House for the next legislature in 2004.
Mr President, the Member States really do seem to have forgotten that enlargement is a continuation of the historic project which began with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
I share the Commissioner's view, and above all his concern, that it is apparently the Member States' failure to recognise their responsibility which is causing the project to founder.
Have the Member States only just realised that these problems in agriculture would arise, and that a solution must be found, first and foremost, by the European Union?
Do you really not realise that delays in the timetable are grist to the mill of nationalist forces and actually encourage their emergence in these countries?
I therefore call on all the democratic movements here in this House, in the Member States and in the candidate countries to ensure that this major and historic project, which so many people in Europe have worked so hard to achieve, does not fall into the hands of election propagandists.
I have just had an opportunity to see for myself how difficult it was to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria item by item in Latvia.
For historical reasons and due to the great efforts made by Latvia, it would be impossible to explain to the local population that Member States are not prepared to do their homework here.
It is clear that the obvious deficiencies in European agricultural policy cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely without a reform.
It is also clear that Europe needs a constitution.
It is essential that this takes place in parallel to, and does not delay, accession.
After all, it was the prospect of enlargement and accession to the European Union which gave the crucial impetus to the reform movements in Europe and encouraged them to embark on a course towards a democratic Europe.
Let me cite Latvia as an example.
Although the majority of its political elite opposed this move, Latvia has amended one of its electoral laws and granted the Russian-speaking community an unlimited right to stand for election.
This is accepted as a matter of course in our own countries.
Yet in Latvia, this was a highly sensitive issue, just as agricultural policy is for us.
So if Latvia can do it, why can not we?
This comparison may not seem relevant to you, but it is relevant in terms of the candidate countries' expectations.
What we expect from them are the qualities which we ourselves should be displaying, namely a willingness to move towards integration, and an enthusiasm for reform.
Without constitutional reform and financial solidarity, Europe cannot progress.
The tasks to be resolved must be resolved here.
We cannot point the finger at the enlargement countries and tell them that they should be doing this and that if we cannot manage to do the same things ourselves.
I would certainly recommend that Latvia's accession be planned for the end of 2002, for I am convinced that this country can resolve its remaining problems.
The European Commission must also continue with the process of decentralisation and pursue policies which are close to citizens in order to shape this process successfully.
Mr President, I am optimistic and I am certain that what Commissioner Verheugen has repeated on numerous occasions will in fact happen and that, at the beginning of next year, the first accession agreements will be signed with the new Member States of the European Union in the Pnyx beneath the Acropolis, in the precincts of the church of the parish of direct democracy in which Saint Paul himself preached.
I am sure that this new historic reconciliation, which is good news for all of us, will look to the future and that we shall all dismiss the atavism which has been flying around recently as a mere distraction of no importance whatsoever.
We have seen a great number of protagonists along the way.
The twelve candidate countries, ten of which will join us next year, at least on paper, with the other two, I hope, following on a little later.
Along the way, nations have woken up and governments have woken up.
However, I should like to highlight the real efforts made by a number of countries.
Cyprus tops the league of candidate countries.
It has an exemplary economy, an exemplary democracy and its institutions operate in an exemplary fashion.
And hopefully, all these developments will help forces which do not operate as positively as they might to resolve regional problems.
Malta, that unique Mediterranean island, the only one left which will not be a member of the European Union for some time yet and which we need to treat with understanding and on its own merits.
Lithuania, for which I have acted as rapporteur.
This country has forged ahead in leaps and bounds in resolving the problem of moving from a planned economy to a free market economy.
It has made excellent progress on a great many issues.
Taking a decision such as the one about the Ignalina nuclear power station which Commissioner Verheugen mentioned earlier takes a great deal of political courage, especially when you know the regional structure of energy networks in the area and how the economy depends on them.
There are two problems: first the usual problem in these countries, that is, agriculture. I trust we shall demonstrate the courage needed and the will needed to ensure these issues do not delay the enlargement process.
Secondly, the major political issue of Kaliningrad.
Clearly, these political issues and other issues in Europe must not listen to the urgings of the past. They must listen to the needs of the future.
In this sense, the political wisdom of the European Union will be judged in Kaliningrad; it must be true to itself but must understand that the historic reconciliation reached between the 15, between the 25, the 27 and the 28 countries has to be a factor in continuing historic reconciliation, a Europe of peace, cooperation and development for everyone.
A Europe in which we feel at home.
Mr President, Mr de Miguel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having provisionally closed 22 chapters in the negotiation statistics - although this cannot be taken as the sole criterion - Malta has lost a little of its dynamism.
Like all the other accession candidates, not only are specific chapters open, so too, of course, are the major areas of agricultural, regional and budgetary policy.
However, economic development has been positive, and the budget deficit has been substantially reduced.
In terms of Malta's alignment with and implementation of Community law, Malta has made substantial progress as regards labour legislation and health and safety in the workplace.
In the area of competition, further efforts are needed to strengthen administrative capacity. However, Malta is not alone in this respect.
What is also positive is that Malta has created a suitable legal framework for the development of investments and the restructuring of SMEs.
There are still shortcomings in the environmental field and in preparing the structures needed to implement the EU's regional and agricultural policies.
However, here too, the European Commission is called upon to respond to Malta's specific agricultural structure, which is based on small farms, its traditional taxation system, or the specific trade conditions resulting from its island status.
We should also support Malta's claim to six seats in the European Parliament.
I hope that Malta's accession process will speed up again in the coming months, and that when the Commission's report is presented on 16 October 2002, Malta will be included as one of the candidates for the first round of accessions.
Finally, as the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should like to comment on the highly sensitive issue of the Bene? decrees.
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is pointing out that discriminatory provisions which conflict with the acquis communautaire must be abolished before accession to the European Union, and I hope that after the elections in the Czech Republic, this issue can be resolved in an objective way.
As regards the issue of nuclear safety, I would like to emphasise in particular that the European Parliament should maintain adherence to the closure dates for dangerous and non-upgradable power stations - not only Ignalina, but also Kosloduj and Bohunice.
Mr President, Poland has made great progress in its journey back to Europe, at the cost of great sacrifice and the risk of unpopularity on the part of its governments, which have determinedly pursued this objective.
I regret to say that, in Poland, as in the other candidate countries, accepting compromises with Brussels, giving the impression of yielding ground, is seen as extremely negative, and there is now a price to pay for those who do so.
Poland is paying this price with great European determination.
In this regard, I would like to stress how important and useful the information campaign on accession to Europe organised by the Polish Government is proving to be, yielding excellent results. It could be used by other countries as a model.
I would also like to express my firm support for the Commission and the Council's refusal - Commissioner Verheugen mentioned this just now - of Russia's request for transit corridors from Kaliningrad.
Those who are familiar with the history of Poland know what corridors mean for that country.
I would just like to express one concern in what is, on the whole, a positive picture for Poland, regarding what appear to be clumsy attempts on the part of the current left-wing government to influence, or rather to restrict the independence of both the press and television and the National Bank of Warsaw.
I trust that the debate currently taking place in Poland on these two key institutions of any democracy will not result in decisions which mar the esteem in which this country is held in the world.
I will end by sharing a further concern with you, which has already been expressed by Commissioner Verheugen, namely that there is resistance to enlargement in the air.
There is, in effect, something unhealthy in the air: enthusiasm is waning and the anti-European parties are gathering support everywhere.
In my opinion, we really do need to redouble our efforts: it is our duty.
Slovakia has, over the past year, made considerable progress in the negotiations about EU membership, and this certainly deserves credit, also in view of the internal problems which the government coalition has faced in that country.
Slovakia is now, since yesterday, at the top of the list of negotiating countries, which is, given that country's past, no mean feat.
But in the case of Slovakia too, preparations have not yet entirely finished.
Judging from the schedule, a great deal of work will need to be done this year.
Despite the optimistic note in my report, there are still points of criticism and points that will weigh heavily when this Parliament comes to reaching a final verdict.
They are not new and concern in many cases other candidate countries too.
They involve the fight against corruption which, in Slovakia, is still too widespread.
They also concern improving the government's implementing capacity, a topic, in fact, to which this Parliament ought to devote a separate debate.
In addition, the problems of the Roma should be tackled more swiftly.
Also, an effective regional policy should be developed as a means of fighting excessive levels of unemployment in that country.
Additionally, effective border control should be implemented in the framework of future Schengen cooperation.
For a number of these points, demands are high.
We do not want perfection but visible progress towards an average level we have in the current EU.
It is precisely the advocates of enlargement, to which, fortunately, also the large majority of this Parliament belongs, who have the responsibility of carefully testing the acceding countries at the end of the journey, on the basis of the criteria formulated in the past.
In September, parliamentary elections will be held in Slovakia and there is already a great deal of speculation about the outcome.
It is up to the Slovakian citizens to decide, but as in 1998, these elections are, in fact, about Slovakia's future in Europe.
I hope that the turn-out will be as high as possible, and I expect that the outcome will lead to the forming of a new government that will be able to work with the European Union in a manner that is just as positive as the current government.
Mr President, I feel that the Brok report provides an excellent overview and a method for future similar operations.
With regard to the current operation - enlargement - the sooner it happens the better.
The politicians of the new democracies, although in some cases the public rather less so, are under the impression that outside Europe it is darker and rainier, but many small, developed countries, including Slovenia, are wont to succumb to fears and see complete sovereignty as a way of constraining the globalising force of the strong and the economically aggressive.
I hope that the Brok report will help to set them straight and convince them that they are progressing along the right road.
It appears that the general issues have already been dealt with and I would therefore like, if I may, just to focus on Slovenia.
Ultimately, as far as Slovenia is concerned, there are two sensitive points in particular.
Slovenia, considered to be among the best prepared candidate countries, is making every endeavour to complete the adoption of the chapters of the European acquis. In practice, however, the problems revealed are the same as those highlighted by other reports.
In some sectors, the efforts are yielding the desired results, but there are delays in others.
Ljubljana looks set to achieve the four Maastricht criteria on target, reducing inflation, and that is a considerable achievement.
There seems to be a certain amount of progress in areas such as the computerisation of the land register and the privatisation of banks, particularly the privatisation of banks, which is an indication of greater openness towards other countries.
The computerisation of the land register, on the other hand, should reduce the number of civil court cases attributable to denationalisation.
The European Union has been urging Slovenia to speed up the procedures and make good the delays in this field for years now.
Brussels, for its part, understands Slovenia's concern that it will enter the Union under unfavourable conditions or even as a net contributor.
The support for agriculture, which is not sufficiently long-term, does not provide sufficient reassurance.
It would appear that Slovenia's argument that stable mechanisms need to be found for the Structural Funds, direct payments and so forth is falling on sympathetic ears.
Mr President, as a general point I would first say what a pity it is that we did not use this great opportunity of enlargement to introduce a lighter, less integrative approach to European cooperation, which would be less burdensome to all concerned.
Instead we have the enormous weight of the imposed acquis, which grows by the day and significant elements of which are ignored even by current Member States, let alone the candidate states.
I would also hope that the enlargement report before this House will continue to make reference to all 13 candidates for accession.
This will enable Turkey's progress to be addressed.
I note Mr de Miguel's realistic but encouraging remarks with regard to Turkey.
Furthermore, the negotiations for a just, lasting and mutually acceptable settlement of the Cyprus question, which most of us so anxiously desire, are at a very sensitive stage.
Both sides must be encouraged to make the necessary compromises to reach such a settlement.
As rapporteur for Bulgaria, I want to commend that country for the steady progress it is making towards EU membership, with its economic successes, its strategies for administrative and judicial reform, for more effectively dealing with the problems of its minorities, for tightening its borders and for fighting corruption.
We now need to translate these strategies into more effective action which produces tangible results so that Bulgaria will be in a position rapidly to close all the negotiating chapters with a view to accession in about 2007 or 2008.
Such a positive outlook, backed up by what must be well targeted, well managed European Union assistance, would help sustain support for modernising governments and reformed public institutions in Bulgaria - support which is frail at the moment.
We need to send a positive signal to Bulgaria with a clear road map for accession.
I welcome Commissioner Verheugen's promise of additional aid and a reinforced approximation strategy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the Committee on Budgets' point of view, we want to send out two signals to the Council, the Commission, the European public and the accession countries today.
Firstly, we want to make clear our desire to put the budgetary conditions in place so that enlargement can go ahead in 2004, involving up to ten candidate countries.
Secondly, we want to make it very clear to the Commission and the Council that according to Paragraph 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement and on the basis of Article 272, the adjustment of the financial perspective is undertaken on the proposal of the Commission together with Parliament and Council, namely with a qualified majority in the Council and, in Parliament, a majority of its Members and three-fifths of the votes cast.
Let me add that everyone involved should work towards ensuring that the outcome is capable of securing a majority in both the current EU and the new Member States.
This is a major challenge and obligation for us.
The original financial perspective contains an indicative financial framework, initially for six new countries from 2002.
However, this framework should serve as a basis for the negotiations, so that the decisions taken in Berlin, Agenda 2000 and the acquis communautaire might be adhered to.
Based on the plenary's decisions of September 2001, we greatly welcome the approach involving progressive integration in agricultural and structural policy, simply taking account of the pre-accession experience, budget discipline, and WTO rules, but also the candidate countries' own domestic situations.
We also welcome the fact that the agricultural subsidies available to the new Member States are to be increased to reach the level of 100% of direct aid by 2013.
It is clear that if necessary, we must start discussing the European Union's development after 2006 today.
Will the financial perspective be extended or revised?
What will happen in agricultural policy and the structure of direct payments, rural policy, and society's new demands regarding international competitiveness and the WTO?
Then there is the issue of introducing a comprehensive reform of the structural fund mechanisms due to the experience of absorption, the simplification of procedures, greater consideration of local conditions - all this is necessary.
I would like to take up what the Presidency has said: let us not overburden the accession negotiations, and let us stop and think for a moment.
Taking decisions today for the period after 2006 also means anticipating the recommendations of the Convention on the future of the European Union.
In my view, this is unacceptable.
The simplified model of direct payments in agriculture, and the concept of special financing arrangements via a Fund which is defined and managed separately from the Cohesion Fund, offering very favourable conditions to the new Member States, is the right approach.
However, let me add this: alongside improved utilisation of structural fund resources in the accession countries, the possibility of phasing out the special conditions must also be discussed.
In particular, we wish to endorse the comments made by Mr Verheugen in connection with aid to the new Member States, especially as regards improving administrative capacities and the closure of nuclear power stations, with specific closure criteria being a precondition for this aid.
New Member States will also entail new external borders. This means new partners on the EU's external borders, which will raise new issues concerning cross-border cooperation and the European Union's foreign policy.
It has also implications for heading 4 of the budget, and we therefore wish to be consulted on these issues at an early stage.
The provision of budgetary compensation to the accession countries through a lump sum on the expenditure side of the budget, which should be temporary and degressive, in order to prevent any new Member State being a net contributor during the first years, is something which we would certainly support.
Naturally, the fact that the administrative costs may reach the upper limit stated in the financial perspective is a cause for concern, and we will have to look at whether we are in a position to abide by this limit by streamlining work processes and competences or whether we have to accept what the Commission has defined as additional costs of some EUR 500-600 million in this area during the first years.
Finally, I should like to mention one very important point.
If there are any net contributors who believe that we should already be setting a framework for the period after 2006 in all policy areas, I should like to remind them that a new financial perspective, whatever form it might take, must ultimately be decided on the basis of unanimity. This makes it clear that in the future, too, based on the Commission's proposals for the enlargement process, we have the opportunity to maintain budget discipline while having a responsibility to achieve a balance in this negotiating process and find a solution which is in the interests of the current Member States but also takes account of the equally justified interests of the accession countries.
Let us all get to work to achieve this outcome.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming enlargement which is the subject of our debate today naturally poses a unique challenge to the European Union.
The number of Member States will virtually double.
The EU's population will increase by almost 50%.
What will not increase substantially, however, is the Gross Domestic Product of this new enlarged EU.
It will only rise by about 10%.
The prosperity gap between the current EU, with its fifteen Member States, and the accession states is enormous.
This enlargement will entail major burdens for us all.
Nonetheless, we all agree that these burdens are immaterial in light of the historic opportunity afforded to us to unite Europe in peace and democracy and in political and economic stability.
Yet already, many of our regions bordering candidate countries are experiencing a foretaste of enlargement.
It is precisely these border regions which will face tremendous problems in the wake of enlargement. They will bear the brunt of enlargement for us all.
These border regions need our solidarity.
We must help them to cope with this difficult situation.
Certainly, not all the border regions are the same.
Some of them are prospering more than others.
Nonetheless, many of them have been in decline for some time.
These regions have been on the absolute periphery for decades; indeed, from our perspective, they are almost at the edge of the world.
It is not a particularly attractive situation, and this is reflected in the fact that many of them are still areas covered by Objective 1.
They still have a major deficit compared with the EU average.
What are the key features of the situation in these difficult border regions?
High unemployment, a lack of prospects and even resignation, the drifting away of young people, inner city decline, decaying villages in rural regions, and a resulting loss of infrastructure - for no one contemplates expanding the road network if it seems that no one uses it any more.
These regions' loss of infrastructure, their loss of quality of life and their declining attractiveness and quality as a location for industry create a vicious circle.
Then there is the competition from the accession regions on the other side of the border, which are quite rightly pushing westwards. It is a fact that the borders have been semi-permeable for a long time.
This is not necessarily a fair competition, for we all know that the prosperity gap is wide between these neighbouring regions on either side of the border.
It results in major differences in the cost of living and in labour and social costs, as well as highly disparate environmental standards, which are likely to continue for some time.
This situation substantially distorts competition.
It is particularly difficult for small and medium enterprises in the trades and service sectors, which is why, in my report, I have focussed especially on support for SMEs in the border regions.
Indeed, I would have liked to set up a separate budget line for this area in order to guarantee that the support genuinely reaches its target.
However, I was forced to recognise that this was unlikely to be supported by a majority in this House, for of course it is quite correct that setting up a new funding instrument takes a great deal of time, and time is running out for these SMEs.
They need assistance urgently.
I therefore abandoned my idea and agreed that the well-established, tried and tested funding instruments such as Interreg should be used instead.
In the end, I also had the impression that the Commission recognises the urgent need for strong support to SMEs in these problematical border regions.
We ourselves should also recognise the need for short-term transitional measures relating to the freedom to provide services and the free movement of workers.
What is needed, please, is a gradual opening and a cautious approach.
Naturally, therefore, I do not support the amendments before us which dispute that these measures are necessary.
Incidentally, it is also important to stress that we are focussing on our border regions very late in the day, and that the financial resources available are completely inadequate.
This is described in my report as well.
It would be unfair to use the lion's share of these meagre resources to expand the Trans-European Networks.
These TENs are in Europe's general interest.
They are only of limited benefit to the border regions.
In the border regions, what is required are regional transport links and, in particular, cross-border transport services.
There is virtually nothing available at present.
The measures which we are now initiating through this Community action for border regions are really only a start, a first step.
Let us recognise that dismantling the existing deficits is likely to take several generations, and so further measures must follow.
Of course, the border regions are now moving to the heart of Europe, and this naturally offers them great opportunities for the future.
There is a chance for them to become a model of best practice for European regional cooperation, that is true, but this is likely to take many years.
Until then, we must help them.
Let us send out a signal and endorse this report by a broad majority in this House.
Let us send out a signal to the citizens living in these difficult regions that we are not sacrificing them to the enlargement process, and that we are not abandoning them. Instead, we are taking them by the hand to progress together towards a positive future.
Mr President, after the fine proposals for our dream Europe, we must come down to earth to the bad news of Europe as it is at present. The report of which I am the rapporteur examines three annual reports by the Commission relating to the year 2000: the report on the Structural Funds, the report on the Cohesion Fund and the report on the Instrument for Structural Policy for Pre-Accession.
If Commissioner Barnier, the Commissioner responsible for regional policy, were here, I would have read him what he said before this House during the year 2000, but he is not here so I will not bother with that.
The year 2000 was the first year in which the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund interventions laid down by the 1999 regulations was actually implemented.
In the light of the report by the Commission itself and both the annual and special reports of the Court of Auditors, we have noted that the simplification and speeding-up of implementing procedures for structural measures promised by the Commission in Agenda 2000 and implemented through the adoption of new regulations did not have any effect.
As was pointed out, again by the Commission, with regard to the rates of implementation of the Structural Funds objectives overall, there were delays similar to those recorded in 1994.
It was only thanks to the 7% advance and automatic annual commitment that it was possible to attain rates of implementation of 13% for commitments and 5% for payments.
If we consider the objectives, Community initiatives and innovative measures as a whole, only 51.8% of the appropriations available for the year 2000 were committed, and that is without taking into account the situation of the new Community initiatives, which is truly unbelievable.
Despite the fact that the Community initiatives were scaled down and simplified with the intention of making them more effective and were thus reduced to four - Leader, Interreg, Equal and Urban - the rate of budgetary implementation was zero for both commitments and payments, and no measures were approved.
Furthermore, the guidelines for the innovative measures were not adopted until the beginning of 2001.
Clearly, these data induce us to raise the purely rhetorical question of whether the new programming rules really make it possible to ensure transparency of budget management and avoid liquidity bottlenecks.
We cannot conceal our fear that the delays that affected the implementation of Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund resources in 2000 might jeopardise the attainment of the goals charted for the crucial 2002-2006 programming period, and that is without even considering the measures from the previous periods.
We were surprised to learn that, at the end of 2000, 11 years after the closure of commitments and nine years after the final date for making payments, as many as 35 programmes from before 1989 were still open.
Moreover, there were as many as 73 operating programmes from the 1989-1993 period still open too.
What can we say?
We note that the non-extendable deadlines and the threats of stringent coercive measures repeatedly proposed by the Commission were once again disregarded.
Moving on to monitoring and evaluation: in its annual report for 2000 and its Special Report for 2001, the Court of Auditors has detected serious shortcomings in the management and control systems of the Commission and Member States.
The seriousness of the errors in intermediate payment declarations is the same as in previous years and the most frequent errors are similar to those previously recorded in various Member States.
Lastly, we agree with the opinion of the Court of Auditors that checks should meet internationally accepted standards, including provisions stipulating that those carrying out the checks should be independent of those implementing the project, which is not the case at present.
I will end with ISPA, which would appear to be the reason my report has been slipped into the enlargement melting pot.
We note that the Commission committed approximately one third of the funds earmarked for 2000 during the first year of programming and we wish to see implementation stepped up considerably so as to guarantee full use of these resources, which are vital to the balanced development of the candidate countries.
Lastly, I am absolutely astounded that, in a debate on enlargement which includes a discussion on Hungary, not one Member has mentioned that, on 7 September 2001, Hungary appeared on the updated list of countries and territories which were not cooperating with the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, a group which is part of the OECD, which is a body to which the European Union itself belongs.
Fine, we did not realise what was going on in Hungary and we will continue to pretend that everything is going well and that our dream Europe will be better than the one we have today on which I have reported.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the Sapard report in this related debate, I would like to say a few words about the enlargement negotiations.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wholeheartedly supports the Commission's line in the agriculture negotiations with the accession candidates.
We call upon the Council and especially some Member States to give their support to the course adopted by the Commission on agriculture.
As many of you are aware, I have been a fervent supporter of reform in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for many years.
I will carry on being one in future, and we are looking forward to the Commission's communication on this issue with great excitement.
However, one thing must be clear: the reform debate must not interfere with the negotiations.
No premature conditions must be set at this stage which might delay the accession negotiations.
Conversely, of course, the accession negotiations and the accession candidate countries' demands which understandably arise must not be allowed to impede the reform debate.
The two must run in parallel, but must not block each other.
We feel that this is a very important point.
Naturally, there is conflict: some Member States are not in favour of any direct payments, while the recipient countries would like to receive 100% - and let me say to the candidate countries that they will yet again have cause to be grateful to the Commission for its proposals.
On the issue of Sapard: while we spend our time arguing in the accession negotiations about the level of payments, we are failing to exploit the opportunities for pre-accession assistance that Sapard offers.
We are pushing substantial amounts of money around as if we were a snow plough.
Of course, there are reasons for this.
I am not trying to apportion blame, but it is important to analyse the causes clearly and decide what else we can do.
Of course, the decentralised management of the programme which we have opted for is a very demanding method of management.
I am sure that money would have been paid out to projects much more quickly if we had had a centralised administration with management by the Commission.
For sound and well-intentioned reasons, things were done differently.
However, we must accept that we should have foreseen that these generous arrangements involving a decentralised structure and increased individual responsibility on the part of the accession countries were unlikely to achieve the rapid outcomes which were desired.
We hope that there will be a major step forward this year.
Unfortunately, however, we cannot make up for lost time.
This is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recommended to the Commission last year that since we have opted to manage the programme in this way so that it involves a learning process which will ultimately be of benefit to the candidate countries after accession, why not implement other elements of rural development which we have tried and tested in a European Union with fifteen Member States?
Why not include a Leader-type programme, which we have christened INPARD?
Now, of course, this proposal by the committee is being dismissed by the Commission, which tells us that we have run out of time and that we do not have the right legal framework.
The Commission often uses these arguments when it does not want to adopt a particular measure!
It may well be the case that if we now motivate the organisations and local populations by offering them a Leader-type programme and encourage them to develop their own ideas creatively in rural areas, things will not really get off the ground until they are full members.
Nonetheless, we would win some time if we try to involve them pro-actively in this way.
What is more, this type of programme might give us an opportunity to channel all the money that has been lost - not down the Swannee, I would not say that - back into the Finance Ministers' coffers.
We are not happy with the situation, none of us, we know that.
The Commission is not happy either since the Sapard funds have not been used in the way we wanted.
Nonetheless, let us at least put on a spurt over the final metres so that we can see something for our efforts, and so that all the Member States - and there are differences between the accession countries in this Sapard programme - so that they experience the EU and so that the money which is urgently needed for reforesting around agriculture, and for slaughter-houses and dairies etc. can genuinely help them to attain the quality needed to make their products marketable in Europe.
We must also make it clear to the accession countries that it is not only a matter of quality: once they have full membership, they must supply the EU market.
We cannot make distinctions in terms of the quality of agricultural products depending on whether they are destined for the EU's internal market or for export.
The excuse used by some candidate countries - that we should not get excited about it because they are not exporting to the EU at present, and are actually buying products in Ukraine and Russia - will no longer be relevant.
We cannot accept it.
This is why money and prompt assistance are needed.
Money now being spent on Sapard and other programmes in the accession countries will save us money later when these countries are full members.
Let us try and make the best of it!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, I believe that we should sometimes stop and pinch ourselves and reflect upon how privileged those of us are who are permitted to work on European issues right now.
To unify Europe and finally incorporate the countries of central Eastern Europe into the European Union is the historic challenge of our time.
Sometimes, I see this as unreal because, for a very long time, I had got used to there being a dividing line running right through Europe, which would remain in place.
Fortunately, it did not do so.
Now, however, I feel that unification is taking an unduly long time, with many years already having passed since the dividing line disappeared.
As Mr Brok said, there is no longer any excuse for delaying enlargement.
To provide their people with safe and nutritious food has always been an important ambition for all states.
That is why agricultural and food policies play such a large role, both in areas of the world with surpluses and in those with shortages.
Agricultural policy is a knotty problem in the accession negotiations.
The EU cannot reasonably meet all the wishes of the candidate countries.
In the negotiations, we must, however, create a feeling of understanding and community within the framework of the EU's long-term economic and political commitments.
The Council (General Affairs) was unable to achieve agreement on the issue of direct payments.
I wish to take this opportunity to state clearly that I do not support the Swedish Government's view, but am in favour of the Commission's policy when it comes to the phasing-in of direct payments.
One Paragraph of our report proposes that the Commission should provide help and support on the issue of Romania's and Bulgaria's continued work with a view to accession.
I would therefore thank the Commissioner for having already begun by explaining that this should be done.
It is very pleasing when we are agreed in our endeavours.
We are also addressing a number of points which may perhaps make the negotiations a little smoother.
It is possible that the Commission has already come up with these ideas.
Regarding the establishment of quotas and volumes, we believe that, within the framework of the quotas and volumes proposed by the Commission, account should be taken of the candidate countries' situation during the reference period, their production potential and their consumption trends.
We also believe that those countries which, for various reasons, have exposed their agriculture to a tough market in recent years should not be treated unfairly.
In countries with low direct payments prior to accession, it should moreover be possible to provide the option of exceeding that level.
I do not say that that should apply generally, because it is sensible not to allow any increase over and above previous levels.
There should nonetheless be an opportunity and scope for discussion about the option of exceeding that level in those cases in which the economy permits this and in which competitiveness will not be harmed.
Given that the candidate countries are undergoing major readjustments, it would also be appropriate after a little while to review how the common agricultural policy is to be applied.
The President-in-Office of the Council is right in saying that enlargement is one thing and agricultural policy another.
There are, however, connections, and we believe it is a matter of urgency for both EU and candidate countries directly to begin to discuss how a future agricultural policy might look.
We are all aware that it must be changed, and such discussions would perhaps facilitate acceptance by the candidate countries.
I believe that the EU, in accordance with the discussions now being conducted at the World Food Conference and in accordance with the WTO's ambitions, has a crucial interest in being able to sell its food on a functioning world market.
Hopefully, it will then be possible to exploit its production potential.
I want to make a recommendation to the Council and the Commission: negotiate with knowledge, sensitivity and love, and we shall achieve a good result.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, on 18 April 2002 the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities adopted an opinion drafted by Mrs DybkjÃŠr on the basis of the Commission reports submitted in November 2001.
Unfortunately, Mr Brok's otherwise very important report does not include any of our proposals on the legal and social position of women in the candidate countries and, as chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights, I should like to express my committee's acute displeasure to the House.
Naturally I hope that the amendments tabled by my committee on the subject will be adopted tomorrow.
In its opinion, our committee stressed that adopting the acquis communautaire on equal opportunities for men and women is a sine qua non to accession because this is a basic human rights issue.
Institution building and strengthening institutional and administrative capacities in this area are basic prerequisites to full application of the European acquis.
Equality of the sexes is a fundamental and integral part of economic, social and democratic development, which is why it must act as a guideline in the development and accession process.
In other words, the candidate countries must ensure that the acquis on equal opportunities for men and women is applied fully and effectively before they accede.
As you know, the acquis communautaire on equal opportunities consists of nine directives on equal pay, equal treatment in the workplace, health and safety, work for pregnant women, parental leave, the burden of proof in cases of discrimination and equal treatment under social policy.
We also feel it is very important for the candidate countries to develop or reform their judicial and administrative structures, in order to create the right conditions for applying the acquis communautaire efficiently.
The Committee on Women's Rights has of course taken account of progress already made by the candidate countries and has identified areas in which further improvement is needed.
It is important, in our view, for the enlargement procedure to include the application of efficient measures to prevent and combat trafficking in women, prostitution, sexual abuse of children and child pornography in the candidate countries, given that many of these countries are still the countries of origin, transit and destination for international organised crime networks in the modern slave trade.
In addition, problems persist in certain candidate countries as far as children are concerned, as a direct consequence of weaknesses in social protection systems.
The Commission is called on to step up its efforts to wipe out all forms of violence against women as part of the accession strategy, in order to ensure that women's personal rights and dignity are safeguarded and, of course, to act as an incentive for improving children's rights and child protection.
We still need a broad programme of institutional intervention and economic support in order to incorporate the gender equality dimension in the economic guidelines for the accession process and counterbalance the negative impact on gender equality of privatisation and cuts in public spending.
As you know, the transition to a market economy is exerting huge pressure on all aspects of employment in many of the candidate countries. We are particularly concerned about the adverse impact which this transition has on women, given that they are always the first to suffer from cuts in the budget in the areas of child care, education and the social protection systems which allow them to combine working and family life.
The Commission needs to promote suitable public and private investment in social sectors in the candidate countries, in order to make it easier for more women to enter representative institutions and the centres of power.
There is a serious democratic deficit in this sector in all the candidate countries.
This being so, we call on the Commission to tell us what has been achieved in the candidate countries as regards adopting the social acquis communautaire on equal opportunities.
We should also like to know what progress the candidate countries have made in constructing the relevant framework over this period.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you, Madam President, this 'debate' speaks volumes about the chasm between Europe and its citizens.
While we know that there is little public support for enlargement, there is hardly a critical noise to be heard in this House.
This confirms the impression that this is the umpteenth European project that is being forced through by a European elite instead of holding an honest, open dialogue with genuinely concerned people.
Honourable ladies and gentlemen of the Council and of the Commission, these people are not only rightwing-populist and anti-European types, they are also ordinary citizens with real concerns.
In order to give this honest dialogue a shot in the arm, the Liberal Group is asking why the EU is granting asylum to people from countries with whom we are round the negotiating table?
Either those countries are safe, in which case we should not accept any asylum seekers, or they are not safe, and they need to be taken to task over this in the framework of the political criteria.
The Liberal Group is taking the asylum obligations arising from the Geneva Convention very seriously.
We want a humane and just policy.
How can we achieve this following enlargement?
This is our question.
Madam President, today, we are once again discussing the imminent fulfilment of a very deeply cherished wish.
Many realise this.
Others prefer to speculate about uncertainty, fear and alleged dissatisfaction.
More than ever, it is the politicians' responsibility not to pander to that populism.
It is our task, and that of the media, to offer the people a true picture of reality, whether this is beneficial or not.
Parliament and the Commission largely agree on the policy to be adopted.
I would thank Commissioner Verheugen for his very committed speech.
He has always approached this matter with due thoroughness, with a critical eye and with a great sense of responsibility for the European Union and for the candidate countries.
This is how we as Parliament would have wanted it, and this is how it has been all these years.
The evaluation of progress and of shortcomings in the candidate countries has always been clear and detailed.
In the interest of the enlargement process, we have always said to our friends in the candidate countries that we want to see what their suffering is rooted in. We can use this knowledge in order to aim our policy effectively.
We would like to point out that a great deal is yet to be done in the area of public freedoms.
This is only natural, on account of the rule of law being prioritised with good reason.
A great deal of money has been, and still is being, pumped into improving the capacity of governments to enforce and apply their adapted legislation.
In the recent Commission communication on administrative and judicial capacity, it is noted that a great deal of work still needs to be done.
I would like to ask the Commissioner what the odds are of a timely completion of a necessary improvement and further development of the rule of law in the candidate countries, so that these can function effectively after 18 months to two years.
The Commissioner, particularly the Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, has an important role to play in the field of monitoring and guaranteeing the smooth running of things, also in future.
In this area, a yellow card will probably be issued more frequently in future than we were used to in the past.
In my view, the idea of perpetuating back-door politics by appointing a high official for this policy in the Council is highly astonishing.
I experience this as a slap in the face of the Commission and Parliament.
What kind of example is this supposed to set for the candidate countries?
Apparently, it is one of the Council's fondest wishes to avoid parliamentary control, certainly in the form of the capacity to remove a political official from office.
Finally, the idea of a referendum is frequently being mooted in a few countries.
A referendum would possibly have been appropriate at the outset of the whole process, but then the surveys were so positive that nobody was ever in any doubt about the fact that the European citizen really wanted this enlargement, by way of paying off a debt of honour to Central Europe.
A survey now would be very odd indeed, because that would give the impression that after this enormous amount of work - which, very often, was also very unpopular work - after compliance with all the requirements, it would be possible yet again to be faced with a 'no' from the Member States, based on a referendum which would be very difficult to interpret.
This is why I think that we as politicians must find our way to the people, as we have always done, with the sense of criticism that we have always had.
Madam President, every line of the important opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, drafted so courageously by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Berger, is a matter of concern and frustration to us.
From the lack of the judiciary's independence from the government to the situation of minorities, from the limited access to justice, to crimes and acts of violence going unpunished, from religious persecution to discrimination against homosexuals, from trafficking in human beings to organised crime, police corruption and inefficiency at the borders, from the limited independence of journalists to the weakness of the judicial system, all of these are problems on which progress has been limited and almost imperceptible.
Europe cannot be held responsible for this, because this year alone, we will be spending EUR 1 billion on a fast-track approach to help the legal and administrative apparatus of the candidate countries improve these disastrous situations.
As the Copenhagen doctrine established, in the field of freedom, democracy and human rights there can be no exceptions, transition periods or Ã  la carte Europe.
On these matters, Madam President, countries must either put up or shut up.
Let us hope that they put up and do so in the best possible way.
Madam President, in the space of one minute I shall mention five points in order to remind the House of the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The first point is our concern over the evaluation report which we asked for from the Commission, on the needs of the applicant countries with regard to general-interest services.
Then there is the idea that in the case of the applicant countries we should regard their economic capacity with a certain degree of flexibility, taking into account the need to create in those countries the conditions for continuous and sustainable economic growth.
Then there is our concern, again, about the campaign against money laundering and tax havens, which in our view constitutes a real preliminary condition for accession, as other speakers before me have already pointed out.
In addition there is the need to encourage these countries to have more regional cooperation, and finally there is the idea that the accession of these countries to the Union will make it easier for them to achieve the objectives pursued by the European Union.
Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very pleased that the chapters on the internal market and the related chapters have already been negotiated successfully.
In this respect, we can claim that the internal market already exists.
However, we are still concerned about the shortcomings in the administrative and judicial systems in the future Member States.
I would like to tell you something which I found out at the weekend in Prague, namely that the process of registering a foreign commercial company in the Czech trade register takes about a year - unless you are prepared to pay EUR 2000.
In the internal market, no gap should open up between rights and duties as a result of the failure to enforce environmental, social and consumer standards.
We need fair competition, also in the enlarged internal market.
I should like to thank Mrs Sommer for her report.
It provides a strong impetus towards fruitful cooperation and cohesion at the interface between East and West in the border regions.
Giving priority to SMEs is something we strongly support, and we hope that this will be implemented in forthcoming calls for proposals.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my task was to draft a horizontal report on industry, external trade, research and energy for twelve candidate countries.
That was difficult enough in itself.
Providing a comprehensive overview of the report in just one minute now is impossible.
I therefore draw attention to the short justification provided in my report.
Anyone interested should have a look at it.
I should like to mention one issue which is very close to my heart, and wish to underline rather more pointedly than my colleague Willy GÃ¶rlach that as I come from a region which has been part of the European Union since 1990 and has experienced a great deal of solidarity in the last twelve years, I have a very clear appreciation of the efforts made by the candidate countries, especially the Central and Eastern European countries, to become eligible for accession.
What I would now ask of us all - from the European Union, especially the Council and particularly from two countries which have always been the driving force in this European Union, namely Germany and France - is to remove, as soon as possible, the obstacles which stand in the way of union with these countries and enable us, myself included, to conduct a European election campaign on both sides of the Oder and Neisse in 2004.
. (NL) Thank you, Madam President, I would also refer to my report and would like to specifically emphasise two points.
The first point is the high level of unemployment in a number of the candidate countries.
In Poland, for example, the employment figure is 19% and is not showing any signs of abating.
This requires support for the most heavily affected areas and an effort by private investors, who should, at the same time, invest in training and in-service training.
I would ask the Commission to throw its weight behind this plea too.
A second point is the fear among our own citizens of losing their jobs or of large flows of immigrants from the candidate countries.
This should be removed. There are plenty of arguments.
The candidate countries are enjoying strong economic growth and will be able to accommodate their own citizens.
The average monthly income in the enlargement countries is rising sharply, and exports from our countries to them is rising more steeply than the import from those countries.
Belgium, for example, enjoys an annual increase of 15%.
Moreover, all the figures bear out that immigration to the European Union is restricted.
Commissioner, you have done sterling work at the summit of entrepreneurs, and many statistics have made their way to the press.
This is vital, because we must dispel people's anxiety.
I would urge you to continue in the same vein for all these social issues.
Madam President, when you stand in a derelict asbestos factory in Poland and taste it on your tongue, when you hear a debate in Malta about how they dispose of waste on a small island made of hard rock, and when you stand in a yard in Bulgaria and see where the offenders with mental disorders are expected to exercise for one hour a day, you see some of the challenges that some of our European family have to meet as they seek to join the European Union and adopt our acquis.
Our Committee on the Environment's enlargement reports have highlighted concerns on nuclear safety, stocks of obsolete pesticides, food and feed safety, habitats and wild bird protection and human rights in mental health systems.
We want to see compliance with the acquis, but we understand that the acquis has standards that we are all seeking to implement.
We want candidate countries to have access to advice and support from specialists and funds available to us already as Member States to meet our obligations and we ask the Commission to ensure that we are not asking candidate countries to meet standards that our own Member States are failing to meet themselves.
Madam President, I was just about to impress the Commissioner, Mr Fischler, but unfortunately, he is absent at the moment.
However, if all goes to plan, we can land a very big fish at the end of the year, which makes a change.
In fact, the fisheries sector is ahead of agriculture in the enlargement process, which also makes a change.
The fisheries chapter has already been closed with all candidates, albeit with some restrictions in the case of Poland and Malta.
Nonetheless, here too, some positive developments are emerging now that Poland has withdrawn its demand for special rights of access, for example.
As a result of enlargement, the coastline will increase significantly in length and the number of actors in the fisheries sector will increase.
On a day-to-day basis, we do not anticipate any major problems, but there may be some difficulties which we will have to take on board.
In particular, there is a lack of more effective administrative structures, a standard register, effective controls, genuinely harmonised hygiene and environmental standards, and measures to tackle flags of convenience.
However, we should be able to deal with these.
I am confident, therefore, that we can resolve these problems and set a course towards an enlarged European fishing industry.
Madam President, my opinion dealt largely with the technical progress of the Commission's negotiations with the candidate countries on the relevant chapters, but it also called on both the Council and the Commission to redouble their efforts to raise awareness of public opinion.
I wonder whether in their summing-up replies both Minister de Miguel and Commissioner Verheugen might refer to progress, as far as public opinion is concerned, and any further initiatives they have in mind.
We all pay lip service to this - bearing in mind the referenda - but much greater practical application is required, in particular from the Member States, not simply from the institutions of the European Union itself.
I have three thoughts concerning action in the Member States.
Firstly, further public platforms should be given to leaders from the candidate countries, not only political but also cultural leaders - writers, film-makers, and musicians.
Secondly, the links between the institutions of civil society should be publicised.
Thirdly, something should be done to overcome the collective amnesia which was imposed by the Soviet tyranny on western Europe, allowing us to forget the thousand years of cultural, political and commercial links which we are now in the process of restoring.
- (DA) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for his efforts in the area of equality.
Every single time the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has spoken with the Commissioner, he has not hesitated to state that the 'acquis communitaire', if I may use that term, should also apply in that area.
The Commissioner cannot be reproached for the fact that the 'acquis' was only introduced at the last moment in a long list of countries.
It means, however, that I should like to call upon the Commissioner and his colleagues to continue to monitor this area so that we do not only consistently obtain the necessary facts but also ensure that the countries supply these.
To the President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to say that, in my opinion, the Member States have a special obligation towards women, for it is one thing for us to get the governments to accept membership and something else to get the people to do so.
Women form more than half of the population, and what women in the candidate countries have so far had cause to note is high unemployment affecting women in particular.
It is very important that attention be given specifically to the area of women's rights when we come to the next phase: that of convincing people that enlargement is in actual fact a good idea. I believe that the Member States have a contribution to make to this area and that they and the Commission together have a special contribution to make.
Madam President, the Committee on Petitions considers this report to be extremely important.
Enlargement is the most exciting, difficult political challenge of this century and cannot just be addressed from an accounting perspective.
We need more political ambition and a less parochial, more global vision of politics.
The quality of the European Union's politics must be enhanced too, and the Union must become more than just a large market.
Only political stature can make us credible interlocutors in the western world as difficult processes of cultural, economic and, above all, judicial integration are developed.
Small-minded, petty egotism will be of no help to us; conservatism is in danger of making us introspective and isolated, with serious medium- and long-term consequences.
The enlargement process is now underway.
The slow, gradual adjustments that are being made in the candidate countries, as we have heard, must not just be encouraged but supported and not just at the top but with appropriate budgetary policies in a climate of solidarity and rigour and with a view to safeguarding development and peace, if we are to avoid the danger of Eurosceptic reactions.
Madam President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has examined the financial framework 2004-2006 for accession negotiations proposed by the Commission and considers that, generally speaking, the Commission proposal is a balanced and realistic proposal.
The needs of the candidate countries have been taken into account, especially as their take-up capacity will be limited during the first years following accession.
Similarly, no call is being made on the present Member States to increase their contributions.
Certain Member States maintain that this proposal is overly generous in the initial stages of negotiation and have countered by proposing that the amounts for which provision was made in Berlin for 2002 should be used for 2004.
This criticism is unfounded because, first, a more restrictive proposal would be rejected outright by the candidate countries.
The danger here is that negotiations will be derailed and we shall fail to find any common ground by the end of the year. Secondly, it is estimated that the take-up capacity of the new Member States will be such in 2004 that we shall be able to give them far more resources than those for which provision was made in Berlin for 2002.
The present negotiations on enlargement should not be confused with other negotiations or endeavours to amend Union policies.
Madam President, we would stress that the principle of solidarity and economic and social cohesion must be the basis of the Community institutions' political action if it is to achieve the goal of a European continent based on shared values, and we would also like to mention the great importance our group attaches to the impending enlargement, to the pillar of economic and social cohesion and to the ever-increasing endeavours in the field of cohesion.
We therefore feel that the proposal, already called for by Parliament, to phase in the Structural Funds and to introduce the Cohesion Fund in the new countries at a level of at least a third of the total allocation for structural measures is highly appropriate, for it will be a considerable contribution towards improving the absorption capacity of these countries which are, still today, effectively without genuine administrative capacities.
We have already, on other occasions, requested increasingly careful monitoring of the committed resources on the part of the Commission, and this is becoming still more urgent and pressing if we consider that prolonging access to the Cohesion Fund in this way to improve implementation of structural measures in the candidate countries must be seen as a completely new strategy and that it therefore cannot be understood to be a permanent facility. We therefore support Mr BÃ¶ge's proposal to monitor the trend of improvements in Structural Funds implementation carefully, proceeding, where implementation is improving, to reduce the Cohesion Fund quota gradually.
We hope that the problems encountered in the implementation of the ISPA, Sapard and Phare instruments, for example, despite the fact that the Funds were trebled as of 2000, can be overcome or, at any rate, diminished as the institutions are strengthened too.
I will conclude by saying that, while, on the whole, we welcome the Commission's action, we share Mr BÃ¶ge's concerns and confusion regarding the financial perspective, which does not necessarily have to cover the 2007-2013 period if we take up the option of prolonging by a short period the current interinstitutional agreement and financial perspective.
Madam President, the border regions adjoining the future Member States of the European Union need our undivided attention now and even more after enlargement.
Everywhere, especially in my country, the border regions are marked by extremely high unemployment and dying villages and towns.
Young people are leaving because they see no future there.
The only way we can halt this negative trend is to support those regions, modernise the infrastructure, create transport links and make small and medium sized enterprises fit to meet the challenge. Because it is they who create the most jobs.
If the EU and the Member States themselves encourage and support the border regions, which are suffering massive problems, and that help must include preventing low-wage dumping and unfair competition, then a sense of cross-border neighbourliness will grow and that will be to everyone's advantage.
The historic task of enlargement must succeed.
We have no alternative.
Madam President, on the subject of fisheries, this report does not carry out a detailed analysis of the overall advantages of the structural funds and of the amounts allocated for each programme, for example the management of fishing fleets, decommissioning, fish farming etc.
The Green Paper asks whether the FIFG has contributed to the sustainability of fish stocks or whether it has introduced a distortion into the industry.
Have all the resources allocated to the restructuring of the fleet contributed to the creation of a fleet which has selective fishing methods, high-quality products and a maximum employment rate, or have they simply had the effect of speeding up the process of industrialisation, squeezing out the small vessels and turning them into large vessels, with all the social and economic consequences that that implies?
The Commission will have to try to answer this question during the current debate on the common fisheries policy.
Madam President, as many colleagues have pointed out, the pace of enlargement varies from country to country and month by month.
It is no secret that the modernisation of the agricultural industries of the candidate countries is proving to be one of the most difficult issues.
Clearly support under the Sapard scheme is of vital importance in assisting that process.
However, the take-up of this and other schemes is patchy.
Expectations in those countries are universally high.
There is a continuing problem that these expectations may not be met, producing the inevitable political and social fall-out.
In the past months I have visited Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary and once you get away from the main roads and railway lines it is easy to see how much has to be done.
I share Baroness Nicholson's fear that the often superhuman efforts by the governments will not be met by flexibility from our side.
May I urge that such EU operations are carried out with flexibility and tact and encourage the process rather than inhibit it.
Madam President, from the Committee on Industry, External Trade and Energy's point of view it is of course important, now that Sapard is entering its operational phase and money is actually flowing, that that money should be used for developing the rural environment and less for agricultural production capacities.
I would like to mention just two key figures: one is the 15% of agricultural production in the candidate countries, and the other is the 50% of cultivated agricultural area that can be further capitalised.
So it would be wrong to continue trying to improve production structures.
It would be better to create alternative sources of employment in rural areas, either crafts or small-scale industries.
All in all, it is important that any possible expansion of production should not add to the already high levels of overproduction in our agriculture but that we should in that event find the right ways of developing craft trade and small-scale industry structures in the candidate countries' agriculture and rural areas.
Madam President, we in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and in the Group of the European People's Party believe that enlargement is a worthy objective in itself.
It must not therefore be used by the Council as a bargaining chip to obtain strategic positions which have nothing to do with the actual political process of enlarging Europe.
It must not be a bargaining chip to obtain certain modifications of the agricultural policy or to resolve other problems, and I therefore congratulate the Spanish Presidency on having done such good work and I directly condemn those governments, with Socialist majorities, which are exploiting the enlargement procedure, which this Parliament and European society are very attached to, to obtain agreements on other issues which they have few reasons for, by trying to strengthen their case by making their position conditional.
With regard to the Turco report, which examines how the Structural, Cohesion and ISPA Funds were spent in 2000, I must repeat once again that the internal cohesion policy, the regional policy, of the European Union must not be changed as a result of the fact that poorer countries are entering.
The internal cohesion between the richest and poorest regions and countries must be maintained, regardless of the fact that ten countries about to enter are clearly poorer.
I believe that more of the Community budget should be spent and it should be better spent, in that order, and we must continue to try to ensure that executing the Community budget is not an obstacle course.
We must simplify the procedures and trust in the executors.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the verge of a really historic round of accessions.
The European House can and will be extended eastwards.
At the same time, a further southwards expansion will enrich the European Union with two beautiful and culturally valuable island states, Malta and Cyprus.
It will not surprise you, however, if I now discuss one of these two states, namely Cyprus.
Cyprus is the candidate country that has made the most progress in adapting to the acquis communautaire.
That has already been pointed out.
We can therefore safely assume that Cyprus will be included in the first round of accessions and that the next European elections will also take place in Cyprus.
The question is: will all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike, be able to take part in those elections?
In other words, will the division of the island, which is contrary to international law, be overcome prior to accession?
We want it to be.
We hope it will be.
It really is time that Europe's last divided capital at last became a living capital again and that Cypriots of both ethnic groups could live together in Cyprus in peace.
I very much hope, as the President-in-Office of the Council has also made clear, that a political solution will be found by October at the latest.
The fact that direct negotiations are now taking place for the first time in many years shows that the accession process is having the catalytic effect we hoped for.
I also hope that Turkey, which is also a candidate country, understands that a solution for Cyprus is very much in Turkey's interest and that Denktash cannot insist on a two state model.
It is in Europe's as well as Cyprus' interest that the solution should result in a state that is capable of acting and taking decisions at international and European level.
Cyprus must speak with one voice.
If such a solution is not achieved by October, then we must try to ensure that Cyprus' accession or membership acts as a catalyst for a solution, because the overwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots want to belong to the European Union and they also want to be able to live in a free Cyprus after accession.
Madam President, now that enlargement is approaching, a lot of people are getting cold feet, and concern is growing in both the present EU and in the candidate countries.
What we have all dreamed about and fought for over so many years - a unified Europe - is on the verge of being achieved, and there is nothing odd about the fact that the questions are accumulating.
In the candidate countries where referendums are to be held, a lot of people are probably wondering what they are getting themselves into.
Many questions are being raised within the EU about costs and about how the EU is going to be able to function.
Extremist parties are exploiting enlargement in their policies and playing upon people's fear of the unknown.
Political leadership is therefore required more than ever.
The leaders of the candidate countries must resolutely continue with the required reforms before the negotiations can be concluded.
They have done an impressive job, and a number of questions still remain.
It is a question of never giving up and of being honest.
A number of domestic problems will still remain following membership, for there is a life after the accession date too.
Those of us within the EU also have a big responsibility: to tell people about the huge importance of enlargement and about what is at stake.
Who believed that enlargement would be cost-free?
Clearly, enlargement has its price, but in the long term we are all winners.
We must also prepare a reserve plan to cover the contingency of there being a 'no' vote in Ireland.
I believe the European Parliament has accepted its responsibility.
We have stubbornly pushed ahead with the enlargement process, set a definite date for this and carefully reviewed progress.
In the report we are now adopting, it is crystal-clear that we support enlargement, at the same time as highlighting a number of problems.
We too have a responsibility to convince people of this historic task.
It is an historic opportunity to unite the whole continent.
Together, we can solve common problems relating to environmental damage, crime, growth, security and the safeguarding of democracy and human values.
A short time remains, and I am convinced that the Copenhagen Summit in December will be an historic occasion and lead to the EU's biggest and most important enlargement so far.
Enlargement is irrevocable and absolutely necessary.
The alternative is chaos, uncertainty and a fatal division of Europe.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we as the European Free Alliance are in favour of enlargement.
This is not so much because we would like to have a bigger market, but because the European Union appears to be capable of guaranteeing peace and stability, albeit within its own borders, but not outside of those, unfortunately.
It could serve as a model for conflict prevention, in other words, and we would like to see this model enlarged.
Mr Brok and the co-rapporteurs, whom we would like to congratulate, have demonstrated in this report the enormous progress that has been made, but unfortunately, many candidate countries are still facing shortcomings in terms of administrative capacity and independent jurisdiction, but also in terms of independent police and independent media.
Mafia and corruption still remain a curse.
Many countries have regional differences in fighting these, for which no instruments are actually available.
We would draw your attention particularly to human rights and minorities.
One of these minorities who live in abject misery are, of course, the Roma in various candidate countries.
They often live in appalling conditions with poor housing, a high level of unemployment and low educational standards.
Although plans are in preparation in most countries, the effective involvement of this minority often remains a problem.
The positive regard for the Roma culture could be a key to the emancipation and integration of that community.
Accountability of the Roma and their participation in the implementation of the projects which are set up by the European Union itself should be the norm.
Furthermore, the Roma are, of course, a European nation without a state, and they are, as such, our joint responsibility.
But other minorities too often experience a lack of appreciation and recognition of their identities.
Their fate is often heavily marked by history. There are scars and wounds that have not healed.
One of the consequences is the criticism of some of the effects which the Bene? decrees have had, to which also Commissioner Verheugen referred.
Accession to the Union can offer minorities hope for the future in which borders become less important and peoples can join forces across the borders.
Finally, a whole host of small countries will be joining after the accession, and this will place the need for a new view of peoples without a state and regional participation in a new light.
Madam President, it was decided in Nice that accession negotiations must be completed by the end of the year so that, if required, the necessary codetermination rights can be exercised in the national parliaments in the course of 2003.
In the complex documentation accompanying accession negotiations, the chapters on agriculture, finance and regional policy in particular have attracted a lot of public interest.
People - by which I mean explicitly the citizens of the EU - are paying more attention to these things than ever before.
At this point I would like to ask the Commission to give the Info-Points Europe, where they exist, more money so they can perform their current tasks.
The present proposal to phase in direct aids to farmers by 2013 cannot be the last word.
This model is not convincing because it lacks sufficient justification.
The European reference yield, only 2.96 in Poland's case for example, used as the basis for payment of direct aid is more than just an ugly detail.
That is not the way to encourage viability and sustainability of agriculture in the candidate countries.
My group believes that European agricultural policy cannot operate two policies in the long term.
My group also wants to see the candidate countries' integration into the common agricultural policy organised in tune with those countries' specific macroeconomic trends with special attention paid to social needs.
EU enlargement can be achieved only by the EU, the Member States and their regions working together.
Development of the border regions is particularly important here.
All involved must intensify their efforts, but they need the close attention of the European Union and the nation states.
The current programme of economic development for the border regions, amounting to EUR 245 million, is not enough.
Its availability is tied to other flows into and out of the regions, placing an even greater burden on already weak local authorities.
But the EU budget is not under such pressure.
If the Council Presidency under Spanish Chairmanship is unable to agree a final figure for direct agricultural aids - because of impending elections as, alas, in Germany - then the last few months will be spent trying to catch up, and in my opinion there will only be losers.
Madam President, I shall deal with two main points in this question of enlargement.
Firstly, I should like put on the record of this House that the Treaty of Nice needs to be adopted by all existing Member States of the European Union to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union by ten countries, which we hope to see in the not too distant future.
I would hate anyone to misunderstand or misinterpret the decision of the Irish electorate not to approve the Treaty of Nice, because the Irish population in general, even those who oppose the adoption of the Treaty of Nice, is in favour of enlargement.
This House, as an institution, and the Irish people, need to guarantee that we can deliver on ratification of the Treaty of Nice in the short term.
The Irish Government will therefore be proposing a declaration in Seville on traditional Irish military neutrality, which I hope will be approved by other Member States.
My last point is that, in our negotiations with the accession countries, we should not stand in the way of their progress towards the adoption of the acquis communautaire.
We should not set up unfair barriers to their accession.
When these countries join the European Union they will bring a new impetus, a new ideology, and a new belief in the vision the founding fathers of the European Union had of a Europe of peace, prosperity, progress and respect for Europe's diversity.
Enlargement is a great challenge that can only be met if all the players are ready.
I regret to say that this is far from being the case at the moment, particularly in the agriculture sector.
We want to integrate countries in which agriculture and exports are very important into the European Union, even though they have not to date adopted the Community acquis.
The Sapard programme has effectively failed and its future prospects are slim as certain countries will be unable to fulfil their cofinancing responsibilities.
At the moment, the farmers are worried. Some of them, from both Member States and candidate countries, came to tell us this yesterday, and we must listen to them.
The candidate countries are afraid that the process of modernising agriculture might destabilise the rural economy.
They are opposed to the Commission proposals with regard to both direct payments and setting quotas.
Farmers in the Member States cannot agree to seeing their products rivalled by products that do not comply with the same health or environmental requirements.
In asking for transition periods, the candidate countries have acknowledged their difficulties, yet what will happen if the objectives of protecting biodiversity and fauna are added to the agricultural constraints prior to accession?
In this context, it is difficult to assess the success of enlargement.
Exceeding the financial perspectives will not solve this.
I ask you, what purpose would be served by favouring a timetable?
Therefore, let us be sensible and take the time to create the conditions necessary for successful accession.
By acting hastily, as is being proposed, we could ruin agriculture in both the Member States and the candidate countries.
Lastly, in Mr Olsson's report, I cannot support item 24, as I reject the idea of turning our farmers into gardeners and riding instructors, as it stipulates.
Our smaller farms participate fully in and are essential to production diversity, supply and rural development.
I think it is important, however, to emphasise item 20, which reminds the Commission of the need to develop other activities in rural areas.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is beyond question: there is no doubt as to the historic necessity of enlargement.
It is coming, that is a fact, and it is good that it is.
But it will not be a tragedy if we fail to stick precisely to 2004 as the accession date.
It is the quality of the process that is crucial, not the tempo.
The project's success must be assured.
The report has many merits.
But I wish it had shown more political courage and been open about the problems we face.
I will mention two examples.
Firstly, there are no definite plans in place for financing enlargement beyond 2006.
I think the practical constraints method is a dubious strategy.
The public needs to know what to expect.
They have a right to know.
This is not an intellectually specious argument, Commissioner.
Secondly, at the heart of it, the dispute about the Bene? decrees is about the 1946 amnesty law.
We cannot allow history to be misused as an obstacle to enlargement.
But the amnesty law legitimises expulsion as an instrument of conflict resolution and expressly exempts crimes from punishment.
That is contrary to the ethical foundations of the EU, the principles of the European community of values and the Copenhagen criteria.
The Balkan conflict was about precisely the same thing: ethical and ethnic cleansing.
Anyone who plays down this conflict of values does Europe a disservice.
Right and wrong are indivisible and non-negotiable, whether in the past, in the present or in the future.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion there is still a great need for information about eastward enlargement in the EU Member States.
At least, that is what I find when meeting citizens at events in my constituency.
Today I would like to speak in particular about the challenge of agriculture and eastward enlargement.
I would like to congratulate Mr Olsson on his very good report on EU enlargement and agriculture.
How can the new Member States be successfully integrated into the common agricultural policy?
That is a key question for most of the candidate countries and it is crucial because in the countries of central and eastern Europe agriculture accounts for a larger proportion of national income than the EU average.
The same is true of employment in the economy as a whole.
The accession of ten countries in 2004 will increase the agricultural area by 29% and the number of agricultural holdings by 74%.
But the number of consumers will increase by 24%.
How can we best shape accession and integration in the long term?
In my opinion, the countries of central and eastern Europe will and must press ahead with changing the structure of their agriculture.
The European agricultural model where farmers have the twin tasks of producing in some places and caring for the countryside in others must be applied in those countries too.
In my view, the high standards of hygiene in production and processing must apply from the first day of accession, otherwise European consumer policy will become a farce.
Environmental concerns and alternative jobs in rural areas must be funded from the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.
We agree that the Commission is taking the right approach there in aligning financial compensation payments gradually.
If we allowed too much money in at the start, agricultural structures there would be ossified, and that cannot be the right way for those concerned either.
While I believe our citizens do not know enough about eastern Europe, I also noted during the hearing that farmers in the candidate countries, too, still have a lot of public relations work to do at home.
Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, you have by far exceeded the time allocated to you.
I hope that your fellow Members will not do the same.
Madam President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to Commissioner Verheugen, because it is down to his industry and determination that we are so close to grasping the prize of the reunification of Europe.
Credit should be given to his efforts.
I should also like to echo his opening words in relation to Lithuania.
The decision taken by the Lithuanian Government in relation to the closure of the Ignalina power station is an extremely brave one, as it is not in accordance with general public opinion in Lithuania, and illustrates just how determined the Lithuanians are to fulfil the EU entry requirements.
They have moved at tremendous speed in order to catch up, and it has been very difficult for them.
However, if accession were suddenly to disappear off the horizon, that decision by the Lithuanian Government and Parliament could well rebound on them and we could find accession moving further away and not closer.
It is vital to keep to the timetable and the road map.
We must not allow that timetable to be eroded.
If we slow down, some of the accession countries - for example, Hungary - will turn elsewhere, perhaps towards the United States rather than the European Union.
Political movements that we see within the European Union could well mean that we will be unable to proceed if we miss the Copenhagen Summit deadline.
As Commissioner Verheugen quite rightly said: we must take advantage of this window of opportunity before it is closed.
Or, as the late, great Elvis Presley said: "It's now or never, ....
Tomorrow will be too late".
History will not judge us extremely well if we fail to show the leadership and courage required at this moment.
That is not to suggest that we should somehow weaken our position in relation to our demands on the countries.
Each country must be judged on its own merit and keep to the criteria, in particular in relation to implementation and administrative capacity.
Let us look at individual countries.
The Czech Republic needs to reassure us that competition policy will be in line with EU competition policy and that public administration will be reformed.
Latvia has to make serious advances in the reform of its judicial system and in dealing with corruption.
I welcome Commissioner Verheugen's plans in relation to Bulgaria and Romania, but we must also send out a message to Romania that it has to get its act together, otherwise it will seriously fall behind schedule.
The Brok report should be a warning to them in relation to corruption and reform of public administration.
Let us not forget that we have to convince the people that enlargement is in their interests.
We should stop talking about the problems of enlargement and remind people that enlargement is a solution to many of those problems.
Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent reports.
Enlargement is a huge political and historical event but it is also the biggest objective regarding development cooperation the Member States have ever committed themselves to.
For that reason its success requires mutual cooperation and trust.
The Commission's proposals on financing enlargement are realistic and even rather shrewd.
The new Member States need support; the principle whereby they immediately become net beneficiaries is the correct one, as it takes into consideration their solvency rating.
Likewise, there is no intention to reduce the income of farmers in the new Member States but put it on a growth track.
It is just as clear, however, that the financial burden of the present Member States cannot be suddenly increased.
For that reason, phased-in implementation is the right way to proceed.
I wish to draw attention to one matter.
The new Member States are attractive agricultural countries in terms of their natural conditions. The price of land is low in these countries.
Rates of pay are 10 - 20% of the EU average, and the EU is furthermore intending to support up to 80% of investments in association with the Member State in question.
For that reason my question relates to family farming.
Does the EU intend to support industrial agriculture in the same way as family farming or is the intention to implement aid and modulations in one form or another that decrease with size?
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, it is time to dust down the old classic.
A spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of fear, the fear of enlargement which is trapping an increasing number of politicians in its power.
Fear that enlargement will be too fast after all, or that it will be too costly after all, or both.
Politicians across the political divide are starting to become anxious.
Old and new arguments are being tabled, often under the guise that we now finally want to listen to the voice of the people, thus reinforcing the impression that many politicians do not know exactly what they have been doing up to now and are now starting to tense up right before the final exam.
They tense up because they are starting to realise that they have done too little to convince their electorate that enlargement is very much a positive step, both for the inhabitants of the Member States and those of the candidate countries.
In this chorus of sceptics, a number of voices are becoming ever louder.
One objection, for example, is that agricultural reform should be complete before we can enlarge.
Let there be no mistake about this: reform is desperately needed.
The common agricultural policy must be reformed.
The European Parliament should continue to demand this, without any concessions.
However, without enlargement, the reform of agricultural policy will not take place.
To prescribe this reform now as a condition for approval of enlargement is tantamount to creating not a win-win situation, but a lose-lose situation.
Who would benefit from this, except for those opposed to reforms and to enlargement?
Another argument which is heard increasingly frequently is that the EU itself should undergo internal reform first.
This too is desperately needed, but please let us not resort to blackmail.
It is unacceptable for the candidate countries to be taken hostage because we have not completed all our tasks.
Here too, delay of enlargement means delay of necessary reforms.
After all, these have never come about without extreme pressure yet.
I would like to quote another argument that is increasingly common these days, namely that human rights are being violated in the candidate countries.
That too is true, let there be no misunderstanding about this.
In those countries, the rights of the Roma and those of homosexuals, for example, leave a great deal to be desired.
It is extremely important for this to be denounced.
My group has been doing this for years; this is something altogether different from brushing problems under the carpet.
But here too, it is true, and I am convinced of this, that these problems that are very much there can best be solved if those countries become EU Members and if they are not kept in isolation.
We are not bureaucrats, we are politicians.
This is not about ticking a list and automatically giving a fail if five minuses appear on that list.
We are in favour of weighing up the situation.
What has happened, what needs to happen and what is the most demanding part?
Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, we should all ensure that the completion of enlargement in the next few months does not lead to one large European coitus interruptus, because that would be wholly unsatisfactory.
Madam President, three points.
First, enlargement is in fact an historical venture, but for a new Europe, not so that certain factions can rewrite post-war history.
Any attempts to do so must be rejected; they are odious, irrespective of whether they emanate from the candidate countries or from members of the Union.
I detected a great deal of anxiety in Mr Verheugen's speech; I only hope it will prove to be unfounded.
My second point is that we are negotiating with twelve countries.
Does that mean Bulgaria and Romania have no further prospects of accession?
Will their accession depend at some point on the veto of one of the present candidates?
You said, Commissioner, that we have to give them some sort of clear signal, but what exactly?
This lack of clarity pains me, as does the fact that nothing has been said about the accession prospects of the rest of the Balkans in the more distant future.
My final point concerns Cyprus. The Commissioner has asked for Turkey to exert its influence so that some sort of solution can be found.
Who is it supposed to exert this influence on?
What a pity Mr de Miguel did not meet the commander of the Turkish forces when he visited the occupied part of Cyprus.
He might have been able to tell us more.
Mr President, I compliment Mr Olsson on his work and may I commence by again putting on the record my support, and that of my Irish colleagues, for EU enlargement.
For the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, the academic debate should be well and truly over.
We must now proceed in a planned way with their integration.
I compliment the candidate countries on their efforts to conform to the stringent requirements for entry.
For some of them it has been, and continues to be, difficult.
From an agricultural perspective, Mr Olsson has addressed the challenge of enlargement in a reasoned and practical way.
For me, integration depends on our success in fusing the agricultural economies of candidate countries with existing Member States in a manner that causes least disruption to both and in time provides for their full participation in the common agricultural policy.
Anything short of that would undermine the principles of CAP that, by and large, have served European farmers and consumers well.
As we face a mid-term review of the Berlin agreement and the inevitable long term CAP reform, we must not allow the review to deviate from what was agreed in Berlin or to contemplate a move towards re-nationalisation of CAP in future reform.
Farming in Europe as evidenced by yesterday's 15,000 farmer demonstration continues to be difficult.
With the benefit of hindsight we have not in the context of world trade provided the degree of protection necessary for our farmers from the obvious unfair competition and market manipulation by our competitors.
With the completion of enlargement, Europe has the potential to be a dominant player in world trade.
We will only succeed, however, if we are committed in the short term to supporting the European model based on family farming.
I alert the House, not for the first time, to the serious threat to the survival of that model because of long-term uncertainty and the availability of alternative, attractive and more financially rewarding employment for young people who would in normal circumstances take up farming as a career.
Madam President, it is a measure of the ideological poverty of the European Union that anyone can, with a straight face, still talk about success and the CAP in the same sentence.
As the common fisheries policy is widely acknowledged as having been disastrous, so too is the CAP.
The central fault of the CAP is that it is a common policy, and it is not possible to have one policy covering sub-Arctic Finland, the temperate grasslands of Cheshire, the wine growers of Bordeaux, the arid near-subtropical vegetable growers of Catalonia, or the sheep producers of the mountains of Greece, much less the highly populous Denmark which produces more pigs than people.
But the other major fault of the CAP is that it is an agricultural policy.
As demonstrated during the foot-and-mouth crisis in our country, agriculture is an integral part of the rural economy.
There is massive interdependence between farming and its rural infrastructure.
Support one part without taking into account the needs of the other and you can create damaging distortions, which is exactly what has happened.
Enlargement would have been an opportunity to have started with a clean sheet, but it was missed with Agenda 2000's so-called reforms; and it will be missed again.
Now the disaster is to be imposed on the enlargement countries.
This you will have cause to regret.
Madam President, incoming members need to realise that their membership of the EU will not remove the great difficulties they already have in their agriculture industries.
Farmers already in the EU are facing terrifying difficulties.
In Northern Ireland we are going through a grave crisis.
As a result of five increases, export refunds on skimmed milk have risen from EUR 0 to 650 per tonne.
55 percent of all our milk is processed as skimmed milk.
Milk prices have plummeted to 14.5 pence per litre, a loss of 4 pence per litre for all milk producers.
Only a breakthrough into the export market can save us.
Agriculture is facing catastrophe in Europe, both inside and outside this Union, and it should be at the top of the agenda in this discussion.
Madam President, I am delivering an opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the BÃ¶ge report, and this gives me a further opportunity to speak about the transfer of direct payments.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the Commission proposal that there should now be some phasing-in of direct payments, but it also believes that this must not be allowed to stand in the way of a restructuring of aids in the upcoming reform.
We do not believe it will, however, because the 35% given leave room for manoeuvre.
The report speaks of reaching 100% by 2013, but it does not say what reaching 100% in 2013 means.
If the last reform had had the 45% modulation in the upper range that was once mooted, we would now have a difference of 35% to 55%.
That would not be so great.
We are therefore looking to the Commission to make proposals towards reform in the near future, which, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, will make enlargement both possible and stable.
We also believe the proposal to make direct payments to semi-subsistence farmers is a sensible one, but we suggest this be raised from EUR 750 to EUR 1 500. That would entitle 5-6 ha holdings to the full compensation payment.
In Poland that would be approximately 50% of holdings.
So it includes the phasing-in, the social component.
We can see there is room for manoeuvre here.
Something we particularly welcome and call for is greater investment in the second pillar when money is reallocated.
That is money that is needed first and foremost in the candidate countries.
It is palpably obvious that rural areas there need development.
Commissioner Fischler, I am referring here once again - as I think Mr GÃ¶rlach has already done - to the 'bottom-up' approach and to our Sapard programme in Leader form, where the Commission has so far stubbornly refused to underpin this with legislation.
We say it is urgently necessary that civil forces in the candidate countries should also be involved in the work of these projects so that people will feel happier about the European Union and we can lean back rather more contentedly and calmly when they come to vote on it.
So I urge you once again, Commissioner Fischler, to get your bureaucracy moving.
There are precedents. You only need to follow them.
And we are always ready to help you.
Madam President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their overall presentation of progress in negotiations with the candidate countries.
However, we must also congratulate the candidate countries on the results of their efforts, from Cyprus for being at the top of the league, to Turkey on the constitutional reforms which it has started and which we must encourage it to continue if the Cyprus question is to be resolved and peace restored to the area.
Ladies and gentlemen, the announcements and positions we have heard reflect the commitment of all of us to the historic venture which the enlargement of the European Union represents. But we also have a vision of this venture as a humane, democratic and just venture for all the nations and citizens involved.
This being so, we think it is very important, nay vital that we examine the issue of gender equality in the candidate countries.
We need to promise to make this issue an accession criterion, not put it on the back burner until after accession. Similarly, we need to promise to assist with the policies and funds needed to encourage and facilitate reform in the candidate countries in this sector.
In its opinion, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities identifies the problems which women face today and the policies which need to be applied in order to wipe out discrimination in all sectors, so that more women are involved in shaping and making decisions on social, political and economic life.
We should also point out that, where reforms are being introduced, suitable institutional and administrative mechanisms and the funds are lacking or the laws passed are not applied.
We need to voice these concerns and our commitment to promoting gender equality as an accession criterion in tomorrow's vote.
This new European world which is being born also belongs to women and we must give them every opportunity to make a contribution to it and enjoy their fair share of the benefits of this joint endeavour.
Madam President, enlargement is work on behalf of peace, stability and civil rights.
If the applicant countries were not to be included, Central and Eastern Europe could see unrest, dictatorships and large-scale uncontrolled migration start to emerge.
Let us not forget how, for what appear to be insignificant reasons, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination can flare up in democratic elections in democratic countries, such as Austria, Holland and France.
If we cannot effect controlled enlargement, with the approval of the people, there is a danger that we will see the Union rocked by extremist political eruptions.
These may well be something even bigger than the current policy on immigration or questions of security.
I would remind everyone that we are admitting around 100 million people to the Union at one time. That is almost 30% of our present population.
They will represent approximately 5% of the figure for GNP. Significantly poorer people will therefore be amongst us and also competing for jobs.
To prevent the populist extreme right from rising any further it is vital for the new Member States to be admitted as members in a controlled way that benefits everyone.
Some very well educated people from the new countries will also be joining us.
We shall be greatly enriched culturally.
That will be important in a time of content production and an information-based economy.
We shall also have to deal with a negative tradition: there is no great respect for the law everywhere as, during the time of the Soviet Union, it was interpreted arbitrarily.
By the end of the year the candidate countries should have produced a report on the corruption and crime that exist there.
The implementation of EU legislation must likewise be properly verified.
Finally, as a solution to the heated argument over Kaliningrad, I would propose that the Russians should go there by train.
We have seen that before.
The buses could also be watched.
I would have asked Commissioner Verheugen about this but he has just gone to the swimming pool. Perhaps his advisor will take this question.
Would that be all right?
Many Russians are in favour of this idea.
Madam President, I want to highlight Paragraph 26 of Mr Olsson's report on agriculture and enlargement.
It is a question of taking the initiative and holding talks with the candidate countries about what a reform of the EU's agricultural policy is to look like.
Having myself worked on the food safety package for nearly three years now, I have reflected upon the incredible degree to which the reform will affect each and every one of the candidate countries.
It is important that they should be involved now and that they should be able to contribute to shaping the European Union and the policy they will in actual fact have to live with.
I am sure they all realise that the form of the policy that is to replace Agenda 2000 is more important to them than which cash subsidies they receive in the course of the year or two prior to the changeover.
Madam President, what is happening with the agriculture dossier in the negotiations for accession is a clear example of the insistence on pursuing a process of enlargement on the basis of a Community financial framework that does not guarantee the principle of economic and social cohesion, given that the financial framework of Agenda 2000 was only designed for six candidates - whereas there are now ten - with a per capita income of around 40% of the European Union average.
This situation affects farming, in particular, because of the well-known weaknesses of a sector which is important for employment and the economy of various candidate countries.
The situation has a considerable socio-economic impact on the candidate countries, entails additional costs and also requires a revision of the financial perspectives in order to ensure that it is not the most badly affected or least developed countries that foot the bill.
This is why dividing Member States into first and second class when it comes to aid is unacceptable, as are quotas that fall well short of their capacities and needs.
The consequences of this situation would be an increase in unemployment and poverty - something we cannot accept.
Rural development and the protection of a high-quality farm production system require a revision of the CAP and not the renationalisation of its costs, which would harm not only the farmers of those countries but also the farmers of countries such as Portugal, whose system of farming is more vulnerable.
Madam President, I fully agree with the rapporteur that the package of measures from the Commission is a first step towards tackling the specific problems of the border regions, because we are taking a step back into the past, when the current borders of Member States were in many cases inside the old Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires.
Though the Regio projects cited by the rapporteur as good examples to be followed might be of some help, it is clear that a broader approach is needed to the specific problems of some of the border regions.
We have to be aware that, as was previously emphasised by Mrs Maes, 'border regions' is often a euphemism for national minorities.
Madam President, the financial and budgetary consequences of enlargement must be debated in the light of the fact that we are facing a moral imperative and an inalienable political priority, because this project of living together goes beyond the fields of business and finance.
The difficulties do not come from the Spanish Presidency or from the Commission or from this Parliament.
The Spanish Presidency has kept to the road map and is making every effort to unblock the unsettled matter of agriculture and to leave the timetable clear, in order to comply with the timescale proposed in Gothenburg.
As has been pointed out, the countries that put obstacles in the way of a consensus to adopt a common position will have to explain why enlargement should take place not according to the established timetable but at a speed dictated by their interests.
At these times, we must clear away doubts and help change a negative attitude, which is strongest in those countries which, right now, are blocking agreement in the chapter on agriculture and calling into question direct aids for agriculture, either through attempting to clear the financial horizon beyond 2006 or by questioning their inclusion in the Community acquis.
The proposal which Parliament supports, following the Commission's line, and which is contained in the BÃ¶ge report, is balanced, complies with the acquis and is compatible with the budget ceilings set in Berlin.
It includes highly positive aspects, such as support for the phasing-in model for including the new Member States in direct aid payments, remembering that they form part of the acquis, and the phasing-in of the structural operations, but this must be compatible with an effective absorption capacity of the new Member States.
A few years ago, Madam President, the Eastern European countries were totalitarian dictatorships with planned economies.
The changes that have taken place are so profound that we cannot allow ourselves to paralyse this march towards freedom just because some wish to ensure a reduction in their contribution to the Community coffers after 2006.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, enlargement of the European Union is for me one of the greatest challenges of the next few years.
I agree with the Commissioner that we should not get cold feet now, simply because we now have the difficult chapters to negotiate and each of the members and candidates are of course defending their own interests with vehemence and conviction.
We should not lose sight of 2004, because the new Commission starts work in 2005 and the new commissioners from the new Member States would already have to be represented here by then.
Whether there will be a 'big bang' - as we say - with the ten familiar countries, we do not know, but we should not cherish the hope, either, that we will be able to conduct several mini-rounds in the next few years.
A bold step must be taken in 2004.
At any rate, that remains our objective.
Of course it would be easier for us if we had already implemented many reforms.
But I do not see that as a major problem, because the fact that we are faced with the great task of enlargement may perhaps even result in reform, especially of agricultural and regional policy, being carried through with greater vehemence.
I do not see any contradiction here.
Have the candidate countries now satisfied all the criteria?
As we see it, there is certainly still a lot to be done.
In many countries transposition of the acquis communautaire is still far from adequate.
Deciding things is one thing, putting them into practice is another.
Many countries still have discriminatory rules regarding origin and gender, but that can be dealt with.
Poor use is sometimes made of financial resources.
But I also recall that even after accession my country, for example, did not take up and use all the financial resources it could have had from Brussels.
We should not apply over strict criteria here.
Something needs to be done about the promises concerning the environment, especially about the restructuring and closure of nuclear power plants, but some good progress has also been made.
With good will, all these problems can be overcome in the months ahead.
And I want to expressly say that I do not regard history, which in many cases was one of conflict and not of commonality, as a reason to block enlargement.
If, on the one hand, the nationalists there are can see that the expulsions after 1945 were a consequence of the terrible Nazi dictatorship, and if the others recognise that today, I stress today, the expulsion of minorities as happened by the consensus of the victorious powers after the Second World War, is no longer consistent with our present understanding of minority rights, then this question, too, does not stand in the way of enlargement.
Finally, we will not move forward without compromise.
If, as sometimes happens, the EU Member States demand that the candidates fulfil all the criteria and that they reach the level of the Member States one hundred percent, or if they sometimes go even so far as to demand that they do better than the Member States, then of course enlargement will fail.
It will also fail if the candidates demand to receive the full extent of all support measures right from the start.
But we want success, success in 2004, no failure and no delay.
Mr President, while fully supporting the accession of Cyprus, I question whether the Union is trying hard enough to bring about a settlement of the dispute.
The minister says that he supports the UN and is monitoring the talks, but why is he not offering the services of the Council in trying to broker a solution?
Why are the Commission and the Council blocking the opening up of trade with the North?
It is only the pro-active involvement of Europe that will assure the two sides that Union membership profoundly and radically changes the context of their mutual relationship.
Conflict resolution should be at the centre of the Cypriot accession and the Union should prove itself far more creative, and even ingenious, than it has been so far.
Mr President, the enlargement of the Union is a political project.
The states that have applied for membership will start to say from the beginning of autumn that the terms and conditions of membership suit them and at that stage the process will be unstoppable.
The EU will then have to yield to the terms imposed by Poland, the last country to resist acceptance.
As for the question of financing enlargement, many net beneficiaries might feel that they are the ones that are having to pay for it.
The amount they receive in net benefits from the Union will fall.
In fact the budget frameworks for the years 2007 - 2013 should be drawn up while the enlargement negotiations continue so that they are aware of the situation before the decisive decisions are taken.
The Treaty of Nice makes that difficult, of course, as certain net beneficiaries saw their demands for unanimous decision-making accepted at Nice.
In connection with enlargement, the insistence that Ireland should hold a new referendum on the Treaty of Nice is putting unreasonable pressure on that country and clearly shows how undemocratic the EU is in its attitude to small Member States.
All the necessary regulations can be recorded in the accession treaty and to Ireland we send our friendly greetings: no means no!
Mr President, enlargement is our way of demonstrating our solidarity with eastern Europe, Malta and Cyprus, which will soon be members of the European Union.
As regards Cyprus, which the previous speaker mentioned, I should like to say that the faster Turkey understands where Europe stands today, the more it will be able to help, not just in resolving the problems in Cyprus, but with its own European prospects.
The universe is not conspiring against it; on the contrary, sometimes Turkey itself undermines its own European prospects.
Now, one specific European Union policy which illustrates the solidarity of the richer with the poorer is obviously the policy of the Structural Funds, which apply to both present and future Member States.
So, to turn to the report by Mr Turco, and may I offer my congratulations to Mr Turco, what I want to say is that, clearly, the current Member States were slow getting started in 2000 - it was mainly the Member States which were to blame, although I do not entirely absolve the European Commission - and Community initiatives are even slower getting started.
As regards the pre-accession instrument, the ISPA, unfortunately this too has been slow getting started, although we must admit that it strikes a balance between measures on transport and measures on the environment.
However, what we must bear in mind is that the ISPA is not just a funding instrument, it is a way of familiarising these countries with the European Union's way of thinking.
So, as far as funding is concerned, whether we are talking about the Structural Funds or farming, we must demonstrate our support for those who are shortly to become members of the European Union by being generous up to a point; however, they too must do what they can, not just in taking up the funds but in making the best possible use of them.
Mr President, I should first like to thank both the Presidency and the Commission.
In my opinion, they have both done a splendid piece of work over a long period. I find it very encouraging that the timetable for the negotiations with the candidate countries looks as if it will be kept to, so that the negotiations concerning ten countries can be concluded by December under the Danish Presidency.
The candidate countries have made a great effort to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria and implement the EU's regulations.
One crucial thing is now missing, namely a strengthening of the administrative capacity or management structure so that the legislation can also responsibly be put into effect.
I would again praise the Commission for its action programme for developing administrative capacity. In my view, this has been a big help to many candidate countries.
The ten candidate countries will probably be ready, but rather more doubts can be entertained about the EU's own preparedness.
I think this is cause for concern, not because of either the Commission's or the Spanish Presidency's handling of the matter but because we are in the grotesque situation in which the Fifteen have still not been able to reach agreement on a common position regarding the issue of direct aid to agriculture, and the divisions between the EU countries are particularly striking in this area.
Until such time, furthermore, as there is a common position, we must stick to the Commission's proposal in the area of agriculture, which I should like, moreover, to applaud.
It is a sensible and very balanced proposal which can also ensure that the competitive situation for both Polish and other farmers is fair and just, without the EU's funds drying up in the course of a few years.
I think it is also right constantly to emphasise that enlargement and the forthcoming agricultural reform should be kept separate.
In my opinion, it would be an historic mistake if the candidate countries were to be turned into hostages of the Member States' own internal disagreements.
I have great confidence that the Danish Presidency, together with the Commission, can take over the issue and that, jointly, they will do their utmost to remove the remaining sticking points so that the dream we all have of a Europe characterised by close cooperation can become a reality.
Mr President, it has been gratifying in the course of this debate to note Parliament's overwhelming endorsement of enlargement.
The circle from Copenhagen to Copenhagen is about to be closed.
If you come, as I do, from Copenhagen, the delight is naturally that much greater. Nor, then, shall I conceal my pleasure at coming from a country which, according to the opinion polls, is the country which puts enlargement highest on the agenda.
It is encouraging to hear from Mr de Miguel about the considerable progress that has been made during the Spanish Presidency.
We must express our thanks for the significant contribution that has been made, just as we must thank Commissioner Verheugen for his tireless efforts.
We have also heard about the hurdles which remain and which must be overcome: agricultural policy, Kaliningrad, the Cyprus issue and the Bene? decrees.
The question is, whether the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Great Britain are to be added to the list.
Do not allow them to stand in the way. Let us not lose this historic opportunity to reunify Europe for the sake of freedom, peace and security.
Like others, the Danish Presidency too has a three-word motto or slogan. It is 'enlargement, enlargement, enlargement'.
After today's debate, it could be Parliament's agenda.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr BÃ¶ge and Mr Brok and the other Members who helped to produce these reports.
They are important reports with which I identify.
I have also listened with great interest to what Mr de Miguel and Commissioner Verheugen have said.
I would like to focus on the factors which might have been slightly overlooked.
One of these is the approval of the Irish referendum; we must endeavour to work out what might happen in the future.
If it is not approved, which I am sure nobody wants, we cannot tell the candidate countries, after all their efforts, that it was just a joke.
This is undeniably an historic opportunity for Europe to be reconciled with its past.
It is clear that a response needs to be found in any case and it is right that we reflect on this.
The other factor is the cost of enlargement, which should be compared with the cost of not going through with enlargement.
Anyone who thinks that enlargement does not involve higher costs has quite frankly not done his sums properly.
Clearly, we also need to make the public understand the reasons behind some of our decisions.
The issue of upstream decisions, with which our citizens are quite unfamiliar and to which they are largely opposed, was mentioned just now, and rightly so.
Here, however, greater effort may be needed on the part of all the European institutions, not just Parliament and the Commission, for it is unthinkable that enlargement should be reduced to merely the opening or closure of a set of dossiers.
It is a decision that must have the backing of our fellow citizens but it is an opportunity which we cannot consider rejecting if we genuinely want positive developments for the future.
Mr President, first of all I must say that the goal of enlarging the European Union is as fundamental as the goal of deepening it.
In this respect I agree entirely with the report drawn up by Mr Brok, whom I congratulate.
In any case, I want to focus on one of the candidate countries: Bulgaria.
In my view, Bulgaria has been approaching the process of joining the European Union very seriously since political stability was achieved with the last elections.
I must therefore state that the Bulgarian authorities are making a great effort to continue in the right direction with the enlargement negotiations and the country's specific adaptations so that it can become a European Union Member State within a timeframe that is both convenient for Bulgaria and possible for the Union.
We all want this timeframe to be as short as possible, although, as we say in Spanish, 'the sun is not hurried by early risers'.
Nevertheless, I want to emphasise certain aspects that worry us.
First, the social aspect: of course the Bulgarian economy has to adapt, but it must be done by keeping the basic principles of social cohesion, such as the fight for equality and against unemployment, poverty and marginalisation, to promote jobs, benefits and social security.
On the matter of the environment, we highlight the need for all units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant to be closed down by the appropriate dates and also for the Bulgarian Government to make a firm commitment to environmental protection.
Lastly, we urge the government to remove all legal obstacles that still allow people to be marginalised, because of their sexual orientation, for instance.
It is unacceptable that articles like Article 157 should still be in force in the Bulgarian legal code.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, for me the year 2002 is one of the most decisive and historically significant years in the development of the European Union.
As the European Parliament, we want to make a full and complete contribution to peaceful enlargement.
Negotiations of individual chapters are making good progress in many fields and the Council presidency is really making every effort to get formal negotiations with the candidate countries concluded by the end of the year.
The agricultural chapter is one of the biggest topics for negotiation and along with regional policy and budget matters certainly one of the most difficult areas.
For me, one of the most important points is still the much criticised question of phasing-in the countries seeking accession.
But I fully support the Commission proposal concerning phasing-in.
Particular attention also needs to be paid to ensuring that the acquis communautaire is actually transposed into practice.
Only products that satisfy the same requirements as those of the EU Fifteen must be allowed on to the internal market.
The quota system must be maintained as an important instrument of control for that.
I would also like to stress how deplorable it is that such slow progress is being made with setting up Sapard payment agencies.
So far, they have been set up in only seven candidate countries and regrettably only a small amount of the funding has been disbursed since Sapard was implemented in the 2000 financial year.
We must do more to encourage the new Member States to create the administrative conditions necessary for adequate financial management for decentral administration without losing sight of the targeted nature of the aids.
On the other hand, I am glad that the Commission is aware of the difficult situation in the border regions and is investigating the socio-economic situation in those regions.
I personally welcome that very much and would like to say in conclusion that a common Europe can only come about through intensive cooperation and that the European model of agricultural policy must also be safeguarded for the future.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I speak as someone who is involved with setting the Budget, and people in that position sometimes have the feeling that they have to start by saying very clearly that we, too, who are involved with the financial side of enlargement, are in complete support of that enlargement.
We know it is not only a question of money; it goes far beyond that.
It is a question of peace on this continent, a question of standards, a question of security for the people who live all over this continent.
If we are to meet a challenge as great as the one before us, we must not only have the political will, but we must also ensure that the policies we make are backed by those for whom we make them, namely the people.
That means they must have confidence, and confidence exists when they have the feeling that things are also being handled in a proper and orderly way when it comes to funding these issues.
In that connection we must say that this enlargement will demand something of everyone.
Those who dream of advancing without any difficulties through landscapes in bloom fail to understand the matter.
We want to subject the financing of enlargement to very precise tests, which means that we are not issuing any blank cheques for the acceding countries, but we do not want to set up any hurdles either.
We very much welcome what the Commission has proposed.
In the matter of the structural funds, one of the areas where most expenditure is made, we are pleased that it has followed the approach taken by Parliament and intends to adopt a Regulation similar to what we are doing with the cohesion fund in order to make it easier for the candidate countries to absorb the funds.
But we also say very clearly at this point that this model is a model for transition.
We will not be creating a cohesion fund here that, in the future, will give rise to another model or to another fund that will then never run out but, insofar as it is possible to move over to the normal structural fund, that is what we shall have to do.
In the area of agricultural aids we support the Commission.
We agree that the rural areas should be seen as targeted units.
We also believe that direct aids are now part of agricultural incomes and that up until 2006 there is a simple model that can be funded, is clear and that we can also support.
For the time after that we shall have to give thought to how it is to look.
There are no blank cheques today, because we know the financial framework only up to 2006.
At this point we can guarantee full support.
After that, it will be necessary to think again.
But that also demands something of those conducting the negotiations.
We will give them very critical but constructive support.
We take a similar position on foreign policy.
Anyone looking at future developments in external aid must count on things happening that cannot be foreseen today.
As an example I will simply mention Kaliningrad.
Here we shall of course also be subjecting the European Union's external aids to very critical scrutiny, but we are very much convinced that this is possible and that, here, too, we will be able to make progress accordingly.
Citizens can be assured that between now and 2006 there will be no discernible problems.
For the time after that there will have to be proper negotiations.
All who sit round the table carry a heavy responsibility.
As a Parliament we will have a part in deciding how things will move forward, and we will be looking at that very closely.
But we will also be following these questions very positively because we believe that European Union enlargement is the task of the future to which we must apply ourselves, where everyone must know where we are heading, where we must first talk about how much we are prepared to pay, but we will always take a constructive and positive attitude, as we have up until now.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about the administration of the EU structural fund, something which is more than in need of improvement.
This is not only in the light of enlargement, as the 12th Annual Report on the Structural Funds 2000, the Cohesion Fund and the Instrument for Structural Policy for Pre-Accession shows, as the rapporteur has rightly said, that there is substantial underutilisation of commitment and payment appropriations.
Despite the lowering of targets, concentration and simplification of planning, take up of the new forms of intervention for the structural fund planning period has been much slower than was intended and was desirable.
Even if EU Finance Ministers are currently pleased at every euro that is not spent at EU level, since it eases the burden of the EU Member States' net payments in the short term, they are economising in the wrong place because EU money is urgently needed especially in times of rising unemployment.
The reasons for the difficulties must be sought both in the Member States and in the EU Commission.
In some cases there is a shortage of suitable projects.
Not infrequently the problem is the necessary cofinancing.
But appreciable administrative bottlenecks are also a reason why the Member States are unable to take up funding.
According to the Annual Report 2000, not one intervention was approved in connection with the new Community initiatives, and as a result 0% of the budget plan was implemented in this area.
That is atrocious!
In future, the Commission must ensure that the new planning period starts on time and it must insist that the Member States do their groundwork early.
On the other hand, the Commission must also intensify its scrutiny of the implementation of programmes and inform the European Parliament in good time of all irregularities found.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it has been pointed out several times today already, and I can only emphasise it, that the advantages of EU eastward enlargement naturally outweigh the disadvantages and that many will gain from it.
But there are also problems and we cannot disregard those problems if, as Mr Walter has just said, we want to take the citizens with us.
That is particularly so at the interfaces of enlargement, that is the border regions.
Many border regions are already marginal areas with large structural deficits.
It is for that reason that we cannot leave those regions alone.
That is why, among other things, we have Community action for border regions, which I consider to be a very good instrument.
The main section relates to transport.
As we also made clear in the Sommer report, we must give regional transport a central place in that.
It is not enough only to invest in TENs, because it is not only about ways from Warsaw to Berlin or from Vienna to Prague, but it is also about ways from one small town over here to another small town over there.
This brings me to the second key area mentioned in this Community action, namely support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Cross-border trade is a necessary step.
There is now a pilot scheme that has at last got going and I hope it will be a great success.
But we will only be successful if we simplify the application procedures and if we get better coordination between support instruments, for example between Interreg and PHARE-CBC.
I also want to stress here that we do not need any new instruments, but that we should optimise the existing ones.
Finally, we must also give some thought to whether we cannot increase the proportion of cofinancing in one corner or another.
Instruments like Community Action really have European added value.
In border regions, people come together.
They may work on one side and live on the other.
This is where they can get to know each other and learn from one another. That is why we should do all we can to assist this process.
Mr President, I am speaking specifically about the Turco reports.
I agree that they represent a damning indictment of the management of the Structural, Cohesion and ISPA Funds.
It is simply not acceptable, for example, that there are many programmes dating from the 1980s and 1990s that have still not been closed.
Likewise, no disbursement of funds has been made under programmes such as Urban, Interreg or Leader in the year in question.
As the report implies, this has been nothing but a catalogue of errors.
Recent reports by the European Court of Auditors and OLAF have revealed substantial holes in the Commission's accounts.
OLAF alone has investigated cases with a value of EUR 144 million this year.
Where has all this money gone?
