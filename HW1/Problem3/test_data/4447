The establishment of the rapid reaction force, the launching of operations in Bosnia, FYROM and the Congo are certainly pluses.
However, the weaknesses in the quality and coordination of European defence spending are clearly negatives, which we hope will be remedied by the new Armaments Agency.
Our failure over Iraq also helped you adopt two remarkable documents at Thessaloniki: Mr Solana's EU security strategy and the Council's declaration on weapons of mass destruction.
The security strategy provides a fitting European response to the US doctrine, resting as it does on the European principles of multilateralism and prevention rather than pre-emption.
The statement on WMD makes clear to our American friends that we are taking the threat of these weapons seriously, and offers a framework for Europe's response to Iran and North Korea.
You made Justice and Home Affairs the centrepiece of your presidency programme.
Much has been achieved, though justice and freedom still play second fiddle to security, to the European Union's discredit.
Commitments to further progress on legal migration and the integration of third country nationals are a fitting riposte to those who sought to repeat in Thessaloniki the kind of headlines which shamed Seville.
However, my group regrets that you did not provide for proper parliamentary scrutiny, at European or national level, of the recent EU-US extradition agreement.
On economic reform the Hellenic Presidency has made good progress, notably reforming the Stability Pact to target underlying deficits, concluding the energy liberalisation package and adopting the much-needed pensions directive.
All in all, this has been a profitable six months for the European Union, despite the huge costs of war and the difficult economic position.
Let us hope that, as you hand the baton to your successors, they too will run hard to keep up the Olympian lead that you have established.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in my speech I shall concentrate on a subject which was dealt with at the European Council in Thessaloniki, a subject that has hardly been mentioned up to now, but which is one of considerable scope.
I too would like to talk about the document presented by Mr Javier Solana entitled 'A Secure Europe in a Better World'.
On several occasions I have called in vain for a response from the European Union to the publication, on 20 September last year, of the new strategic doctrine of the United States, which was first applied in practice in the 'pre-emptive' war against Iraq.
Nine months after Washington, therefore, the Council has just given birth to its own strategic doctrine.
No doubt it is purely by chance that this text first saw the light on the eve of the Transatlantic Summit.
What, then, does this document say?
Let me give you a few quotations. 'With the new threats the first line of defence will often be abroad.
The new threats are dynamic.
Left alone, they will become more dangerous'.
This quotation explains the meaning of that other enigmatic phrase contained in the document, 'Pre-emptive engagement can avoid more serious problems in the future. ?. we should be ready to act before a crisis occurs'.
Then, just in case things are still not clear, I quote again: 'In failed states, military instruments may be needed to restore order ?' and, more generally, and still quoting, 'We need to develop a strategic culture that fosters early, rapid, and where necessary, robust intervention'.
Finally, there is the inevitable, 'Acting together, the European Union and the United States can be a formidable force for good in the world'.
We cannot believe our ears when we hear such mimicry of the ideas and even the language of the current tenant of the White House.
If we can believe the press agencies, even Mr Prodi, in the crowd, showed his enthusiasm for President Bush by declaring that when Europe and the United States were united, no enemy would be able to stand up to them.
On what basis, however, are we to be united, and for what purpose?
That is the question, Mr Prodi!
It is not by complaisance that we shall earn the respect of an American administration which despises Europeans, including the most conciliatory among them.
Of that, for my part, I am convinced.
Europe will exist as an essential actor on the world stage when it has the political will to use its economic clout, its political influence and its capacity for forming strong partnerships, particularly with the South, in order to help to create rules that are different from those that prevail at present, so as to achieve a globalisation with greater solidarity and greater democracy, and so as to create a peaceful world.
The document presented in Thessaloniki turns its back on such a prospect and gives us an apocalyptic description of the threats, without ever examining their causes in any depth.
The conflict in the Middle East is dealt with in four and a half lines out of a total of fifteen pages of text.
The concept of fighting for security that is described therein gives precedence to the military dimension, even though this approach has proved ineffective from Kabul to Baghdad, and even in the United States itself, whose vulnerability was so tragically emphasised on 11 September 2001, despite the fact that that country alone accounts for 40% of the world's military spending.
In this context, the references in the Council document to the multilateral system have a hollow ring to them.
After all, the main issues here have to do with the WTO, the international financial institutions and NATO.
The United Nations is mentioned only in order to ask that in future the European Union should be ready, and I quote, '? to act when their rules are broken'.
We can recognise, in this allusion, a call to order addressed to those member countries of the Security Council who opposed the 'material breach' argument quoted by George Bush as grounds for going to war with the backing of the UN.
For all these reasons, my group believes that the taking of this first step towards a new strategic doctrine of the European Union would be a turning point, the implications of which we would have to explain, and the dangers of which we would have to emphasise, to our fellow citizens.
Given the power of the recent mobilisation of European public opinion, in both East and West, against the argument in favour of war and American supremacy, you can be certain that you will have to explain yourselves.
I would ask those Members who are motivated by the knowledge that it is civilisation that is at stake here, to join, at 3 p.m. today, in hearing the views, on this subject, of two eminent experts, one, Mr Pascal Boniface, from Europe, and the other, Mr Philip Golub, from America.
Let us debate the issues with frankness, for it is the whole significance of the Europe of the future that is at stake.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek Presidency fell at a difficult time, and it has been a success.
I should like to congratulate you on this achievement, Mr President-in-Office.
Incidentally, you have proved that the principle of a six-monthly rotating presidency of the European Council is a creative and enriching force, and this is something that the future permanent Council presidency will have to prove.
The Chalkidiki Summit was also a success.
This was not a foregone conclusion.
The Heads of State or Government came together and nearly all of them had a long list of national ambitions that, even at the last minute, they wanted to salvage from the Convention's draft constitution.
But when our Heads of State or Government saw each other they were deeply moved and left the Convention's draft in peace.
This was a great success, except for the moment when it was decided to regard the Laeken mandate as fulfilled and to inform us - and I should now like to address this point, Mr President-in-Office - that Part III now only required some purely technical work.
This was the first that we had heard of this: otherwise, why on earth are we continuing our work in the Convention in July?
Because there was no consensus on the Praesidium's draft.
Hundreds upon hundreds of amendments - 1 700 of them - have been tabled and not on technical issues.
Essentially a very clear question is at stake in this work: namely whether we are going to deliver on the promises, values and aims set out in the first and second parts, whether we are actually going to make the competences, responsibilities and principles of democracy, that we enshrined by consensus in the first and second parts, a reality, or whether we are simply setting ourselves new objectives without freeing Europe from the chains of the past.
I should like to illustrate how critical this situation is with the aid of a few examples.
In the first part, of course, we declare our overarching support for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, but in the third part there are still key areas where only the Council can legislate, for example on European social policy.
National parliaments lose the right to ratify international treaties without this House gaining that right.
In one of the most difficult cases, concerning the reduced powers of the European Court of Justice to supervise one of the most sensitive areas in the constitution, that of police and judicial cooperation on home affairs, 80% of the Convention have demanded the deletion of the exemptions.
No policy without judicial control, no law without Parliament - these are clearly not technical issues, but issues of self-determination and the definition of Europe.
The ability to act is a key principle, but in the last few nights of the Convention whole swathes of policy disappeared from the majority voting list and reappeared under unanimity.
We were put under pressure by governments.
The majority of the Convention wants more; the people of Europe want more.
We know that the European public demand far more of Europe than the governments of Europe are willing to give.
The Convention does not need to make technical decisions here; it needs to achieve fundamental reforms.
Take public services of general interest, cornerstones of European social policy; the vast majority of the Convention want them to be explicitly protected in the constitution.
So far this request has been turned down.
I am not saying this to belittle the work of the Convention or the current draft, but to make this House aware that a great deal of what we have enshrined in the first and second parts still needs to be delivered and that we will not be keeping our promises to the people if we do not make one further effort to bring about a genuine reform in the third part.
Mr President, the Greek Government assumed presidency of the Union at a time of great international uncertainty and political instability.
It was clear that at the start of this year different governments in Europe had diverse viewpoints when it came to facing up to the growing political problem of Iraq.
The Greek Government sought to put in place in Europe a common political position on Iraq.
This was always going to be difficult to achieve but the Greek Government approached this political issue at all times with determination and with true sensitivity to all the parties involved.
The international difficulties which surrounded the war in Iraq were many, but I believe that in the context of its presidency of the European Union the Greek Government dealt with this difficult political matter as even-handedly as possible.
The last six months have also seen a great momentum in the work of the European Union Convention.
The Greek Government has worked very closely with all the representatives on the EU Convention and this has contributed in ensuring a new draft Treaty that will pave the way for new structures within the Union.
The Treaty forms the basis for future discussions at the IGC, which will finalise the provisions of a new European Treaty.
We are all aware that the internal structures operating within the European Union must be modernised and by 1 May next we are hopefully going to be living in a Community of 25 Member States comprising a population of over 500 million people.
Decision-making procedures must change so that we can guarantee that decisions can be taken within the different EU institutions in a streamlined and structured manner.
We want to enact a new Treaty that will command the support of the people of Europe and which will oversee the smooth running of the European Union for the next 50 years.
We must recall that the European Union has been a success because the interests and concerns of both the smaller and the larger Member States are respected within the institutional structure in Europe.
In fact, the last six months have been testament to the fact that the smaller countries in Europe can run an effective and focused presidency of the European Union.
This is an issue that we will return to again in the run-up to the next IGC.
The Greek Government has supported recent peace efforts in the Middle East.
After the war in Iraq the Middle East region has become more unstable and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that we get the peace process in the Middle East back on track.
This is a matter that should not be left to the United States alone; the European Union has a very positive and central role to play in promoting the road map to peace in the Middle East.
I would like to commend the Greek Government for the manner in which it has overseen the running of the presidency of the European Union for the past six months.
The vast majority of the political goals that it set at the start of the year have been met and that is a commendable achievement.
The Greek Presidency has set a good example of how a presidency should be conducted on behalf of all the Member States and others will do well to follow this example.
To the President-in-Office I would like to say that you have won respect and support from this institution for the semester.
On a personal basis I would like to wish him some short period of relaxation in one of the many beautiful Greek islands which some of us had a opportunity of visiting in recent times, during the presidency.
Might I suggest to President Simitis that I could recommend no place better than Platy Yialos and he would know what I mean when I say that.
Mr President, the climax of the Greek Presidency was a special summit involving the new nations of the West Balkans.
They too are making efforts to enter the EU.
They will be sincerely welcome, and I am pleased that the EU Charter of Human Rights contains the recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities that is deserved by everyone in the Balkans.
The EU may have 25 Member States on 1 May of next year, and perhaps 30 in 2007 and 35 in 2010.
The process may suddenly go very fast, because the countries concerned find it difficult to see any alternatives, given that, in practice, the EU also legislates for its neighbouring countries.
We must reform the EU that much more quickly in order to obtain more supple and flexible decision-making structures suited to Europe in its entirety, with very big differences between countries.
An Estonian language teacher can earn ten times as much by working in Brussels.
It is not easy to secure a proper language education in Tallinn.
It will be possible for MEPs from Prague to earn 20 times as much as their colleagues in the national parliament, so it will be no fun returning over the Charles Bridge in Prague.
One hectare of land in the Netherlands costs 30 times as much as Polish agricultural land.
It is scarcely Polish farmers who are buying up Dutch land.
The majority of Polish slaughterhouses and dairies are to be closed down when the EU rules come into force.
Why not be more flexible in introducing EU rules into the candidate countries and the new partnership countries.
There is no one in the EU who is lining up to pay subsidies to unemployed slaughterhouse workers in Poland.
The high point of the Greek Presidency was the solemn signature of the agreements to extend the EU to include ten new Member States.
Here we were in the cradle of democracy, welcoming a range of countries that could only enter the EU because they had become democracies.
It is one of the Copenhagen criteria that countries can only be accepted when they have stable parliamentary democracies.
That is why it is all the more absurd that the concluding summit in Haldidiki accepted the Convention's draft constitution that would remove the greater part of democracy in both the new and the present Member States.
In our case, power is not to reside with those who are elected but with people who were once elected and can now no longer be.
When prime ministers can no longer be re-elected in their own countries, they can be appointed to lead us in Europe, without being answerable to the electorate.
The national parliaments and the electorate are losing far more power than the EU is gaining, and that is not a guarantee of increased voter turn-out in the EU elections.
Hold referendums on the constitution in all the countries.
Ask the voters if they want to participate less in elections.
Imagine its being possible, in the birthplace of democracy, to accept Mr Giscard d'Estaing's getting away with quoting Thucydides, when what the draft constitution does is precisely to remove power from the majority of the electorate in the Member States and give most of it to the bureaucrats in Brussels.
Mr President, the draft treaty presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing is only one draft constitution among many.
It is also, to a large extent, the personal draft of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, because the other members of this Convention, after purely formal debates, have been left in total ignorance of a text essentially cooked up in secret by the Praesidium.
Claims that this is not so are mere propaganda, though this would be nothing unusual in Brussels circles.
This text, which is unreadable to the uninitiated, is nothing more than a new attempt to create a centralised and unified European state, a sort of super-Maastricht.
In fact, it employs various legal devices to increase the powers of Brussels, and it organises, amongst other things under the disguise of so-called shared competences, the sidelining of elected national governments.
No, Mr Badinter, the Eurosceptics have not had their final say yet!
Consequently it will be for the next Intergovernmental Conference to show its opposition to these reveries and these ponderous statements, in particular by deleting from the draft treaty - if there is one - the words or expressions 'constitution', 'constitutive', 'federal' - perhaps the worst one of all - 'law' or 'framework law', 'shared competences', 'subsidiarity' - a synonym for 'integration' - 'legal personality', 'reinforced cooperation', 'citizenship' and, generally speaking, anything that falls within the scope of Article 308 of the current Treaties.
I hope that some of the governments concerned - and not just the Government of the United Kingdom - will strongly oppose this attempt to overthrow the democracies for which they are responsible, and will do so without recourse to the illusory and temporary easy way out provided by 'opt-outs' or by some anodyne legal formula that will serve for all subsequent interpretations.
Mr President, the Athens Accession Treaty signed on 16 April was a historic landmark in the history of Europe.
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall my party has been consistent and determined in its support for the enlargement of the Union, and we unreservedly welcome the positive results of the referendums that have already taken place in many of the accession states.
However, we are less supportive of the presidency in other respects.
On Iraq, the damage to transatlantic relations arising from the 'gang of four' summit, attended by Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg, also severely undermined NATO.
At a time when many of our citizens in Europe are facing economic stagnation and deflation, there has sadly been little progress in advancing the Lisbon agenda of economic structural reform.
Instead, we have seen that we again prefer to devote most of our time to institutional reform, whilst persuading ourselves that this is the sort of progress that European citizens are crying out for.
I doubt it.
The presidency conclusions begin by stating that the Convention was successful in bringing our Union closer to its citizens, strengthening our Union's democratic character, enhancing our Union's ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system.
I fear that such warm, optimistic rhetoric is little more than that.
The results of the Convention's work have again shown the inability of a European political elite to reflect the real concerns of the people of Europe.
We are asked to believe that what our citizens really want is an EU with a legal personality, a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, the removal of the pillar structure, an extension of majority voting, an EU president and foreign minister, common asylum and immigration policies and a European public prosecutor - in short, that people want a fundamental change in the relationship between the Union and its people.
The British Prime Minister's now infamous view that the Convention is merely a tidying-up exercise has attracted derision from Eurosceptic and Europhile alike.
I repeat today that the people of the United Kingdom have a right to a referendum on this constitutional treaty, just as other Member States intend to do.
If the governments of the Union really wish to bring their citizens closer to the Union, then it is in their interests and those of their people to ensure that referendums are held in order to legitimise what is being proposed in their name.
My party believes in a different kind of Europe: a Europe where the nation state is the fundamental building block of cooperation and intergovernmentalism is preferable to one-way integration, which I fear is being reinforced by the Convention.
It is a different kind of Europe to the integrationist agenda, but it is no less European for that.
I wish the Convention had chosen this route.
I hope that the governments of the Union look afresh at the results of the Convention when the Intergovernmental Conference begins its work.
Finally, I noted that the presidency adds that the accession countries will participate in the Intergovernmental Conference on an equal footing with current Member States.
I hope that means that they will be given the same voting rights as Member States.
It would be outrageous for the IGC to conclude a new constitutional structure for Europe just weeks in advance of accession and try to present this as a done deal.
No democrat should put up with that.
Just for your information, the conclusions from Thessaloniki make it very clear that the accession states will play a full part in the Intergovernmental Conference on an equal footing, which, as you said, is ideal.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the chairman of the socialist group of the European Parliament spoke just now about the Odyssey of the Greek Presidency.
It was indeed an Odyssey which floated between the Circe of the war in Iraq - perhaps I should remind you that Circe was a wicked witch who had the ability to turn men into pigs - and the good goddess Calypso of the Convention on the Future of Europe which may guide the European Ulysses to the safe haven of the Europe of his dreams.
As Europeans and as Greeks, we can be proud of this success, however unhappy we are about the incidents of war we had to address.
The Greek Presidency undertook to address both the issue of Iraq and the differences which this war provoked between the Member States of the European Union and between the European Union and the United States.
At the summit Councils in February and March, with the promotion and exploitation of the role of the United Nations, the European Union acquired a material presence on the international stage.
Public opinion in the European countries recognised and welcomed the contribution by the Community institutions.
The European Union is based not only on the principles of democracy, but also on the rejection in principle of war in international relations.
The Member States, who have a very bloody history of conflict between them, no longer arm themselves against each other.
These principles now need to be consolidated between the Member States, the candidate countries and Europe and its new neighbours as a whole.
The Greek Presidency was persistent in its efforts to disseminate these principles in the new and sometimes dangerous areas of responsibility into which enlargement has led Europe.
Problems in sensitive areas, such as Cyprus, which the Foreign Ministers in the area have called a sort of powder magazine of the Eastern Mediterranean, were addressed methodically and consistently.
Cyprus, if there is the cooperation expected from the Turkish side which, unfortunately, there has still not been but we hope that there will be, can constitute a standard for the coexistence of different nations within the same state.
In the same spirit, the Greek Presidency especially promoted the peace process in the Middle East.
The current diplomatic procedures in this region are also the result of initiatives by the Greek Presidency.
From a wider perspective, it is worth highlighting the guidelines given for the formulation of a new strategy by the European Union, which was worked out down to the last detail by the Council's High Representative.
The promotion of European pacifist positions in the Western Balkans and the summit in Thessaloniki resulted, with its decisions, in a significant turn round in relations between Europe and the Western Balkans.
With these efforts the world did not become completely safe, but we can say that, thanks to these efforts, the Greek Presidency has bequeathed a much easier or, at least, less difficult task to its successor than it would have had without the methodical, consistent and sometimes inspired work of the Greek Presidency not intervened.
Mr President, firstly I would like to pay tribute to Mr Katiforis for his work for the Greek Presidency within the Convention.
The European Council was quite right to resist the temptation to deconstruct the Convention's work.
The result would certainly be greatly inferior.
As far as the revision of Part III is concerned, I am prepared to turn myself into a technician, pure or not, for the final phase of the work.
I quite agree with President Prodi that it is vital to extend the scope of qualified-majority voting as far as we can if the Council is in the future to be able to enjoy the capacity to take decisions.
But what about Part IV concerning the revision and the entry-into-force procedures?
The European Council was completely silent upon this point.
Was it brought up and, if so, what was said?
Would Mr Simitis agree with me that unless we can modify the future revision procedures we will be forever trapped in the dual lock of unanimity plus national ratification procedures - frequently protracted and problematical?
Surely it is desirable that the Union avoids putting itself inside such a straitjacket.
We must find a sufficiently flexible form of modifying the Constitutional settlement if we are to be able to move with the changing circumstances we will face in the years to come.
Mr President, unfortunately, as we predicted at the beginning of the Greek Presidency, decisions were taken during the past six months of the Greek Presidency which reinforce the anti-grass roots, reactionary and aggressive character of the European Union.
The increase in the retirement age, the reduction in pensions, the privatisation of social security and the extension of part-time and temporary employment were promoted.
In the name of competitiveness, the general economic policy guidelines of the European Union were approved, the main feature of which is the attack on the workers in order to increase the profits of the monopolies.
The citizens of the Member States of the European Union were handed over to the United States bound hand and foot with the disgraceful agreements on judicial cooperation.
The Greek Presidency aligned with the USA in its interventions in Cuba, with the pretext of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, which proved to be non-existent, and the objective of oil, in order to impose the global sovereignty of the USA.
During the Greek Presidency, the European Union, despite the unprecedented protests of its peoples, found excuses for and ultimately legalised the savage attack by Anglo-American troops and the occupation of Iraq, with its well documented disastrous results for the Iraqi people. .
Fortunately, the occupation is being resisted by the Iraqi people.
Who the Greek Presidency was serving is clear from the warm congratulations of Messrs Bush and Powell, but also from the outcry by the peoples.
On the pretext of crushing terrorism, further militarisation of the European Union was promoted, by completing the formation of the European army for imperialist interventions all over the world jointly with ???? and the USA, as was the more general strengthening of the repressive mechanisms to armour the interests of big business inside and outside the European Union from hostile peoples.
The idea of increasing military spending so that we are reliable partners of the American imperialists with whom, it is said, we are united by common values, also advanced.
The mid-term review of the CAP was approved, reducing and uncoupling subsidies from production, with disastrous consequences for small and medium-sized farmers, quality and the environment.
The strengthening of fortress Europe was promoted with new expulsions of immigrants and stricter terms of asylum.
The signature of the enlargement of the European Union marks new hardships for its peoples and legalises the division of Cyprus as a result of the invasion and occupation by the army of Turkey, which is a candidate for accession.
Finally, during the Greek Presidency an abortive text was approved, the creation of an anti-democratic Convention, which strengthens the pro-monopoly, anti-working class character of the European Union, the power of the strong and the militarisation of the European Union, in order to claim a more active role within the frameworks of international imperialism at the side of the USA.
Mr Simitis and his friends are proud of all this.
We are angry and we are extending our fight with the peoples against these policies.
Each of us shall serve his cause.
Mr President, as a member of the Convention I noticed that very early on it became a commonplace - at least certain governments tried to make it so - that the six-monthly rotation of the presidency of the Council leads to inefficiency, a loss of momentum, a loss of direction and, sotto voce, that if too many small countries have the presidency it will not work.
I congratulate the Greek Presidency most sincerely for having shown that this is completely false.
It has been the case during the last five years that the small-country presidencies have proved to be models of how this system can work.
We should take pride and pleasure in that and congratulate the Greek Presidency on it.
Last Friday, at a meeting in London, a document produced by the London Office of the European Parliament remarked that the Convention was proposing that the Council should have a permanent, powerful presidency.
Anybody who believes that ought to have a look at the draft text.
The presidency of the Council will have no constitutional powers.
The Council is denied any power of legislating.
The Council may - and ought to - have influence, but the idea that the presidency will be 'powerful' is a great mistake.
Since it will be a presidency chairing a meeting of prime ministers and heads of states, it will not be so much a case of primus inter pares as of less than par inter primos, unlike the position of the President of the Commission in future, for which again I am glad.
Although we have rightly heard a certain sense of alarm about the dual presidency, it may not be as bad as it sounds, like the music of Wagner.
At the Convention I had the honour of representing - as alternate member - the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and in particular the European Free Alliance subset representing the stateless nations of Europe - the small countries.
I rejoice, as I said the other day, to see the flags of the new countries that come in.
But not all the little countries of Europe are as yet - or intended to be - Member States of Europe.
It is therefore vitally important to ask ourselves, as we contemplate a new constitution for Europe, about the future position of Catalonia (comparable in size to Hungary), of Scotland (comparable in size to the Slovak Republic), of Galicia or Wales (comparable in size to Latvia).
What will be the way in which this Union works?
Mr de Gaulle was happy to pour contempt on the idea of subsidiarity.
If we do not recognise that this is going to have to be a Europe of democracy at many levels, which takes subsidiarity seriously and takes it in a transitive sense right through the Member States, to all the countries of Europe, it will not work.
I hope that will not be the case.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Thessaloniki European Council was dominated by the presentation of the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention.
In that respect, it could thus be said that a political process which began at the Laeken Council has come full circle.
At Laeken, less than two years ago, the Heads of State or Government decided to set up a convention whose aim was to consider the main problems facing the future development of the Union.
As we all know, the Convention's task was to draw up a final document which under the terms of the Laeken conclusions themselves, may - and I quote - 'comprise either different options, indicating the degree of support which they received, or recommendations if consensus is achieved.'.
Very much under the impetus of its President, the Convention rose to this challenge issued at Laeken by seeking out a third way.
This consisted of drawing up a complete draft Constitutional Treaty, a kind of closed structural framework for the future of the Union.
It is worth saying that the text of the Convention was not a consensual one and nor could it have been.
Without going into detail, we must recognise that there were many contradictions, controversies, omissions as well as successes which, taken together, resulted in a necessarily imperfect synthesis.
This synthesis will put to the test the ability of governments of Member States to cooperate and take decisions at the next Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).
This is why the Convention's work was rightly considered by the Council to be a mere starting point, not a final destination.
A good starting point, it is true, but no more than that.
Mr President, I would like to outline two final points.
The first is to note that, if the solution favoured by the Convention for the future of the Presidency of the European Council goes ahead, the Greek Presidency will remain inextricably linked to the beginning of the end of the excellent democratic practice, carried out every six months here in the European Parliament, of assessing the work of the Presidencies.
These regular debates on major European issues will come to a ruinous end without the least profit or advantage being drawn from it, as far as I can see.
To my mind, the opposite is the case.
This is undoubtedly due to my own shortcomings, but that fact does not prevent me from expressing one desire. This is the desire that the balance-sheet of the Greek Presidency that we are drawing up today should not be a final balance-sheet, the beginning of the end of a way of undertaking the Presidency of the Union which we consider crucial to safeguarding equality between Member States.
To sum up, and I will end on this second point, we would like to congratulate the Greek Government on the excellent results of its completed Presidency.
We are sorry, however, that this is the last time we will be able to pass on our congratulations to Greece in the same circumstances.
Mr President, at the European Council, I was struck, yet again, by the gap between the Heads of State and the public.
How can we ask the public to be enthusiastic about the creation of a super-minister for Foreign affairs - suddenly appointed Vice-President of the Commission - or about the appointment of a President of the European Council, or about all these texts which either are totally beyond their comprehension or have a hollow ring to them?
Should there be more competences for Europe, for more Member States?
Very well, but which budgets are going to pay for them?
Should we have more qualified-majority votes?
What will we use them for?
Mr Blair sees this as the condition for greater liberalisation, while others, on the same side of the political chessboard, believe that it is the condition for the advent of social Europe.
One does not have to be a genius to see that some people are going to be disappointed.
This draft constitution, which seeks to smother individual states, is, in my opinion, incompatible with democratic expression.
I do not want to see our states, deprived of their decision-making powers, become mere regions of Europe.
The Convention did not need the mandate of the people for that purpose.
This draft constitution, drawn up by an unrepresentative Convention, has no legal value and even less added value for our citizens.
I hope that the final text will enable the national parliaments to control subsidiarity effectively so that Europe no longer has a say in everything.
For all that, it will be up to the people to decide, by means of a referendum, whether they accept the idea of disappearing into a European-style democracy constructed out of nothing, thereby still giving the lion's share to an all-powerful democracy.
Mr President, the Thessaloniki Council stated in its conclusions that the draft European Constitution prepared by the Convention was a good starting point for the Intergovernmental Conference which will be opening this coming October.
That is an interesting expression, because it demonstrates that even though the Convention has done a lot of work on clearing the way, there is still a long way to go before we arrive at an acceptable text.
The Intergovernmental Conference, which will have more than six months ahead of it before 1 May 2004, will have to work in three directions, and I am speaking here both to the incoming Italian Presidency and to the Greek Presidency.
First of all, the proposed text does not maintain the necessary balance between, on the one hand, the mechanisms of cooperation and, on the other hand, respect for national sovereignties, which are the two pillars of the original Community method.
If the truth were told, this unbalanced text is sliding towards a predominantly supranational system, a super-state which will cut Europe off from its peoples even more.
Secondly, it will be necessary to carry out a serious review of Part III, which the Convention has not even looked at yet, and which it will only be able to correct, before 15 July, on its technical aspects alone.
Yet very important issues of principle are still outstanding.
For example, it is impossible to leave as it is the section concerning agriculture, because in no way does it mention our current objectives, namely the preservation of our model, self-sufficiency in food, food safety and nature conservation - all objectives which can only be achieved by multi-functional, and preferably regional, agriculture.
Finally, it will be necessary to rewrite the preamble, because it contains two vital omissions.
Firstly, and this is unbelievable, it does not say a single word about nations, except for a vague allusion to national histories.
Yet a nation is not simply past history.
It is, above all, the most important political reality experienced by our fellow-citizens and the most effective framework for modern democracy.
Secondly, the preamble does not say a single word about Christianity either, and yet surely it deserves at least equal mention with humanism, not only as a historical reference point, but above all as the belief in God of the majority of Europeans.
Therefore on two essential points, nation and Christianity, the current preamble refrains from mentioning what constitutes the very essence of Europe.
This is inadmissible, Mr President, in a supposedly formal document.
Mr President, the favourable comments heard in the House on the Greek Presidency, like the favourable comments in the past on other Presidencies are, I think, the most decisive argument in favour of maintaining this system of rotating Presidencies at the helm of the European Union and, of course, not in favour of what is being proposed in the new Constitutional Treaty, which has clear disadvantages.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are here to criticise the work of the Presidency of the Council constructively, honestly and in good faith on the basis of your report.
I shall focus my attention mainly on the issues on which no progress was made, not in order to grumble, but because it is good for us to remember the things that were not done, so that we can put them in order and make progress with them.
I would say that there was a delay in the immigration sector, because there is not one word in the conclusions of the summit Council about the question of setting up a European border guard, while the Commission is absolutely convinced about it and has announced it.
Why this standstill on such an acute problem?
Similarly, the issue of financial solidarity and an equal division of the burden in the immigration sector has essentially been lost, even though it was also a priority of your programme, in that no special funding means have been adopted, as proposed by the Commission.
Similarly, I would say that the common European asylum system was not introduced and, finally, we have no readmission agreements.
What readmission agreements were concluded?
How can 2 000 to 3 000 illegal immigrants from a country which maintains relations with the European Union, I am talking about Turkey of course, be caught and readmission not be accepted?
Readmission applications are being made - if I remember correctly over 1 400 - and only 14 have been accepted.
Where is the strength and will of Europe on such an important issue, which has not only economic, but also, more importantly, humanitarian consequences.
I would hasten to emphasise that guarding the external borders of the Union would also help in the foreign policy and security policy sector, where the Union is suffering, because this precisely constitutes the cornerstone of foreign policy and defence.
Now, on the Lisbon strategy I cannot but find that the political and economic uncertainties remain.
The prospects for sustainable development in Europe appear to be a distant hope.
For the reform of the CAP, I believe that you realise that the debate on the mid-term review carried out has not been completed, in that a series of products have not been included in the decisions.
Finally, as far as the future of Europe is concerned, I absolutely agree with President Prodi that the Constitutional Treaty does indeed contain some very important and positive points; however, it also contains certain elements which give a great deal of cause for concern.
I shall start with your phrase, that we share the future in a Community of values, to ask, how do we share the future?
Divided into blocs of large and small countries, with the reinforced ability of the former to affect decisions?
With duality?
Double structures?
In other words, something which the most simple company or government official knows leads to adversity, confusion and, ultimately, inefficiency?
Or by cutting the right of each Member State to equal representation by a Commissioner in the Commission?
Under these conditions, how will the interest of countries and, above all, their citizens, be maintained?
And what Community of values?
The Community in which it is not the Community model of the European Union but intergovernmental cooperation that is being extended?
And, finally, what values?
Those which we do not dare refer to expressly in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, offering the citizens - whose support we crave - the political education and values of a last-minute compromise?
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to start with, I could not reply to you in a language other than that which we spoke when we were at school together fifty years ago.
First of all, I want to thank you and warmly congratulate you for the particularly successful presidency which the Greek Government has brought to a close.
As you have heard from the honourable Members' interventions - and the interventions which do not come from the same political family are more valuable - there is generally a feeling that the Greek Presidency was a great success.
Nonetheless, I do not want to refer to the issues already raised, but to another issue: during the Greek Presidency, what you euphemistically refer to as the 'Iraqi crisis' took place.
I think that the Greek Presidency took the best possible reaction to the division which the European Union underwent in relation to this issue in convening the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels on 17 February 2003 and with the outcome of that Council.
The Greek Presidency is not to blame for the fact that some of the participants did not honour their own signatures before the week was out.
I shall continue in German, the language of the country which I represent here in the European Parliament, knowing also that you will not therefore need to wear headphones.
The European Heads of Government in Thessaloniki spoke almost continually of the need for speaking with one voice.
That is what they all want, as long as that voice is their own.
If they do not let go of this attitude, little will change, despite the Convention and despite Mr Solana's interesting document.
There is little one can say in the way of criticism about his analysis, but therein lies at the same time its weakness.
The report speaks about what unites us but is silent about what divides us, and that, in practice, is precisely the problem with 25 Member States.
The threats in an enlarged Union do not only lie beyond Europe's borders but also within them.
We can see eye to eye with Mr Solana at the abstract level, but God forbid that this should become a little more concrete.
I fear, above all, an internal rift about the attitude with regard to America's role in the world, and hence about how to tackle the major breeding grounds of conflict.
Mr Solana is right to say that an effective European Union could have a considerable impact, one that is conducive to a fair, safe and multilateral world.
We must develop our own security policy, but we have not managed to do this to date, unfortunately.
The Iraq crisis was not only about Iraq, but also about a new distribution of power in the world and inside the European Union.
Since the fall of the wall, external policy in the European Union has been re-nationalised.
Heads of Government, especially those of major Member States, seek to compensate for the loss of national sovereignty and identity in many areas by raising their own national profile in the area of foreign policy.
Unfortunately, the Convention bears out current practice by maintaining the rule of consensus.
Even the voice of a European super-Minister for Foreign Affairs can only be heard when the cacophony of his national colleagues has fallen silent.
Mr President-in-Office, in Thessaloniki you made progress on the issue of the Western Balkans and their prospects of acceding to the European Union.
That is very good.
However, you did not succeed in laying down a timetable.
I greatly fear that we shall not anticipate the new conflicts on their way.
Secondly: the invasion of Iraq has been followed by military occupation, with the logic behind a military occupation, men in balaclavas, police spies and so on.
The occupying forces are, as we learned yesterday, building a new Guantanamo.
Politically, what do we say to these gentlemen, whom we sometimes call allies and certain of whom are also members of the European Union?
I do not understand.
I do not think that we resolve any problems by politically appeasing allies.
Thirdly: you have signed an agreement with the USA.
The European Parliament accused you on the grounds that this was democratic infringement.
The article which you chose excludes the parliaments; however, it says that the Member States can express objections if their internal order so requires.
Will Greece do so?
Fourthly and lastly, the matter of the Constitutional Treaty really did progress, but with opaque and, in my opinion, very dangerous procedures, which may even change the essence of everything the Convention has done.
Question: how will we safeguard the politicisation of the unification of Europe and the limited cooperation which can give impetus to those who really want to do something different against American efforts to reduce everything to the lowest common denominator?
Will Greece hold a referendum as part of this effort at politicisation?
I do not say this to detract from all the positive things said, but to remind you that politics go on and that there are very serious issues outstanding, including for the continuation of political life in Europe.
Mr President, I want to talk about one of the annexes to the Council declaration, in particular that on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
This is to be welcomed, and I know we will return to this many times in the future.
We particularly welcome the statement in Paragraph 2 that 'weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation puts at risk the security of our states, our peoples and our interests around the world'.
However, I regret that meeting this challenge is only taken up in terms of European Union external action.
We should hope that the efforts regarding non-proliferation will apply to all states already in possession of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and those which may develop the capacity, and not just states which are seen as unfriendly, as opposed to those which our foreign policy supports.
Turning to other questions, my group certainly welcomes the efforts made by the Greek Presidency on the question of temporary agency work, currently blocked through more political game-playing by particular Member States.
It is clear that we need more progress on workers' rights and the implementation of existing rights, for example in terms of mass redundancies, as in the case of Schiesser-Palco in Athens, and the questions about retraining and social protection which follow that.
The Council really needs to start questioning whether Lisbon is working as well as people think it is in terms of the provision of high-quality jobs and the social cohesion which was sought at Lisbon.
In one of those areas we need to look at the relationship between that and the World Trade Organisation agreements and proposals we are currently following, and to see whether we will be able to safeguard social and environmental rights within the European Union and encourage and support such development in poorer countries under the current regime.
Finally, I want to pick up the question about tax evasion, which the Prime Minister mentioned, and hope that future presidencies - I do not hold out much hope for the next one - will look at this question of tax evasion within the European Union and beyond it, because at the moment we are losing fortunes from our public budgets due to the non-payment of taxes by corporations.
Mr President, the conclusions of the Thessaloniki Summit relating to immigration represent an encouraging milestone insofar as major decisions are made with regard to the management of external borders and the policy on the return of illegal migrants, not least in terms of the European Union's financial undertaking.
However, on this extremely serious issue, the European institutions continue to suffer, so to speak, from an endemic reluctance across the board to address, head-on, the challenge represented by the activity of the criminal Mafia organisations which organise the despicable trafficking of human beings, which frequently causes tragedies such as those portrayed on television screens in the houses of all European citizens throughout the world, where a picture is painted which certainly discredits the European institutions as well.
There are still a number of questions on this matter which were not clearly raised at the Thessaloniki Summit.
Europe is not addressing the relationship between illegal immigration and terrorism, and yet Al Qaeda members are identified daily in the ghettos of illegal immigration.
Just recently, a criminal network has been identified in my country whose members have even penetrated the reception centres.
What if, instead of merely aiding the criminal trafficking of illegal immigrants, these had been members of Islamic terrorist organisations?
Furthermore, why are adequate health protection measures not laid down, not least in the interests of the immigrants, given the extremely unstable health situations endemic in the countries and regions of origin of illegal immigrants?
Consider the situation in Algeria, with the plague crisis.
Moreover, has Europe considered, or does it intend to consider, the need to protect, not least from the point of view of protecting the Union and its natural resources, areas such as the islands and coastal regions of southern Italy, where illegal immigrants leave the ships of traffickers?
The island of Lampedusa, with its extraordinarily beautiful countryside - one of the last strips of European land before Africa - and the Costa Domiziana are parts of our European heritage which are unique in their beautiful scenery.
For how much longer must they continue to be transformed into reception camps for floods of illegal immigrants?
In this sense, the UK proposal to place reception centres outside Europe's borders is to be welcomed.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the Greek Presidency will be forever associated with the picture at the foot of the Acropolis, where the reunification of Europe took place.
We will also forever associate it with a sense of gratitude.
We will also see, however, that this presidency saw a great failure on the part of Europe - not that the Greek Presidency is responsible for this; we all are - namely the inability of us Europeans to have a common position on an issue of war and peace.
Lessons were learnt from this and it gave the Convention impetus to make perhaps greater progress on aspects of the foreign, security and defence policy than we had initially thought possible.
This is also true of the discussions on a strategic concept for the European Union that have been taking place and will continue in Thessaloniki, so that we are better prepared in terms of content in the future and have our own system for weighing up interests, from which a better operational policy will emerge at Community level in the future.
We must be aware that what has been achieved in the Convention is marred by several mistakes.
At the last moment the Convention's courage failed it and in its final 14 days it clearly does not wish to try to move more foreign policy issues to majority voting.
The idea that in the future one country would be able to block 25 others on an issue of foreign policy, with no way out, is a painful one, and there is the risk of an opportunity being missed.
I would ask you once again, Mr President, to define what is meant in the Thessaloniki Conclusions in respect of Part III by purely technical work, so that we can make progress on majority decision-making - particularly in foreign policy but also in other areas - and so that this does not serve as an excuse for our not being able to discuss anything further.
The proposals that have been made by government representatives in the Convention seem at least not to be technical, when I look at the proposal that the German Foreign Minister has tabled on behalf of the Federal Government about a foreign service.
If a footnote in Part III - this being declared to be technical - leads to our own foreign service being set up, drawing its staff from the Commission or the Council and including national civil servants, under the exclusive competence of the foreign minister, this will constitute a dramatic change in the balance between the institutions and a dramatic weakening of the Commission and ultimately also of Parliament.
It is unacceptable for us now to create further bureaucracy for the important position of foreign minister.
Ours is a twofold task: we are to merge areas and not create anything new that will make life even more difficult in the future and will be harder to monitor.
We do not need any new fiefdoms; instead we need to integrate areas and I hope that attempts will be made with your help to gain control of this.
I would therefore urge you to help us in this matter, and I would ask you once again to define the word 'technical', so that we can still make progress in the Convention this week and next, and in this context also to tell us why Part IV cannot be touched.
The Convention has not yet debated Parts III and IV.
It should have the right to do so, and governments should not prevent it from doing so.
Mr President, I am going to refer to the Thessaloniki agenda in relation to immigration and asylum.
Compared to the Seville conclusions, I find it genuinely interesting, although, having heard Mr Borghezio, I am wondering whether my analysis may be mistaken.
Seriously, I believe that the Council has returned to a more global and balanced vision of immigration, reducing the decibels of its declarations, but in a more measured way increasing the intensity of the measures adopted.
I take a positive view of the option of guaranteeing border control by means of a Community operative structure for cooperation.
Border control is necessary, but it is only one part of immigration policy, Mr President, and it has its limits: in terms of security, because criminals do not normally use their documents or cross borders by the usual routes, and in terms of the management of migratory flows, because the majority of immigrants currently residing in Europe, without documentation, crossed the borders originally in a legal fashion, as students, with an initial work permit or as tourists, but the border was crossed legally in any case.
In fact, the situation at maritime borders is dramatic and people have a very negative perception of it, since they feel subjected to a dual tension: fear of a phenomenon which appears to be out of control, and a tremendous compassion which we all feel when we see, sometimes, bodies reaching our coasts.
In terms of numbers, however, this is very limited compared to the overall phenomenon of immigration.
The Tampere element is needed, and its application does not require money, but does require political courage.
It is also necessary to create a common legislative framework for legal entry and for the harmonisation of asylum.
Similarly, readmission agreements are just one part of the relationship with third countries.
We should use a little imagination so that, in a world such as ours, in which everything has the potential to move within a global framework, the movement of people can become a virtuous circle, generating a little wealth for third countries, for our neighbours and for us.
We will need this imagination.
Furthermore, Mr President, please allow me to end by congratulating you on having accepted, for the first time, the need for a European integration policy and on having correctly identified its objectives and the need to implement them with local and regional authorities and social actors.
We have a lot at stake in this field.
The co-existence of our Member States is at stake.
I only hope - and I congratulate you on your Presidency - that your successors will deal with this issue with the same care as you.
Mr President, I too appreciate greatly that the Greek Presidency has taken an enlightened approach to facilitating legal migration and integration, not just fighting illegal immigration.
In an important presidency conference on the theme in Athens and in securing agreement on the family-reunion and long-term-residents directives you have gone some way to rebalance the EU agenda which has been much too focused until now on control and rejection.
The EU's role in offering refugees protection has been under assault from some governments, notably the UK.
I am glad that Thessaloniki rejected the preposterous suggestion that all EU asylum seekers should be driven back towards the Third World or EU fringe countries.
The prospect of vast detention camps, raising the spectre of concentration camps, was rightly a step too far for some Member States.
We need to get order in our asylum systems with a common EU system that does not shift responsibility but shares it.
This would end the damaging rotation whereby first one country then another sees its numbers peak.
We can only have a true partnership on migration with third countries if we offer their people adequate alternative opportunities, especially in agriculture.
The CAP with its export subsidies and import protection is a gross barrier to trade justice.
You have made some reform progress but not enough.
My colleague Mr Watson rightly deplored the manner and content of the EU-US legal cooperation and extradition agreements.
I agree with him.
However, I welcome that the summit issued a clarion call of strong support for the International Criminal Court.
The EU must stand up to the outrageous US bullying to undermine the court.
Finally, the accession signing ceremony took place at the foot of the Acropolis where the new Parthenon museum is also located.
I represent London where the British Museum is located, but I take a rather softer line than its director on the so-called Elgin Marbles and I hope some arrangement for transfer, even if only a loan, can be reached before next year's Olympics.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I should like, first of all, to thank the Greek Presidency once again for the quality of its collaboration, and congratulate it on the work it has accomplished during a particularly eventful and difficult six months.
I should also like to say, following Thessaloniki, how greatly astonished I am at the gulf which has opened up between the enthusiastic media welcome given to the sovereign proposals of Mr ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing and the numerous criticisms expressed on the sidelines, or in their capital cities, by many Member States.
Finally, I should like to say once again that, without a clearly-affirmed social dimension, without any real rules for urban and rural planning across Europe, without any major European public services, without the attributes of a real European citizenship which respects the need for pluralism and the real diversity of our histories, cultures and traditions, yes, without all that, Europe is condemning itself to disillusionment, a disillusionment which will no doubt, in time, prove to be fatal to its very existence.
The IGC must therefore improve the draft Convention on these points, so that what is being called the new Treaty of Rome really does open the door to a European Europe, a social Europe and a Europe of citizens.
Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has discussed various aspects of the process of the EU's enlargement, and these were also addressed in Thessaloniki.
From this, the impression is created that the process is currently going hand in hand with less stringent criteria.
In the past, we most definitely did not want to set down any dates for the start of negotiations, the end of negotiations or for accession to the European Union.
Nowadays, dates are being suggested quite spontaneously which, in themselves, are also being interpreted in all kinds of ways.
With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, our resolution was reported to state initially that we appreciate it that those countries have set themselves a target date, namely 2004.
We have not given an opinion either way, but we are increasingly hearing that we assume that the negotiations can be finalised by the end of 2004.
One cannot help wondering whether conditions are also being prescribed for the implementation of what is being laid down in law.
Will, for example, Romania be a country that functions normally by 2007, or will it still be weighed down by corruption and political power-play that overlook the interests of the general public?
We never imagined that what we used to call the two waves would follow each other in such quick succession.
We are therefore surprised about those dates 2004-2007 for Romania and Bulgaria.
The western Balkans and Kosovo are also being mentioned in the same breath.
I should note in this connection, and it must be patently clear to the authorities in Kosovo, that nobody here wants an ethnically-based Member State.
Could this be a case, perhaps, of misplaced guilt in respect of the candidates left behind?
This feeling is not present among Union citizens.
The people have become more critical; the importance of a well-functioning Europe has become greater.
The economic political problems of the new accession states have also grown and meanwhile, it seems as if the Council and Commission have become more lenient.
Then, as the President-in-Office of the Council also mentioned there is the largest potential enlargement: the accession of Turkey.
Unfortunately, a date has also been set for the start of negotiations while no conditions have been laid down for this.
According to Turkey's interpretation, this is an unconditional date.
It would be unfortunate if the Council and the Commission were susceptible to Turkey's criticism that they are not reacting quickly enough and that surely, Turkey has now waited long enough, while it is we who have waited for the changes in Turkey to take place.
Luckily, the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the minorities, religious freedom and the position of the army.
The Commission on its part has promised an inquiry into the role of the army.
This strikes me as extremely important, provided this does not simply look into the extent to which the current situation at the start of the negotiations about other chapters can be maintained as much as possible.
It appears to me that a priority has been set here which we must handle with the greatest of care.
We must also deal with the changes in Turkey required by us with due care.
These cannot simply be made in the course of a few years without causing major damage.
We should not be guided by a fear of driving Turkey away in this.
After all, the introduction of quasi-Iranian conditions is probably the last thing the army will allow.
This calls for staying power and caution.
The solution to the Cyprus problem, in particular, will be one of the benchmarks for Turkey's accession, because that is where the army's role is felt most acutely.
The Balladur initiative on borders and good neighbourliness are, in fact, the basis for Copenhagen's political conditions.
It would be naive to think that no country would use its veto if Cyprus were not re-united.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency of the Council on what it has achieved in its six months, in a difficult situation: on Iraq - as we have heard - and also on specific dossiers like the European Statute for Political Parties, where a lot of hard work was put in.
The ministers will know that I do not say this just out of politeness because I have also voiced friendly criticism of some aspects of the Greek legal system.
I did so, for instance, when a constituent of mine - Mr David Wilson - who is now facing an appeal in the Greek courts, was arrested and sentenced within 24 hours of his arrest to 12 years in jail, after some stowaway asylum-seekers were found hidden at the back of his lorry without his knowledge.
So you know that my praise is genuine because sometimes I do not hesitate to criticise.
The key issue of the period of the Greek Presidency is the constitution.
In the long run that will be the most significant thing.
I congratulate the presidency on getting the form of words agreed in Thessaloniki - that the constitution will be the basis for the negotiation of a new treaty in the IGC.
The Convention has not quite finished its work.
Part III, at least, is going to be subject to a technical revision: such technicalities as how to vote in the Council, the technique of voting by QMV or unanimity.
That shows that technicalities can sometimes also be of the highest political significance.
It is important that progress be made on that.
But once we have a completed result from the Convention the battle then moves on to getting it intact through the IGC.
The IGC must not unravel the Convention, must not pick it apart.
As soon as we start moving one little bit of the constitution, there will somebody else who wants to remove another bit of it, and the whole thing could fall apart.
On the contrary, we must all unite to say that this must be the basis on which we move forward.
If there are going to be changes they should only be small, detailed and technical changes to the constitution.
I welcome the reference in the conclusions of Thessaloniki to the participation of Parliament in the IGC.
The details still need to be spelt out but we now have an acquis from the Amsterdam and Nice negotiations that the European Parliament participates via its President in the meetings at the level of ministers and via two representatives at the level of the working group that does the negotiating.
That at the very least should be the basis on which Parliament participates in this IGC.
Mr President, I too should like to wish that a Greek prime minister will pass through the European Parliament in a few years' time under the rotating Presidency, which is a useful institution, to thank Mr Yiannitsis for the good cooperation we had and, in the short time which I have, to wish that the President-in-Office of the Council and Prime Minister of Greece will resolve, not in the remaining hours of his Presidency, but over the coming days, an important issue to which the letter sent to him by 90 members of the European Parliament also referred, in other words, the application of Directive 70/1999 on fixed-term workers.
I would like to believe that, taking account of the views of the Commission and the European Parliament, as well as the decisions by the Greek courts, the Greek Government will set a good example in this basic sector, which concerns tens of thousands of workers and in which fixed-term contracts are being abused.
There are still people who sign unilateral fixed-term contracts for 15 years.
I would like to hope that the Prime Minister will address it positively and I should like, if he can, for him to take a position on this issue in his second speech.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without a doubt these six months of the Greek Presidency have been some of the most dramatic in the recent history of the European Union, and I think that we can compliment the Greek Presidency on doing its job with great sensitivity, consistency and energy.
Three major issues have dominated this period as they do this debate: enlargement; the war in Iraq and the significance that it has had for Europe and will also continue to have in the future, and the Convention.
Enlargement - the great historic project of our generation - is well on the way to being completed successfully.
For us enlargement already has a human face, in the shape of the colleagues who are already working here as observers.
As an aside, I should like to mention that we in Germany were interested to note that after Parliament's decision on enlargement the Czech Government for example issued a statement on the injustice of expulsion, which is along the right lines and gives us hope that here too the process of reconciliation may reach a successful conclusion.
The war in Iraq made it clear where Europe's borders lie and showed where we need even more Community: primarily in the field of foreign and security policy.
So far Europe has played no role at all here or at best a pitiful one.
It really should strike people that where Europe uses the Community method, such as on internal market issues, we operate on an equal footing with for example the United States of America, but that where we work on an intergovernmental basis, we play no part at all.
This has to change in the future and the Convention needs to make a contribution to achieving this.
I hope that it will still succeed in doing so before 10 July of this year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, Greece was not found wanting in its encounter with history.
Indeed, the draft Constitution, whose preparation Greece showed it could oversee so clearheadedly, makes a decisive contribution to European history.
After a period of national constitutionalism, we are now witnessing a period of European constitutionalism.
Moreover, though sceptics may criticise this European constitutionalism, which will not replace national constitutions. Instead, it represents a break, a highly creative shift in the European spirit.
Greece has also, however, shown itself worthy of the classical humanism as expressed by Gorgias, who said 'man is the measure of all things'.
It also showed it could resist those who wanted to turn immigration policy into a tool of repression against those immigrants who are attracted to Europe as a land of work, prosperity and peace. Greece showed that it could resist, furthermore, by pointing the way to a suitable immigration and asylum policy.
When confronted with the storm over Iraq, the war in Iraq, moreover, Greece showed it could remain upright and clearheaded, and could once again point to the way forward, which took the form of an independent European defence policy and identity, still within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance.
Greece, which, we should remember, invented the democratic city-state in ancient Athens, showed that it could contribute decisively to developing and strengthening a new form of democracy, typical of the European character: the European Union on a continent-wide scale.
Greece showed it could also contribute to that process of enlargement by proposing that the western Balkans join the European Union in the long term.
In the same way, Greece, and especially its prime minister, Mr Simitis, showed it could restore its troubled relations with Turkey. It showed it could move beyond their historic dispute and prove that nations do not have to be permanently at war.
Greece showed it could open up to Turkey, that great country which has always been present on the European political scene, in the good times and in the bad.
Just one reservation: the CAP, which perpetuates serious inequalities in the distribution of resources between farmers and countries.
Lastly, the Greek Presidency showed it could reconcile the world of Platonic ideas with Aristotelian realism.
The art of politics in Greece cannot be separated from philosophy, just as the art of politics in Europe must not be separated from philosophy either, otherwise it will always be susceptible to the temptations of religious fundamentalism and repressive ideologies.
The spirit of Europe today is the spirit of Greece, and the spirit of Greece is the spirit of Europe.
It is my earnest wish that the future permanent presidency of the European Union, which I support, unlike so many, will always show it can be like the Greek Presidency. I hope that the latter will be an example for the permanent presidency of the European Council in future.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to echo the positive words about the Greek Presidency. I should immediately like to follow this up with the comment that this is yet another example of how small countries often make better presidents than large ones, and that we should not be so quick to give large countries priority.

Greece is a case in point.
You have dealt with a number of very heavy dossiers, and the finalisation of the accession dossiers on the Acropolis on 16 June gave us a stunning picture, also for those who were only able to follow the proceedings on television.
I do not think we could have imagined a more beautiful spot and a more beautiful image.
It was, of course, coincidental that these dossiers happened to be finalised during the Greek Presidency, but it was a very happy coincidence.
The Convention's work has also been guided in a very positive manner.
Greece assumed a hands-off approach and gave latitude to the Convention itself.
I myself was - indeed, I still am - a member of that Convention, and I can vouch for the fact that the result that is now before us is mainly due to the way in which the MPs and MEPs have joined forces.
The MEPs and members of the national parliaments worked together much more effectively than some government representatives.
There is, therefore, the risk that the governments are going to put a spanner in the works.
An amazing amount has been achieved: values and standards have been established, the Charter has been adopted, the pillars have disappeared, decisions will be taken by qualified majority more often, democratisation has moved on by quite a long way, parliamentary control has been stepped up, transparency enhanced and the institutional structure improved, the only discordant note being that we are now, after all, getting a President, something that many did not actually want.
Unanimity in foreign policy is, in my view, a major disadvantage, and it really should not have been adopted.
During the Iraq crisis, we saw what became of Europe if everything is to be decided unanimously.
If any changes are yet to be made, therefore, then this aspect is a definite contender.
I also share Mr Prodi's view that it is odd that half of the Commissioners are entitled to vote and the other half are not - this is somewhat out of order.
We should, however, change as little as possible to this proposal and try to guide it through the process as well as we can.
If we manage to do this during the coming six months under the Italian Presidency, then Europe will have taken another big step and we will have a bright future ahead of us with those 25 countries.
You have helped to make this happen.
Mr President, when the President of the French Republic, Mr Chirac, referred to the Greek Presidency as brilliant, he articulated not a diplomatic, but an historic speech.
I shall refer to just three of the many and useful successes of the Greek Presidency that justify Mr Chirac, allowing - especially today - my national modesty to take second place to my satisfaction as a European.
First, Greece had the misfortune, but Europe had the fortune, that the Greek Presidency coincided with the huge moral - without doubt moral - crisis which the European Union underwent in the consciousness of the European citizens with the stance taken by certain of its members on the illegal war against Iraq.
This sort of incident could have resulted in the break up of the European Union.
The Greek Presidency managed not only to prevent it from breaking up, but also to express the European Union with a word of consent, which will certainly withstand the criticism of tomorrow's historians.
Of course, in the future we shall have work to do to restore the moral credibility of Europe as a whole.
The second major historic event during the Greek Presidency was the positive decision on the Constitutional Treaty submitted to the European Council in Halkidiki by the Convention through its chairman.
The text submitted takes historic steps, it interconnects the European institutions more firmly, it safeguards more than ever before the social state, crowned with the concept of full employment, for which Georgos Katiforis deserves particular thanks.
However, it also has serious shortcomings, some of which have already been pointed out by previous speakers.
The European Parliament, in the report which I have the honour of having undertaken together with President Gil Robles, will expose these weaknesses in the Treaty.
The Greek Presidency respected the institution of the Convention and its results and thus politically - and this is important - the institution of the Convention was established as one of the major accomplishments of European democracy.
Finally, I would refer to the likewise historic fact that, after seven years of being unable to take a decision, common positions were found with the European Parliament so that the regulation on the operation and funding of political parties could finally enter into force.
This is extremely important in consolidating the European democratic institutions.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when we review the Greek Presidency we can say with complete justification that it is hard to see how a permanent Council President could have done better.
After this presidency we will clearly have to explain to the public what additional benefit Europe is supposed to derive from the creation of a new post such as that of Council President, a president appointed from the ranks of the Council.
Obviously the Convention, which has already been mentioned here several times, has resulted in a compromise and the Intergovernmental Conference, too, will ultimately result in a compromise.
Nevertheless, the Convention's weak points should not be overlooked, even if the worst has been avoided.
There is however still the issue - which the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, mentioned - of the dual presidency of the European Union.
Even if the Council President has no legislative competence, that person will still represent the European Union to the outside world and it will be their personality that will determine what they make of the office.
This may give rise to conflicts within the EU.
On the arduous path to a Common Foreign and Security Policy, a post of common foreign minister has now also been created, which is supposed to combine the two functions carried out by the previous agents.
This undoubtedly constitutes progress, but creating a post does not yet mean that a common policy has been created.
The foreign minister - who is yet to be appointed - will embody the schizophrenia of the European Union.
Above all, however, subdividing the Commissioners into those with voting rights and those without is a real structural defect, particularly where the Commission remains a collective body.
I can certainly understand that, when faced with an EU of 25 or more Member States, some may long for the times when there was a Community of six.
But artificially scaling down the European Union by dividing it into a core Europe and the rest undermines the European Union's cohesion and also public trust in the European institutions.
This weakness should therefore be remedied.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that it seems to me to be totally counter-productive, as a Member of the Convention and a Member of the European Parliament, to maintain rivalries between small and large states.
It also seems to me, in any case, that Greece is a large European country.
I would also like to say that I welcome the decision taken at Thessaloniki on the five Balkan States.
I believe that this was a most historic day in the creation of this greater Europe, the source of democracy, peace and stability, towards which we are all working.
With regard to the Convention, I should like, Mr President, to say two things to you.
The first is that it seems to me that there is an unidentified objective in this draft constitution, and that is the fourth part.
You are giving us a mandate to make technical improvements to the third part, and you can count on us to do that.
As for the fourth part, though, where has it disappeared to?
The Convention has not really discussed it, and I am afraid that there is a broad consensus within the IGC that nothing should be said about it.
In the final analysis, it seems that there is a conspiracy of silence, so as to ensure that nothing is said about what is at the heart of a constitution, namely the question of how the text can be revised and whether it authorises regional unions.
When and how shall we be discussing these issues?
In any case, it seems to me that, according to the Laeken mandate, these issues also fall within the competence of the Convention.
I hope that, at least as far as the rest is concerned, the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to be short and decisive.
As for the operating method of the Intergovernmental Conference, it seems to me that, at Thessaloniki, the rough outline was established, but there remain four absolutely vital points which the Heads of State or Government must take into account.
First of all, they cannot treat this IGC just like any other IGC, like those of Amsterdam and Nice, for example.
Before the new IGC takes place, things will have happened, in particular the fact that there will be twenty-five of you.
Therefore the situation is not the same.
The second important point is that you have been asked to examine a text which has not been prepared by a group of experts or a group of wise men, but which has been drafted by 105 Members of the Convention, without any options.
That is a long way from being a good basis on which to work.
The third point concerns Parliament's involvement.
We will not accept the sort of treatment we received at Amsterdam and Nice.
It was all right, but today we need something more, and something better, and, what is more, that is in the interests of the Intergovernmental Conference itself.
I do not deny the intergovernmental nature of this Conference, but as regards the task to which you have committed yourselves, prepared as it has been, the Conference cannot imagine that, all of a sudden, history will come to a halt and we shall go back to the previous process, like we used to do when there was no Convention.
This is why the nature of Parliament's involvement is so important.
I have one last point, about the way in which the IGC will be working.
I am sure, Mr President, that I will have your agreement on this point.
Lack of transparency, silence and the strategy of evasion cannot be the way in which the IGC operates.
In order to work and to make progress in the right direction, you need the support of Parliament, and you will need a debate, of which there will be an official record, not just the evasive statements organised by journalists.
Consequently, Mr President, I would ask you when and how all these elements will be explained in detail, because they are elements which are vital to the working method of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, the Greek Presidency of the Council has managed to do good work under tragic international circumstances and in an economically and politically unpromising climate.
For that reason, I too should like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council.
Much has been achieved in many areas, but the Presidency of the Council will, of course, be best remembered for the kick-off of the final decision on the constitutional treaty.
I hope that this will result in an Intergovernmental Conference that will decide to sign a treaty that is actually based on the Convention's conclusions.
Not only was the method of the Convention a sound choice, the leading triumvirate was one too, and it is fortunate that the Convention's ordinary members have also added value in a significant manner.
Anyone taking part in European debates nowadays is mainly faced with criticism, and I admit that we are keen to join in.
What we agree on is something that we believe to be already as good as established, something we believe to be very much a matter of course and for which we have been asking for a long time.
As regards the things that we think are less successful, we hope that they can still be rectified, obviously in the direction we indicate.
We should not overlook the fact that there is still to be an IGC, and that we still need to convince the public.
We should therefore not be tempted only to focus on our minor or major disappointments, but rather look at the whole picture and, with a sense of balance, point at the increased opportunities for transparency and at the Union's decisive policy.
Despite this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too should very much like to know whether the mandate which the Convention has with regard to Part III still leaves enough room for the Convention to file down a few layers of the remaining veto rights, whether the Convention now has the authority or not to change anything to Part IV and whether the European Council actually believes itself that the Union can hold out beyond the period of the next financial perspectives to work with the current financing mechanism.
I am really happy today to be a Christian Democrat; not because we are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary, but mainly because our ideology takes as its starting point the need to believe in people.
You cannot rely on structures alone.
The structures with which the Convention provides us will not, on their own, enable us to move mountains.
We will therefore need to rely on responsible people, and I hope that there are many of those left in Europe.
Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, in common with many others, I wish to thank the Greek Presidency for fulfilling its responsibilities so well during a difficult period.
For me, the high point of this Presidency was the signing of the accession treaties on 16 April.
It is an historic event, meaning that our divided Europe has come to an end.
The future entails not only a more peaceful Europe but also a more democratic one.
I must just say a few words about the Lisbon strategy.
A great deal has been done during the Greek Presidency, for example on coordinating the economic and employment guidelines and the social process, something that I applaud.
You also listened constructively to Parliament's points of view on the employment guidelines.
In particular, you took account of what Parliament had to say on the matters relating to equality between men and women.
I also want to commend you for the pensions strategy put forward during your Presidency, which I believe strikes a sound balance between economic and social aspects.
That is important now that we have to review our pensions systems throughout Europe.
I regret the handling of one issue, namely sustainable development.
Sustainable development is as yet still only a matter of words, and we have not done very much to give more specific content to sustainable development, for example in the form of indicators.
I also regret that we did not succeed in reaching an agreement on the matter of staffing companies.
When it comes to the Convention, I agree with what many others have already said, namely that it has been a success, partly due to its content and partly due to the way in which the work has been done.
As Mrs BerÃšs said, this must now be followed up at the Intergovernmental Conference too, and Parliament must be involved in the ongoing handling of the issue so that the transparency that has now been achieved can be maintained.
When, finally, it comes to asylum and refugee policy, I welcome the fact that the proposal for protection zones was removed.
At the same time, I regret, however, that we have still not obtained a common asylum and refugee policy with common minimum rules.
In the future, we need a common asylum and refugee policy based upon generosity and humanity.
Mr President, even applying the principle that nothing is ever perfect in life, I have to say that I have difficulty in imagining a better Presidency than that which is coming to an end today.
The Greek Presidency has succeeded in combining the major themes, already widely addressed - such as enlargement, supporting the Convention and establishing a very balanced, wise position in foreign policy - with everyday issues which are important for the citizens of Europe.
Over these past six months, a relatively short time, we have brought a number of extremely important dossiers to a conclusion.
We have made progress in financial dossiers, closed the energy dossier and implemented and extended major programmes such as Erasmus and eLearning: I therefore endorse your work.
I can see only one flaw: the conclusion of the position on agriculture.
I am fully aware of the macroeconomic situation; I am fully aware of the need for the European Union to adopt a clear foreign policy with regard to the developing countries too.
Nevertheless, the conclusion of the agriculture package last week is causing me some concern, for, in actual fact, we have instigated a process of dismantling our continent's primary sector and we have, in reality, started to destroy the one genuine policy which has allowed the European Union to claim the title of Union thus far.
I hope that there will be a rethink once Cancun is over, for, otherwise, Commissioner Fischler's position, promoted by the Agriculture Council, will affect what is not just a key sector for the economy but, most importantly, a key sector for consumers.
In other words, we ask farmers for investment and commitments to safeguard the quality of foodstuffs and then we dismantle the various measures protecting the sector: this is a policy which I really cannot understand.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Services Action Plan has been fast-tracked, the accession treaties signed - bringing the reunification of Europe one step closer - the Balkan Initiative launched and the first two parts of the draft constitution presented.
Nevertheless, in the last few weeks we have been forced to recognise that where the war in Iraq was concerned personal vanity and national egoism proved to be stronger than the aim of a common foreign policy and that as a result we did not play a part in the 'war or peace' decision.
We succeed when we act as a Community; we fail when we reduce Europe to the level of an intergovernmental enterprise.
Acting as a Community means not having a national veto with the system of unanimity, but having greater public participation with qualified double majorities.
The internal market will become a domestic market for 25 only when they all have the euro as their currency and Parliament is given a right to codecision on tax issues that are relevant to the internal market.
The EU foreign minister will be more than an important and necessary job title only if we have codecision for foreign policy.
Europe is more than the sum of its parts.
Europe is more than the sum of the governments.
All of us are Europe!
Each individual carries a degree of responsibility for the future of the whole.
This way of seeing ourselves is however not yet a reality but still a dream, and that is why I propose that we do not move on to the agenda but have a more in-depth round of communication, information and social dialogue about the results of the last six months.
That is also why I call for us to continue to apply the characteristics of the Convention - transparency, proximity to the people and democratisation.
The Convention itself fostered this and that is why I think that a public opinion poll on the result of the Intergovernmental Conference would call for regions, nations and members of the public to be directly involved.
It would give domestic policy a European dimension, it would make national movements European ones ahead of the forthcoming European elections, and it would inform the public that we are all part of Europe and successfully active in it.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on just one point in your debate today.
You mentioned it in only one sentence.
I should like to say something about the Balkans and south-eastern Europe.
I very much welcomed your initiative and I am also delighted that the Thessaloniki paper, that was prepared together with the Commission, has been adopted, because it contains much of what Parliament has demanded.
Obviously I now hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that as an ordinary Member of the Council you will work together with the new Council Presidency to implement its content.
We are still waiting for it to be implemented in the countries of the Balkans.
It would be nice if the EU and the Council could actually agree to implement the decisions that they make in papers of this kind.
This involves, for example, opening up education and youth programmes to the young people of these countries, which sends out an extremely important signal to them.
It also involves annual reports on progress in the individual States, and the reinforcement of the twinning programme so as to modernise the administrative structures in these countries and make them ready for the accession that they have, of course, been promised.
We expect there to be more cooperation in the region, particularly between Greece and Italy and these countries, on human trafficking and cross-border crime.
We also hope that you will perhaps consider, together with your colleagues in the Council and the Commission, easing the visa requirements in a number of fields and for particular professions, so that people are able to gain faster entry to the European Union.
I very much hope that positive progress is made when we start, as we are now doing, to initiate discussions between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians.
I would be very pleased if you, as a country bordering the Balkans, could help to move this forward.
I very much hope that the Serb, Roma and Ashkali refugees will at last be able to return to Kosovo so that the conditions can be put in place to enable them to live there side by side.
I think that the Council and the Commission need to step up the pressure on the Albanians in Kosovo in this regard.
We did not wage a war to have a situation today that is not wholly dissimilar to the unpleasant state of affairs that we have seen there over the last ten years.
I believe that we need to be more deeply committed, because of course we want these countries to return to stability and peace.
That is also the case in Serbia and I would urge you to use your influence to stop the Serbian Government continuing to gag journalists, as it is now doing.
Media freedom in Serbia is under threat.
Please give your word.
Do not tolerate it!
Otherwise, thank you very much for your commitment.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the statement issued by the Thessaloniki Summit on the European Union's security policy was an important step towards a common European Security and Defence Policy.
The United States have set out their security policy in clear terms, and it guides their actions on a day-to-day basis.
A constructive response to it from the European Union is overdue and necessary.
The paper tabled here is the beginning of a joint reply of this kind.
If we take a closer look at it, we see that when it comes to analysing new threats in the world, joint statements are made that are extremely detailed and also completely accurate.
But when it comes to defining the answers to them and saying what now needs to be done, we see that the system of unanimity makes it extremely difficult to come up with a coherent statement.
That is why this paper can only be a beginning, a beginning with important statements.
Nevertheless, we need a broad debate about this in the European Union, including in Parliament, so as to gradually formulate a common security strategy.
We need clearer statements on our relations with NATO, on our relations with the United Nations, and on the roles that Russia and also Turkey will play in this security concept, and we need a clearer mandate - this too is addressed to the Intergovernmental Conference - for the arms agency that is now being proposed.
Above all, however, we need a step-by-step plan.
We have seen that the European Union has only ever carried out projects successfully when it has first had a plan setting out clear tasks and deadlines.
Our job now is to formulate a more precise strategy of this kind for the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your comments and thoughts.
Your many, very many positive criticisms fill all of us who participated in the Greek Presidency with great joy.
Of the comments expressed, I shall pick out two or three issues.
The first core issue to which you referred was the issue of the new Constitutional Treaty and the Convention.
Ladies and gentlemen, as President-in-Office of the European Union, I visited the 24 Member States for the first time in order to prepare the summit in Halkidiki and to help so that the Constitutional Convention could finish its work.
I thought I knew Europe well.
However, I found that there are significant differences, not only social and political differences, of course, which were visible and known, but also as regards the perception of the issues of the European Union, the progress of Europe and European cooperation.
There were countries which have a completely different perception of the Presidency from the perception all of you have and from what is happening or has happened in past years.
I do not believe that we can find a solution to European issues unless we take account of these differences and try to find compromises.
The new Member States in central Europe are living with the past, a past of repression by the Soviet Union.
They are living with the fear of similar developments, they want to pay great attention to relations between the European Union and Russia, they set particular store by security issues, cooperation and participation in ????.
We also know that the old countries in the European Union now have a different perspective, because they have seen that the European Union has overcome these problems.
Therefore, compromises are needed on all issues.
And a number of steps - either big or small - need to be taken.
Besides, we cannot achieve the objectives we would like right from the start, the objectives, for example, of a Union which operates to a federal standard, with advanced central policies, a Union which has a uniform foreign policy without difficulties on all the issues etc.
On the basis of these conclusions, I want to repeat that the compromise contained in the Convention's text is a good compromise.
A good compromise, a good basis for further discussions, which will take place at the Intergovernmental Conference.
The issues of the Intergovernmental Conference will be resolved by the Italian Presidency, which will convene it, as agreed in Halkidiki, during October.
That is also where the answers will be given about the participation of the European Parliament and the working method.
That brings me to the question of what the technical issues mean in relation to the third chapter of the Constitutional Treaty.
As we remember, the European Council decided that the work of the Convention should be completed by June and it insisted on this, as did the summit in March and the extraordinary informal summit held in Athens for that reason.
We therefore said in Halkidiki that, as there is this decision, the Convention should not continue its work by changing this text or this compromise which was presented.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing said that the third chapter needs to be brought into line with the two previous chapters, that the method of expression or form of the third chapter are a method of expression and a form that need correction, which is why it was decided to extend the Convention, so that the work could continue within the framework of what had been agreed, on the basis of what had been agreed, and the third chapter could be brought into line with the previous chapters.
Having said which, the Convention will, of course, have to decide what this harmonisation work will be, but the Council was clear that it does not want to reverse this arrangement or the compromise reached.
So I think that good work was done and the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to finish according to the timetable.
That brings me to the second issue raised, the issue of immigration.
There is misinformation here.
I was asked whether or not the single border guard had been decided or discussed.
Of course it was discussed.
The three Scandinavian countries and numerous countries of central Europe stated that, for constitutional reasons, they would not agree under any circumstances to this sort of guard and that this sort of guard is not possible.
Consequently, because the objective is not for there to be a guard, but for there to be common action and coordination, we emphasised in particular in the decision taken in Halkidiki the need for common action and coordination, and various proposals are contained in the Commission text, which is also the basis for the decision on how this coordination will be achieved.
As far as the distribution of the burden between the Member States is concerned, it exists.
However, there is an erroneous perception, that decisions will be taken so that, for example, Germany will give Italy money to deal with immigration.
That is not what it is about.
It was decided that there would be common programmes, of the Union as a whole which, because they were applied in the Mediterranean, for example, or on the Union's eastern borders, would benefit a number of countries.
This is the distribution of burdens.
The common programmes help those countries or the areas in which there is a problem, or those countries which have some special need to address the overall problem.
Similarly, as far as readmission agreements are concerned, I would like to point out, because it was said that Turkey has a readmission agreement with the Union, that it has no readmission agreement with the Union, which is why we said that the Union needs to conclude readmission agreements.
We therefore decided that there should be a series of criteria for the application of these agreements, because a country cannot cooperate with the Union and refuse to accept the return of immigrants.
I agree with all those who pointed out that this policy must also continue under the Italian Presidency, because we have taken a step, I believe an important step, but more needs to be done both on asylum and on immigration to complete that step.
The third issue which I wish to mention concerns the issue relating to Mr Solana's proposal.
Mr Wurtz commented that this proposal by Mr Solana needs to be debated and we agree entirely.
Mr Solana has undertaken to process his proposal by December and, of course, afterwards, as with Economic and Monetary Union, so too with security policy, whatever form it takes, and defence policy, we need a broad debate here in Parliament and in the Union.
I believe that Mr Solana's proposal has much to commend it.
It does not generalise, it concerns specific issues and correctly identifies the dangers.
And these dangers arise from weapons of mass destruction, because modern technology allows weapons of mass destruction to be manufactured without the technical means needed in the past.
Therefore, such weapons can also be made in other countries and prevention is needed.
Prevention does not necessarily mean that the means for military intervention must exist.
Prevention for immigration was also what was said, financing for other countries.
Prevention of terrorism is monitoring these developments, controlling trade, signing agreements governing the provision of information.
We need prevention.
We need a policy for this, so that we can stay ahead of such situations.
Mr Solana has made a proposal, a step, and I believe that we need to continue it, because Greece is convinced from the visits it made, that we need a common defence and security policy.
Mr Papayannakis said that there is continuity on major problems.
Of course there is continuity and it has never been maintained that the Greek Presidency resolved all the Union's problems.
That would be ridiculous.
In the Balkans, for example, to which one honourable Member referred, both the next Presidency and Greece, now in the capacity of a Member State of the European Union, will need to follow up the solutions found.
But, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, if there is to be a follow-up, we need to talk creatively.
And I think that the Greek Presidency, as you have confirmed in your comments, gave a creative direction to the approach to the problems.
Why, what did we want to do?
I should like to close by repeating our aspiration.
We wanted to create a stronger Europe and we followed up the Lisbon policies so that there would, for example, be a stronger Europe in the social and economic sector.
We wanted the cohesion of Europe, hence our policy on Iraq.
We wanted prospects for Europe, which is why we worked for the Constitution and the security policy.
We wanted to make Europe a world power, hence our policy for the Middle East, our policy with Russia, the USA, Japan and Canada.
I believe that we progressed and we progressed thanks to cooperation with you.
We progressed thanks to the great help of the European Commission, which submitted a series of proposals, thanks to the contribution made by Mr Prodi, and we also progressed, I believe, because something particularly positive happened during these six months: all the European countries realised that we need to progress.
We need to create.
We cannot stay put.
As long as we stay put, there is an increasing risk of our losing what we already have.
In order to keep it and to gain even more, we need to progress.
. (IT) Mr President, Prime Minister, I will be very brief, not least because, as you have rightly pointed out in the House, Mr President, you are anxious to move on to new activities.
There are two points on which I would like to focus, however, for I feel that they are particularly important and supplement the Members' speeches and Prime Minister Simitis' response.
The first point concerns immigration. I have noted that this subject has attracted the attention of a large number of Members of Parliament and I am therefore anxious to stress the long-term principles which the Commission intends to apply in this sensitive, key area.
Firstly, close, ongoing cooperation with third countries.
We cannot solve the problem of illegal immigration just by clamping down at this end: that is a sure, confirmed fact and it is the basis of our initiative, but our partners will have to cooperate responsibly in this initiative of ours.
Secondly, solidarity between Member States.
This is a problematic point because of the different perceptions, the different attitudes - which the Greek Prime Minister has already highlighted - but we must remember that, after Schengen, the issue of immigration became a European issue, which must be resolved, which can only be resolved in a European context.
We are an economic area: we have to learn to become an area of freedom and security too - there is no alternative.
Thirdly, we need to facilitate and simplify legal immigration.
Europe must continue to be a land which welcomes the stranger, but with strict regard for the law. There can be no tolerance of modern-day slave traders.
Lastly, we must not confuse rigour with inhumanity.
There must be no deviation from the pursuit of our values of equilibrium and respect: it is a question of civilisation and of European identity.
My second point is equally brief. Mr Wurtz raised the issue - most appropriately, it would appear, seeing as it was picked up on in other speeches - of relations with the United States, foreign policy and Europe's role on the world stage.
I would like to make just one point in this regard. The bilateral meeting with the United States, with President Bush, was extremely interesting and extremely friendly, and both parties outlined their positions clearly.
I was struck by one aspect, namely that where Europe is able to act in a united fashion - as Mrs Maij-Weggen said in her speech - the United States is ready to listen to us and to follow us.
I can bear witness to the way Mr Bush was impressed by our account of the economic dimension of the Union, of the number of citizens there will be following enlargement, of the nature of enlargement itself, of the way we have conducted the negotiation process with due regard for democracy - the way we have discussed with each individual country, with all the parliaments, chapter by chapter, the components, the statutes of our democracy, in order to create a genuinely shared democratic vision.
This has been and continues to be a European vision that nobody can take away from us.
This is progress. It is a way of extending democracy that we can pursue in the world.
In this regard, we are listened to with great respect, for nobody has ever carried out an experiment of this kind.
The other thing which has made a lasting impression on President Bush is the role of the euro.
So many of the issues and questions which we are addressing today derive precisely from the fact that we are starting to see the results, the effects of the euro. We expected this but many sceptics did not believe it would happen: the truth is plain to see.
When, as in the discussion with the United States, I point out that well over half of transactions with Russia and other countries are now carried out in euros - for the euro is a driving force, it can only go on to be used in sectors currently outside its scope such as energy or other sectors because we are being carried that way by the momentum - then Europe is heeded, then Europe is a genuine political entity and not only an economic entity, even though we are talking about purely economic matters.
Lastly, we were heeded when we outlined the future strategy for the Balkans, to resolve once and for all an issue to the solution of which the United States has contributed greatly, although it stopped when it reached a certain point because it could go no further.
At that point, Europe has put forward the definitive solution: it has provided the political solution, the solution which brings to a close one of the most serious issues of contemporary history.
At these times Europe is strong, when it succeeds in making its voice heard, in matters on which we stand united.
That is why the Convention must take these facts into consideration, promoting majority decision-making in order to give Europe the ability always to speak with one voice.
It is important that it has become clear and is being accepted - albeit in a light-hearted manner, with a half-smile - that neither the wisdom of Old Europe nor the youthful ardour of the United States is alone sufficient to save world peace: both are necessary.
That is why, as I see it, the guarantee of peace lies precisely in a strong, close relationship with the United States.
However, this relationship can only be maintained through dignity and strength, and we have dignity and strength only in those areas where there is no right of veto, in those areas in which we can establish our will, as happens in all other democracies.
There you are: these are the comments I wanted to make.
I would like to end by thanking Mr Simitis once again.
Sophocles' Antigone contains the sentence, '???? ????? ????????'.
I do not know if my - now hazy - memory of Greek has reproduced it accurately, but it means something very precise: that the exercise of power puts a man's nature to the test.
Mr President-in-Office - Prime Minister - your nature has passed that test with flying colours.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
I have received 6 motions for resolution on the Greek Presidency under Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
At the recent Thessaloniki Summit, certain very worrying decisions were taken on the process of European integration. The most notable of these relate to the Convention and the so-called European constitution, to confirmation of the immigration decisions taken at Seville, which aim to create a 'fortress Europe', and to the maintenance of the monetarist policies of the Stability Pact and of neoliberal objectives for reforming the labour markets and social and health services, as well as for privatising most public services.
We do not believe that the aforesaid European Constitution can serve as a basis for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for October. This conference represents a fresh qualitative leap forward in the process of integration, consolidating the fundamental bases and strands set out in the Treaty of Maastricht.
These aspects were developed later at Amsterdam, but above all at Nice, whose treaty came into force a few months ago.
The proposals for altering the European Union's institutional model are completely unacceptable, since they strengthen the federalist nature of its institutions and its domination by the major powers.
I am thinking especially of proposals to end the rotating presidency of the European Council, to elect a president according to rules which give preeminence to the larger countries, to end the practice of each country having a Commissioner, and to extend qualified majority voting at the expense of the right of veto.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to inform the House that our dear friend and former colleague, Pier Ferdinando Casini, who is now President of the Italian Camera dei Deputati, is in the official gallery.
We welcome him and look forward to working closely with the Italian Parliament ...
...in order to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference under the Italian Presidency is a success.
We also thank him for the efforts he has made for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
Mr Frans Weisglas, President of the Dutch Upper House, is also in the official gallery.
He is visiting the European Parliament in order to meet with colleagues.
We warmly welcome him and wish him every success in his contacts here.
(Applause)
Mr President, I would like to make a short statement - which I had intended to make yesterday - about events yesterday at Charles de Gaulle Airport.
I was on a flight from London to Paris with 28 other passengers, including Mrs Lynne and Baroness Nicholson.
The plane was half an hour late.
We were then told that, even though there was half an hour until the departure of the Strasbourg flight, we would be transferred to a flight five hours later.
Some of us decided not to accept this proposal and made our way to the check-in desk for the original flight, which was then closed.
At that gate I found other colleagues, including Mr Hume, who got the Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with the hard men of Ireland - but they are nothing compared to the ground staff at Paris Charles de Gaulle.
(Laughter and applause)
I then proceeded, because I wanted to talk to the pilot down the ....
(The President cut off the speaker)
.
Mr President, I do not wish to speak until Mr McMillan-Scott has finished saying what he had to say.
Mr President, I was just about to say that, contrary to some speculation, I was not arrested at this point.
We have received a number of tributes to my late friend, Mr Dankert.
He used to chair a small committee of this Parliament, in which I sat, which had as its sole motivation the achievement of the rights of this Parliament to decide where it sits.
I understand that Mr van Hulten and others are pursuing that work and I want to encourage them.
We cannot be taken seriously until the Council allows us to decide where we sit and where our staff meets.
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I just wish to say that I was one of the people who tried to take the flight.
I have always supported Strasbourg and have never voted against sitting here.
However, I have decided that I really cannot come to Strasbourg any longer.
None of us should be coming here.
If Air France cannot get its act together and get Members of the European Parliament to Strasbourg, then we have to decide for ourselves that we meet in Brussels.
It is not anti-French: it is anti-Air France.
I am asking Air France to get its act together and the President of Parliament again to appeal to Air France, to appeal to the President of France, and say that, unless something is done, every single Member of the European Parliament will be against meeting in Strasbourg.
It is just not acceptable to spend at least 12 hours travelling here and miss a whole day's work.
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I understand the frustration of my colleagues.
It arises from the fact that we are legally obliged to meet in Strasbourg 12 times a year.
The only way to change that is by a new unanimous decision of the Heads of Government.
We have perhaps an opportunity with the forthcoming IGC to do that.
There are a number of written declarations in the register on this subject, which are available for colleagues to sign.
They are not contradictory. I suggest that colleagues who feel strongly about this sign all of them.
I would draw particular attention to my own one, which envisages compensation for Strasbourg, because we are not going to get Parliament's sittings to Brussels without compensating Strasbourg.
I think it should be the Heads of Government and the European Council who should travel to Strasbourg four times a year and have their meetings here.
Mr President, at the part-session here last month I raised this very question of the problems of flying to Strasbourg.
Yesterday I left home at 7 o'clock in the morning and, because of the behaviour of Air France at Charles de Gaulle, I arrived here at 9 o'clock yesterday evening.
I could have flown to America and back in the same time!
Here is my boarding pass - but Air France would not let me on the aeroplane.
Nor would they allow nine colleagues on board and, as a result, we had to wait several more hours to get on the next plane.
Given that this is the European headquarters of the European Parliament one would have thought that every mechanism would be in place to ensure that Members get here.
That is a primary factor: that Members attend Parliament.
If the current arrangements prevent us from doing so then they should be investigated.
Two weeks ago, I was unable to attend a Commission meeting in Brussels, because the Belgian railways were on strike, and I can inform you that they are still on strike now.
Mr President, we Members of Parliament ourselves have adopted numerous provisions on liberalising air transport.
Any European airline can link any European airport with the city of Strasbourg, so I do not see any reason for criticism.
The criticism might be justified in this case, but why should it necessarily be Air France which has to link Strasbourg with the other European cities and not British Airways or, I do not know, Alitalia, Iberia or even airlines which are not what are known as national airlines.
It is true that there is a problem, but we cannot put the blame on a single airline, seeing as we are for the liberalisation of the markets.
Of course, I would like to thank the previous speaker.
I have the impression that, in this impromptu debate which you are organising, Mr President, we are mixing everything up.
First there is the transport issue, which actually comes under the heading of the rules which the European Union has provided itself with in the context of the liberalisation of air transport, which prohibits equalisations and the servicing of lines that are not necessarily, immediately and permanently profitable according to the criteria of the law of the market.
Then there is the issue of where Parliament should sit, and I do not believe that the best method of dealing with that issue is to do so during a debate such as the present one, which has been initiated by someone who, sometimes, does not seem to know which of his hats he is wearing.
I condemn this method of proceeding, and I only wish that, in this House, we were capable of mobilising our forces with the same determination and the same willingness on subjects of obvious interest to our citizens, for example tax harmonisation or the defining of minimum social conditions.
Mr President, speaking as a French MEP who has defended Strasbourg, I must say that Mr McMillan-Scott raises a real problem.
It is clear that the solution to that problem cannot, in my opinion, be to relocate everything to Brussels, thereby transforming Brussels into a sort of federal district of the European Union.
The solution lies in respect for the Treaties and in the French Government's agreeing, finally, to make the necessary investments to ensure an appropriate service for Strasbourg.
I think that, in mentioning this incident, which could have arisen just as well in the case of Brussels, and has indeed done so on some occasions - and I can confirm that, as have several other Members - our British friends have nevertheless raised a real issue which could be the subject of a complaint by the authorities of this House to the French authorities.
Having said that, the eminently symbolic nature of Strasbourg in the construction of Europe, its central position and the importance of not concentrating all the authorities of the European Union in Brussels, argue in favour of respecting the Treaties and retaining the city of Strasbourg as the venue for Parliament's sittings.
Mr President, I would simply like to point out an extravagance which is having a hard time here: the extravagance whereby an institution, however prestigious it may be, should decide unilaterally on where it should sit.
In actual fact, all the European institutions have their headquarters determined according to the principle of multi-centralism, which, although it allows the European Union to breathe, does have its price.
However, the decision on whether it would be better for Parliament to sit in Strasbourg or in Brussels does not belong to Parliament alone. Otherwise one might consider that the European Council should sit on its own somewhere, the Court of Justice somewhere else, and the Court of Auditors at a third location.
It is all the institutions together that give life to the European Union.
It is therefore not just one of those institutions, but all the institutions together, either through the Treaty or by a joint decision, that should decide on this delicate question.
I would like to see an end to this stupid notion that the institution can of itself determine the place where it carries out its work.
Mr President, I too feel that these are just excuses.
Transport problems provide an easy excuse.
We all have difficulties with transport, whether we are coming here to Strasbourg or going to Brussels.
There is ample proof of this in the statements made in this House a few months ago.
One Member saw rats everywhere, and so on ... I think that we should now stop all this and start being serious and, as Mr Bourlanges has just said, we should take the bull by the horns and respect the Treaties.
Mr President, a number of Members would have noticed that at the last Strasbourg part-session there were a number of very close votes.
It is fortunate that Mr McMillan-Scott decided to travel a day before any votes in this particular part-session, because it is my concern and the concern of many of my colleagues that the inadequacies of the transport arrangements to Strasbourg are having a direct impact on who is here to vote on certain subjects and could sway an issue in the vote in this place.
Once our accession colleagues arrive, this problem is only going to get worse because they have even worse connections to Strasbourg.
It is obviously an issue that is not going to go away.
My French colleagues who are going off for their very good lunch now should remember that this Parliament will only legitimise itself when it can choose where it sits.
I share the rapporteur's position and give my express support to the promotion sought for the proposal for a directive on the adoption and promulgation of best laboratory practices and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances, to be achieved through harmonisation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions.
As stated in the Commission's original proposal, it is important that the various Member States adopt common methodologies in this area, as well as common inspection and checking procedures.
This will facilitate communication between the various operators. It will also improve cooperation between them and opportunities for technical and scientific development.
Reason dictates that I should agree with the proposal to codify and simplify the relevant legislation.
I voted with the rapporteur, in favour of adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on the continuing application of schemes approved in 2000 for a supplementary period of four years.
It is a fact that these schemes, both the LUCAS Project (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey) and the MARS Project (Monitoring Agriculture with Remote Sensing), have contributed to a better understanding of areas and crops in the Community.
They have contributed to improving measures on land use and land cover, as well as to an understanding of the impact of rural climatic phenomena on harvests and to making yield predictions for the principal crops.
The extension of these projects should therefore be encouraged because of the good results which have been achieved and presented by the European Commission.
Mr President, the representatives of the Vlaams Blok and also the Front National have approved this report without necessarily agreeing with Mr Camre.
The European Parliament must resolutely take the lead in upholding the right of freedom of speech.
In a democracy, everyone must be free, and have the opportunity, to express their opinion on any subject, even if this opinion is felt by some to be disturbing.
Freedom of speech applies a priori to the representatives of the people.
Not only is it their right, it is also their duty to place their electorate's problems and complaints on the political agenda.
Moreover, parliamentary immunity should be interpreted as broadly as possible, because MPs are not only active in an assembly, but also in the political arena in a broad sense, such as meetings, debates and any possible political and electoral communication.
Another worrying development is that any criticism of Islam meets with legal and other actions.
Since the majority of Islamic states are not democracies, it is of particularly great importance that there should continue to be the possibility of debate within Europe on this religion's potentially totalitarian, intolerant and archaic aspects.
.
(EL) We are categorically opposed to and we condemn and are fighting against racist and fascist perceptions such as those contained in the statements made by Mr Camre, which are the cause of the request for waiver of his immunity.
The condemnable statements made by the member in question are intolerable, provocative and humiliating for a large group of religious people.
However, they were made during the performance of his duties and are part of his political activity.
Woe betide us if we end up waiving parliamentary immunity, the precise purpose of which is to safeguard the free and unimpeded expression and movement of ideas, when someone expresses views which are contrary to our own political convictions.
What is the raison d'Ãªtre of parliaments and Members of Parliament if we deny them freedom of speech in practice?
The content and the quality of the ideas expressed by individual Members of Parliament can only be judged by the people who elect them.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn Mr Camre's views, but we vigorously defend freedom of expression and everyone's right to state their opinion freely, even if we radically disagree with it.
Let us remember what Voltaire said: 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'.
That is why we are against waiving Mr Camre's immunity.
I would normally vote against waiving MEPs' immunity in connection with political statements, but I do not have a mandate to allow the European Parliament to block a lawful Danish decision.
I have voted against the recommendation by the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market not to waive Mr Camre's immunity.
It is possible to hold many opinions, both for and against the racism paragraph and freedom of expression.
Every other Danish citizen would, however, want to be brought before a court to have their case tried.
Even Members of the Danish Parliament would have their immunity waived so that their cases might be tried before the courts.
The EU enters into agreements whereby ordinary citizens may be extradited to countries other than their own, solely on suspicion.
Indeed, we would also extradite our citizens for prosecution in the United States, where the use of the death penalty cannot be ruled out.
In this situation, I find it completely unprecedented for a Danish parliamentarian to be able, on a relatively innocent matter, to hide behind a majority of the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr Camre is risking neither his life nor his freedom in a matter concerning racist statements.
At most, he is in danger of the courts' confirming the view taken by ordinary people, namely that his statements go beyond what is acceptable in terms of spreading lies and hatred concerning people from religions other than Mr Camre's own.
I am voting in favour of its being possible to prosecute Mr Camre in Denmark.
It is a sound democratic principle that a Danish court should decide whether there has been any breach of Danish law.
Important objections may be raised to Paragraph 266 b of Danish criminal law (the racism paragraph), but for as long as Paragraph 266 b is a part of Danish law, matters concerning the significance of the racism paragraph must be decided by Danish legal bodies.
It is a serious warning of the EU's growing power over the Danish legal system that an EU institution should have the power to prevent Danish courts from carrying out those tasks that fall to them under the constitution.
In line with Mr Chirac and Mr Berlusconi, Mr Camre is hiding behind an anachronistic immunity and thereby significantly helping to undermine the constitutional state that his party chairman nowadays attacks openly.
I approve of the European Commission's caution regarding the proposed length of the transitional period proposed for all vehicles, because I too consider it excessively long.
I must nevertheless congratulate the Council on its unanimous adoption of the common position in question.
Road safety has to be a top priority, and is becoming a matter of urgency in my country.
The type of improvements suggested in the European Commission's proposal must also be introduced.
Enhancing what car, bus and lorry drivers can see behind them by introducing new technologies which increase the resolution of rear-view mirrors is a measure which must surely deserve all our support and encouragement.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I was present at yesterday's sitting but forgot to sign the attendance register.
Would you please correct my mistake?
Do not worry, Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, the correction will be made.
(The Minutes were approved)
The next item is the joint debate on the following recommendations:
recommendation for second reading (A5-0202/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on genetically modified food and feed [5204/3/2003 - C5-0133/2003 - 2001/0173(COD)] (rapporteur: Mrs Scheele), and
recommendation (A5-0204/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC [15798/1/2002 - C5-0131/2003 - 2001/0180(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Trakatellis).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this draft regulation seeks to guarantee a high level of protection for human life and health, animal health and welfare and the interests of the environment and consumers in connection with genetically modified food and feed.
The high level of protection for human health and also environmental interests is achieved by means of a very demanding authorisation procedure.
This needs to be said right at the outset, because many Members continue to confuse this with health concerns in connection with the limit value for adventitious and unavoidable contamination that we will be discussing later.
If I may start with authorisation, the placing on the market of genetically modified food and feed will only be permitted after an independent and stringent assessment of their possible risks to human and animal health as well as to the environment.
In the future, the assessment will be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, while the authorisation will be granted by the Commission.
In its first reading, Parliament called for a greater degree of decentralisation.
We have had only limited success here.
One point that is important for us, and which has also been taken on board by the Council, provides that the environmental risk assessment for seed will be carried out by the Member States' authorities.
Turning to labelling, I am very pleased that the consumer-friendly system of labelling genetically modified food and feed has been accepted.
As you will remember, at this time last year we had a very controversial and also very emotional debate in this House.
I have been able - and as rapporteur this does of course make me very proud - even in the face of opposition from the largest group in this House, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to gain acceptance for a very consumer-friendly system.
At this time last year we also discussed the possibility of having a GMO-free label. I was and still am strongly opposed to this.
However, the question no longer arises in the second reading, because it was already answered in the first reading.
I should simply like to remind you once more that we know from numerous studies and surveys that a majority of European consumers want to know when foods contain genetically modified ingredients.
A further aspect of this legislation that constitutes significant progress - something that is always forgotten because of the other hotly contested points - is the labelling requirement that is imposed for the first time on genetically modified feed, particularly when you consider that a large proportion of the genetically modified organisms imported by the European Union are used as feed.
One of the most controversial issues in this debate is the question of thresholds.
Here too, I should like to correct something at the outset.
I know that it will not do any good, because the Members who repeatedly make this claim have already written their speeches, but I should nonetheless like to say this once more.
This 0.9% threshold does not relate to a conscious use of genetically modified organisms, where people might say, 'it is only labelled above 0.9%'.
It is a necessary threshold for technically unavoidable and adventitious contamination.
In its first reading, Parliament set it at 0.5%, and the Council is now proposing 0.9%.
At second reading, I have focused on the issue of coexistence, which clearly affects how we are going to retain different forms of agriculture in Europe in the future, but is also directly related to consumer choice.
I wanted European legislation to be logical; if genetically modified organisms are authorised centrally then the rules for coexistence should also be laid down centrally.
There was no majority in favour of this.
The compromise on the table, with which I am very happy, and which nearly all of the groups in this House support and which has also been endorsed by the other European institutions, is very good in my view.
Through this compromise we give the Member States the possibility of taking appropriate measures to guarantee coexistence and thus also freedom of choice for consumers in the future.
As a Member of the European Parliament, I would obviously have liked the Member States to be placed under an obligation to do this.
Unfortunately, the short time available meant that it was not possible to negotiate this.
I believe, though, that this compromise does put the onus on the Member States not just to sit back and point the finger at Brussels where this important issue is concerned, but also to fulfil their own responsibility in this respect and to protect consumers' freedom of choice.
I should like to take a few more seconds to thank Members from the other groups for their fruitful cooperation.
.
(EL) Madam President, the two regulations we are debating today add to a series of Community legislative acts on genetically modified organisms relating not only to the restricted use, but also to the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment, new foodstuffs and new ingredients and compulsory information on soya seed and genetically modified corn labels.
These regulations add a panoply of legislative arrangements, with rules on the marketing and sales of food and feed products which consist of, contain or are produced from genetically modified organisms.
In addition, consumers are given the necessary information, so that they are informed when they want to buy a product.
Thus, when a product consists of, contains or is produced from genetically modified organisms, the words that this product consists of, contains or is produced from GMOs must be written on the packaging.
The Council's common position reinforces the proposal for a regulation for which I am acting as rapporteur in connection with the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and products and the traceability of foods and feed, the European Parliament's amendment to Directive 2001/18 and the Commission proposal, particularly those provisions designed to ensure the regulation is implemented more efficiently.
Thus the Council attempts, mainly on the basis of traceability, to ensure that the market will function smoothly and to achieve a high level of consumer protection in cases where it is not possible to use analytical methods to distinguish between conventional products and products produced from GMOs, in the following ways: introduction of systems to recognise the identity of GMOs by assigning a unique identifier, a requirement for undertakings to transmit information on identity of the product, a requirement for undertakings to retain additional information for at least five years.
Consequently, I think that the fast adoption of this regulation without proceeding to the conciliation procedure with the Council is what we are asking for.
If the Council and the Commission accept just certain amendments which, I would say, make traceability and labelling requirements for genetically modified organisms slightly stricter, it will be possible to introduce rules at European level.
Similarly, as far as the question of mixed crops is concerned, I would like to emphasise that we are talking here of foods and feed, which is why we call on the European Commission to develop guidelines for the coexistence of genetically modified and conventional crops.
Finally, I think the added amendment concerning the creation of a register for the publication of technical guidelines on sampling and testing for the methods is useful, because this both reinforces transparency and helps to achieve a coordinated approach and efficient implementation of the regulation.
Fast approval of the regulation in question and of the regulation on genetically modified food and feed will ensure consumers are informed about foods and feed produced from genetically modified organisms, so that they can make an informed choice of products.
This will result in the lifting of the de facto moratorium on the approval of new GMOs and prevent a trade war with the USA, Canada, Argentina, Egypt and other countries.
I am basically of the opinion that Europe is lagging behind in these new technologies and in biotechnology, as described in the Council's conclusions and the road map and the significance of this development, with these two reports today and the vote tomorrow, will be considerable for Europe, because we are noticeably lagging behind our competitors as regards this promising technology of the twenty-first century, with adverse consequences at all levels: economic, social and even environmental.
I therefore propose that we proceed to vote for these amendments, which do not change the substance of the legislative text and, consequently, that we avoid conciliation and that we have these two regulations in force as quickly as possible.
The problem of being unable to keep up with the speed of developments in biotechnology was what basically resulted in reservations and I think that it is time the European Union moved in a positive way towards this technology.
That is the intention of these two regulations, so as to give consumers the chance to be informed and the European Union the chance to make progress at last in this technology compared with its competitors.
I think that we should proceed to vote for a text which is as close as possible to the Council's position.
.
Madam President, I am very pleased that we have now reached the final stages of the deliberations on the GM food and feed proposal - which I first presented to you almost two years ago.
The discussions have been intensive, complex and have often provoked strong emotional reactions and divided opinions.
It is now important to draw the discussions to a close.
Allow me to draw your attention to the three principal elements of the proposal.
First, it will ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health on the basis of a streamlined, efficient and more transparent authorisation procedure.
Animal feed produced from GMOs will, in future, be subject to authorisation.
The simplified procedure based on substantial equivalence will be abandoned and authorisations will be limited to a period of 10 years.
The public will have the opportunity to make comments prior to decisions and to the authorisation of products.
Second, the proposal provides consumers with what they so overwhelmingly demand - an indication of whether or not food and feed ingredients are produced from GMOs.
This will provide consumers with the freedom to choose between GM and non-GM products.
Similarly, feed produced from GMOs will have to be labelled to facilitate the freedom of choice for farmers and other operators dealing with animal feed.
Third, the proposal increases the legal certainty for operators and traders, which they need to carry out their daily business.
The common position adopted by the Council in March is both balanced and rational.
It represents a major step forward in building public confidence in the application of biotechnology to food.
I am pleased that a compromise package has been tabled to facilitate the final adoption of the proposal.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work towards arriving at this compromise package and for their willingness to ensure a balanced result as well as a timely resolution of the outstanding issues.
The compromise package includes provisions concerning the issue of coexistence between different forms of agriculture.
The Commission agrees that this is an important issue for which appropriate solutions need to be devised.
The Commission would have preferred to address coexistence separately in the context of Commissioner Fischler's current work.
However, the Commission is prepared to support the compromise package and - as outlined in the package - to develop guidelines on appropriate measures to be taken at national level.
Such guidelines are on course to be adopted by the Commission later this month.
To conclude, let me state the Commission's position on the amendments as tabled.
The Commission can adopt the compromise package, consisting of Amendments Nos 1, 7, 8, 9, and 44 to 48, provided all the other amendments are rejected.
.
Madam President, we all know that the GMO issue is a political one as well as a technical one.
As policy-makers and legislators we have a clear responsibility to provide a high level of safety for European citizens and to enable them to exercise choice.
The European Union has been building a system that allows us to base decisions on whether or not to authorise the use and release of GM products on the best available scientific and technical advice.
Once that base is secured it is then a matter of ensuring that the consumer is correctly informed so that he or she is able to choose whether or not to buy GM products.
The two proposals now being considered in second reading are important parts of the overall design of our system for dealing responsibly with GM products.
They have been fully debated inside all the political groups and different committees.
Turning to the proposal for which I am responsible, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the presidency for their efforts to finalise the proposal on labelling and traceability.
I hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to agree on the amendments to be adopted later in plenary, so that we can reach agreement on both food and feed and traceability in labelling in this part-session.
This proposal will provide an important complement to the existing regulatory framework.
You will all be aware of the difficult negotiations leading up to the adoption of the common position.
The gap between the different positions has narrowed, as many of the amendments adopted at first reading were introduced in the common position.
As was to be expected, the issue of coexistence has surfaced as the key issue at second reading of both proposals.
The new Article to be introduced into the directive under the political agreement for the proposal on food and feed will provide for a legal base under which to work.
This, linked with the forthcoming initiative from the Commission on guidelines for coexistence will provide Member States with the possibility of implementing appropriate measures to deal with coexistence.
In terms of the key issues, the Commission can support the amendments that provide clarification of the common position. These include Amendment Nos 1, 3, 4, 18, 24, 26 and 27, as well as the second part of Amendment No 17, and the first parts of Amendment Nos 8 and 13.
Conversely, Amendment Nos 22, 23, 25, and 28 seek to introduce texts on coexistence that are identical to that which would be laid down in Directive 2001/18/EC and the regulation on GM food and feed.
The Commission considers this to be duplication but we could accept it.
The remaining amendments, the majority of which are retabled from first reading, cannot be supported.
Amendment Nos 2, 9, 10, 14 and 15 refer to exemptions via thresholds.
Acceptance of these amendments would undermine the political agreement reached on the proposal on GM food and feed.
As I have previously said, consistency and coherence between the two proposals must be ensured.
In addition, the first part of Amendment No 15 seeks to reinstate national provisions for traceability under Directive 2001/18/EC.
To accept this would only create legal uncertainty, given that the proposal on the table will provide Community rules for traceability as well as labelling.
Amendment No 7 refers to the 'may contain' clause for food and feed products in the original Commission proposal.
This was also the subject of a very difficult debate and to reopen it now would have serious consequences for the operability of our system and the forthcoming WTO Panel.
Amendment No 6, which refers to the definition of the placing on the market, was also subject to considerable debate in the Council, following adoption of the same amendment at first reading.
The wording of this amendment was included in the common position via reference to the full definition of placing on the market from Directive 2001/18/EC.
The Commission cannot support further amendment of this definition particularly as the tabled amendment would contradict definitions already laid down in Community legislation.
Amendment Nos 5 and 29 refer to the precautionary principle.
I would point out that the Council addressed this amendment in the common position as supported by the Commission.
