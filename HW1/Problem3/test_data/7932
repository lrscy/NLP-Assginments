MrÂ Bonde, we are not proposing to get you out of the mess in which you have buried yourself.
The majority of this Parliament will not give you a helping hand; you must manage it yourself.
In May, when the new Commissioners arrive, you are welcome to propose that all ten be promptly sent back home, and then you will be exposed as fools before the European public for having abused this instrument of the no-confidence motion for purely party political purposes.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the vast majority of my group does not support this initiative of a motion of censure on the Commission.
We think it is inappropriate, because voting for the resignation of the Commission every time that bad management problems are discovered and recognised is quite excessive.
As well as individual disciplinary measures, what we need to do is to increase the independence, powers and resources of OLAF and give the Commission as a whole the human and financial resources to fulfil its tasks.
The reforms undertaken by the Commission aim to do this, as the Commissioner has just said, and the European Parliament has made specific recommendations in several resolutions, which we are waiting to see implemented.
In the historic period that is beginning of a Union of twenty-five, in which we need to succeed with enlargement, our group thinks that we need a competent European executive and civil service which is subject to permanent democratic monitoring by Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have attempted to apportion the blame for what happened, but it has not been possible.
In our opinion, no one believes they are to blame for anything at all.
This was the conclusion of the report, submitted by the so-called Committee of Wise Men in March 1999, into the problems of the earlier Santer Commission.
The same can be said of the Eurostat scandal.
All the defence mechanisms have been set in motion.
Commissioner Solbes is not to blame because he does not read newspapers.
Commissioner Kinnock is not to blame because he was not listening when Mr Blak told him what Mrs Schmidt Brown had said.
Commissioner Schreyer was not to blame because she does not read audit reports, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, is not at all to blame because he obviously ensured that no information got through to him either from the European Parliament or the press, and if you do not know about something you cannot be to blame for it, as Mr Prodi says.
The only thing one might wonder is how people with so little ability to perceive what is going on around them have come to be so high up.
The truth is, of course, that they had known what was going on at Eurostat for at least a year, but they kept under wraps something that should not have been kept under wraps.
You could call it misplaced loyalty to a corrupt system.
You could call it nepotism.
Whatever you call it, it is not worthy of an inter-European institution.
That is why we want to establish who is to blame, but the system is designed to prevent us from doing so.
In a normal democracy, critics within a parliament can move a vote of censure.
This occasionally happens in our Member States.
If a government has a solid majority, it will be fairly indifferent.
A government that wins a vote of censure generally comes out of the vote stronger.
In this case, the Commission is certain to win, because the majority here in Parliament do not wish blame to be apportioned, and those of us tabling this motion of censure know that we will lose.
Nonetheless, those loyal to the Commission have been busy preventing us from holding this debate and the subsequent vote at all.
Signatures have been placed under suspicion and removed for no objective reason, and Members have been pressurised into withdrawing their signatures.
That is not true parliamentarianism.
There is something rotten permeating the entire issue of Eurostat, and a majority in Parliament do not want to contribute to apportioning the blame.
I recommend that Members vote in favour of our motion of censure.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start with a question for Mrs GrossetÃªte, Mr Kuhne and Mrs Reding: who is politically responsible for the Eurostat scandal?
Over 100 Members of the European Parliament signed a motion of censure against the Commission, but one in three was pressurised into withdrawing his or her signature.
The die-hards now include some Members who may lose their places on important committees or in delegations.
Members of this Parliament will be punished by their groups for supporting the simple principle of the responsibility of ministers and Commissioners for their conduct in office.
Parliamentâs highly politicised administration is no longer there solely to serve its Members.
Not content with checking the authenticity of the signatures and counting them, it has cooperated with the groups in getting Members to withdraw their signatures.
It has even refused to accept confirmation sent by fax and quite obviously genuine signatures in order to stifle or stave off the debate on censure.
Do we also have to verify the signatures on the attendance lists by means of handwritten original letters?
Imagine if all the group chairmen were as keen to penalise the people in the Commission who have had their hands in the till, or those covering up for the thieves.
Nothing is, however, so bad that there is not some good in it somewhere.
The compromise text on Eurostat contains the fiercest criticism to date of the Commissionâs financial management.
It still does not apportion direct responsibility, however, and we are thus weakening those in the Commission who are working to bring about honest accounting and transparency.
We are backing up those who say that approving the accounts is just parliamentary chit-chat, that it does not mean anything and that we can carry on swindling people.
EURÂ 8Â billion disappears from our budget every year.
It is taxpayersâ money, and we have been elected to this Parliament in order to represent taxpayers.
Consequently, we must call upon the Commission to apportion the blame itself by 12 noon on Tuesday 4Â May.
Otherwise, we shall vote on the motion of censure.
I should like to thank the more than 100 members who are signatories.
There may be more of us watchdogs after the elections.
I should like to thank you, Mr President, and to the person who said that this was electioneering I would point out that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have attempted to apportion political responsibility for this from the very first day the scandal came to light.
Â Â  Mr President, in order to fully justify the proposal for a motion of censure on the European Commission that I co-signed, all I need to do is to refer to the report that the European Parliament itself adopted by a very large majority on 29 January, on the measures taken by the Commission to follow up our observations on the discharge of the 2001 budget, particularly regarding the Eurostat affair.
The assessment made by that resolution is damning.
What is more serious is not so much the Eurostat affair itself because, after all, misappropriation can affect any body, but rather the monitoring failures that it revealed, and, above all, the inability of the Commission to convincingly put things right.
Our resolution of 29 January, which I remind you again was adopted by the European Parliament, criticised the culture of secrecy and lack of transparency in the Commission, the poor internal communication of information, the fact that it was extremely slow and reticent in submitting audit reports to the European Parliament, and the fact that the Commissioners were shirking their political responsibilities.
The last of these characteristics seems to be even more true now, as the Commission no longer accepts any responsibility for this affair and Mr Prodi, who did not even come to our debate this evening, seems to be more interested in the electoral campaign in Italy.
This is why Members must take on their own responsibility today as elected representatives of the people of Europe, the taxpayers of Europe.
I congratulate the sixty-six other co-signatories to this motion, led by Mr Bonde and MrÂ Heaton-Harris, who had the courage and clarity to resist all the pressure.
I would like to say this to Members who are hesitating to vote in favour of the motion of censure: by defending the Commission, as Mrs GrossetÃªte just did, whether you like it or not, you will be covering up unacceptable behaviour and providing a very poor service to the European institutions.
The way to provide a good service to the European institutions is to make the Commission understand that it is not superior, that it is a body like all the other bodies, which has to give in to the higher control of the European Parliament and the Member States.
Â Â  Two colleagues have made reference to the question of signatures and implicitly suggest some kind of foul deeds behind the scenes.
As far as I know, the motion of censure is on the European Commission and not on the services of the European Parliament.
Let me make it clear that while it is argued by some that there are 100 signatories, I have a duty of care as President, under the Rules of Procedure, to establish and verify who has signed and who stands over the signature.
In the fulfilment of that duty of care and in instructing the staff to follow that duty of care on our behalf, I take the responsibility.
So if you have a problem about what is going on behind the scenes, talk to me.
On my watch we will do it the right way or we will not do it all.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the reason for the motion of censure, its signatories argue, is the scandal and the irregularities which have taken place in Eurostat.
Everybody is aware that for some time we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have been working very hard to try to clarify this issue and resolve the problems stemming from it.
It is true that the Commission took a long time to react, but it finally did so and implemented an in-depth reform and, so far, we believe that the results are satisfactory.
It is true that the case is not closed, since a judicial procedure is underway.
The majority of the political groups have therefore prepared a resolution which will be voted on during tomorrowâs sitting, precisely because we are still concerned about such an enormously important issue as fraud in Eurostat.
We do not believe this issue to be closed, and we believe we must monitor events very closely in order to prevent any repeat of it in the future, either in Eurostat or in any other Commission body.
The resolution various groups will table tomorrow makes it very clear that Parliament is vigilant, is carrying out its duty and is exercising the control conferred on it by the Treaty as a fundamental Community institution throughout the procedure.
There is no justification for this motion; it is a purely electoral issue for the signatories, who have in common, amongst many other things, their anti-European sentiment and militancy, their Euroscepticism and their constant campaign against the European institutions.
We therefore believe that this motion is inappropriate.
We in the European Parliament do our work, we have done so seriously and rigorously, and we are going to continue to do so, and we do not believe that a group of Members who call themselves anti-European and Eurosceptic are the right people to defend the transparency and smooth functioning of the European institutions.
In our work, we have often insisted that it is necessary to trust in the control of the Commissionâs management, as we have done this morning, while making it clear that we are still concerned about the problem of Eurostat, and we therefore believe it is entirely inappropriate for small groups in this House - whose record and approach in relation to this issue have been very well-known from the outset and have never changed - to try to use this issue for electoral party political ends.
They have taken no notice of explanations or solutions, nor any type of suggestion.
The position of the People's Group is very clear and we will continue to work to ensure the openness and transparency of the European institutions and also to strengthen them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the document that we are discussing appears to be more like an election manifesto than a parliamentary mechanism.
Furthermore, the fact that this was drawn up and signed by minorities known for being anti-Europeanist quite clearly exposes this intention.
This is confirmation that, in making Parliamentâs work more frenzied, the run-up to the elections is inspiring initiatives such as the one that we are dealing with this evening.
The Eurostat affair is once again being discussed by some of our fellow Members to bring general discredit to the European institutions and, in particular, to the Commission and its President.
My fellow Members who signed this document know that the Eurostat affair has been â and still is being â continuously and thoroughly tracked by this Parliament and will be the subject of an umpteenth resolution in this sitting too.
The bad faith concerning this affair is clear to see when nothing is said about the specific measures adopted by the Commission and, more generally, about the reforms implemented in order to achieve the good governance that we want to inspire all the European Unionâs institutions, a process followedstep by step by this Parliament and by its Committee on Budgetary Control too, and mentioned here by Commissioner Reding.
Of course, it is easy to stir up scandal about particular issues in order to try to grab the attention of the public, which is often ill informed about politics and the European institutions.
It is more difficult to give Europe a political dimension, starting with adopting a real constitution.
Having said that, as a representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, it is a matter of pride to me that no one in my group signed this motion.
The support of the British Conservatives once again clearly shows the untenable association of this group with the European Peopleâs Party tradition, so well represented by MrsÂ GrossetÃªte and also by MrsÂ AvilÃ©s Perea.
Among the signatories, I then notice many Members from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, in which the representatives of the Italian stand out in particular.
It seems to me that this position contrasts somewhat with the role that the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, MrÂ Fini, played in the work of the Convention.
This is perhaps why MrsÂ Muscardini wisely withdrew her signature.
If the Members of her delegation were to follow her example, moreover, that would even cast doubt on the safety of the 66 signatures announced by the President this evening, without even mentioning the so-called âtechnical signaturesâ, which should not turn into votes in favour either.
There is, however, another key to interpreting the true intentions lurking behind those who tabled this motion, and it is the one given by the Vice-President of Italyâs Senate, MrÂ Calderoli, chief representative of the He claimed that, in actual fact, the signatories are secret supporters of MrÂ Prodi.
Indeed, this Parliamentâs trust in the President of the Commission would be strengthened and his prestige increased as a result of this motion, which will certainly be rejected.
If this is true, though, what is to be said then about MrÂ Speroni, a member of the same party as Mr Calderoli?
Is he aware of being converted into one of the most fervent supporters of the European Commission?
If things are really like this and we look at the motion of censure in this light, then I believe that all of the group of signatories have something to think about.
Â Â  MrÂ President, different assessments can, of course, be made as to whether the Commissionâs action is so serious as to require a motion of censure, and I can therefore respect a contribution as objective as that of MrÂ Jonckheer.
When, however, I listened to MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, MrÂ Kuhne etc., I was reminded of when, in the Eighties, I visited the Supreme Soviet in Moscow where all critics were held up to ridicule, condemned and accused of being anti-Soviet and traitors.
Is that the way in which you are to defend your EU project?
Is it to be done by means of accusations and ridicule, through the harassment of whistleblowers and by setting the police on investigative journalists?
Have you not noticed that the project is suffering from a crisis of confidence due to the lack of transparency and democratic legitimacy?
We are attempting to use a classic parliamentary tool to monitor the executive.
You may have a different view but, when you ridicule us, run us down and call us anti-Europeans, you undermine the democratic legitimacy of your own project.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the end, and almost too late, I agreed to add my name to this motion of censure on the Commission regarding the Eurostataffair.
Quite frankly, I do not feel that I am either illiterate or, even less so, an anti-Europeanist, nor do I believe that I can be blamed for bringing the Commission into disrepute; if anything it did that on its own.
At the end of the day, we were practically forced into this extreme measure by the Commissionâs indifference and perfunctory attitude towards Parliament, because â and I want to mention this â this is not an impromptu move.
For more than a year, there have been hundreds of questions and a large body of parliamentary work behind this extreme move.
In any case, we expected the Commission to act less like Pontius Pilate; this is what we expected and, I believe, what we deserved since, after all, we are the only institution that has genuine popular legitimacy.
I do not want to go back over the many questions to which adequate responses were not given, or the good proposals stated by the Commission for the future.
Once again, however, I would like to comment on the organisation involved, that is to say Eurostat It is worth remembering that Eurostatdoes not deal with generating interesting and harmless statistics.
Eurostatis an institution which, through its surveying and statistical work, is in fact the guarantor of the Stability and Growth Pact: it monitors the application of the Maastricht criteria.
It is, therefore, involved in setting out the economic and financial policies of the Member States and, indeed, in making Member States adopt strict policies that often entail budget and welfare cutbacks.
It is, therefore, an institution that has a monitoring role, and its impartiality and authoritativeness must not be even slightly scarred by the doubts and suspicions that hang over Eurostat today.
I am, therefore, sorry, Commissioner Reding, but the Eurostat affair cannot be crossed off as a deplorable exception.
We realise that the affair is embarrassing, it is for me too, but I believe it is the citizens that are calling for this not to be tolerated, the same people whom we are asking to make sacrifices in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I do not want to give lessons in democracy to anyone â God forbid â but I would like to quietly mention that democracy is based on the rights of minorities to express their opinion.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that this evening we are experiencing a real parody, a mockery of democracy.
Every week we issue resolution after resolution, giving lectures in democracy, transparency, human rights and whatever else, to the whole world, and we are not capable of organising a debate, worthy of a Parliament deserving of that name, on censure, which in all of our democracies, is an important moment in political, democratic and parliamentary life.
It is said that we can only make our mark by opposing.
This is how the national parliaments have been created throughout history, generally against the arbitrary nature of executive powers.
That is not the case here.
Think about it, if you will, Mrs GrossetÃªte, that is not the case here.
The executive and legislative powers are thick as thieves, dodging the truth, like in the famous Vermeer painting, in view of the onlookers, European citizens.
I admit that you have impressed me in this exercise, MrsÂ GrossetÃªte.
I am talking about dodging the truth, about dishonesty, and I would even say that you reminded me somewhat of Vichinsky pleading before the Soviet Parliament.
The proximity of the elections may exacerbate peopleâs attitudes, that is quite natural for a democrat: the elections are not a difficult time to get through, as you seem to think.
We spent an hour this morning, Mr President, an hour, and we also did so in the last sitting, pushing and shoving each other out of the way for reasons which, personally, entirely escape me.
Is that the type of democracy that you want to set an example for?
We spent an hour this morning and we will definitely spend two or three hours tomorrow morning debating an obscure manoeuvre of Italian internal policy.
Is that the democracy that you are talking about?
You should recognise, Mrs GrossetÃªte, that it would be at least paradoxical for this Parliament which, I repeat, gives lectures to the whole world, to act like a frightened virgin when it comes to exercising the only power that it has: monitoring and censuring the European Commission when it has made a mistake.
Â Â  MrÂ President, senator Calderoli is right in saying that our real intention was to help President Prodi.
We wanted to prevent him from ending this European affair in the shameful role of someone who is as slippery as an eel when faced with questions and demands posed by different newspapers â and we would have thought that he would have had the decency to be present in this House to discuss this issue â whilst one of the people who exposed the information is being investigated, as in the good old days of the communist police, and his files are confiscated because he dares to investigate European fraud and Eurostat.
The scandal concerns a body of the European institutions that deals with funds and sensitive data, and this makes it a serious fact.
The Eurostat dossier has compromised the image of the European Commission and its President, who â in our opinion â would do well to draw from it the necessary consequences.
What we really must ask ourselves in this situation is what type of hidden connections of solidarity â in Italy we would say somewhat mafia-like â prevented the Commission from lancing the pustulent boil that is EurostatI would welcome an answer.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the May part-session.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on four reports produced on behalf of the European Parliamentâs Delegation to the Conciliation Committee:
â A5-0242/2004 by Mr Jarzembowski, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways (PE-CONS 3641/2004 - C5-0156/2004 - 2002/0025(COD));
â A5-0245/2004 by Mr Sterckx, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (Railway Safety Directive) (PE-CONS 3638/2004 â C5-0153/2004 - 2002/0022(COD));
â A5-0243/2004 by Mrs Ainardi, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and Directive 2001/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system (PE-CONS 3639/2004 â C5-0154/2004 â 2002/0023(COD)); and
â A5-0244/2004 by Mr Savary, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Railway Agency (âAgency Regulationâ) (PE-CONS 3640/2004 â C5-0155/2004 â 2002/0024(COD)).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the second railways package we wanted to provide a strong impetus for the construction of an integrated, competitive and safe European rail network.
Now we are at the end of more than two years of intensive work, and I think that the result is very good.
I would like to highlight the essential contribution that the European Parliament has made to the four texts that make up this second rail package.
I would particularly like to thank the four rapporteurs, Mrs Ainardi, MrÂ Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary, for the considerable work that they have done and I would also like to thank their colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have closely monitored this matter.
My thanks also go to Parliamentâs delegation to the Conciliation Committee and, in particular, its Chair, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, who reached an agreement with the Council at the final conciliation meeting on 16 March, a compromise which we consider to be very balanced.
This second package of measures opens up new possibilities for development for rail transport in the enlarged European Union, and I therefore hope that Parliament will adopt the results of the conciliation and therefore give the definitive green light for implementing these texts.
From that point onwards, I can assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to establish the European Railway Agency as quickly as possible.
Allow me to give you a few thoughts on future work in the railway sector.
When examining these texts in the second railway package, Parliament wished to highlight the importance that it attaches to opening up the passenger transport market.
The Commission itself indicated in the White Paper in September 2001 that proposals would be made.
This is why it adopted a series of proposals on 7Â March regarding opening up the market for international passenger rail transport services from 2010, and also regarding passenger rights.
These texts are accompanied by a significant proposal for a directive on certifying locomotive drivers and crew and a proposal for a regulation on contractual quality clauses for rail freight.
It will of course be up to the new Parliament elected in June to examine these new proposals.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner â Viviane â ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that it is now a little late and there are hardly any spectators present â apart from a well-known representative of a railway company â I will be brief.
I think that Parliament can be proud that we have overcome the hesitant position of the Council with the results of the conciliation procedure on the second railway package and have created a new, practical European dimension for the development of railway companies in the Union.
With the amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC, all railway companies will now be given non-discriminatory access to the rail networks of all the Member States for cross-border freight traffic as of 1 January 2006 and â this is Parliamentâs achievement â for freight traffic within them as early as 1 January 2007.
At the same time, the Commission, Parliament and the Council recommend an opening up of the network also for cross-border passenger traffic for the year 2010.
Commissioner, we are grateful to you for the third railway package, as put before us by the Commission.
I personally am not sure whether it is necessary to regulate quality control for freight services â which I believe should be left to the market â and compensation for delays and so on in railway transport â aviation is rather different from railways.
However, we will do this in the next round.
In any event, we are in favour of the opening up of passenger traffic, on which we agree, Commissioner, and also on the fact that we need a European driving licence, so that we can have a European labour market for railway employees too.
I would like to go on to say, however, that, with the new Directive on railway safety in the Community, we will for the first time be developing a European safety standard for railways, that we will be overcoming the small-state approach to questions of safety and will in fact be introducing rules across the Union for a uniformly high level of safety for private and public railway companies.
I believe that this will be a major step towards a European internal market.
I regard Mrs Ainardiâs amendment on interoperability as important precisely because we will be able more rapidly and better to coordinate and accelerate technical specification work for rolling stock in other parts of the railway system.
Finally, I also believe that with the regulation establishing the European Railway Agency we will have created an important institution which will be committed in practice both to European safety standards and also to the rapid processing of the technical specifications for interoperability.
Let me conclude with that.
I believe that, by means of the conciliation procedure, we have created the right â that is to say, favourable â parameters for ensuring that in the railway sector too there is a European internal market and, now that we have created the parameters, it is now up to the railway companies â whether public or private, on that we are neutral â to exploit, at a high level of safety, the opportunities in the market and at the end of the day to achieve our common objective of reviving rail transport in the European Union and shifting as much freight as possible from road to rail, so that our policy can make sense both environmentally and commercially.
We have thus taken a major step towards a reasonable modal split between future transport providers and a good new opportunity for railway companies in the Union.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Sterckx was unable to remain in Strasbourg this evening, and I am speaking for him.
The objective of the new directive on railway safety is to harmonise the regulatory structure in Member States and to develop common safety targets and methods in Europe.
Harmonisation aims to reduce the number of barriers to an EU-wide railway network.
The proposal defines the main elements of common safety systems, puts in place a common system for the issue of safety certificates, as well as introducing the principle of independent technical investigations in the event of accidents.
In conciliation an agreement was reached on 10 March which was confirmed by the Parliament delegation and the Conciliation Committee on 16 March.
Under the agreement Member States agree to keep the introduction of national safety rules to a minimum. This way the objective concerning the application of just European rules gains depth.
The Commissionâs powers to scrutinise new national rules were strengthened.
It was given the power to suspend the application of a national rule if there is a serious doubt about the compatibility of the draft safety rules with the European rules. The Commission can also act if it considers that a rule constitutes arbitrary discrimination or disguised restriction in respect of rail transport operation between Member States.
The Member States will be obliged to ensure access to training facilities for train drivers and on-board safety personnel.
To allow mobility of these members of staff between railway companies, it has been agreed that train drivers, on-board safety personnel as well as ground-based infrastructure managers will have the right to have access to and obtain copies of all documents attesting to their qualifications.
This new directive is an important step towards the creation of a safe European railway system and sets out a clear regulatory structure for its gradual establishment.
The European Railway Agency, another essential part of this railway package, will play a key role in the implementation, monitoring, development and harmonisation of the system.
The agreement reached within the Conciliation Committee fully reflects Parliamentâs position at second reading.
All in all this railway package is a major step towards freeing up traffic by means of the railways.
We need our railways to be efficient and safe and to provide a high quality service.
Otherwise they will be unable to compete equally with other forms of transport.
A functional railway system will mean greater and greater benefits to the consumer and also allow us to achieve sustainable development in transport.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate this evening brings us to the end of numerous discussions and meetings regarding the future of the railways in Europe.
A package has been completed, but it is also true that we have not yet completed the necessary revitalisation of the railways.
At the end of this long and educational road, I would like to thank all my fellow rapporteurs who, despite differences of opinion, even seeing things in an entirely different way, have allowed us to work in a way that respected everyoneâs points of view.
As this discussion follows many others and closes the package, I would like to give an overall view of the proposals.
In my opinion, this package is in line with the twofold reality of European integration today.
It is also proof of the positive contribution that Europe can make to its people in order to tighten links and develop solidarity.
The same applies to the reports on interoperability and the creation of the Rail Safety Agency.
The aim of the âinteroperabilityâ directive, for which I am rapporteur, was to bring the national networks forged by history into harmony with each other in order to achieve faster, more efficient and more harmonious transport.
This is essential in order to revitalise rail transport and help international trade to flow more easily.
It means that techniques need to be made coherent and that we need to ensure that the diversity of networks does not hinder traffic or cause delays.
Considerable progress has been made in this respect and also on how we can achieve it.
To give just one example, the black box proposal, which everyone welcomes today, was suggested to me right at the start of the debates by actual railwaymen, which shows that we have everything to gain from the participation of the main people involved.
This is why, as rapporteur, I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for helping me to complete this task, and also everyone within Parliament and outside, professionals and associations, who have helped me to look in detail into these questions and gain a better grasp of the issues at stake.
This is also one of the main reasons why I welcome the report on the creation of the Rail Agency.
Representatives of the profession, and in particular of employee organisations, will be on the board of directors of the agency.
They will also have the opportunity to take part in working groups on the TSIs that affect them.
Even though I wanted other improvements, in my view these two points demonstrate what Europe can gain by trusting and giving a voice to those who keep it going day by day.
They deserve strong support from Parliament at the vote tomorrow.
I now come to the other aspect of the twofold reality that I mentioned earlier.
In my opinion, this package also reveals an ideological bias towards opening up markets and liberalisation.
The unbridled race towards ever more liberalisation is one of the sources of discontent with Europe.
The directive on opening up the networks proposes total liberalisation of freight, even though the first package has just been transposed and no serious, transparent and balanced evaluation has been conducted on its effects.
Moreover, a date for the total liberalisation of passenger rail transport has been announced, prejudging the debate, which has not yet started, on the third package.
I think we need to stop being deaf to the opposition expressed by all the rail workersâ unions in Europe.
Even on a subject as important and decisive as safety, it is being proposed to us that the first Article be amended to place opening up to competition on the same level as safety.
In my view, this is sending a bad signal.
I do not wish to repeat what, as my colleagues know, I have already said several times on this matter.
I will simply say that, on issues of such importance, with the experiences that we have had in Europe, it is worth adhering to the precautionary principle.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank all of my colleagues, firstly the rapporteurs of these four important reports, but also all my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for the very significant work which has been done on these four texts.
I think that this is a very good example of Parliament adding value to the initial Commission proposals.
We have added a considerable amount to them, which I think is positive, and in response we have had great understanding from the Commission and the Council, which means that the texts are ultimately very gratifying to us as MEPS.
I would like to go back to this package to say that, as a whole, we are very pleased with it, particularly thanks to the work of MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld in the Conciliation Committee, in particular the safety package, which was absolutely necessary as a strong political signal prior to enlargement.
I think that the date that we are reaching is not insignificant.
At a time when we want to welcome ten new countries, we have to renew a very strong safety requirement in an area, railways, in which ultimately the job is about safety.
With regard to interoperability, we know that it is one of the essential conditions for opening up the networks.
Opening up to competition would not overcome the technical barriers that still exist and which mean that, for example, the Thalys locomotive has to take on board computer equipment capable of reading the different control and operation systems on the small Thalys network.
Therefore, bringing all of this up to standard and starting on this vast project is essential for the future of the railways.
With regard to the Agency, I think that it is very important to establish a tool to enable the Commission to work on a more daily basis on implementing this major policy and major ambition for the railways.
I am personally very honoured to have been able to bring this matter to a close having made significant changes.
These include, for the first time, involvement of all the social partners â in particular, but not exclusively, the unions â in working groups and management board.
We would have liked to set an example in another area, as we think that for the Agency, the Council should stop requiring one representative per country, which now means that we have a representation of the Council of 25 members, two of which do not have rail networks.
This shows the absurdity of the system, which creates mechanisms that will very soon be unworkable, in particular when we want to push enlargement further, towards the Balkans and perhaps beyond.
I therefore hope that the commitment made by the Council and the Commission to adopt a directive in the coming years to create order within the agencies and establishing a standard model for all of them, in order to put an end to the disparities, will be respected for the purpose of better governance.
Finally, regarding access to the network, my fellow MEP Mr Jarzembowski is aware of my reluctance, not regarding opening up to competition, but the fact that it brings with it a number of requirements.
I consider that in this text, which is acceptable regarding freight, we are going to have to be careful about opening up to international passenger traffic.
In particular, what bothers me in this text is that it states that there will be an evaluation on 1 January 2006, when 1 January 2006 is the opening date.
I do not see how we can evaluate a text which will be implemented at the same time as the evaluation report.
On a more general note and to conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give you a few comments on our major objective, which is sustainable mobility, and therefore developing railways and waterways, rather than giving in to the rise in road traffic that will one day pose severe political problems.
I think that opening up, in the sense in which we see it, in other words as purely liberal, creating competition on the networks, is not the panacea.
We are currently blindly working towards that goal.
In reality, we are well aware that there is no funding for interoperability.
We are well aware that there are colossal investments to make and the financial perspectives do not respond to the request for financial resources made by Commissioner de Palacio herself in order to fund trans-European transport networks and, in particular, rail networks.
In short, I do not think that anything will be done.
Today is a step forward without the railwaymen, because there are extremely strong national cultures in these companies, that is how it is, because they are labour companies.
I think that we need to promote sectoral dialogue before issuing directives, which is what we did this time.
We need to continue in this way, but I also hope that one day we will move towards a collective railwaymenâs agreement, whether they are employed by private or public companies, so that they can own this tremendous rebirth of the railways which is of benefit to everyone who wants us to have a less polluting method of transport.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the last conciliation of this term of office was aimed at establishing a common market for railway transport, and it has been a great success, especially for Parliament.
It is, however, annoying that the Council refused to reduce the number of members of the board of the new European Railway Agency, as Parliament wanted it to.
This will indubitably lead to unnecessary bureaucracy, as explained so eloquently by MrÂ Savary here in the House and, best of all, during the negotiations.
On the European Parliamentâs side, we succeeded, however, in introducing a legally binding document whereby the Commission is to carry out a thorough review of the structure and composition of all the authorities.
Efficient management must be based upon the general European interest.
It would be a retrograde step if the view were to be taken that the greatest merit of the decision-making bodies were that they were constituted on a national basis, because that would reduce the chances of bringing about the greater efficiency that is needed.
National interests may certainly have their place, but they must definitely not reign supreme.
Parliament succeeded in bringing the liberalisation of freight services forward to 2007, thanks to MrÂ Jarzembowski.
His wording means that the Commission must seek also to liberalise passenger services in a similar way after 2010.
To ensure rail safety, all railway workers, such as train drivers, who affect rail safety must, from now on, use a generally known vocabulary and system of orders to eliminate any risk of misunderstanding.
All trains must, furthermore, be provided with black boxes similar to those on aircraft.
The railway packageâs four rapporteurs â MrÂ Jarzembowski, who was responsible for the report on the development of the Communityâs railways; MrÂ Savary, who was rapporteur for the report on a European Railway Agency; MrÂ Dirk Sterckx, who was responsible for the report on safety on the Communityâs railways; and MrsÂ Ainardi, who was responsible for the report on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system â have all helped inject life into the European railway sector.
It is necessary to develop the railway infrastructure in order to reduce the congestion on our motorways and enable us to fulfil the environmental requirements.
I wish to thank the European Parliament, together with the rapporteurs, MrÂ Jarzembowski, MrÂ Savary, MrÂ Sterckx and MrsÂ Ainardi for this important step.
A particularly worthwhile instance of progress was the fact that we succeeded in uniting all the different parties.
There was only a minor split between the parties.
We were able to maintain a more or less common front against the Council, a fact that is, of course, in large part the reason for the outcome.
The conciliation was held in a constructive spirit, and the entirely new mood we can now sense exists between Parliament and the Council found its optimum expression.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her work.
In many ways, it was easy from the start because the policy ideas were similar and ran in parallel, whereas in other aspects it was slightly more difficult, but if one is used to debating from different standpoints and if one is prepared for a compromise, then one will indeed find a good compromise.
Why do I think, as a Social Democrat, that this is a good compromise?
It is because I am constantly telling my friends that in the last few years and decades, since there was no liberalisation or opening up of the market, the railways have lost market share.
What happened was not liberalisation but scrapping.
The fact is that, on the one hand, there are heavy goods vehicles, driven more or less the length and breadth of Europe without borders.
Drivers do not have to change at the border, and the driving cabin is not changed at the border; there are, no doubt, various detailed provisions about traffic signs but they are relatively easily intelligible.
On the other hand, unfortunately, there are still national railway systems, which are separate from each other, which involve obstacles and which of course also make the railway inflexible.
For that reason, many companies which, whether we like it or not, have relied more and more on just-in-time production, have frequently found themselves forced to prefer the lorry over the railway.
Coming as I do from a country which is burdened by a massive amount of lorry transit traffic, I can only hope that there are efficient, market-oriented but still, of course, environment-oriented means of transport and for me that certainly means the railway.
Mr Jarzembowski was right to say that railways must now do something about this.
I have constantly criticised the fact that railways have taken a long time to start thinking in international and European terms.
However, I believe that today â not least because of the work of this House â the railways, and even the representatives of the employees, the trade unions, have a European orientation.
There are probably not many trade unions that are now as European-oriented as the railway unions, because they know that the future depends upon their being involved at European level.
I believe that they are also to a large extent responsible for this evolution.
The times when there were still firemen on English trains even though there were no fires left to stoke are, thank God, over and it is employee representatives who are now working, as we also see with the train drivers, very constructively on deliberately giving the railways a renaissance at European level and also enabling them to compete with the roads.
Of course, there is still much to be done.
This very week, we voted on the Cocilovo report.
It is not yet the optimum solution, but there has been some progress.
MrÂ Jarzembowski does not regard it as progress, but the good thing is that he must also sometimes make compromises, even in Hamburg in Northern Germany he must be able to make compromises.
So with any luck we will be able to find a good solution for the question of the offsetting of external costs.
For I believe that any reasonable person, any reasonable traffic expert, would say that we need both rail and road.
What is at issue is the appropriate balance.
In this period, I believe that a good compromise has emerged.
We will see what to do about passenger traffic.
I agree with Mrs Ainardi that we need to review the steps that have been taken.
Only so far, there has in fact not been much market opening, not much readiness on the part of the railway companies to accept the market.
I hope that this will now be the case to a larger extent.
I would like to thank the rapporteur warmly for her work once again.
I would also like to thank you, MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld, very much for the way in which you have chaired the conciliation committee in a purposeful and cautious manner.
This made it possible to be on a level with the Council and the Commission.
That itself, I think, is an important milestone in the development of the European railway system.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first speech to this House fifteen years ago, which I remember, took place during an evening sitting at around 11.45 p.m.
My last speech, fifteen years later, is also in the evening, before an almost equally reduced audience.
I am nevertheless pleased to be able to make this speech on this important matter of the rail package and everything that it implies.
I would like once again to say on behalf of my group and also personally that we think it is very important to maintain and particularly to develop a quality, tight, diverse, secure European rail network, providing a public service to all the citizens of Europe and contributing to a balanced use of land in Europe.
In our view, the rail package and what underlies it are an example of a Europe that we no longer want, a Europe which has given priority to free competition, very often over any other consideration.
It is true that thanks to the fight by the unions in the sector and by a party in Parliament, not forgetting the real pressure of public opinion that is increasingly sensitive to our arguments, the points that were most dangerous for the future of rail have been removed or deferred.
But in our view, and in my view, the result is still not acceptable, in particular with the Jarzembowski and Sterckx reports, despite the Savary and Ainardi reports which we consider to be positive.
Ultimately, the overall result is still too negative in our view.
To conclude, I would like to express my hope that in future there will be more forces that wish to construct the other Europe that we want, a social and citizenâs Europe which we think is much closer to the dream of the founding fathers of Europe than this Europe of a big liberal market that years of liberalisation decisions have finally led us to.
Â Â  Mr President, unlike the situation affecting other modes of transport, the liberalisation of the markets has only touched the surface of the rail transport sector.
As a consequence, this mode of transport has lost a great deal of influence to competing sectors, to road transport in particular.
We therefore welcome the presentation of this second rail package in which the Commission proposes new measures that will enable us to move towards liberalisation, whilst at the same time maintaining the safety standards required for the sector.
I wish to take this opportunity to welcome the excellent work of the rapporteurs.
From our point of view, the compromise that could be reached with the Council is acceptable as regards the points under dispute.
The most complex issue was, of course, the process of liberalisation, because this clashes with interests that are deeply entrenched in the various Member States given the special role that the rail sector plays in each countryâs economy.
From this point of view, the conciliation that has been achieved moderates the more radical proposals without, however, discounting a future opening-up of the market to passenger rail transport.
Another point that must be highlighted concerns the agreement reached on the composition of the administrative board of the future European Railway Agency.
The principle of including on the board one representative from each Member State, which has already been applied to the other agencies, was fortunately accepted.
I wish to say a final word about the need to include a common rail safety strategy, which is ultimately one of the most important aspects for users of this transport sector.
We fully agree with the need to harmonise minimum safety standards in this field and the provisions in force in the various Member States.
We should also emphasise the set of proposals put forward by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on introducing a safety certificate, on training and certifying rail staff and on introducing a common working language for international transport, similar to the situation in the air transport sector.
In short, the compromise that has been reached demonstrates the bold and forward-looking vision that we should all adopt towards the crucial transport sector.
Â Â  Mr President, we can look forward to the revival of the railways as a wonderful prospect.
Unfortunately, reality is still far removed from that.
In order to bring the high hopes within reach, a powerful European incentive is crucial.
We are therefore pleased with the progress that has been made under the supervision of Mrs Ainardi, Mr Savary, MrÂ Jarzembowski and Mr Sterckx.
These Members of our House have each contributed to the setting up and further elaboration of a sound legal framework within which European railways can develop as competitive carriers over the coming years.
An important area of concern was passenger transport.
I endorse the current insight that passenger transport is, as a market, entirely different from goods transport and the concept of one type cannot be applied seamlessly to the other.
Development of this market therefore calls for a cautious approach.
The Council has spoken; Parliament has spoken, and so have I. It is now up to the industry to take up the challenge.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that we would do well to be satisfied â I would say very satisfied â with the result that we are achieving.
The Members who have followed this railway package will remember that there have been moments when we doubted that we would succeed in the endeavour to close such a complex chapter.
The first result that we must be proud of is, therefore, that of having reached the destination and of having achieved the result.
The second is that, objectively, apart from some things that may not convince all the respective political leanings â as we have also heard this evening â we must recognise that we have achieved a balanced result.
In these four proposals â for which the rapporteurs must, of course, be thanked for the great work that they carried out â we have a balanced mixture of, on the one hand, the urgent need to open up this market and modernise it and, on the other hand, the need to give us guarantees, both in terms of security and in terms of the ability and experience that the workers in this sector bring, which we want to safeguard.
More than anything, what I want to do is say thank you.
I would just like to make one observation, because I have heard comments that I am struggling to understand.
When talking about this liberalisation, which some are demonising, I would like to call for us not ever to forget that our focus and our objective are the users of this service.
No one has the key to liberalisation as such.
We must ensure that, by using competition opportunities, we, on the one hand, effectively improve the service for many users who are, primarily, workers â the commuters on this service â and, on the other hand, ensure that this takes place safely and also makes good use of workersâ professional skills.
I believe that we have achieved this objective.
Since this is my last speech of this parliamentary term, I will take this opportunity to thank my fellow Members.
For me, this has been my first parliamentary experience and to have had it in this committee has helped me to understand on many occasions that more is done to build Europe in this difficult, regulatory work that has a direct effect on peopleâs lives rather than in the many, often pointless, debates on the future and meaning of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the Trans-European Networks have set back rail transport, a symbol of public investment and service that have been the norm for decades and which have featured in epic poems telling of conquests that have enabled access to hitherto uncharted areas.
The wholesale shift towards liberalisation, like other parallel factors, was bound to reach the railways, in the same way that it has reached education, health and water, establishing the market economy as a single and fundamentalist ideology.
We do not, out of a sense of nostalgia, want to turn the clock back.
We do, however, want to help to ensure that the railways and with them public services move into the future in a way that will benefit the community and that they are not motivated solely by financial interests, serving few areas and passing through at high speed.
Interoperable networks, multimodal links, proper safety, environmental safeguards, real participation and liability of Member States as a crucial part of a rail structure are prerequisites for ensuring that this happens.
I therefore thank the rapporteurs for their work.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0237/2004) by Mr RÃŒbig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision 2000/819/EC on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2001-2005) (COM(2003) 758 â C5-0628/2003 â 2003/0292(COD)).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr RÃŒbig, for his excellent work, which will enable us to adopt this proposal at first reading.
It is a good example of efficient and constructive cooperation between the institutions.
The Commission proposal has two main parts.
On the one hand, it envisages the closure of the Joint European Venture programme and, on the other hand, makes a few changes to the European support mechanism for start-up capital for technology companies, called ETF Start Up.
This mechanism provides risk capital for launching technology companies.
The proposed closure of the JEV programme is the result of an evaluation of the programme which concluded that it has not achieved its objectives.
Demand has decreased and the impact in terms of job creation is limited.
I think that this proposal sends a clear message that both Parliament and the Commission are prepared to close ineffective programmes that do not achieve their objectives.
It is better for the Commission to devote its financial and human resources to financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises which have a greater impact, for example the SME guarantee facility and the ETF Start Up mechanism.
The changes proposed for this support mechanism will make it flexible.
The changes will improve the availability of funding and start-up capital for companies that are up to ten years old, compared to five years old currently, if they are working in particular sectors such as life sciences.
This reflects the fact that product development and the experimental phase can be particularly long for those companies and that, during that time, they need access to risk capital in order to continue their business.
The Commissionâs proposal also refers more explicitly to the eligibility of funds invested in companies carrying out research and development activities.
This highlights the fact that the European support mechanism for start-up capital is open to funds used for small and medium-sized enterprises that are particularly active in research and development.
I will conclude by saying that these changes to the support mechanism for start-up capital should help in achieving both the Lisbon objectives and the objective of 3% GDP for spending on research and development.
I am therefore pleased to see that Parliament supports the Commissionâs proposal.
It therefore goes without saying, MrÂ RÃŒbig, that the Commission accepts all the amendments from the European Parliament, i.e. Amendments Nos 1 to 5.
Â Â  . Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, working hard and hitting precise targets is what I learnt as a smith, and I am glad that the three institutions â Parliament, the Council and also the Commission â have shown how rapidly and efficiently European legislation can work when there are important matters at stake, and when there is agreement on them.
The proposal was submitted in December 2003.
In January, three committees and a rapporteur were instructed by Parliament.
On April 21 â today â we have found in the trialogue that we agree on this draft legislation, so that, from the first proposal to the entry into force of this important decision for small and medium-size firms, only four months have elapsed.
We quite simply want this programme to facilitate investments in new technologies and above all in training â and so I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Reding is here, because we think that training, education and further training is an absolutely crucial basis for the success of a company and therefore at the end of the day the creditworthiness of a company and the securities required for receiving credits are also decisively improved by it.
Our objective is quite simply to secure existing jobs and companies and to create new ones.
I believe that this programme will enable us to achieve this objective quite efficiently.
We also acknowledge that we want to promote collaboration, especially between companies â especially the smallest â and at the end of the day also the collaboration between businesses, but also with the organisations that promote them.
We also believe that the Commission should report to us about the progress, obviously in the first place on the financial effect, but we are also interested in the benchmarks, which are imposed, and the best practice, as to how these programmes will in fact be put into practice, how they will be implemented, how we can learn from various country applications in order to exploit these programmes as optimally and 100% as possible, so that here in this area there is no administrative expenditure included, but that all the money provided â 100% â is passed on directly to the companies through the European Investment Bank .
We know that in one of the three programmes, namely JEV, we have not achieved these objectives.
I would like explicitly to thank the Commission for having had the courage officially to concede this and to say that this is a programme which is not being used to the full.
However, we would like to use the funds which have become free here appropriately and we know that the subjects of Basel II â guarantees, equity loans and risk capital â will in future be even more the focus of attention.
So even today I would like to demand from this body - and we will indeed provisionally resolve all this tomorrow in the plenary session - that the subject of Basel II is also taken seriously.
Here we find that although a study has now been produced which is already recorded by the competent experts internally, with the results of which, however, we are apparently not satisfied, we would also like an impact study, which quite simply shows what problems we are expecting to get through the Basel II legislation, and we would like today to have an impact study by the Commission, and the Council has also insisted that we should get one.
We would like to know what our finance ministers, what our national states, in the run-up to the introduction of Basel II, would like to do or will have to do, what proposals the various States are developing here, and above all there must be a programme of business re-engineering.
However, it cannot be the case that we introduce Basel II with billions of euros in costs.
We would like the opposite.
We would like a rationalisation project.
The costs for companies, for banks, must be reduced dramatically, and here everyone is looking to the financial markets supervisors, the finance ministries and the Commission.
Parliament, too, will also do everything it can to make Basel II a success.
We would like the Stability Pact, which we have accepted for our Europe, also to be shaped to fit our small businesses, and then they too would be looking at a secure future.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the RÃŒbig report does not pose any problems.
It proposes adjusting the financial measures for companies and modifying the multi-annual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship for which I was rapporteur.
I hope that this report finally marks the will of the Commission to take into account the needs of SMEs for risk capital, start-up aid and transfer of business, as you said, Commissioner.
All of these programmes are still insufficient to achieve the Lisbon objectives, which are nevertheless reaffirmed each year at the Spring Summit.
I will not elaborate further.
As this is, however, our last sitting and I will undoubtedly not be in the next Parliament, unfortunately, I would like to emphatically state again what my colleagues in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and I have always advocated.
First of all, I hope that the European Charter for small enterprises will finally have legal status.
Our companies need it to be implemented, as was stated at the Barcelona Summit.
What is the Commissionâs opinion, Commissioner?
Secondly, our companies, both small and medium-sized, and whatever their sector, innovative, traditional or small-scale, need access to the research and development programmes.
This is not an option, but an obligation in order for them to remain competitive, dynamic and effective, as you just said, Commissioner.
Finally, these companies need advice, cooperation and dialogue.
There are professional organisations that support these small and medium-sized enterprises.
Does the Commission intend to consider them as genuine partners when drawing up new programmes?
This is how our companies will be able to respond to the challenge of growth and employment, our young people will be able to take on the culture and spirit of enterprise and Europe, finally reunified, will be the most dynamic area in the world so that every citizen can find their place in it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say just for the record that Mr Hans-Peter Martin, who is always excited about people signing in without being present, is himself conspicuous by his absence from this night-time session.
Â Â  Since those who were due to speak are not present, the debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0235/2004) by Mr van Velzen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community programme to make digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable (COM(2004) 96 - C5-0082/2004 - 2004/0025(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, this is a fairly historic moment, because it is now Wednesday evening, and this is the last report on this evening's agenda. It is also my last report in this House, because after ten years, I am retiring.
Not so long ago, the importance of the Lisbon process was discussed once again during the Summit in Brussels.
If we want to turn Europe into the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society by 2010, there is of course a great deal left to be done.
As we have already witnessed in the case of Europe 2005, a successful implementation of access to broadband largely relies on the availability of Content.
Indeed, it is possible to have broadband, but if there is nothing on it, then the public will not exactly be enthusiastic.
The same applies to advanced services for users of mobile telephony, and I would, for example, refer to the third generation.
I spent a few weeks in China recently, and it struck me that the Chinese, together with the Japanese and the South Koreans, are already getting excited about fourth-generation mobile telephony.
What this means, then, is that, in terms of third-generation mobile telephony too, Europe will be lagging ever further behind, as the figures at Nokia testify.
In this light, the report on Content is extremely important, because it promotes an increase in productivity and innovation, better information products and services; it has a positive impact on Government, another area in which we are trailing behind badly, and it leads to more projects in the areas of Health, Business and Learning.
I am therefore pleased that the Commissioner is here this evening.
The Commission's present Content -proposal identifies the obstacles, particularly in the areas of public interest in Europe,and also the areas in which the market is overlooking adequate investments.
The market cannot do everything and the governments have a just role.
In the current proposal, conditions are being created for better access to, and better use of, digital content and, where necessary, for greater economic return for services based on access to, and re-use of, digital content.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has tabled 16 amendments to the Commission's proposal.
By means of these, we want to ensure that the report targets the public sector, that consideration is given to the financial perspectives after 2007, that a budget to the tune of EUR 55 million will be set aside for the years 2005 and 2006, and that the total budget will amount to EUR 163 million.
In this connection, I should like to take the opportunity of thanking my shadow-rapporteurs, Mrs Gil and MrsÂ Plooij-Van Gorsel, for the excellent working relationship we have had.
It promised to be a good celebration, because the Council, with whom we negotiated, also benefited from completing in one reading, so that we would not face any delays.
Our basic budget was EUR 163 million.
The Council, and the Irish Presidency in particular, led us to believe that a deal was within reach if we were to reduce the amount to EUR 145 million.
As befits good parliamentarians, we ultimately hoped for an amount in the region of 150 million, but, during the informal trialogue, the Irish Presidency responded that the budget should not exceed 120 million and added that, if we were to push a little, we could probably end up with 138 million.
We indicated that this was insufficient for us and that 140 million was the absolute minimum. We subsequently asked the Council Presidency to declare in writing that an agreement was reached on 140 million.
The deal expired at 1.30 p.m. this afternoon.
It is characteristic of the Council that I received the following message at 5.11 p.m.
I will quote it verbatim, as this will look good in the historical records.
This is now the third time that we have received the same message from the Council, and each time we ask them to deliver, they respond that they are unable to do so.
With this amount of, what I would call, uncertainty in the Council, we cannot but conclude that we are about to launch an election campaign. That we will be telling the citizens that the Council makes fine promises in Brussels where the Lisbon process in concerned, but as soon as it has to deliver, also in terms of financial means in order to achieve the Lisbon process, the Council fails to come up with the goods and leaves us empty-handed.
It is extremely regrettable that we, who want to have the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010, and we in this House, are being treated by the Council in this manner.
I am glad that election campaigns are on the way.
They will in any event spur me on to take part and to denounce the Council's ambivalence.
The future is bright.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me, before I go into the heart of the matter, to say a personal word to thank the honourable rapporteur, my friend MrÂ van Velzen, for the work that he has done over the past ten years for the common good and to improve the lives of all Europeans, whatever their background or field, and not only Europeans: I am also thinking of his international and even global work.
I think that MrÂ van Velzen has shown what it is to be a good parliamentarian.
I turn now to the e-content+ programme.
The Commission aims to launch this programme, as the rapporteur explained, at the beginning of 2005, nearly halfway to the target year for the Lisbon Agenda: 2010.
We need to improve conditions for innovation by business - notably in certain sectors of the digital content market - and that is why this programme is very relevant to the Lisbon strategy.
The online digital content market offers significant potential for growth, but it also provides an ideal platform for innovative digital content products and services that transcend national boundaries.
Imagine, for example, if our public administrations in Europe all collected and stored data and information in the same way and if, on top of that, our citizens were proficient in all the languages of the Union.
I tried to raise awareness of that with the European Year of Languages, and the process is ongoing: people are learning more and more languages, but we still have a long way to go to reach our goal.
However, on the Internet we are likely to see many more maps of trans-European highways, waterways and other natural and man-made features, and then we will see large European digital libraries of cultural and scholarly repute.
We will see much more European digital learning material.
The reality is that in May 2004 the European Union will encompass 25 Member States, 20 languages, even more cultures, a great many regions and a truly fragmented market for any business intending to develop innovative cross-border digital content products and services.
This is a situation that should be taken into account when the e-content programme starts in January 2005.
The outlook might not be as bleak as it appears.
The recently adopted directive on public sector information aligns legal frameworks in Member States with respect to the re-use of information held by the public sector.
The difficulties in combining formats and languages can be addressed using today's information technologies, subject to the eContent+ proposal.
That is why â and I agree completely with the rapporteur â it is so important that this e-content programme should be seen in conjunction with the e-learning programme, since people first have to be taught to utilise the content before it can be of real benefit.
The proposed programme recommends focusing on clearly fragmented parts of the digital content market in Europe where market forces alone have been insufficient to drive growth, as rightly stated by the rapporteur.
It targets three domains: spatial or geographical data, educational material, and cultural content.
The Commission is therefore pleased to note that the amendments to its proposal tabled by the rapporteur, MrÂ van Velzen, improve the proposal.
We would like to thank him and the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and MrsÂ Plooij-van Gorsel, for their efforts to find a compromise with the Council in an attempt to conclude proceedings at first reading.
Even if the rapporteur has problems with the Council, he should have none with the Commission because it can accept all the amendments tabled by Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, congratulations are due to Mr van Velzen because he has done excellent work and produced a really good report.
I was rapporteur for the first e-content report and I can see that Mr van Velzen has worked very hard to try to ensure we give Europe an advantage in e-content.
As he stated earlier, the US has the world's most advanced digital economy and Europe, with its fragmented markets and smaller media and telecommunication companies, is trying to catch up in terms of quality of content and products.
Rather than talk about what is in his report, which has been eloquently summarised both by the rapporteur and the Commission, I want to talk about the Council.
I am extremely concerned about the sort of attitude and approach that the Council has adopted.
It has stated time and again that it wants to achieve the Lisbon objectives, key among which is the opening-up of opportunities for Europe in the electronic age.
However, when it comes to the Council putting its money where its mouth is, nothing at all happens.
As the reporter said, the Council has treated Parliament with complete contempt.
We have been haggling over figures â 20 million, 30 million, 50 million â because it is unwilling to provide sufficient resources to make this programme happen.
In a Europe of 25 Member States, adequate resources will be needed if we are to gain a competitive edge over our major competitor, the US, in this area.
Many high-skill jobs rely on us being able to get our content right and on having this programme and reaching SMEs and other providers.
It is a great pity that owing to the Council's attitude we have been unable to finalise this initiative.
It was key for this legislature to do that and have this programme up and running for 2005, and there was real will on Parliament's part to make this happen.
It is to the detriment of the EU that it has not, and this has been because the Council has been unwilling to pay for it.
What it is offering at the moment is peanuts in terms of a Union of 25.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who did his utmost to achieve closure, because some of us in other Groups wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal, which was for EURÂ 165 million.
That is the amount needed if we are genuinely to deliver on this eContent proposal.
This failure is not due to a lack of effort on the rapporteur's part.
I hope that at second reading the Council will get the message that Parliament is not willing to support programmes that are simply piecemeal efforts.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.(1).
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, as other colleagues have done this week, I too would like to draw the attention of the House to the unusual fact that we were not allowed to make one-minute speeches on Monday.
I submitted a statement in writing at that time on the issue of Mordechai Vanunu, who was released from jail in Israel yesterday after 18 years' imprisonment.
He is subject to very severe, cruel and unusual restrictions on his liberty.
This is not acceptable in a democracy.
He is not allowed to leave the country, people watch him wherever he goes, he is not allowed to make contact with foreigners and he is not allowed to contact journalists.
I ask the President to make representations to the Israeli Parliament and Government in support of this person, who served a prison sentence for showing that weapons of mass destruction were being prepared in Israel.
These are precisely what the forces in Iraq have been seeking; the discrepancy between the way the two countries are treated is simply amazing.
I ask you, Mr President, to bring this matter to the attention of the President of Parliament, and to ask him to contact the Israeli authorities with a view to allowing this man his liberty.
He has served his sentence.
Â Â  We shall bear this in mind.
I shall pass this request on to the President.
Without doubt this is an issue which arouses strong emotions amongst many European citizens of all political persuasions, and I have no doubt that in the future it will be dealt with in Parliament through the appropriate channels.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the outcome of the trial against Leyla Zanay and others in Ankara.
Â Â  . Mr President, the case of Leyla Zana casts a negative shadow over the implementation of political reforms.
In a statement made yesterday, the Commission strongly deplored yesterdayâs verdict by the Ankara State Security Court confirming the sentencing of Mrs Zana to serve her full prison term until June 2005.
Let me briefly remind you of the background to this case.
As part of the political reforms adopted in Turkey in the period 2002/2003, new provisions were introduced in the Turkish legal system allowing for the retrial of persons whose convictions the European Court of Human Rights has found to violate the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
This was a specific priority under the Accession Partnership with Turkey.
Another priority concerns the need to remedy the situation of those persons prosecuted or sentenced for non-violent expression of opinion.
Following the introduction of these new provisions, a decision was taken in February 2003, under which MrsÂ Zana and her three co-defendants were to be retried by the Ankara State Security Court.
However, in spite of the several sessions held by the Ankara State Security Court, retrial largely resulted in a repetition of the previous trial, leading to persistent concerns about the respect for the rights of the defence and the principle of presumption of innocence, as acknowledged by independent international experts.
The Commission has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the Turkish authorities in the framework of the political dialogue.
In our view, while fully respecting the principle of independence of the judiciary, the way this case has been handled shows the gap that exists between the spirit of the reforms and their actual implementation.
As I mentioned, the trial against Mrs Zana was held at a State Security Court.
It is worth recalling that, according to the relevant priority under the Accession Partnership, the European Union has repeatedly asked Turkey to align the functioning of the State Security Courts with European standards.
We note that the abolition of these courts is among the measures envisaged in the next package of legislative reforms announced in Turkey.
I should also like to point out that in his speech before the Turkish Parliament in January 2004, President Prodi called for the immediate release of Mrs Zana.
Moreover, the Commission has raised this issue several times in its regular report and within the framework of the political dialogue with the Turkish authorities.
We understand that the lawyers representing the defendants have announced their intention to refer the case to the Court of Cassation and hope that it will be dealt with in accordance with all the relevant principles of equal justice.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its statement.
Probably uniquely in this House, I actually knew Leyla Zana before she was tried and convicted.
I first met her in the late 1980s.
She is, to put it mildly, a controversial figure.
Nonetheless the action that she took is perfectly within the realms of democratic expression.
After all, all she did was to say something in the Kurdish language within her Parliament.
Mrs Ahern and others sometimes choose to use the Irish language within this Parliament.
Indeed my Quaestor colleague, MrsÂ Banotti, did so in her opening speech.
However, I do not think even the worst enemies of Fine Gael would wish Mrs Banotti to be locked up for 15 years for that.
There has been complete over-reaction from the very beginning.
The way in which the trial was conducted was unacceptable and it was thanks to the intervention of the Council of Europe that a retrial was held.
It is a great disappointment to me and my group that the Turkish judicial authorities did not show themselves to have sufficient flexibility to use this opportunity of having a retrial that would effectively have exonerated Mrs Zana.
She has been the victim of what is in effect a struggle between a reactionary judiciary and a state that is trying to reform.
I welcome the packages of reforms that have been adopted and I also welcome the fact that the state security courts are to be abolished.
This is not before time.
Some people are indeed working hard for democracy in Turkey, and the AKP deputy Faruk Ãnsal spoke out against this particular verdict.
I hope that in passing in what I think will be a unanimous resolution, supported right across the House, that we can send a message, not to the Turkish Government but to the Turkish judiciary, to be realistic, to get up to date and, for a change, to support their government in trying to restore respect for the Turkish judiciary within Turkey.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply disappointed by the decision in the case of Leyla Zana.
I, too, am far from agreeing with all her views; to judge by her latest letter â which I have here â to, among others, Javier Solana and President Prodi, her assessment of ÃÃ§alan and of the PKKâs successor organisations is perhaps somewhat naive, rather exaggerated or understated, depending on your chosen way of putting it, but â as has already been said â none of these things are reasons for someone to be locked up for many years and their sentence confirmed in the teeth of rulings by European courts.
I entirely agree with the Commissioner that this shows that there is still a great discrepancy between a parliamentary decision in favour of reforms, and those reforms being implemented.
That is not to be taken as criticism of the government, which, as I see it, has, in so far as it has been able to do so, made quite plain its interest in a different decision on Leyla Zana being reached.
We really do, though, have to urge, beg, or urgently petition the government to really put its whole weight behind the reforms in order to push them through, especially in the justice system, for I do think we will have major problems if the government proposes the right things, if the parliament backs them up, but the necessary democratic practices are not in place in the administration or in the law courts to make them happen.
This government, too, when decisions are taken in December, is sure to have the charge laid at its door that too little has been done by way of implementation and that too little effort is being made to bring Turkeyâs administration and its justice system up to modern European standards.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its extremely strong and clear statement on the unfortunate Zana case.
During the recent Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting in Turkey, we brought up the issue of the Leyla Zana trial, as we always do.
Justice Minister Cicek promised us that in the next package of constitutional reforms, which I think is to be published this week, the State Security Courts would be scrapped.
This is, of course, first-class news because these courts do not contribute to justice; they do not contribute to security.
The Turkish Government fully appreciates the political importance of the Zana case for the European Parliament.
As a strong Turkophile, let me be quite clear that, if Leyla Zana and her colleagues are not released soon, it will be impossible for Turkey's closest friends to argue that accession negotiations should be opened from December.
No country can seriously contemplate European membership with nearly six thousand prisoners of conscience, no matter how controversial those people prove to be.
Â Â  MrÂ President, yesterday morning I was in Ankara at the hearing during which the 15-year sentence of Leyla Zana and three other ex-DEP MPs was confirmed.
Among the many serious aspects of this trial that have already been mentioned by fellow Members and the Commission representative, whom I thank, what matters is the very fact that the 1994 sentence has been confirmed.
The Strasbourg Court condemned the 1994 trial because it was illegal in many respects and called for a new trial to take place.
The sentence is not based on the proceedings of this trial, but explicit reference is made to the 1994 sentence.
The behaviour of the State Security Court in Ankara not only affronted the European Union but also the Strasbourg Court.
I attended all of the trial hearings: the right to defence was breached in a most blatant manner; more specifically â and to keep it short â the defence was denied any possibility of objectively replying to claims made by the prosecution witnesses.
By the way it acted throughout the 14 hearings, the Court was only concerned with protecting the 1994 sentence.
I will not add any more general comments since I agree with what has been said by those Members who spoke before me.
In October, the European Commission will put forward its proposal on whether or not to open, and if so when, the negotiations for Turkeyâs accession to the European Union.
Having also listened to the Commissioner, I believe that the European Commissionâs assessment will be a conscientious one.
Having heard my fellow Members, I also believe that the future Parliament will conscientiously assess the advisability or otherwise of opening negotiations for Turkeyâs accession to the European Union or whether to open them immediately.
At the moment, frankly, the conditions for opening negotiations do not exist.
Â Â  Mr President, sadly the outcome of yesterday's verdict came as no surprise.
Those who have been involved in this matter over the past months and years have been able to see with their own eyes that this trial was a farce.
The judges and especially the public prosecutor had absolutely no interest in properly reinvestigating the old evidence from 1994.
And in this trial the defence once again had no opportunity to call new witnesses who wanted to put forward contrary evidence.
This was a copy of a bad trial, and the result of a bad trial is a bad verdict.
But one thing should be quite clear: this says less about the government's attitude to reform than about the stubborn resistance of conservatives.
These judges, yesterday's judges, wanted to show who is boss.
Their answer is clear: we are the bosses, not the European Parliament or the European Commission in Brussels, and not the Government in Ankara either: we are the ones who decide what will happen in this case.
I think that the only way the Government can limit the damage it has undoubtedly suffered in connection with its request to start negotiations in December is to show that this is an exception to the rule.
That rule must remain the same: reforms on paper must be put into practice.
Two examples.
There has already been mention of the plans â and I emphasise the word 'plans' â to abolish State Security Courts.
I should like to call on the Government to make haste in this matter, not to drag things out, and to ensure that these courts are actually abolished by December.
The second example, highly symbolic of course in this context, is the use of the Kurdish language, which we should remember was where this whole issue started.
On paper, once again on paper, the use of this language is permitted, but in practice there are still numerous administrative hurdles.
So it is very important that by the end of the year the Kurdish language can actually be used in the education system and in the media.
Finally, for those who have concluded solely on the basis of this matter that negotiations should not start, I would like to remind you of what Ms Zana herself said.
In a letter to the European Parliament she said: I would rather be in prison in a country that is negotiating with the European Union than free in a country on which Europe has turned its back.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to support the fine rhetoric of my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk.
I would prefer Ms Leyla Zana to be at liberty in a country that is negotiating with the European Union.
That is actually the only option which I find acceptable.
It is in fact very rare for someone to have spent so long in prison and to have held the Sakharov prize for almost as long.
The situation is quite extraordinary.
It is also very unusual for the European Union to have continued proceeding on a 'business as usual' basis for so long.
This cannot continue.
We must make more of a nuisance of ourselves, exert more pressure so that this pressure can in turn be exerted on the opposing forces in Turkey.
The old state philosophy, the old type of Kemalism, still holds considerable sway as can be seen in this trial.
Those in charge are themselves supporters of this old philosophy and of course time and again come to the same conclusion.
I agree with other Members who have already taken the floor and made the point that the unusual feature here is that the Government, as we must recognise, is doing its best and has adopted some dramatic legal reforms.
The Government was behind the change allowing trials to be reopened, in particular.
It also introduced the option to free someone from prison, but this is not used: the legislation is either not used at all or not used properly.
I believe that we must persuade our own governments of this.
It is not just a question of isolated symptoms, like the serious case of Leyla Zana and her associates.
It is a consequence of a more profound question which we must discuss with Turkey.
I would also add that in my opinion it is essential to build up contacts between European judges and public prosecutors and their Turkish counterparts in order to change attitudes, as the wrong attitude can take us down the wrong track time after time, falling into the trap of nationalistic hatred against minorities caused by the fear that they could undermine the integrity of the State.
For these reasons I think that we must press for the existing opportunities to be used to free Ms Leyla Zana and others imprisoned for similar so-called offences in anticipation of reform of the entire legal process.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wished to speak because I naturally find the result of this trial unacceptable.
It has been restarted twice.
The Supreme Court, at the request of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, has restarted the trial.
The verdict is identical.
We could not be more disappointed and, faced with such confusion, there is nothing more to say.
I went to see Leyla Zana in 1995 at her prison in Ankara, with the other Kurdish prisoners, prisoners of conscience, we must remember.
It was the year when the Customs Union was to be voted on.
I was very confused and said to myself that maybe I should give Turkey a chance, since I was in favour of its accession in the future.
I therefore went to the country to learn about its evolution, which I wanted to give a chance by voting for the Customs Union.
I thought that maybe this would have an effect on respect for human rights, respect for minorities and freedom of expression.
Of course, I must recognise today that, unfortunately, things have hardly developed in a positive way.
I am, nevertheless, Mr President, in favour of Turkey entering the European Union.
I am, however, sorry that Turkey continues to violate human rights and I insist that a considerable effort be made. Otherwise I fear that accession is in a bad way.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision in the court case against Leyla Zana shows beyond doubt that Turkey is not yet ready negotiate its accession to the EU.
Unaffected by the official reforms in Turkey, the court is doing things the way they were done in the old days, so anyone who had attended the hearings â as I did â could conclude that the initial judgment, founded upon one sentence spoken in Kurdish and harshly criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, would be upheld.
Turkey could have used the trial as a means of demonstrating that its reforms of the justice system exist not only on paper.
This was not, in the final analysis, about the minutiae of the law, but about a woman whose fate had become a symbol of the failure of Turkish politics and Turkish justice, a woman whose trial was a test of how seriously reforms were being taken.
Neither that, nor the fact that the eyes of the world were upon them, could induce the court to conduct a trial in accordance with the rule of law.
Let me ask you this, then: if even the case of Leyla Zana cannot bring about change in the Turkish legal system, how are reforms to be implemented at all?
In principle â and let me make this clear â I am in favour of Turkey joining the EU, provided that it meets the relevant conditions.
Turkey has known for years that there must be drastic change in it if it is to have a prospect of acceding, but yesterdayâs judgment shows that the willingness to do so is still not yet present, and so the EU must now, at last, cut short all this talk about the commencement of accession negotiations being imminent.
Those who, in the aftermath of this ruling, continue to insist that accession negotiations will be possible in six monthsâ time, show only their indifference to the Copenhagen criteria and their interest in the implementation of strategic objectives to the exclusion of all else.
Far from it; the fact remains that the criteria for accession to the EU have been laid down and must still be met.
For as long as Turkey ignores that fact, there can be no accession negotiations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not have many comments to make about the various contributions.
I just wish to say that the independence of the judiciary is perverted when the very structure, performance and culture of part of the judiciary itself negate basic democratic principles.
This is comparable to the situation in Guantanamo.
It is not good enough.
We therefore welcome the proposed abolition of the state security courts, and the Commission will attach due importance to this issue in our report on Turkey in October.
Â Â  To end this debate, I have received 5 motions for resolutions, in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
â A5-0280/2004 by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Recommendation of the Commission relating to the 2004 updating of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States and the Community (period 2003-2005) (COM(2004) 238 â C5-0183/2004 â 2004/2020(INI)), and
â A5-0277/2004 by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposed Decision of the Council relating to the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (COM(2004) 239 â C5-0188/2004 â 2004/0082(CNS)).
Â Â  Employment results today constitute a key element of the principal objective of Lisbon, set in 2000.
As you surely know, this objective is the following. I quote: âmaking the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesionâ.
We must not forget that Europe has already made considerable progress as we have created six million jobs on the European continent since 1999.
That being the case, it is clear that, despite this progress, Europe will not reach the intermediary quantitative objective: to reach an employment rate of 67% by 2005.
Today, a major French newspaper used the headline âEuropeâs growth at a standstillâ, growth that will only reach 1.7%.
This is the reason why, faced with the observation that the economy is slowing down, we must bring everything into play, and it is the duty of the European Union to react.
It is in this context that Mr Wim Kokâs report was produced.
This report stressed that there was an urgent need for practical action, by putting in place some decisive measures on a fiscal, social, environmental, research and innovation level in order particularly, in all areas, to create jobs, taking into account, of course, globalisation and the problems linked to the ageing of the population.
This requires to a great extent a rapid reaction and good management of the change.
This is why we have a duty to choose this change in order not to be subjected to it.
This is why, in my report, I wished to insist on the practical implementation of the employment guidelines.
Firstly, it is advisable to improve the reaction capacity of businesses and their employees.
This requires an adaptation through an increase in levels of human capital and a policy of life-long training, which should be encouraged.
This also requires active encouragement of the creation of businesses, particularly small businesses.
It is in this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 7 of the report) that Europe must support networks and partnerships, for example platforms of excellence that link small businesses, research centres, universities and private businesses.
Secondly, there is cause to mobilise the working population, indeed the entire population.
In this spirit, I recommend (this is the subject of Amendment 5) making the employment of young people a great European cause.
Thirdly, it is advisable to launch a huge European plan against de-industrialisation.
In this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 6), it is certainly important that the European Union support the most disadvantaged regions without neglecting the development of the most dynamic areas.
This is the subject of Amendment 5.
Fourthly, very specific guidance, intended to improve governance.
This is, in fact, the conclusion of the Wim Kok report.
Improved governance, meaning the need to mobilise all of the players â national parliaments, regional and local players, social partners, trade unions and associations, but also businesses â and also to facilitate, in this spirit, improved access to the structural funds.
Until now, Europe has supported the policies of the Member States, but in a spirit of assistance, by adopting a policy of what I would like to call assistance in the form of a crutch, but not in a spirit of economic dynamism.
I think that if it is advisable to keep in mind the need to support the most disadvantaged regions, Europe must both show overtly, and demonstrate, to the outside world its ability to be dynamic.
Community financing policy must be established in this spirit of economic dynamism.
This is very specifically what I would like to say.
Furthermore, Mr President, I am sorry that, following the votes that took place yesterday, which were on such important issues as the environmental life cycle, tyres, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purÃ©e â all votes of great consequence â we are obliged to discuss employment policy now, and, moreover, without the Council.
I am sorry about the conditions under which we have had to produce this report, given the ambiguity that surrounds it.
Indeed, you are producing a report on the guidelines, a legislative report, but you cannot amend it because the guidelines have been fixed for the past three years, as if the environmental context, the international, sociological, financial and fiscal context of this matter, were not changing.
Â Â  . â Mr President, this House has always demanded that economic, employment, social and finance policies should be coordinated and considered as a whole, in order to provide the European Union with a coherent strategy for growth, employment and society.
We think it right that we should be doing as we now are and considering these broad economic policy guidelines not merely over a year, but over a longer period.
That does not, however, mean that we do not have to take a very practical and critical look at these guidelines and at the need to adapt to changes in growth and employment.
We can see very clearly that the European economy is continuing to lose its strength, and that, within the eurozone, recovery, where it has occurred or has had a beneficial influence on growth, is primarily attributable to a steep rise in exports, while domestic demand has sunk as a result of low levels of private consumption over several quarters.
That must surely give us cause for concern, and so we want to consider and reformulate these broad economic policy guidelines in such a way as to stimulate economic growth and enable it to become more sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms.
Only if all the Member States keep to what has been agreed will this be possible.
I will now reiterate Parliamentâs criticism to the effect that many Member States are not keeping to their commitment on the Lisbon strategy of combining and bundling all measures aimed at creating truly sustainable growth and also enhancing competitiveness.
This is why I believe that the policy guidelines must be targeted even more than before at stimulating economic growth by way of investment and job creation, thus bringing about a rise in productivity.
While the Growth Initiative, with this as its end, is surely to be welcomed, the guidelines should also express in clear and definite terms a concentration on human resources, research and development, and innovation, as well as on an industry policy that particularly prioritises small and medium-sized enterprises, renewable energies and environmentally-friendly technologies.
Although the environmental technologies action plan must be implemented, we must not forget the need to invest in social infrastructure, for there will be no increase in productivity if we do not make work and family more compatible and thereby increase the number of women in work.
This I do regard as a very important measure; it cannot be too much stressed that this is an area in which many Member States must make much more of an effort.
Nor is the funding of growth-promoting investments any more adequate, and we should also be including in the broad economic policy guidelines coordinating measures to combat unfair tax competition and tax evasion.
Indeed, the spending envisaged in the present Quick Start programme and in the Growth Initiative will take us no further than that, as all the economic research institutions are of course right to state that no investment under 1% of gross domestic product will have the desired effect, in particular, the positive effect hoped for on the vast mass of people in the European Union â over 14 million of them â who are unemployed.
The broad economic policy guidelines must continue to focus on social and regional cohesion and on convergence in real terms, but there must be greater clarity as to which policy mix will actually prove successful, as we need strong synergy effects between, on the one hand, the necessary structural reforms and, on the other, investment and macro-economic policies aimed at stability and growth.
This, of course, is where intelligent use of a more flexible Stability and Growth Pact is called for.
Transparency and participative implementation of the Lisbon strategy are not just lofty ideals; these approaches really do promise a great deal in terms of using reform partnerships as a means of implementing the Lisbon strategy.
It is my belief that such partnerships for change must concern themselves with economic, social and environmental issues across the board if the Lisbon strategy is to be improved and moulded into a more political form.
Affirming, as I do, the spirit of Lisbon, I believe that this is the most comprehensive strategy for the purpose of mastering the problems of the European Union, but we must, of course, respond to economic change by updating these guidelines every year, which, as we can see, is becoming more and more necessary.
Any reform of the structural funds must also take into account the importance of forging a link between the economic policy guidelines and the structural funds and the use made of them.
Moreover, the whole must be formulated in such a way that all the partners really are compelled to make the connection in the interests of sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be taking part in your debate today on economic policy and employment policy.
This debate is being held in response to the update of the broad economic policy guidelines and the Commission's 2004 report on the employment strategy.
I should like to congratulate in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath and MrsÂ Hermange on their reports.
The adoption by the Commission of the so-called package of guidelines, a package which jointly covers the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies, is proof yet again that streamlining bears fruit.
Streamlining has resulted not only in the update of the economic policy and employment policy coordination circuits of the European Union, but also in stronger complementarity and cohesion between these two basic procedures.
The core objective of streamlining, of coordination of the policies, was to increase their efficiency, by placing more emphasis on application than on the annual drafting of guidelines.
Both the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies were adopted with a three-year perspective.
It was clear right from the outset that the guidelines must be amended only in order to take account of important developments.
Within this framework, as there are no important developments, the three-year guidelines must remain stable this year.
By maintaining a stable strategy, we shall be able to improve how we project and forecast the impact of European Union policies and ensure that they continue and are efficient.
I should like first to comment on the broad economic policy guidelines.
The Commission considers that the overall political strategy laid down in these guidelines continues to apply.
Emphasis was placed in the 2004 update on incorporating the 10 new countries within the framework of the coordination of our policies.
I should like to comment in greater detail on these two aspects, taking account also of certain comments made in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The European Commission has confirmed the Community's medium-term strategic economic policy laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003-2005.
This strategy has three main axes: macro-economic policies predicated on development and stability, economic reforms to increase development potential and policies to reinforce sustainability.
This package of policies focuses on the contribution which economic policies can make towards achieving the Lisbon objectives.
The reasons for continuing the existing strategy and for achieving progress are obvious.
First, economic developments are in keeping with the expectations which applied when the Council issued the present broad economic policy guidelines last year.
As stated in our new economic forecasts, the economies of the European Union are in the process of recovery, which is expected to consolidate.
Of course, I have taken note of what MrsÂ Randzio-Plath said earlier about concerns about recovery and growth and Mrs Hermange's comments in today's publication about the stagnation in the economy and growth.
In all events, the general framework of macro-economic policy is not negative.
I should like â and I think that we must â emphasise that we need to take pains to give new impetus to financial restructuring once the recovery has progressed and we must not make mistakes, as has happened on previous occasions when the short-term economy has been sound.
Secondly, in order to strengthen both potential growth and the endurance of the economy, decisive application of the objectives we have set for structural reforms is required.
In the first evaluation of the application of the present broad guidelines in January, the Commission recognised that some progress had been made.
It did, however, also become clear that more progress with the reforms is needed in order not to jeopardise the achievement of the Lisbon objectives.
The 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines focuses on integrating the new Member States within the framework of the coordination of our economic policies.
It is positive that in Mrs Randzio-Plath's report and in the motion for a resolution you express your support for this objective.
The economic challenges which the new Member States face do not differ materially from those which the current Member States face, they are just bigger.
Our medium-term economic strategy is in a position to address the challenges of the acceding countries.
The synergy created from the interaction of macro-economic policies and the necessary structural reforms will result in gradual convergence between these countries.
This â gradual convergence â is the most important challenge which the acceding countries face.
As far as the 2004 guidelines for employment policies are concerned, I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, for the dynamic way in which they prepared the European Parliament's opinion on the guidelines.
It is very positive that the issues addressed in the report all relate to the four basic policy sectors, as set out by the European Employment Task Force and in the 2004 joint report on employment, which were confirmed by the spring European Council, namely: improving the adaptability of workers and businesses, attracting more people to the work place, improving the quality of employment and investing in human resources.
I consequently consider that, materially, we are on the same wavelength, we have the same concerns and the same priorities for action in coming years.
It is also important that you emphasised the need for stricter assessment of the performance of the Member States, in order to give impetus to the application of the strategy on employment.
I shall refer very briefly to the Commission proposal for the 2004 guidelines for employment.
The Commission proposes maintaining the guidelines as adopted by decision of the Council last July.
As part of our joint efforts to streamline the economic policy and employment policy circuits of the European Union, the guidelines for employment policies, like the broad economic policy guidelines, follow a three-year cycle.
The reform of the policy on employment carried out last year aimed to address better the basic challenges of the job market in the European Union, in order to respond to the Lisbon objectives for 2010.
This reform emphasised the medium-term approach and the definition of a framework policy which would take account of the diversity which prevails in the enlarged European Union.
The joint report on employment on which the European Employment Task Force under the chairmanship of MrÂ Kok agreed, highlighted the need to emphasise the monitoring of the reforms which the Member States undertook to implement, rather than becoming involved in a procedure of further amendments to the guidelines.
Similarly, the spring European Council confirmed the need identified in the joint report on employment for the procedure on employment to focus the following year on evaluating progress.
The main issue in the next joint report on employment must therefore be the Member States' response to the special recommendations for each country.
This means that these recommendations must be at the epicentre of the national action plans submitted by the Member States, both the current fifteen and the new Member States, in the autumn of 2004.
Finally, may I assure you that the European Commission expresses its satisfaction with the constructive approach by the European Parliament, which has focused its amendments on the recitals.
The European Commission, during further negotiations with the Council, will also take account of and will support those amendments which improve certain recitals.
I am absolutely convinced that the immense challenge which we face in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives by 2010 makes it necessary for us to focus 100% on application, by translating the challenges into political action.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank MrsÂ Hermange for her report â I shall focus on employment â and also the Commissioner for his statement this morning.
Mrs Hermange has the correct approach: we are not seeking to amend the detail of the structure of the guidelines.
When we agreed to the streamlining of the economic and employment guidelines last year, we implicitly agreed not to unpack the guidelines themselves until 2006 â the mid-point.
That is the right approach: we need that stability in the guideline structure.
However, we must acknowledge that we need to focus ever more upon the implementation of both the economic guidelines and in particular, perhaps, the employment guidelines.
The problem lies there: Member States are not implementing the guidelines properly.
Therefore, we have introduced a number of recitals that seek to focus upon key areas of implementation.
For example, Amendment 1 concentrates on research and development.
With the streamlining of the broad economic and employment guidelines we have every right to expect a comprehensive European framework for investment in lifelong learning, research and development and infrastructure to create a European Union engine for growth and to transform that growth into full and better employment and more social cohesion.
That is what the Lisbon process is about and we are falling far short of that at the moment.
In our Amendment 2 we focus on a couple of issues highlighted by the Employment Task Force â the Kok report â namely adaptability and lifelong learning.
They are there in the employment guidelines.
However, we must acknowledge that in all the national plans, to a greater or lesser extent, there are failures in achieving the targets laid down in those respects.
Amendment 3 concerns taking possession of the delivery of guidelines by national parliaments, social partners, NGOs, and local and regional authorities.
We need to encourage those tiers of government to take possession of the guidelines and ensure their proper implementation.
I particularly welcome Mrs Hermange's Amendment 6 on better harnessing of the structural funds for delivery of the guidelines.
I also welcome Amendment 7 to encourage companies to better anticipate economic, technical and industrial change.
Throughout this mandate, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has insisted on a proactive approach to the management of industrial change.
She is right to make that call.
Finally, I know that Mr Bushill-Matthews intends to table an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce.
We would be happy to accept such an amendment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for a sterling piece of work.
I wish in particular to recognise MrsÂ Randzio-Plathâs solid work on this report.
She has also done some sterling work for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Your chairmanship, MrsÂ Randzio-Plath, has been characterised by impartiality, knowledge and professionalism.
I am quite sure that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will miss you.
Thank you.
The EU economy still suffers major problems.
Overall growth has not achieved the rate we had desired and expected.
Even if the American economy is improving all the time, many problems remain.
The double deficit and the political uncertainty are undermining economic strength.
Nor is growth in the eurozone impressive.
We are well aware of the current figures.
When it comes to the EU of the Fifteen, it emerges that the countries concerned have greater economic strength, with growth of 2% this year and 2.4% next year.
Things are significantly better in the new Member States, with growth of 3.5% this year and, on average, 4% next year.
Those are figures we can virtually only dream about in the EU of the Fifteen.
We know that the changes in the new Member States have been very far-reaching and often painful.
The trend is manifestly in the right direction, even if a number of objections may be raised and caution recommended in the manner, for example, of todayâs statement by the International Monetary Fund.
The EU of the Fifteen should be able to learn more from the new Member States with a view to giving impetus to the economy.
The competition and the increasing market that is now opening up are to everyoneâs advantage.
Instead of criticising countries like Slovakia and Estonia which have reduced their taxes and in that way created room for growth, we should see what we can learn from their having done this.
Above all, it would be devastating if, in an attempt to standardise and direct the national economies, the EU were to force the new countries to introduce tax increases and extensive welfare reforms at a rate that they themselves are not in favour of.
Certainly, competition will become tougher.
It has done so already.
Corporation tax in the new Member States is lower than in our own countries, but healthy competition is to be welcomed.
There is still a need for structural reforms in quite a few of the Member States.
We know who the sinners are, and the list of these will unfortunately become longer.
The Netherlands and Great Britain are next to be added.
Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, we think that this has operated well.
It is already flexible.
Certainly, the rules can be reviewed, but
We Liberals believe that Europe can extricate itself from these economic problems but, if it is to do so, more must be done.
The Lisbon process must be implemented in full.
The Liberal recipe for enabling the EU Member States to obtain growth and more jobs involves sound public finances, increased competition, completion of the internal market in all its aspects and structural reforms for the future.
We shall not support the extra amendments in MrsÂ Randzio-Plathâs report, but we are prepared to support the rapporteurâs balanced assessment.
MrÂ President, we face huge challenges in Europe, but the opportunities in the new Europe are so much greater.
Peace, freedom, democracy and social and economic stability now dominate Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we agree that things are going very badly for Europe.
MrsÂ Randzio-Plathâs excellent report documents how dreadfully bad matters look.
That applies particularly to Europe and not to the whole world.
It must therefore have something to do with specifically European conditions.
I am among those who believe that it has to do with the Stability and Growth Pact and with the policy linked to the Stability and Growth Pact.
As long as the pact prevails, there is little help to be found.
We have a low level of investment and a lack of growth and dynamism, meaning in actual fact that we have a surplus of capital.
This capital then has to leave Europe in order to find more profitable investment opportunities.
We also have a tragic surplus of labour in the form of people who are unemployed.
I do not believe we can break this pattern unless we also abandon the Stability and Growth Pact and, instead, begin to think in terms of public investment as practised in the Keynesian tradition.
It is nowadays forbidden to talk about Keynes, but I think it incredibly important to begin to debate Keynes and post-Keynesianism.
The fact that this is not being done must be due to a kind of ideological block.
I cannot see how it could be otherwise.
Our having a sound employment policy does not help much as long as those with education and qualifications are not given jobs.
Companies do not want them.
We need to pin our hopes on public investment.
I believe, above all, that we are concerned here not only with infrastructure but also, to a large extent, with the consumption of public services.
This needs to be increased.
I also believe â and this is another matter that is not allowed to be discussed â that there is a place for reducing working hours in order to get more people into work.
We should then obtain a better balance and be able to increase work productivity.
Such measures are needed if we are to get anywhere, but as long as neo-liberal politics dominates, matters will, unfortunately, continue to go badly for Europe.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, my fellow Members will not be surprised if I tell you straightaway that I am in almost complete disagreement with my esteemed Liberal fellow Memberâs intervention.
I think that, at the end of this legislature, it is time to briefly take stock of economic policy in the European Union.
Economic policy includes a Lisbon agenda whose philosophy we could certainly share, but whose implementation is, in fact, deeply unbalanced, since it concentrates on the liberalisation of the sectors and neglects the social and environmental objectives included in the agenda.
There is, however, another part that is definitely lacking, and this is macroeconomic policy at European Union level, which, if it exists at all, does so only through a Stability and Growth pact.
The policy that has been followed in recent years, particularly by France and Germany, has consisted of making an effort in relation to budgetary policy, in an attempt to reduce deficits and debt at the same time as decreasing public revenue, in the hope that this can all be resolved by an increase in growth.
This scenario did not work.
We have very weak growth, increasing unemployment and an increase in disparity in income between different social groups, with no reduction in exclusion and poverty, in one of the richest regions of the world.
I think that there are alternatives.
These have been discussed within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but without success, or at least without achieving a majority.
There are alternatives that consist, in particular, of making efforts in relation to supply, certainly, but also substantial efforts in relation to spending.
Is it normal that European savings should be financing an increase in military spending in the United States?
I formulate the problem in these terms, which is how it must be formulated.
There is, therefore, room for a relaunched neo-Keynesian policy, which relies fully on the size of the internal market within the context of a Union of twenty-five and on the need to increase public and private investments.
Maybe the growth initiative is moving in the right direction, but it is inadequate in terms of both quantity and quality.
We need to coordinate the budgetary policies of the Member States and the social and environmental convergence rules, particularly concerning working conditions, salary progression â yes, salary progression â and the environment.
Finally, I would like to end on the fiscal issue.
It is a point we have discussed at great length.
I would simply like to tell Mr Schmidt that I was struck by a French Press Agency dispatch, a statement by the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, which said that if the candidate countries continued to decrease corporate tax as they were doing, it would no longer be possible to agree to finance these candidate countries through the structural funds.
We would do well to think about this kind of observation, and I maintain â and I am weighing my words carefully here â that those who do not want to subject corporate tax to the system of qualified majority voting laid down in the European Constitution are irresponsible and will have to face ever harsher scenarios of fiscal competition, which will unravel our systems of social protection.
Â Â  Madam President, last Tuesday Mr Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, gave a speech about the European economy.
He appeared to be very concerned at the slow recovery of economic growth.
I share that concern, as growth is taking too long to appear.
A passive attitude will do nothing to encourage growth.
We need action, and that is just what we do not see.
According to Mr Trichet â and I agree with him â we agree in Europe as to our diagnosis, but â and here I go further than Mr Trichet â our political input is not producing solutions.
I want to urge the Member States to overlook their differences once and for all and take action.
Countries like China and India will miss no opportunity to forge ahead of us.
Action will be hard and demand political sacrifices, but waiting longer would be irresponsible.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to confine my remarks to the Hermange report, and start by saying this is not the speech that I had intended to make.
I had hoped to be in a position to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report.
It was an excellent report but by the time it came out of our committee earlier this week a lot of the more excellent parts of it were unfortunately removed.
What is left is still very useful, very positive, but it is a pale shadow of the excellent and very thorough work that she had put in.
Unfortunately her amendments were voted out by the PSE Group who were there in strength on Monday.
Unfortunately, apart from herself and one other Group Vice President from the PPE-DE Group, I was the only representative of our Group there.
I have no quibble with the Socialists for what they did in pursuing their agenda.
They happen to believe they are right in saying there should be no legislative changes and I am not going to debate that particular point now.
I congratulate them for their single-mindedness and the efficiency with which they pursued it.
However, I do say to our colleagues, particularly our absent colleagues from this side of the House, that if we care about employment, as we do; if we care about unemployment, as we do; if we care about the social injustice that flows from unemployment, as we do; then we must be prepared to make this area a priority.
Although there is work simultaneously in other Committees, we have to make certain that we can stand up to be counted, so that our view may prevail in these meetings and so that we can drive change.
Change is important on the issues of employment guidelines; I was delighted that the Commissioner again reinforced the importance of the Lisbon Agenda, to which all sides of the House have agreed.
However, if we are to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, it is not good enough simply to say that the guidelines will not change before 2006.
Similarly, it is not good enough to say it is entirely up to Member States to make changes and implement the guidelines.
The guidelines need to be strengthened and refocused and there is a lot of work both to do and to undo in this House in order to give more impetus to the Lisbon process.
Finally, I would like to thank Stephen Hughes for saying that he is in full agreement of an oral amendment, which I believe the rapporteur will also support, concerning the importance of elderly people, which I will be proposing later this morning.
I am delighted to have that agreement; I hope that augurs well for our relationship in the coming mandate.
I know that Stephen Hughes hopes to be back; I also hope to be back, but next time with more support.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many months the Group of the Party of European Socialists has been calling for an adaptation of the Stability and Growth Pact to the economic cycles.
On different occasions, I have been able to develop, on behalf of my group, specific proposals to reform the Pact in order to turn it into the instrument of a European policy of growth and stability.
Thus, we recommend greater stringency when the economic climate is good.
It would be a case of, for example, requiring the Member States to have a balanced budget when growth exceeds, let us say, 3%, even if it allows them greater infrastructural spending flexibility at the time of an economic turnaround.
Our objective is the transposition of the British golden rule to European level.
The Christian Social Prime Minister of Luxembourg, MrÂ Jean-Claude Juncker, has just taken up the Socialist proposals again.
In an interview for the newspaper , he recommends that the Pact should be more flexible when the economic climate is poor and stricter when the economic climate is good.
At the recent Ecofin Council, the theory that it would be necessary to reform the Pact in 2005 gained ground.
The Socialists will bring their constructive participation to this necessary reform, but Mr Juncker will have difficulty persuading his colleagues in the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who demonstrate almost religious dogmatism in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact.
In fact, stability without growth will only increase the economic and social problems of the European Union.
In this respect, I recommend that you read the paper of Professor Jean-Paul Fitoussi for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
This paper broadly demonstrates that the Stability and Growth Pact has slowed, and continues to slow, growth in Europe.
The Pact is particularly harmful to the large European economies, whose economic activity depends more on internal stimulation than that of the small countries, who depend more on external demand.
This certainly explains the fact that the small countries seem more virtuous in relation to stability than the large countries, whether the large countries are governed by the left or the right.
Stability and Growth Pact reform is, therefore, not a question of politicking, but rather a vital necessity for a Europe that is losing the fight for growth and employment.
Madam President, allow me to address a final word of thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Mrs Randzio-Plath will no longer be part of the next Parliament, which saddens me greatly.
With her, we will lose a woman who was committed to the euro, to a social Europe and to a Europe of growth and employment.
I think that I speak on behalf of all our fellow Members in thanking her publicly for her work at the head of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Goebbels, for the words that you have just addressed to our fellow Member, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who has worked so hard within this Parliament and in the service of Europe.
Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Â Â  I too, Madam President, would like to take the opportunity during these last sittings to congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath on her work and to offer her my friendship again, as well as Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels and the others.
We have not only deplored the European Unionâs situation of profound underemployment and weak growth, but we have sought to build an economic policy at European Union level.
In order to overcome the various obstacles, I too would like, moreover, now to put forward some political objectives.
The first is that we must first of all seize the opportunity that enlargement offers.
The new Member States want growth and they need solidarity.
Just like us, and even more so, it is in their interest that the enlarged Europe be a much more dynamic region of the world.
The fears of the West must, therefore, be dispelled and common interest built, which means that positive mobility, restructuring and specialisation strategies that enable human and productive capacities in the East and the West to be increased are essential.
How, though, are these to be brought about?
The second objective is to create new options in the debate on structural reforms.
How can investment be encouraged?
Two ways are possible.
Only the first of these is being used at the moment: the drawing power of capital for high profitability, with fiscal and statutory competition.
Failure is inevitable.
Another way is to be opened up.
Indeed, we must issue the challenge of a new mixed economy, a mixed economy of multinational cooperation, founded on policies of partnership and networks.
This is the structural reform that Europe needs and that we will have to devise.
The third objective is the renewal of the macroeconomic framework.
The Lisbon strategy chose good objectives and a good driving force, but its guidelines are still very ambiguous and it has not found the tools to work with.
The greatest ambiguity reigns as regards its interpretation.
National policies differ.
The redefinition of this policy must be at the heart of the agenda of the next few years, particularly in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact.
I think that with a good European budget and fiscal harmonisation, we would indeed be in a better position to resolve the problems relating to the reduction of national public deficits.
Finally, my last point is a question of method.
The Member States have got an absolute nerve: they do not respect the Lisbon strategy; they do not take it on board.
We must build up the responsibility of the national parliaments and envisage reinforced cooperation in the field of economics, but it is particularly amongst the players of civil society, amongst businesses and territorial communities, that we suffer most from a loss of profit.
There is a mass of activities to start, but a great backlog of projects and of players.
European policy is only possible on the basis of decentralised participation.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to make a few comments regarding the procedure we have followed so far, because that is where the necessary difficulties have arisen.
I should also like to say something about Lisbon, about Mr Kok's report on the quality of work, about China and India, and finally about the amendments.
As regards procedure, I think that this is the second or third time that we have realised how little time we have when it comes to determining employment guidelines.
This causes conflicts among us, beyond the normal political differences, as to how the guidelines should be interpreted, how they should be amended, what needs to be changed and so on.
I would suggest a different approach next year; that is a piece of advice to the future presidencies of the Council and to the Commission.
It is vital to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to play its role under the Treaty, namely commenting in an appropriate manner, so that we need not vote down a series of votes on a pile of amendments, which, let me put it this way, are not in the correct procedural order.
I also wonder whether the triennial procedure we have adopted is the most sensible approach.
Given the fast pace of change in the economy, and in view of the fact that the Commission soon had to adjust its optimistic outlook and accept that things were not going as smoothly as expected, I think that we need to have the opportunity to alter some important aspects of these economic and employment guidelines.
I would also like to point out a major shortcoming in the Treaty.
It needs to be said.
According to the definition, employment guidelines are, in fact, subordinate to economic guidelines.
We do not want that.
It causes all kinds of problems, for example when liberalisation is on the agenda, but it also means that all kinds of other measures are put forward that have their impact in this way.
I agree with what a number of other speakers who have already taken the floor, including Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels, have said on this point.
Little progress has been made since Lisbon.
This has been commented on in our committee as well.
We have achieved little on poverty and on the participation of older people and women in the workforce.
There has been some progress, but far too little and we must really revise the guidelines.
We should revise the Lisbon agreements in the light of various factors, including the evolution of the economy.
Against that background the position adopted in the Kok report, namely that we must achieve better implementation of the agreements in their entirety, is welcome.
That is what the Council was supposed to be doing.
I wonder whether it is enough though.
Mr Kok proposes discussing and encouraging flexibility and security.
He certainly addresses the issue of flexibility, but I see nothing about security.
Both Germany and the UK are still blocking the Temporary Agency Workers Directive.
That is not in keeping with the principle of promoting the quality of work, also one of Mr Kok's ideas.
In other words, I think we must look carefully at this and that we should get back to, for instance, the proposals of the Belgian Presidency on the quality of work.
That was a useful report, not only with regard to a simple category like job satisfaction.
I also think that we should look not only to the United States but also to developments in China and India.
We are currently facing massive off-shore outsourcing with all its consequences.
Finally I should like to thank all those who have cooperated during this last term in office.
I can also tell you that the Group of the Greens will support the amendments submitted by Ms Hermange and probably also the oral amendment tabled by Mr Bushill-Matthews.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to join in the words that have been spoken on the subject of Mrs Randzio-Plath.
I was her first vice-chairman for two and a half years.
I was able to appreciate both her rigour and her courtesy, even if, as you know, our ideas scarcely brought us together.
I was also pleased to hear Mr Goebbels speaking of the harmful aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact.
When I spoke in similar terms within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs three or four years ago, I think my fellow Members were shocked.
It is now clear that, in fact, I was right and that the Stability and Growth Pact is a corset that is far too tight for growth, investment and employment to be able to develop in Europe.
There is, however, in my opinion, another subject that weighs down European growth, and I think that this is the euro.
In order to be convinced, we need only see that the three countries of the Union that have not adopted the euro and have preserved their monetary sovereignty are doing much better than the twelve that have chosen, within the framework of the European currency, to link their destinies and to entrust them to a veritable State Bank, a supreme bank that does not care two hoots about growth in Europe.
I hope the subject of the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign.
I do not know if, like Mrs Randzio-Plath, I will not return.
Personally, I hope to return, but it is far from certain.
That said, I very much hope that the consequences of choosing the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign since, in my view, this is the main problem between Europe and its citizens today.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, despite all its successes, lives with the worry of creating new jobs, because this is one of the fundamental rights of European citizens and is also the best precondition for growth and social cohesion between us.
The employment guidelines and the Luxembourg procedure in general are very important in achieving this objective, which is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs always examines them with close interest.
Our rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, has taken the right approach, for which we thank and congratulate her.
I could reiterate many of the positions formulated by my fellow Members; however, I shall comment for my part on certain points which I consider should be highlighted.
First, increasing employment is a highly complex procedure and policy.
It affects all sectors of economic policy, of social policy, of education policy, of vocational training, of transparency, of the fight against tax evasion and of undeclared work.
Research and innovation have been particularly highlighted recently.
This was, in fact, a decision by the recent spring Council and I thank the rapporteur for accepting my amendment on the subject, which calls for proper coordination of all these policies when designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the application of the guidelines.
This coordination policy is very important to the new Member States, which are being called on to adopt European results in their internal policies.
We also note that the countries in which there is no proper coordination have the worst performance records in the field of increasing employment.
Coordination and complementarity are needed both between European policies and national policies at all levels â central, regional, local â and between all the agencies involved.
I agree with the rapporteur's proposals about transparency and simpler procedures and about information on making the best possible use of the structural funds.
Another issue on which I want to comment is the issue of structural reform, mainly in the fiscal sector and in the social security sector.
It would appear that this issue, however necessary everyone considers it to be, is not easy.
It demands a political price, it needs to be distilled by society and matured and this is not happening to the required extent.
The assent which we set forth as policy, in order to have meaning and be successful, needs properly informed and prepared citizens, responsible social partners and serious effort if the results of our policies are to become visible and if we are to create trust in our chosen objectives and procedures.
Â Â  Madam President, Mrs Hermange has produced a valuable report and notwithstanding the comments by Mr Bushill-Matthews the emphasis remains on implementation.
Implementation is key to the employment guidelines and to the Lisbon process.
Why is it so important for us?
We understand that not only have the Lisbon guidelines not been pursued and that progress is slow but also, as Mr Dimas commented, the new Member States have to do what we have to do and they have the same problems.
Unfortunately size does matter in a situation where we must keep to the employment guidelines and yet overall unemployment and the budget deficit in the new Member States are roughly double that of the EU 15.
Size definitely matters.
That is why implementation is key, rather than new guidelines.
Implementation is important, as some people have touched on â in Amendment 5 for example, concerning youth unemployment and as regards women in the workplace â but we also have to look at the issue of older workers, the rapidly ageing population of working age.
Also, as was briefly mentioned by the chair of our committee, the job shocks that our regions are now facing, such as the outsourcing and offshoring of work â issues that this House is at last taking seriously â will have to be incorporated into the Lisbon goals.
I am sure Mr Dimas will take account of that in his work in the coming months.
The big issue here is to ensure not only that implementation is key, but also that there is better understanding among the main players â the trade unions and business organisations â of what the strategy is.
This clearly does not yet exist in Member States.
It is vital with regard to this issue, which is one of the last the Committee on Employment will address before the end of the mandate, that we register that the players concerned by this Lisbon goal are insufficiently aware of the strategy being pursued.
Also important are the quality of lifelong learning and the regional impact of issues like equal funding and market discrimination.
All of these issues are vital and must remain within the Lisbon goal and the employment guidelines.
We must strengthen implementation. That is the key to today's debate and I welcome Mrs Hermange's report for that reason.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, MrsÂ Hermange and MrsÂ Randzio-Plath, but shall confine myself to commenting on MrsÂ Hermangeâs report.
Although the recent reforms of the employment guidelines were a positive step, it now seems clear that the European Union will not achieve the Lisbon goals set for 2010.
The employment rate at the moment is 64%; achieving 70% by 2010 would entail creating 22Â million jobs in the new 25-Member European Union.
Only through the development of competitiveness and growth potential will Europe achieve this rise in employment and productivity.
The 2004 Spring Summit therefore drew up employment recommendations with the aim of highlighting priority areas for action by each Member State and underlining the need to strengthen the exchange of good practice and experience, which have a fundamental role in European employment strategy.
I support Marie-ThÃ©rÃšse Hermangeâs excellent report, which highlights the need to make more effective use of all available instruments, the effort to implement what has already been agreed and the mobilisation of all the players involved.
My country, for instance, Portugal, is well on the way to meeting the Lisbon employment objectives, even though it has recently seen its unemployment rate go up, mainly because certain multinationals have pulled out.
Even so, the unemployment rate is below the Community average.
As for the objectives of promoting the employment of women and older workers, Portugal has exceeded them.
Let us not evade the issues, however: the economic environment we have in Europe today is very different from the one that formed the backdrop to the Lisbon Summit in 2000.
The economic and financial situation in certain Member States demands tough policies to curb public spending and, most of all, structural reforms as a precondition for economic growth and job creation.
Those Member States that remain courageous enough during this economic slowdown not to give in to easy solutions and undertake the necessary reforms of employment legislation, social security schemes, and so on, deserve not reprimands but encouragement and incentives for their ability to reform.
I am certain that without structural reforms Europe will not achieve the levels of growth needed to implement the Lisbon objectives.
Â Â  â Madam President, Romano Prodi recently stated that recovery in Germany and Italy is non-existent, which means that this year will see a continuation of all the same old uncertainties, doubts and risks as to economic recovery in the euro zone.
All this statement does is carry over the pessimistic forecasts made by the Commission for 2004 into the political field.
This then is the background against which we must analyse how Europeâs economic situation develops in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines.
We cannot continue to dodge the issue.
We do in fact have at our disposal powerful theoretical instruments, such as those resulting from the Lisbon Strategy or arising from the good practice associated with economic policy coordination.
We also have powerful limitations, however, such as those resulting from too strict an interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which demolish all the efforts we make.
The issue is becoming more and more political, or, put another way, a matter of choices, and while it is true that there can only be long-term, sustainable economic development with financial consolidation, it is also true that there will be no financial consolidation, even in the short term, without economic growth.
Europe needs a new agenda, focusing on the problems of the economy and employment, in place of the current agenda, focusing on the budget deficit and public spending, which have become a veritable obsession.
What Europe really needs is structural reforms, but it also needs the financial means to carry them through.
In the early stages there will always be an increase in public spending or a reduction in revenue, and that can only be possible with a profound change in the budgetary rules in force.
It is at this point that delays begin to occur to the proposals for a review of the Stability and Growth Pact announced by the Commission, especially if these proposals focus on the essence and are not confined to sweetening the regulatory aspects of control.
Reform of the SGP is inevitable, partly because this instrument has, strictly speaking, been suspended since 25 November.
The new rules can no longer ignore the changes in the economic cycle, or fail to take account of each Member Stateâs individual situation without prejudice to the efforts to achieve budget conciliation for the whole euro zone.
They certainly can no longer ignore the role of public investment and quality spending in the framework of development.
Aiming at a zero budget deficit in the euro zone over the long term is complete folly, is not supported by any economic theory and would result in the absurdity of a public debt that would, after all, be no better than zero.
I believe these concerns are to be found in the excellent report tabled by Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath, to whom I offer my warmest wishes, because the dealings I have had with her over the last three years have shown her to be a woman who is capable, competent, determined and profoundly pro-European.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, may I begin by congratulating Mrs. Hermange on her good work and on the quality of the report, which by now has become customary.
Much has been done in Europe in recent years concerning employment.
