We cannot satisfy everyone; that would be a miracle.
However, I do protest against what has been said by the Polish here, that somebody is suffering discrimination.
There is no discrimination against anyone.
On the contrary, a proposal has been put forward, which is plausible and adheres to objective criteria, on the basis of which the seats we have can be distributed.
We must, however, continue a debate which our Italian colleagues have started, namely the debate as to whether the concept of citizenship in the European Union is the same as the concept of citizenship at national level.
The nation state has closed the borders and excluded all others.
The EU is based on a different concept and we are in fact broadening this debate in order that all residents of the EU are represented by us and not just those in possession of a Member State's passport.
There are 30 million in the EU who do not have the passport of a Member State, but who abide by our laws.
We shall be coming back to this once again next time.
Thank you for this proposal, which now brings us on track to a successful conclusion for the Intergovernmental Conference and for a new European treaty.
Madam President, I would just like to say to Mr Stubb that Lithuania does not gain in any of the cases he gave.
(LT) I would like to say to Mr Alexander that Lithuania will have the same number of seats in all three cases, because in the first case it is determined, in the second case it is determined, and in the third case...
When we are debating here as Parliament (as the President of the Parliament is not in the chair for this important session), when we are debating about Parliament and I do not see Mr Lamassoure.
Is he here in the Chamber?
Why should we talk?
The key individuals have left.
Everything is obvious.
I speak about this because we really have to talk about a common home, a common Europe, and hear every voice of every country.
The problem of my country is that we have fought for our survival for many centuries.
We are a small nation.
Now many people live in other countries, they work in your enterprises and, practically speaking, they will be unable to solve Europe's problems.
We try to maintain a relationship, to be together, to be a nation and will not disappear from the map, but these people will not be able to vote because the number of Members of the European Parliament will be set in respect of the number of citizens, yet they live in your country, Alexander, as well as Great Britain and Ireland and they work there honestly.
Of course, they can elect the representatives of Sweden, Finland, Britain or Italy, but in this way we are simply declining as a nation.
So this is the most important issue that makes me worry and am so sorry that, as Mr Lamassoure says, in this Chamber we really talk little about values.
Today's debate is a perfect example.
Looking at the surnames, I know who has got how many seats and I can say in advance what opinions will be presented.
(PL) Madam President, I have long since become used to the flagrant hypocrisy that prevails in this House.
But today I would like to ask one question.
Alright, what you want, as I am hearing from most of the speeches that have been made, is for there to be a change in the voting principles and the allocation of seats in the European Parliament so that citizenship of a given country should not be decisive, in other words you are saying that we are already looking at an integrated European people with a unified standard and unified interests.
This then is a European people.
I would like to ask all you hypocrites how it can be that poor old Poland has only one third of the agricultural subsidies, that the Germans, the richest of all, despite the common energy policy, want to negotiate over the heads of other states with Russia and run a pipeline under the sea, with its threat to environmental protection?
Can these two things be reconciled?
And if what I say is true, then is it not too early yet to create the myth of a European state?
We need to work towards it, but slowly and systematically, whilst accelerated actions of this type can only lead to results that are the opposite of what is intended.
(ES) Madam President, I understand the difficulty of the undertaking, and I acknowledge and commend the work done by the rapporteurs.
However, on some points the proposal for the distribution of seats that they make is, in my opinion, too discretionary and also does not take sufficient account of the necessary institutional balance inherited from the current Treaty of Nice.
Some MEPs have therefore signed amendments that will be submitted to the plenary tomorrow and which, I would like to stress, fully respect the principle of degressive proportionality; and also in our view, they objectivise the allocation of seats for the future, linking it to clear and transparent criteria.
One of these amendments, which I should like to focus on, which would enter into force in the 2009 elections, is in line with one of the most prudent studies produced by the Spanish Government and sent to Parliament and the Council.
As you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, I am not guilty of defending the proposals of the current Spanish Government for partisan reasons, but what is true is that, in this case, the demographic factor is taken into greater account, and it should be considered to be essential in shaping the institution that represents the interests of the people.
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask the rapporteurs to take them into consideration, and my fellow members to vote for them, and in any case, I hope that they will be submitted, defended and taken into account by the European Council when it makes its decision next week.
(ES) Madam President, this was not an easy undertaking, and I think that Mr Lamassoure, from the Group of the European People's Party, and Mr Severin, from the Socialist Group, have presented us with a magnificent report that has a profound sense of being European and pro-European.
Mr Stubb is right: this is one of the saddest debates that I have attended in this House, but I hope that tomorrow the result of the vote on this report will be one of the best moments that we experience, because this report, which is not only theirs but also belongs to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with 70 % support, firstly responds to what the Council has asked of this House; secondly applies the principle of degressive proportionality, thirdly, guarantees a representative Parliament, something that would have been impossible with the Treaty of Nice, partly because under this treaty, in an unjustifiable and unjustified way, some countries like Spain ended up with no proportional logic in terms of their representation.
Fortunately, the proposal by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, adequately resolves this problem.
This is the question: either this report or Nice.
Either this report, with a representative Parliament, or Nice, with a Parliament that is not fully representative.
All the promises we want can be made about this, but, of course, what we need is a realistic report so that at the Lisbon Summit, Parliament will have its efforts recognised, and also supported along with the adoption of the new Reform Treaty.
Thank you very much.
(DE) Madam President, allow me to begin by saying that the Members of the Free Democrat Party (FDP) have allowed a free vote for tomorrow.
There will therefore be no party line.
Why is this so?
There is a dilemma.
The situation for Germany is, of course, deteriorating.
Instead of the 832 000 voters per MEP to date, there will now be 858 000.
Parliament wants to make this happen from 2009 onwards.
This will not happening in the Council until 2014.
Reference is being made to this among other things.
Even good German newspapers like the Berlin Tagesspiegel write that the seats are being redistributed tomorrow.
There are fellow Members here in Parliament who are saying: Germany will lose three seats tomorrow.
The problem is - and this now skips to the part by which I personally stand - this is wrong.
The Lamassoure/Severin report secures the highest possible number of seats that Germany is able to have under the Treaty.
The Treaty of Nice already stipulates that there is a maximum of 96 seats.
The report clearly endorses this.
Why, then, this debate?
Why the provocation with the d'Hondt method, in which only the larger countries gain and the smaller ones lose massively?
It is a proposal backed, even initiated, by fellow Members from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to my great surprise.
What does it actually mean?
I believe that it is an un-European proposal.
The balance, the just and fair balance between large, medium-sized and small countries, is lost here.
What is more it is a proposal, which does not have the slightest chance in the Council.
Do we and our fellow Members in the CDU therefore really believe that in Belgium, Ireland, Sweden or Estonia they cannot carry out any analyses and they will vote for this proposal in the Council?
No!
This proposal is an empty bubble, which is being replaced without any consequence - with one exception.
This consequence is a further deterioration in the atmosphere as regards European policy at home in Germany.
We should support the Lamassoure/Severin Report.
We should ensure that a strong political signal goes out from the European Parliament to the Council that we are able to deal with the problems ourselves.
If this signal, a European signal, is strong, it is good for us all and I expressly include Germany in this.
(NL) Madam President, as has already been said repeatedly in this House, it is ultimately Parliament's credibility that is at stake in this debate.
At issue is its ability to carry out its task of presenting a proposal with a broad majority, thus making it difficult for the Council to disregard the proposal.
The virtue of the Lamassoure/Severin report is that, pragmatically, it makes a proposal that meets all the requirements of the Treaty.
There are not four alternatives, but in fact only two, namely the Lamassoure/Severin report or Nice.
After all, if we fail to win the support of a broad majority for a proposal, so will the Council, and we will revert to Nice.
I do not really understand a number of the amendments tabled.
Although it is clear that the square root amendment strongly supports the smaller countries, this is actually a caricature of proportionality.
Nor do I understand, however, the amendment instigated mainly by German Members, which takes no account of the position of the smaller countries and requests that more opportunities be given to the larger Member States in the Council.
Am I to understand, perhaps, that this is a vicious way of returning to Nice and restoring 99 seats to Germany?
If that is the case, I find it very debilitating for this Parliament.
I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament understands that its credibility is at stake, and that this can only be retained by supporting the Lamassoure/Severin report with a broad majority, as that is the only realistic amendment.
(PL) Madam President, it is hard for me to accept a report according to which my country - I should say, and I shall say, the Polish people, as it is they who elect their representatives - loses the opportunity to elect three additional MEPs.
That is by how much the Polish representation in the European Parliament is diminished under the proposal that has been tabled today.
Why do I think that this is unfair, and why do I think that the criteria adopted in this report failed to take into account such obvious facts as those which my fellow Member from Lithuania has already mentioned today?
This is about workers, about employees, about Poles who are temporarily living abroad - 3 million Poles abroad.
Let us assume they have a right to vote in Great Britain or Ireland, but they come home.
My question is: who is going to represent them?
They are deprived of the right of representation even if they had a right to vote.
This report, and this is my second point, accentuates the institutional imbalance which has existed to date, fragile though it may have been, between the position of the states in the Council and in Parliament.
Poland is losing the most in the Council with the transition to double majority voting, and it also loses out in Parliament.
My final point concerns a certain imbalance that has been spoken of here today, in the employment of officials in EU institutions, and especially in Parliament.
This imbalance, which affects all the new Member States, could be ironed out here in Parliament.
I am requesting an amendment of this report.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, of course I realise that the task with which my fellow Members Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin were burdened was not easy, but I must say that the result, despite the efforts that have been made, leaves me rather perplexed, both from the legal viewpoint and in purely political terms.
The proposal refers for the first time to a criterion for calculation based on the resident population in each Member State, replacing the criterion of citizenship.
Here a problem of legal and political consistency arises as regards the provisions of the future Reform Treaty, and specifically Article 9A, which expressly sets out the principle of the representation of European citizens.
I also see the issue as political, partly because Parliament is making the function of the voice and the expression of citizens a little opaque - and what is more, at a time when the Union is undertaking to disseminate the culture of European citizenship, identity and the rights of European citizens.
And please do not take the issue back to the level of national claims or, worse, reduce it to a mere quantitative issue.
That would be a totally reductive and vulgar approach, and would in fact be ungenerous to the reputation of Italy.
I also note, however, a disparity in treatment; there is a lack of homogeneity between one bracket and another; in many cases the reference parameters do not justify the difference in the number of seats between one country and another.
I will finish, Madam President, by calling upon my fellow Members to vote in a way that is consistent with what is laid down by the Treaties and with what our role as members of parliament has been up until now and ought to continue to be: the expression of citizenship.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Stubb, who has unfortunately left, mentioned sadness this evening, and other Members have also expressed the same feelings.
I believe, however, that it is sad to see discrimination between countries and MEPs, particularly those who are trying to ensure that fundamental principles are observed, as Mr Voggenhuber and Mrs Muscardini rightly said.
Here, what is important is not to cast doubt upon the Lamassoure-Severin report; it is probably well constructed, albeit built upon a foundation of sand.
In fact, there is a legal principle whose import is being completely destroyed, and that is the principle of citizenship.
This point has also been made by those who have supported the report, as well as in the compromise proposals by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin; Mr Leinen mentioned it, and Mr Duff also put it excellently: here we are not sure of our electorate!
Still, on this total uncertainty over the electorate we wish to construct a criterion or a castle that has its own internal consistency - apart from the basis or foundation - and this will give us a composition that in no way respects pre-existing realities or the citizens.
It will also bring us, as a further consequence - and heed what I say, for I do not wish to be a prophet of doom - before the Court of Justice.
It is natural, and probably a duty, for those who find themselves injured to go before the courts as the extrema ratio, as the supreme decision-making body for such an important decision.
I appeal to my government, the government of my country, which has shown extreme weakness so far on this process, from the outset in Berlin, to finally rediscover its pride and exercise the right of veto on this proposal.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, between today and tomorrow we have a historic opportunity to influence the decision on the future composition of the European Parliament.
The report prepared for this purpose by the rapporteurs, Mr Lamassoure and Mr Severin, shows a good measure of quality, balance and responsibility.
It brings a pragmatic solution, which should be embraced unchallenged by the Intergovernmental Conference, as it does not constitute an obstacle to the adoption of the Reform Treaty.
The proposed distribution of seats in the European Parliament is based on the principle of digressive proportionality.
It is a just principle, which expresses solidarity between big, medium and small countries.
The proposed solution is also based on the principle of demographic realities of individual Member States.
Again this is a just and correct principle.
In spite of it, some Members expressed their disagreement with this solution.
They are of the opinion that their countries were discriminated against.
I, however, do not see any sign of discrimination.
Discrimination and inequality would be allocating the same number of seats to two countries with a difference in population of five million.
I trust that Parliament will grasp the historic opportunity tomorrow and adopt the Lamassoure and Severin report by a decisive majority.
Not supporting it would signal a return to Nice.
That is returning to an alternative, which would also represent a loss for those Members who only recently have been touting the slogan 'Nice or death'.
(PL) Madam President, today we are debating a very important report, on the basis of which the distribution of seats in the next term of Parliament is to be made.
The rapporteurs have put forward a proposal that is very interesting and certainly must have required a great deal of work, both analytical and conceptual.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to them for that.
But as far as I am concerned it does have two serious weaknesses.
Firstly, our fellow Members are proposing a solution that is ad hoc in nature, temporary, and solely for the next term.
However, I recall that when we began work on this report in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs we agreed that we would look for systemic solutions enabling an automatic change to be made to the composition of the Parliament when new states accede to the EU.
The alternative proposal announced by about 80 MEPs, including me, meets this condition.
Use of the d'Hondt method to calculate the number of votes from individual states is an objective instrument eliminating political horse-trading.
By accepting this amendment the European Parliament could become the first institution to rise above political and national disputes.
I accept a neutral, mathematical method of weighing the strength of individual countries.
This would be a step in the right direction and a model to follow for other multinational European institutions.
Another weakness in the conception presented is the lack of consistency in the approach to European citizens' rights.
These include the right to be represented in this forum.
In my view, the criterion of calculating the size of the Parliamentary representation from population numbers weakens this right.
For example, how are citizens of Poland who live and work in Ireland or Great Britain supposed to feel?
Various estimates suggest that there are between 2 and 3 million such people.
Under the electoral regulations that are binding in Poland, votes may be cast for candidates standing in Poland.
But if we take the criterion of population as is suggested in the report, as a result of people leaving the country the number of MEPs elected in my country is diminishing, while it is rising on the islands.
So who is going to represent them here in this forum?
Irish MEPs, or British, or Polish, of whom there will be fewer?
The report does not answer these questions.
In this context I feel it is essential for changes to be made to the report's text, and along with many fellow Members we shall be voting for certain amendments.
(EL) Madam President, it is widely accepted that the current distribution of seats in the European Parliament does not properly represent the demographic realities in the Member States and that the correlations are unfavourable for certain medium-sized and smaller countries.
The fact that the report does not reduce the number of seats laid down in the Treaty of Nice is certainly a positive one.
I must also stress, however, that in the case of Greece an increase in the number of seats provided for, from 22 to 23, would be absolutely fair, since the country's population exceeds by 10% that of other countries with the same number parliamentary seats.
I should like today, however, to focus mainly on the various amendments that have been tabled and which relate to the method of calculating the number of MEPs.
One issue is failing to assess the entire population of a country, but only its citizens.
I am in favour of the concept of the European citizen, but I disagree completely with its application here.
As an MEP, I feel that I represent those in the section of the population of my country: without necessarily being citizens of Greece or of Europe, they are bringing up our children, looking after our elderly people, building our houses, staffing our universities, contributing to the insurance system and sending their children to our schools.
Our decisions on the environment, services, immigration and insurance issues, and dozens of others, also in reality affect the lives of these fellow citizens of ours, who are, of course, often the least privileged.
I therefore believe it to be democratically imperative that the number of MEPs ought to be based on the total number of residents of a country.
(DE) Madam President, today's debate on the future composition of the European Parliament has unfortunately not been a highlight in the history of European democracy.
It is perhaps good that neither the Commission nor the Council have found the time to listen to it.
We have had to listen to speakers who have put forward principles with a very great deal of pathos, principles which have still not brought us any further forward in practical terms and which therefore have nothing to offer apart from pathos.
We have actually heard very many speakers who have focused on their own national interests.
This has certainly been no way to success in the search for a European solution and as such, will probably not bring us any closer to a solution either.
Thankfully we have also heard some who have been pragmatic and looked for comprehensible solutions and therefore in the proposal of both our rapporteurs - Alain Lamassoure und Adrian Severin - have found a suitable base.
I believe we should express our sincere thanks to both rapporteurs for the work they have done in committee as well as in what follows next.
This is something that Mediterranean courteousness would normally always demand, but in this specific case both rapporteurs have really earned these thanks.
From someone who does not come from the Mediterranean, therefore, my sincere thanks to you.
I hope and am also looking forward to us perhaps experiencing an historic moment for this Parliament tomorrow at the vote.
That is, if we manage to get clear and definite majorities for the proposal by Messrs Lamassoure and Severin and are thus able to give another clear signal to the Council.
The European Parliament has at any rate put forward a sensible base for the 2009 elections.
(EL) Mr President, in order correctly to assess the report by the two rapporteurs, Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure, we need to take into account certain facts and to apply certain rules.
First of all, we must approach the report in a European manner, not a nationalistic one.
If we fail to do so, we will be faced with competition over which country gets more seats and which fewer.
Secondly, we must take into account certain facts, for example the European Parliament is not deciding today on the composition of Parliament, but is making a proposal to the Council.
The Council has a certain margin and foundation on which to build, even it is based on the past, which we may think is not particularly well-balanced.
In addition to this, we have to apply the arithmetical facts we have been given.
There are 750 MEPs, 96 per country at most and 6 per country as a minimum.
We cannot also start bargaining about parts of the population which are inside and outside.
We ought to reach a compromise based on the existing situation in line with the population and with what applies to other sectors.
We are not here to re-found the EU.
When we do, let us use different calculations.
What matters today, therefore, is that we reach a result which has the widest possible support from the European Parliament, so that we retain our credibility and at the same time open up the way for European and not nationalistic movements.
Let me appeal here to the esteemed Germans, who have always been generous; besides, if in the past they had displayed the tendency they have today we would have no EU.
I also appeal to my fellow Members from the other states, so that tomorrow we can adopt the Lamassoure and Severin report with the greatest possible majority.
Mr President, once we move away from strict proportionality in elections, we inevitably end up applying political compromise rather than pure mathematics.
The democratic principle that all votes should have equal weight is something that cannot be applied until such time as the European Union becomes a fully federal system.
Within the limits set by the Council, this political compromise by Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure is a reasonable and well-balanced effort to achieve fair play and solidarity for all the people of the European Union.
I support it, and I oppose the alternative systems that are being proposed as less fair and less balanced.
But, because some have approached this exercise as a national ego trip, it needs to be emphasised that we are dealing here with how citizens elect their representatives to this Parliament according to their political preferences, to act as a co-legislator with the Council; it is the Council that represents the state, and not this House.
(MT) Like the European Constitution, the Reform Treaty will introduce the principle that a Member State, no matter how small, should have adequate representation and cannot have less than six seats in the European Parliament.
Malta, my country, which at the moment has five seats, will increase to six seats.
This gain will heal a wound, as it were, that happened no less than seven years ago when in the Treaty of Nice Malta was given five seats instead of six, like Luxembourg, which has the same population.
Six seats instead of five means a 20% increase in representation and it also means that the Maltese Members in this Chamber will be in a better position to perform Parliamentary duties that are always on the increase.
Suffice to say that in this House we have more than 20 Parliamentary committees which, with six MEPs, it is very difficult to keep up with.
With five it is impossible.
These Committees are now preparing laws that bind all citizens including Maltese citizens and it is appropriate that the citizens of each country, even the smallest countries, are in an adequate position, in a good and reasonable position to be represented and heard in each of these committees.
Even more so when one considers that under the new Treaty, the European Parliament will increase its powers and will be co-legislator with the Commission, indeed in all sectors.
The minimum threshold of six seats is thus a positive step that will increase the small countries' faith in the European Union and therefore I believe that we should support the Lamassoure-Severin report.
rapporteur. - Mr President, it is never more difficult to understand an explanation than when the promotion of your interests depends on not understanding that explanation.
I am afraid that many of our colleagues have vanished because they are not looking for an explanation: they simply wanted to make their points, and that is all.
However, I would like very briefly to make some clarifications.
Firstly, if this report fails, we are not only going to go back to Nice, but worse than Nice because, according to the mandate of the IGC, the Treaty will mention the 96 seats as the maximum level for one country - so it will be Nice, and Germany will have 96.
By acting against this report, Germany will not secure the 99 seats they have today; they should be aware of that.
Ms Grabowska asked, what about the Polish citizens who live partially in Poland and partially abroad?
It depends on their residence: whether they are tourists abroad or abroad for a short time does not matter, but if they are resident abroad and they are just visiting their families in Poland, they will be taken into consideration where they live, but they will, of course, be able to vote in the same way as any European citizens.
Ms Grabowska also asked, who is going to represent them?
This is absolutely clear - the MEPs for whom they vote.
All European citizens will have the right to vote, and all European citizens will be represented by those MEPs for whom they vote.
A number of colleagues said, and I am only quoting an Italian colleague: for the first time in the history of the Union, we take into consideration the residents and not the citizens.
False!
We have always taken into consideration the inhabitants, the population, since the Treaty of Rome.
If you want to change this custom, you can certainly change it, but please do not say things here which are completely false.
I will end with this: if there is a problem, the problem lies with the lack of harmonisation of the national legislation on elections.
Certainly, I would be in favour of the approximation of that legislation, but this is a different issue.
This takes time and we have to address this issue separately.
I wish luck to the rapporteurs who are going to deal with the approximation of the electoral legislation; I hope that they will succeed.
For the time being, I only hope that tomorrow, after a night of reflection, we will have a vote that will indeed reinforce the credibility of this institution.
My fellow Member has been given additional time as rapporteur.
I would like to reassure Mr Severin that this is not connected either with his report or with his person.
My experience tells me that parliamentarians are people who speak better than they listen.
And this was the way it turned out during this debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 October 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PT) This proposal falls within the ambit of the 'European Constitution' which is to be taken up again at the Lisbon Summit in relation to a new Treaty, once again asserting the pressures and threats previously brought to bear before it was rejected in the popular referendums in France and in the Netherlands in 2005.
Instead of upholding the principle of sovereign States with equal rights, which would require at the minimum that much-vaunted solidarity on the part of the more populous countries and respect for the balance within the various institutional bodies (Council, Commission and European Parliament), the intention is to set minimum and maximum numbers and to apply degressive proportionality based on population, thus subordinating countries as a function of their population and constantly detracting from the representative nature of democracy.
The imbalance which existed before the Treaty of Nice is not even taken into account.
Thus, for example, Portugal loses two Members and is left with only 22, whilst Spain gains four; it is certain that Germany will lose three, leaving it with 96; in addition France will have 74, the United Kingdom 73, Italy 72, Spain 55 and Poland 51.
The six European powers alone account for 420 Members, many more than the majority of a European Parliament with 750 Members representing 27 Member States.
That is why we will be voting against the report.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President,
I represent a small Member State on the Union's periphery.
This, for me, means to understand how important it is sometimes to defend national interests vehemently and to highlight our differing circumstances.
In general Members from the big Member States have understood this, at least those in my group.
They are careful not to simply reject our opinions, to prevent the big countries from steamrollering the small ones in the Union.
When Mr Lamassoure's report was being drafted, a small country's voice was heard inasmuch as I, along the other Finnish MEPs, kept hold of Finland's 14 seats in Parliament.
It is completely justified to speak up for the benefit gained.
Now, however, the amendments to the report proposed by the Finnish MEPs to keep one seat have not got through at the committee stage, and they would not have had a chance of getting though in plenary.
The main reason for that is probably that the benefit gained has already been renounced in some degree: in the Nice talks Finland agreed to have 13 Members.
With Mr Lamassoure's report, a lot more comes under threat.
The amendments proposed by the German, Spanish and Polish delegates in my group seriously endanger the chances of the small Member States having any influence in the European Parliament.
The amendment, according to which each Member State would have six seats as from 2014 and that the rest of the seats in Parliament should be allocated in accordance with the d'Hondt system, will completely destroy the current system of degressive proportionality, which is the best way of guaranteeing objective decision-making in the Union.
The amendment would in practice mean that the number of Finnish seats, for example, would fall to 10, if enlargement continues.
This we cannot accept.
I therefore appeal to you all to remember to appreciate how important it is that the small countries can have an influence in our Union.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza
The next item is the statement of the Council and the Commission on the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the short-term regional and international outlook before us presents a window of opportunity for a peaceful dynamic for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and setting up a Palestinian State, an opportunity which the international community cannot miss.
We are at a crucial moment which could enable us to make significant advances in the Middle East peace process.
The bilateral political dialogue under way between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and the recent setting up of the negotiating teams on both sides are courageous and encouraging steps which we approve of and support and which we hope might enable tangible results to be brought to the international meeting in the autumn, a meeting instigated by the United States of America.
We hope that the current dynamic, which also notably includes participation by Arab countries, will make it possible to move towards the setting up of a viable, democratic, independent Palestinian State, to coexist alongside Israel in peace and security.
The European Union, both within as well as outside the Quartet, has shown itself to be a trusted impartial partner committed to the success of the dialogue between the parties.
Thus we remain committed to the political process, the mission to create the bases for a Palestinian State and to supporting the economic development of the Palestinian territories.
The meetings of the Quartet and the ministerial Ad Hoc Liaison Committee in New York on 23 and 24 September respectively, once again emphasised the international community's support for the diplomatic efforts under way.
In the Quartet meeting's final communication, the European Union and its partners in the Quartet expressed their concern over conditions in Gaza and stressed the importance of continued humanitarian and emergency assistance, and also regarding the provision of essential services for the Palestinian people.
Moreover the Quartet's representative, Tony Blair, warned of the urgent need to develop the Palestinian economy and the respective institutions, as prerequisites for the appropriate functioning of the future Palestinian State.
It was stressed that it was important for the Quartet's representative to draw up a multi-year agenda for economic and institutional development of the Palestinian territories.
That concern, as well as the need to mobilise financial and technical assistance from the international community for those projects, was also stressed by the international donor nations meeting at ministerial level within the meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee.
Various international reports mention the deterioration in humanitarian conditions for the population in those territories; a situation which nurtures poverty and violence, promotes radicalism and extremism - a cycle which urgently needs to be broken.
The Israeli decision of 19 September to declare Gaza a hostile territory and the possibility envisaged of broadening the scope of sanctions imposed on Gaza would, if applied, potentially exacerbate the current situation.
Although the European Union recognises Israel's legitimate right to defend itself, it also underscores the need for the Israeli authorities to carefully weigh the implications and consequences of its decisions on the life of the people of Gaza.
The European Union has consistently reaffirmed its full commitment to continuing humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
The Union is the major donor.
In 2006 the total amount of Union assistance from the Commission and the Member States was EUR 688 million.
In 2007 the Commission allocated more than EUR 425 million, divided between humanitarian assistance and social assistance, strategic support for the setting up of the State and advice on economic reforms.
The Temporary International Mechanism, extended for three more months until the end of the year, was one of the means favoured for channelling donor assistance in view of the complex situation in that area.
Furthermore, the Commission is intending to restructure assistance to the Abbas/Fayad Government in order to make it more efficient and productive.
We do, however, think that the European Union should not bear that financial burden alone and that it would therefore be desirable for other partners, in particular the Arab States, to make a contribution to this effort and to bear some of the cost of building the Palestinian State.
The EU stressed the importance of reopening entry and exit points in Gaza, with a view to securing the movement of people and goods in accordance with the agreement on access and movement.
European support also envisages assistance to the private sector, the motor for economic development in the long term, in particular by granting support to the Palestinian Government to settle its debts with the private sector.
These are short-term solutions which must not lose sight of the long-term objective of economic development of the Palestinian economy and finances.
In fact, the long-term outlook should be evaluated in order to move progressively from the current phase of emergency assistance to a phase of assistance for economic development - that is, a transition from hate to trade.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, two weeks ago I was in New York where there were many meetings of the international community on the question of Palestine.
There was an important meeting of the Quartet, of which I am a permanent member as part of the EU delegation, and an Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting of the major donors to the Palestinians, in preparation for a pledging conference that will probably take place at the end of December, after the international meeting that is now being prepared.
The main conclusion for all of us, as the President-in-Office has already said, is that there is indeed a crucial opportunity for regional and international partners effectively to support the peace process.
I must say that, knowing how difficult this is, I am at least cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a serious and substantive meeting being hosted by the US this November.
I wish to thank those who have mentioned the contributions we have made, but let me also say that I have spoken out very clearly to our Arab partners, because it is those partners that have not yet contributed in the same way as we have.
I have called on them emphatically to do the same for their Arab friends.
We also stand ready to play our part in the future, and indeed we hope that this international meeting on the Middle East will be a next step towards having more ongoing, positive talks and hopefully, at the right moment, a Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel within secure borders.
I am well aware, of course, that the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip has become much more difficult.
For instance, two projects in the sector of water and sanitation, financed by the Commission's humanitarian office, have had to be suspended.
The partners implementing those operations did not succeed in importing the necessary materials, because the importing of items such as spare parts for hospitals and water pumps has been banned.
The European Commission has not been idle in responding to this situation.
On the contrary, humanitarian and emergency aid to the occupied Palestinian territory, including Gaza, has reached unprecedented levels.
We also continue our support for the precious work of UNRWA in Gaza.
Commissioner Michel has recently deployed new support through the World Food Programme in order to respond to the basic needs of the most vulnerable Palestinians.
Our direct emergency support to low income and social hardship cases continues through the payment of social allowances.
In September we disbursed allowances to 35 000 poor families in the West Bank and Gaza.
This demonstrates the added value of the temporary international mechanism, which is able to operate efficiently throughout the occupied Palestinian territory.
By September our fuel provision to the Gaza Strip had surpassed 90 million litres.
That fuel provides 25%, or one quarter, of the electricity needs of the local population.
For those reasons, I requested the Quartet, at the latest meeting in New York, to extend this financial mechanism until December.
Also in New York, at several meetings and with different interlocutors, I yet again pleaded on several occasions for progress on the access and movement agenda.
We are very happy that Tony Blair is awarding close attention to this, as he wants there to be an economic possibility of development.
This, of course, is not possible without freedom of movement and access, notwithstanding the justified security concerns of the Israeli Government.
I believe that much more could and should be done, but that will require more political will than we have witnessed so far.
I also agree with Parliament that the closure of the Gaza crossings has dire implications for the livelihood of an already impoverished population, as well as for the required humanitarian response.
The Karni crossing point has been closed for almost four months now, so our aid has to pass through Karem Shalom and Sufa.
We only see this as a temporary arrangement, firstly because the facilities at those crossings are inadequate and result in extra handling costs - up to 40% of the cost of aid supplies - and secondly because restrictions on the equipment we want to get into Gaza create problems for our project work.
Having said that, our actions must also take into account the illegal takeover of the Gaza Strip.
Our policy is consistent with the Quartet's line and the position of the legitimate government of the Palestinian Authority, and we of course support President Mahmoud Abbas.
On 23 September, we and other Quartet partners made our position quite clear.
We expressed great concern over the continued closure of major crossing points.
We agreed on the importance of continued emergency and humanitarian assistance without obstruction, and we called for the continued provision of essential services.
Allow me also to refer finally to the situation within the West Bank, which should not be forgotten.
Despite recent announcements made by the Israeli authorities about the reduction of checkpoints, the reality on the ground is, unfortunately, quite different: things are getting worse.
It is not only that the settlement policy and construction of the security barrier continue, but also that 48 new checkpoints have been installed, according to a recent report by OTCHA.
It is essential that we see progress in the access and movement agenda.
Otherwise, the chances of a future sustainable Palestinian state are being undermined.
Let me just add that already, with a view to the next Foreign Affairs Council, the preparations for the draft Council conclusions emphasise very clearly the dire situation in Gaza and underline the importance of uninterrupted emergency and humanitarian assistance without obstruction.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, once again we stand here and we repeat: the situation in Gaza is appalling.
Once again we all agree: something must be done.
Therefore, it is my honour, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to table this resolution, and I welcome Article 5 fully supporting the Maryland Convention.
But, frankly speaking, can I be positive, knowing that we urged you, and I called on you in this place before summer started, to be ready for a humanitarian crisis operation and for contingency planning?
Many of you thought I was asking for foreign intervention.
No!
I simply knew that being ready for a humanitarian operation would help us to react in a fast manner when the inevitable situation comes.
It is October, and we are not very much farther.
Of course people in Gaza deserve our help: our immediate, short-term quick fix.
But for many years of our collaboration in the Middle East, we all know well that quick fixes do not count.
What we really need here is to solve the causes of suffering of Palestinians.
Many here think - and I strongly disagree - that Israel is the only cause of suffering.
I was in Gaza for the first time in 1990.
I also saw Hodeida, Tanta, Benghazi, Ismailia, to name just a few other places in the Middle East which look very much the same: no occupation, no military intervention.
Mismanagement, corruption, nepotism, police regimes - these are the Pudelskern.
We have to name them; we have to focus on how we can help those who suffer from both.
We have to have patience to see the truth, to analyse properly and objectively, to design help, to prepare tailored projects, to invest money, to teach and to lead.
And to be unforgiving.
To be sharp, to be responsible.
In Gaza, Ottomans, the British, Egyptians, Israelis, Americans and Europeans are all part of the problem.
But the main part is Palestinians themselves.
We can only help them.
They have to stop any use of threats, abuse, violence, terrorism and killing.
They have to stop corruption.
They have to stop nepotism and pashaliks.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, since mid-July, when Hamas seized power in Gaza, one-and-a-half-million people have been confined to what the inhabitants themselves call a ghetto, a cattle farm.
Even cancer patients are not allowed out of the region.
Israel takes the view that they live in a hostile entity.
The only things that come in are food, medicines and a few humanitarian goods - but people cannot live on just flour, lentils and medicines.
Israel's definition of humanitarian goods is absurdly restrictive.
Components for medical devices cannot be imported, the water supply system cannot be repaired.
There is a constant threat of Israel interrupting the energy supply.
The economy of Gaza has collapsed, the people are unemployed and despondent, and there is no money left.
Malnourishment is beginning to rear its head.
The blockade breeds despondency, anger and hatred, not peace.
Gaza is experiencing an unacceptable humanitarian crisis.
Calls for assistance are growing and, on top of this, the costs of assistance are rising as a result of the blockade.
Thus, the Member States must provide more financial support to UNRRA and the other organisations on site.
The European Commission has already taken that step, as have some Member States.
The European Parliament, too, yesterday voted in favour of increasing assistance.
My group urges the Council to support that decision.
Assistance alone is not enough, however.
The Presidency has remained diffident, cautious, on the subject this evening - but the European Union can no longer take the moral responsibility for providing assistance, whilst refraining from taking political action against the blockade.
On behalf of my group, I would therefore request that the Presidency, the Council and the European Commission call on Israel to end the blockade immediately.
In Gaza the whole population is being punished - which is illegal under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Besides, this method does not befit Israel, and the European Union should be telling Israel this instead of remaining passive - precisely because it is an ally.
This would give meaning to the Association Agreement with Israel, as only by taking action against the blockade will the EU do justice to the section on human rights.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I speak not on behalf of my group, but as a Member who has seen things he did not wish to see.
I hope the Minister does not believe the sanctimonious claptrap he read this House.
To suggest for one moment that the policies of this European Union are impartial is just ridiculous.
Everyone knows that we pursue a policy of double standards.
We expect and demand the Palestinians to obey every requirement.
We merely request that the Israelis meet our wishes.
Those double standards reek.
Commissioner, do you remember standing here just a few months ago, after the Palestinian delegation had returned from meeting Mr Haniyeh in Gaza, before the breakdown of the Palestinian Unity Government, saying to this House that you wanted to do everything you could to support that Government?
Within a fortnight, of course, it had fallen!
It had fallen partly because we had refused to talk to the elected representatives.
We had refused to talk to Mr Haniyeh and, not surprisingly, having undermined the democratic forces, the forces of violence took over.
We never seem to learn the lessons of history.
We have to stop ignoring the wishes of the Palestinian people.
We have to start paying some respect to the forces of democracy, and we have to recognise that you cannot make peace without talking to your enemy.
(Applause).
The continuing refusal to deal with some of those elements in Hamas who want to take a step towards us just makes promotion of peace in the Middle East impossible to attain.
One question about the motion for a resolution before us: why are we even thinking about giving money to Gaza?
What has it got to do with the European Union?
Gaza is an Israeli prison camp!
It is nothing to do with us.
It is the Israelis who should be responsible for keeping one and a half million people alive.
They are the ones who keep them in misery.
It is not our responsibility to be providing our taxpayers' money to meet Israeli responsibilities.
Finally, again on this question of impartiality, we have heard within the last couple of weeks that the Israeli defence force has ordered the confiscation of more Palestinian land to build the roads to enable the building of the E1 settlement - the further expansion of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem - against every commitment we have requested the Israelis to make, and against every hope there could be for a genuine outcome from the forthcoming peace talks.
As the Palestinians see all hopes of a viable, independent Palestinian state disappearing before their eyes, what is the European Union going to do about it?
You know very well that it is going to do nothing except mouth a few words and take no tangible action!
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I was a member of the five-man delegation from the European Parliament which spent a couple of important days in the Palestinian Autonomous Area.
I can categorically state that our mission was humanitarian in nature, not political.
I am saying this because I would not like our debate to turn into a very political debate, where the European Parliament takes the role of a prosecutor acting against someone.
I would like us to stand above political divisions and consider how we can help civil Palestine.
Let us, however, make it clear that it appears that raising the standard of living in the Gaza Strip, normal functioning of hospitals and schools, full access to drinking water, food and electricity, the potential to work normally in agriculture are more likely to cause a fall in tension in Palestinian-Israeli relations and to ensure a weakening of the potential for enmity, where Jewish settlers, Israeli settlers and the State of Israel as such are concerned.
A few months ago I spoke in this House about the controversial texts delivered in some Palestinian schools, in Palestinian textbooks, but now we have moved from one extreme to another.
We cannot criticise certain aspects of Palestinian schooling any longer, as that system of schooling has effectively died.
But this coin has another side to it, an intra-Palestinian aspect.
The political stalemate between Hamas and Fatah and the President Abu Mazen camp continues.
This impasse makes it difficult for Palestinian institutions to function, and thus hurts Palestinians who live there, and is certainly not Israel's fault.
We speak a lot about lasting peace between the State of Israel and the Palestinians, but that is a bit like talking about a house and starting with the roof.
We should always talk from the foundations up, and the foundations in this case are an improvement in the functioning of Palestinian power structures, public institutions and humanitarian assistance for the people of Palestine.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the visit to the West Bank and Gaza a couple of weeks ago that has been mentioned was a shock - even for those of us who have been there many times.
Israel's closure of the borders and the countless roadblocks make it impossible to develop a healthy economy, and for the EU's rules on humanitarian assistance to be followed.
The Council and the Commission should intervene immediately to help the Palestinian economy back on its feet.
Let me make myself clear: without such intervention a peace conference cannot succeed.
As has been said repeatedly, the economic dimension is inseparable from the political.
In other words, Israel's occupation must be brought to an end or there will never be peace.
Besides the economic exhaustion, radicalisation of Palestinians is currently taking place.
It is growing among the poor - of whom there are more and more as a result of Israel's blockade - and among the young.
Older generations of Palestinians have warned repeatedly that the young people growing up today have never lived side by side with Israelis, and that their only experience of them is ugly walls, military invasions and teenage soldiers humiliating their fathers.
This is not the way to create peace, only implacable enemies.
Nor is there any confidence in the EU, which disregarded the democratic elections in the Palestinian territories and, by isolating Hamas, has demonstrated both diplomatic incompetence and, once again, double standards.
Unless all Palestinians are represented in the ongoing negotiations there will be no peace, as anyone involved with the issue is well aware.
As Mr Davies and others have mentioned, all hope of peace will shatter if, as has been reported, the Government of Israel means to expropriate E1.
Both the USA and the EU have said in no uncertain terms that this must not happen.
The question that Council and Commission should answer now is what action is planned to prevent this expropriation of Palestinian East Jerusalem.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is nothing.
Mr Lobo Antunes spoke of courageous gestures and steps: the courageous step Mr Olmert ought to take is to close all new settlements, to free thousands of Palestinians, to stop the military incursions in the West Bank, to remove the checkpoints and to reverse the blockade of Gaza!
He should come to the negotiations with concrete steps; instead, yesterday we saw new seizures of land inside Jerusalem.
Our courageous step, here in the European Union, ought to be to reject any form of collective punishment imposed by the Israeli Government on the civilian population.
Our plans in Gaza are blocked because there is no cement, there are no pipes, costs have quadrupled and UNRWA continues to instigate emergency measures.
In the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow we are calling for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and free movement of people and goods everywhere, but we are aware that the Palestinian issue is not a humanitarian one.
Our responsibility is political: it is the responsibility to put an end to the military occupation and to call for two peoples and two states, able to coexist in mutual safety.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, at the end of last week a delegation from our Parliament debated the grave situation in the Middle East with our US counterparts as part of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD).
During this, the US peace negotiator Dennis Ross gave us the very practical advice to offer the Palestinian population assistance with its precarious existence.
A network of reliable, politically independent NGOs is needed.
Council and Commission: to what extent do you envisage real possibilities for both the West Bank and Gaza?
I now take the view that the behaviour of Hamas lies behind the present internal and external crisis situation in Gaza.
It unfailingly delegitimises the State of Israel and legitimises violence against Israelis and Palestinian 'dissidents'.
Mr President, the recent brutal murder of the Palestinian Christian Rami Ayyad, who was only thirty years old, underlines the perilous position of this minority in Gaza.
I expect of the Council and the Commission that they devote attention and provide support to the Christian minority in all the Palestinian territories.
Mr President, Mr Davies asked, earlier on, what role the European Union had in the Middle East.
Of course, I know it was a rhetorical question, because he is very committed to a solution, but it is a fact that the European Union has a direct interest in the outcome of the Middle East peace process.
I speak from a constituency in Yorkshire from which the four bombers who attacked London several months ago came.
They were motivated by what was happening in the Middle East.
The bombers in Madrid also.
So the security of Europe is directly connected to the Middle East.
I believe that we also have historic and humanitarian commitments to a peaceful outcome.
After all, the process of peace has been slow and patchy, and has resulted in numerous initiatives, numerous intergovernmental conferences - Madrid, Oslo and so on. We have got to the point now, in October 2007, where there is almost a desperation to try and find some solution.
So I believe that it is now time for some fairly radical new thinking.
One of the propositions I would make is that the recent talks between Mr Olmert and Mr Mahmoud Abbas about - in effect - a final status solution, should reflect the negotiations that Mr Olmert himself, a young parliamentarian, had in 1987, where he and the PLO negotiated privately actually to talk about the capital of the Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, about the borders of 1967, and about some settlers returning.
In other words, he got there in 1987, and maybe now the time will come, this autumn, when these two leaders, encouraged by the international community, will come together radically to shape the future for a peaceful, two-state solution to the Middle East peace process.
Mr Triantaphyllides and his delegation, who went to Palestine the other day, came back with two fundamental conclusions.
Let us focus on the humanitarian situation in Palestine, but let us also think about the role that elected parliamentarians there and elsewhere can play in this process.
We should not be forgotten.
(FR) Mr President, while preparing this resolution, we said to ourselves 'no politics, just humanitarianism'.
It is intolerable that today, in an immense open-air ghetto, a people is slowly dying, hounded by the cameras of the whole world, a people bled dry, without the right to develop, to move freely or to educate its children, but a people for whose survival we pay a high price and who most of all must not die on us, because that would taint us and our democracies could not cope with it.
This year the European Union will have paid more than EUR 300 million to prevent this crisis.
It is too little for the Palestinians to be able to live, but it is ten times, a hundred times too much, because if all the international obligations, the fourth Geneva Convention and human rights were being respected, it would not be necessary.
Shame on the ghetto!
Shame on us Europeans! We were able to supply Berlin when the people there were under siege!
Shame on us who welcomed the fall of the wall in Germany with tears of joy, but who are now prisoners and accomplices of other walls and other ghettos!
Stop the closure!
But today, humanitarianism cannot let politics be forgotten.
On 24 September the Israeli government issued an order for the confiscation of 1 100 dunums of land in four Arab villages between Jerusalem and Jericho, to build a road that will cut the West Bank definitively in two.
It is an old Israeli plan from 2004 that Europe and even the United States have always rejected.
Today, on the eve of the international meeting in Washington, it is a real time bomb.
With Gaza trapped and the West Bank cut in two, how can we still dream of two states living together peacefully.
On 8 February 2005 at Sharm el Sheikh, Sharon declared: 'We have an opportunity to start on a new path.
For the first time in a long time, there exists in our region hope for a better future for our children and grandchildren.'
It is an extremely fragile opportunity that the extremists want to shatter.
If this road, and many others, see the light of day, the extremists will have won.
Architects and geographers are now using more perverse weapons than bombs.
They are encircling Palestine with walls and roads that are pulverising any dream of a viable state.
(Applause)
Mr President, there is nothing more demoralising than life lived in poverty, life without any prospects and life marred by a conflict.
As a humanitarian catastrophe haunts the people of Gaza, it is clear that the only objective Israeli and Palestinian leaders are securing is the transmission of pain, poverty, misery and hatred to a new generation of young Palestinians.
As a direct result of the Israeli blockade on the movement of people and goods, children do not even have basic educational facilities.
Everyone is denied the basic utilities that all of us in this House take for granted.
Livelihoods are destroyed, as fishermen, farmers and others cannot trade.
Individuals suffer needless pain and death owing to limited medical services and treatment.
All of this is set against a background of violence and oppression.
NGOs estimate that there are nearly 2 000 newly severely disabled people in Gaza.
They are mainly young people, who are shot at by tanks or snipers, often resulting in loss of limbs, brain damage or spinal cord injuries - but organisations working to support disabled people are being hampered by the Israeli blockade and are unable to obtain the specialist supplies that they require!
Israeli must fulfil its international obligations, such as the Geneva Convention, to guarantee the flow of humanitarian assistance, humanitarian aid and essential services, and to open up the borders.
The Council and the Commission must keep up the pressure, but they must talk to all sides.
That is the only way we will find a solution.
It is pointless saying we will not talk to one side.
We have got to find a solution by talking to everyone.
If nothing is done, people will continue to die needlessly.
1.3 million people in Gaza will continue to be stripped of their dignity and the transmission of pain, poverty, misery and hatred to a new generation of Palestinians will only continue.
(FR) Mr President, at a time when the crossing points into the Gaza Strip are closed and are controlled by the Israeli army, at a time when murderous incursions are being conducted there on a daily basis, at a time when the number of settlers in the occupied territories is continuing to grow, at a time when, in violation of international law, the construction of the wall and security surveillance are continuing, within these very walls, in the European Parliament, there are still people who would deny Israel's status as an occupying power.
It is shocking!
Israel is an occupying power, and as such has obligations under the Geneva Conventions and, in particular, must not use collective punishment under any circumstances.
We would be well advised to ensure that Israel meets its obligations instead of sending disastrous signals, as we did for example by suspending funding for the fuel supply for the power station in Gaza.
The crocodile tears we have shed over the divisions between Palestinians are really inappropriate after the European Union was incapable of supporting Mahmoud Abbas' efforts to co-opt the pragmatic wing of Hamas.
Can you imagine anything worse?
Playing Ramallah off against Gaza?
Deciding who are the good Palestinians and helping them to get rid of the bad?
Who can believe in a lasting solution if the political and territorial unity of Palestine is not guaranteed?
Who can believe that peace for the Israelis and Palestinians will be built through a policy that in fact leads to the radicalisation of the people of Israel and of Palestine?
The humanitarian situation in Gaza breaches all the standards of human dignity.
The lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip needs to be secured as quickly as possible.
Due pressure needs to be exerted on Israel.
This question cannot remain a taboo anymore and I am asking you, the Council and the Commission, what measures you intend to take in order to encourage the lifting of the blockade and to force Israel to comply with its obligations and commitments.
I am asking you what you intend to do to make Israel give up its plans to cut the West Bank in two by linking Jericho with East Jerusalem, a month before the international conference.
(Applause)
(EL) Madam President, developments in Palestine are moving exceptionally swiftly and leave us scarcely any time to react.
Thus we are now discussing the humanitarian situation in Gaza, whereas the Israeli authorities have unilaterally decided to expropriate thousands of hectares of Arab land in order to proceed with plan Î1, the construction of a road that will in practical terms cut the West Bank in two.
You know that the international community has opposed this plan.
I believe that it would be useful for Parliament to take a stand on this issue.
Political developments behind the scenes, however, have not permitted this.
The result is simple: once again we remain observers while the situation in Palestine gets ever worse; every day the Palestinians' negotiating position weakens and doubt is cast on any existing prospects for success at the imminent international conference on the Palestinian issue in November.
Mr President, last night I was privileged to attend the inauguration of the Brussels offices of the European Friends of Israel, which starts from the premise that we should support the democratic State of Israel's right to exist and prosper.
In contrast, Hamas is committed, under its 1988 charter, to Israel's destruction and remains a terrorist organisation banned by the EU.
It is no surprise to me that this resolution seeks to heap much of the blame for the current situation in Gaza on Israel.
Clearly, Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza as a bona fide gesture of land for peace is of very little significance to Israel's critics.
The resolution refers to a humanitarian crisis in Gaza without exploring the reasons why.
The appeal of Hamas to Palestinian voters was that it provided many of the social services that were neglected by the corrupt Fatah Administration.
Yet the same schools are now devoid of children, who are too scared to leave their homes.
The hospitals are treating those injured in the daily violence that has characterised the Hamas violent takeover of Gaza and the defeat of secular Fatah.
Prominent Gazan Christian, Rami Ayyad, was murdered last Saturday, and on Sunday, eight mortars and a Katyusha rocket were fired by Hamas at Israel indiscriminately.
Bizarrely, Hamas has even been shelling the border crossing at Khani.
The resolution also calls on Israel to take steps to ensure the free passage of humanitarian supplies and essential utilities.
In fact, Israel has not stopped the movement of such goods as food, electricity or water into Gaza and is actually acting with restraint and moderation, even though Hamas has been attacking Israel militarily.
I appreciate that Israel has come to expect a steady stream of invective from this House, but Israel should know that it does have some friends here, and throughout Europe, who are committed to peace and security in the region.
That will never happen while the agenda of Hamas is so readily indulged by so many in this House.
Mr President, a humanitarian crisis requires a humanitarian response, and our first priority tonight should be to deal with medical supplies and school books being held up on one side of the border, while students and ill people wait on the other.
International humanitarian law does give the European Union a direct obligation to act and, four months after Gaza was cut off, our direct commitment to the border assistance mission is a commitment that we are failing to meet.
I thank the Commissioner for the cautious optimism she expressed tonight on the revival of the peace process and on the operation of the temporary international mechanism.
We of course urge her to do whatever more she can.
I agree with Mr Tannock that we should condemn rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian militants, but his complaints would be much more credible if he also condemned the killing of civilians by the Israeli Defence Force in air missile attacks.
I ask you Commissioner, and the Presidency-in-Office too, to make urgent representations condemning the seizure, as was reported this morning, of a further 3% of West Bank land between Jerusalem and Jericho as part of the E1 annexation plan.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(SK) In the light of the European Parliament resolution of 21 June on the MEDA programme and financial support to Palestine, the resolution of 12 July 2007 on the Middle East and the Quartet's statement of 23 September 2007, it is vital for the European Parliament to express a clear stance vis-Ã -vis the situation in Palestine.
We must, however consider, the situation from at least two perspectives: the humanitarian and economic perspective, as well as the political and security one.
From the humanitarian and economic point of view, it is up to Europe, after having committed enormous financial resources to assist Palestine, to ensure the technical feasibility of delivering this assistance and humanitarian aid.
It is unacceptable for Palestinian civilians to be denied access to medicines and for health care institutions, schools and private homes to be devastated.
As it stands, access to proper drinking water and food is often denied as a result of the blockade on the movement of people and goods.
From the political and security perspective, it needs to be clearly stated that just as the international community recognises the Palestinians' right to autonomy, Palestine, including the governing Hamas movement, must also recognise the State of Israel.
To date Hamas has not taken any action to distance itself from its own founding document, which includes destroying the State of Israel as one of its objectives.
Therein lies the political problem, which has escalated into an armed conflict: terrorism on one side and tough defensive actions on the other.
Mr President, first of all, could I say that Mr Tannock is doing Israel a disservice by his unquestioning support for Israel's illegal activity against Palestinians, particularly in relation to Gaza.
I support this resolution, including paragraph 5.
The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is not new, nor has it been unforeseen.
Those of us who have visited the area regularly over the years have consistently warned against the Israeli actions, which were driving the population to despair.
The economy is now in free fall.
Social services have virtually collapsed.
Malnutrition and chronic diseases are rife, and medicines are not available.
Gaza is now entirely dependent on outside aid, which is being blocked by Israeli embargoes.
It is a prison tightly controlled by Israel, and we cannot allow the well-being of the people of Gaza to be held hostage to the political manoeuvrings that are under way.
Hopefully, these manoeuvrings will lead to peace talks.
I condemn the unilateral Israeli decision to seize land from four Arab villages, which cuts East Jerusalem off from the West Bank.
I regret the fact that neither the Council nor the Commission have made reference to this, and I would be surprised if they did not know about it.
We know about it in this House, and it is public knowledge.
This action by Israel is totally in breach of the Road Map, and it is in breach of the agreement that the 1967 borders will not change without a joint agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.
(PL) Mr President, hopefully we might expect that with time the conflict will sort itself out.
That is the hollowest hope there could be.
New generations are growing up, and the conflict goes on and is even getting worse.
You would think that two nations that are quite close to each other, the Hebrews and the Arabs, could cohabit, but not under the conditions of a hierarchical system.
Every dependence of one upon the other, inequality, and above all the lack of a sovereign state structure for the Arabs, will be constant sources of negative emotions, convictions and retaliation.
If the State of Israel cannot entertain a territorial division, I find it difficult to foresee peace in this area, I am afraid.
Just as the Jews have a right to their country, their state, in the same way the Arabs, the Palestinians, have a right too.
Historically, before World War II, Palestine existed, and as we are seeing, it is not easy to erase it from the Arab memory.
Every day the situation is deteriorating for the people in Gaza to such an extent that explosions of built-up aggression are inevitable, and all we can do is look on in embarrassment and sadness.
The most we can do, for our part - besides trying to calm impulses towards mutual destruction and besides attempts at mediation - is to extend humanitarian assistance to people to enable them to live in as decent sanitary conditions as possible, to have something to eat and somewhere to go to school.
But I emphasise that this is only a substitute for a solution, a solution towards which, we are ashamed to admit, we are not able to lead.
Experience gained in central and eastern Europe in the nineteenth century and the twentieth century horrors of Europe and Africa: these clearly demonstrate the power of a people's striving for independence.
This striving is what we are dealing with there too.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course the European Union must do everything it can to release the stranglehold on the population of Gaza in an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
Personally, I would like to point out that the Israeli government's designation of Gaza as a hostile entity has a number of dramatic consequences.
Israel can conduct much larger-scale operations in this area than in the past.
The Israeli electricity company can reduce the supply of electricity to Gaza's 1.5 million Palestinians to a bare minimum, and the company Mekorot will ration the water it distributes, leaving it to Hamas to distribute it to the districts.
This Israeli strategy, clearly aimed at causing a popular uprising against the leaders of Hamas, is unacceptable and can only lead to a fresh escalation of violence.
Not to mention the new settlements that will turn Palestine into another Bantustan.
Personally, as a member of the Quartet, I would like the European Union to obtain an assurance that the sole aim of the peace conference planned for November is not to provide the United States with a way out the stalemate it finds itself in in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that it is a real summit for peace, bringing together all the Arab players.
Mr President, civilians are the silent victims of any conflict and we have an obligation - indeed, a duty - to stand up and protect them, and to live up to the covenant of Noble Peace laureate Elie Wiesel 'never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation'.
I welcome, therefore, the initiative of this House to debate the situation in Gaza and also welcome the call in the resolution to call upon Israel to fulfil its obligations and guarantee the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
But today we also need to ask some other questions.
We need to start by asking ourselves, why is it that every time there is a movement towards peace, the violence intensifies?
Why it is that every time the voices of reason in Israel and the Palestinian territories seek a resolution, there are terrorist groups to take up arms against peace?
Why is the fear of a two-state solution, of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace, so dreaded by some that they prefer to inflict pain and suffering on their own people?
Let us not shrink from admitting that responsibility for the dire situation of the people living in Gaza also lies squarely with Hamas, who oppose a settlement, who call for the destruction of a legitimate member of the United Nations and who fear peace and promote violence.
In 2005, 400 rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza.
In 2006, 1 726 rockets were fired.
In 2007, it was close to a thousand rockets.
Many have died, hundreds have been injured and thousands evacuated.
They are also civilians: men, women and children.
On 26 September, 54 mortars were fired from Gaza on the Sufa crossing terminal.
The next day, the crossing points to which the Commissioner was referring - Erez and Karem Shalom - were targeted.
Indeed, they were targeted because Hamas believes that closing those points fulfils their goal of increasing the suffering, and of people siding with Hamas.
That is the wrong strategy.
Let us acknowledge that there are forces of terror and forces of fear in Gaza who seek to profit from the suffering of their own people.
(PT) Jimmy Carter said in an interview this week that since President Clinton there have never been any good-faith talks on the subject of the Middle East under the patronage of the United States of America.
Expectations are therefore running high for the international conference in November.
It is expected that there will be some tangible development so that we can actually envisage a time-scale for resolution of the human drama and conflict.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is currently deteriorating.
Although a few months ago we had a real open prison which constantly closing in, that is becoming ever more apparent when every day we count the dead, the hunger, the fear, the power of weapons and their effect, on both sides of the walls, on civilians' lives.
Humanitarian assistance is urgently required in the light of the Geneva Conventions and it is imperative that Israel should allow that assistance to be administered.
The movement of persons and goods must become a reality, unless we are to see a real human tragedy in that coastal strip.
The major objectives which we should be launching at the next international conference are to put an end to the violence and to seek a solution based on the existing resolutions which will allow Palestinians and Israelis to live together in peace, before it is too late.
Mr President, 20 years ago there were three theatres of violent conflict which caused worldwide consternation: South Africa, Ireland and the Middle East.
In the first two there has been reconciliation and political transformation.
In the Middle East there has been no progress made.
Arguably, the situation is worse.
The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza obliges us to act, conscious that reconciliation and political transformation are possible, are necessary, are expedient.
But, equally, it is clear that the Palestinians and the Israelis cannot resolve their differences by themselves.
They both resort to violence, which perpetuates the impasse.
The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza marks one of the lowest points in the 60 years of continuous conflict in the Middle East.
We call for security for the State of Israel and we call for security for the state of Palestine.
Today we have neither.
A new way, a new method is required.
It is clear that the United States Administration has the responsibility and the ability to exercise decisive influence on Israel, for example calling on them to dismantle the blockade of Gaza.
Just as the European Union must exercise equal guidance to the Palestinians to desist from violence, so that both may achieve their objectives for secure statehood through the only available effective means, which are peaceful means.
As this resolution will be forwarded to the parliaments of Palestine, Israel, Egypt and the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly, a constructive contribution could well be for us to support and promote a parliamentary dialogue to replace the existing war of attrition, which must be brought to an end so that it no longer disfigures the Holy Land.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, there is human suffering in Gaza.
The humanitarian crisis there has in the last few months indisputably grown into a catastrophe.
No longer is it a matter of just a shortage of basic food.
The Palestinian economy has collapsed and it has become harder to conduct business.
People's everyday lives have been shattered and the relief organisations cannot operate in the region.
The people who live there are caught up in a blockade, and as the Commissioner said, on the West Bank the same problems loom.
The residents of Gaza are the victims of a failed policy by each of the parties in the crisis.
It is one thing to speak about Hamas as the enemy and a terrorist organisation; it is quite another to declare the whole of Gaza enemy territory.
It is one thing to speak about Israel as the enemy; it is quite another to refuse to cooperate with providers of basic services and international organisations.
Although the parties in the crisis have reached deadlock, they both have responsibility for fundamental humanitarian rights.
The resolution by Parliament's groups is an exceptionally straightforward expression of opinion on the crisis in the Middle East.
It is stripped of any ulterior political motive.
All that is left is Europe's profound concern about the lives of the people in Gaza.
I would like to remind everyone that this is the self-same concern we expressed earlier on this year.
We cannot take either side and we cannot point a finger.
The suffering of innocent people makes the desire to excuse and seek justification for the Gaza situation irrelevant.
We demand just one thing: that the parties in the crisis allow us to help and that they should help themselves in particular, because this is a human crisis on a huge scale.
Commissioner, I hope you will take this one demand by Europe regarding the situation in Gaza to the parties in the crisis, the Arab League and the Quartet.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for your comments and speeches, to which I listened carefully.
We understand that continuous and sustained support for the economic development of the Palestinian territories is one of the bases for peace.
There is a close link between security, political stability and the economy.
Peace and security cannot therefore be achieved unless a solid and lasting economic foundation is laid together with a peace process, which needs to be a credible peace process.
All these initiatives reflect our commitment to assisting and helping to improve the living conditions of the Palestinian population in Transjordan and also in Gaza.
These are tasks we wish to pursue and we are confident that the Conference of Donor Nations, scheduled for December in Paris, will provide an opportunity for the international community to express its support, in a practical way we hope, for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine people in general.
It is vital that the international community does not abandon the people of Gaza, so that their highly precarious humanitarian situation does not continue to be a political factor of instability, tension and dissent.
I would like to say that the European Union has a political strategy for the Middle East Peace process based on sound pillars and principles and that is why the European Union is a welcome partner in the political process.
We also have a consistent aid policy for those who need it most in the Palestinian territories.
The figures which I myself presented and to which the Commissioner referred are, I think, undoubtedly proof of that.
I hope that all will follow the example of the European Union in this respect.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we all know that the situation in Gaza is dramatic.
However, we also know that, even if we are donating a lot of humanitarian aid, in the end we also have to find a political solution.
I said before, and the President-in-Office has mentioned now, that this international meeting is a very important occasion.
We have all clearly stated that it cannot be just a photo opportunity.
It has to be a substantive meeting, at which we hope the negotiations and personal talks between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas indeed materialise into an important initial document, not least on the very difficult issues, knowing that from then onwards working groups will have to take ideas further.
We all know that there are many possible alternative solutions on the table.
At the same time, until now, there has for a very long time been no possibility of getting the two parties together at such an international gathering with the support of the European Union, with the support of the US, Russia and the United Nations, and also with the backing of the Arab League.
It is very important that this time the Americans too have said that they are also ready to invite the so-called 'follow-up group' of the Arab League, including Syria and Saudi Arabia.
That shows there is a certain opening-up.
Having said that, we also know very clearly, and this was apparent from the second meeting we had, the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting, that we cannot only have political negotiations.
We also have to make a change on the ground.
That is, indeed, essential.
It is about promoting economic development, and this is part of Tony Blair's mandate, in which we also want to support him as much as we can because this is a possibility and an opportunity that we have to seize.
We of course know, as he does too - I have had lengthy discussions with him - that the pre-conditions for economic recovery, as the World Bank has also clearly mentioned, are an improvement in movement and access, promotion of the private sector in Gaza, which must remain part of the economy there, and of course also promoting things like good governance.
What we want to do is create a viable Palestinian state for when things are, so to speak, ripe in the political sphere.
I agree that we cannot have a 'quick fix' but, at the same time, what we do need now is a negotiation process that will finally start, and quick-start projects.
This is an area that we are already preparing, so that things are ready after the international meeting and maybe after or at the moment of the pledging conference.
We are considering projects - which, by the way, have been selected and supported by us and also by Tony Blair - such as projects for refurbishing schools, through which people see something is being done on the ground.
There are also many other projects that we are studying at the moment, in trying to find the right answers, and for which, of course, we also need Israel's support.
It is also clear that Israel's security concerns have to be taken into account.
But, at the end of the day, we have to find a political solution, and it is President Abbas who is the elected President of all Palestinians.
Therefore, we now have to give him credit and work with him and support him.
I want to thank you also for having very generously given the Commission the possibility, for 2008, of straight away having EUR 10 000 more in the budget for the Palestinians.
We will definitely need this and it will be particularly important for our pledging conference.
Let me also say that we are not only supporting Christians - this was mentioned by Mr Belder - but are also supporting the most vulnerable sectors of the Palestinian population, of which some, but not all, are Christian.
Our criterion is need, not religion, as I mentioned before.
Let me say finally that we are very much aware of what many of you have said.
We have analysed the situation.
The only course is to try to come up with political solutions, while at the same time trying to mitigate the suffering as much as we can.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 October 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - I join others in calling on Israel to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Conventions to guarantee the flow of humanitarian aid, humanitarian assistance and essential services, such as electricity and fuel, to the Gaza Strip.
Israel needs to lift the blockade of the Gaza Strip, and ensure the movement of people and goods at Rafah, in compliance with the Agreement on Movement and Access and the EU Border Assistance Mission, as well as the movement of goods at Karni.
All the Union's institutions, including the Council, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission must face up to their full responsibility on the implementation of this Agreement.
Finally, I echo the call on Israel to guarantee the flow of financial assets to the Gaza Strip, which has been suspended since 25 September 2007, given that the lack of access to any financial assets has a serious negative impact on the economic, social and daily life of the Palestinian people.
Murder of women in Mexico and Central America
The next item is the debate on the report (Î6-0338/2007) by RaÃŒl Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the murders of women in Central America and Mexico, and the role of the EU in fighting this phenomenon (2007/2025(ÎÎÎ)).
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, although the murder of women is a global problem, there are areas of the world that, due to both the magnitude and the complexity of the phenomenon, have become paradigmatic cases.
Those places are also, very regrettably, mirrors that reflect many of the problems that, to varying degrees, affect societies governed by social patterns based on a patriarchal culture.
This is the case, for example, with Mexico and the countries of Central America.
In fact, it was in Mexico where the concept of feminicide began to take shape, especially when the Special Prosecution Service for investigating and prosecuting cases of feminicide in the Republic of Mexico, chaired by the congresswoman Marcela Lagarde, established that the concept referred to, and I quote, 'the sum total of crimes against humanity consisting of criminal acts, kidnappings and disappearances affecting girls and women in a context of institutional collapse'.
In short, it is a breakdown in the rule of law that promotes impunity.
Although the concept is in the progress of being developed, some advocate the use of the term 'feminicide' in order to contrast it with the term 'homicide'...
I would like to ask for a little quiet in the House.
rapporteur. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President.
I will continue.
I was saying that, although the concept is one that is constantly evolving, in fact some feel it is necessary to talk about feminicide in order to contrast it with the concept of homicide, and it is significant that what it highlights is the existence of one of the most alarming phenomena of our time: the murder of women for the simple reason that they are women.
Over the last two years the European Parliament has done a great deal of work on this issue, and there will be an important milestone in this process when tomorrow, 11 October, the Plenary adopts the report on the murders of women in Mexico and Central America and the role of the European Union in fighting this phenomenon.
The report is also the result of a long and intensive process of dialogue with all the sectors involved and numerous compromises between the political groups.
I would like to take this opportunity, in fact, to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their support and inform you that also present here today are Marjo Searle and ArsÃšne Van Nierop, the mothers of Brenda and Hester respectively, who were both murdered in Mexico.
With the adoption of this report the European Parliament will be in line with other institutions that have already expressed their positions on the issue.
This has been done by the Council of Europe and the United Nations, and of various parliaments and governments all over the world.
Its content will represent considerable progress, both in defining the problem and in various parties taking responsibility in the fight to eradicate it.
One of the principles that comes out of the report is recognising, as a starting point for any analysis, the multiple causes and forms of this type of crime that exist.
It is certain that, for example, the highly publicised case of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez - more than 400 women murdered since 1993 - has a great deal to do with the fact that it is a border city with the typical problems of such areas.
However, there are also many factors that require efforts to be concentrated and integrated public policies to be implemented.
These policies include: prevention, investing in education for equality and reversing the patriarchal culture; improvements in data collection and forensic investigation; facilitating and speeding up reporting of crimes; training police, judges, prosecutors and doctors in this type of crime; monitoring of local businesses and multinational companies that operate in the area, many of which subject female workers to incredibly vulnerable conditions; legislative reforms and transposition of regulations at the appropriate levels of society; and finally, placing a special emphasis on support for victims and their families.
Regarding the latter issue, however, I would like to report here and deeply regret the fact that, on many occasions, the victims are despised and even criminalised; and their families are persecuted and even accused of harming the good image of a city or country simply because they want to raise awareness of the problem and because they want to demand, and do demand, justice.
Obviously those with the main and biggest responsibility for implementing all the measures proposed are the governmental institutions of the countries directly concerned, and in this case it is obvious that they are Mexico and the countries of Central America.
However, bearing in mind that the European Union has an association agreement with the former, which, moreover, includes a clause for democracy and respect for human rights, and that, in addition, a similar agreement is being negotiated with the Central American region, it is more than justifiable for the European institutions to take sides and make specific commitments regarding this problem.
Nobody should see this as interference by the European Union in the internal affairs of another country, especially given that, even though considerable progress has been made, as acknowledged in the report, especially from a legislative point of view, the magnitude of the problem requires greater effort and commitment from the whole world, especially Europe.
In short, I hope that after all these months we have achieved the necessary level of agreement and consensus so that tomorrow, in the vote, this resolution will be adopted by a majority of the House and we will finally send a clear and firm message about what it means to fight violence against women, in particular in the regions concerned.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as a woman and also as a member of the Commission, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for the defence of women in Europe, but also worldwide.
This report, presented today, is indeed to be seen within this context of a global fight against gender-related violence.
This is how we see it, and I thank the rapporteur very much, Mr Romeva i Rueda, for what he said.
Feminicide is a tragic issue which covers a much broader problem, that of violence against women, which we must fight at all levels: at local, but also at global levels.
And I would like to talk to you about what we as a Commission are doing to address the question of gender violence in general, again, and also in particular.
To promote it through our external relations policy in Mexico and in Central Asia.
Also, if you allow me, I would like to say a few words about my recent visit to the region, because I was there just last week (but not in Mexico).
I visited Panama, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.
I had already been in Mexico and I will go there most probably next year.
I can tell you that the Commission is on the frontline in the effort of preventing violence against women.
Let me remind you that, on 8 March 2006, the Commission issued what we called a 'road map for equality between men and women', outlining the eradication of all forms of gender-based violence as a priority objective.
In March of this year, we adopted a communication on gender equality in development cooperation, stating that gender-based violence in all its manifestations violates women's human rights and is indeed a serious obstacle to the achievement of equality, development and peace.
The Commission also supports projects on education and on awareness-raising interventions aimed at engaging all adolescents in programmes aiming at changing their behaviour in relation to violence against girls and women.
For instance, as I said, I was just in El Salvador, and I visited a programme that is called 'Pro JÃ³venes', which is for girls and boys - but especially for girls - who have either already been in the so-called Maras, or who could enter into the Maras, in order to prevent them from doing so.
I was most impressed by this programme.
The New European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights also provides a wide scope for activities in the field of gender equality.
Concerning the situation in Mexico, I would like to point out that EU-Mexico relations are based on our 1997 global agreement, in which Article 1 identifies human rights as a fundamental element of EU-Mexican relations.
On that very basis, both parties have established what I think, in the mean time, is a fruitful cooperation in the fields of human rights and justice, a cooperation which is then carried out through our different Commission programmes implemented by the Mexican federal authorities, as well as through projects carried out also by non-state actors and by NGOs.
The Mexican authorities also keep us informed about gender-related violence in Mexico.
So we learned that a number of cases had been resolved and many others were under investigation.
My last personal conversation with the new Mexican Foreign Minister - who is, as you know, also a woman - was in Santo Domingo, where we mentioned this question of feminicide and where I got some relevant information about what the Mexican Government is doing.
They have also a special human rights adviser, another lady who is also working particularly on this issue.
In the case of Central America, as a region, the country where the issue is most critical is Guatemala.
Our approach has been to confront the issue, both in our dialogue with the authorities and through, again, a number of activities on the issue of violence against women.
This includes the mainstreaming on the gender dimension in all the cooperation programmes.
The Commission also organised, in March last year, an important communication campaign targeted at young people and decision-makers on how to stop violence against women.
In the same period we also welcomed the creation of a national commission on feminicide, composed of officials from the executive, the judiciary and also the congress, and a total of 18 state institutions.
Recently, we also noted the creation of an international commission against impunity in Guatemala, which we also strongly support.
As a part of this Commission programme supporting the judiciary, a specific component is dedicated to feminicide.
In particular to activities carried out by the so-called CEPROM.
This is the presidential office in charge, with whom we have a memorandum of understanding on cooperation.
Let me also mention our support for the preparatory work for the revision of the law against feminicide, now before Congress, with a view to the revision of the penal code.
Finally, let me say that I found a lot of goodwill and pro-European spirit in this trip to Central America on this issue.
I was really positively surprised by the interest in enhancing regional integration, and cooperative attitudes also towards the forthcoming negotiations of an association agreement.
I must say it was very important to see that even the interest in Panama was much higher than I expected.
I am looking forward to the possibility of everybody there being included.
The first message that I passed on there was the importance of achieving progress on the negotiations that will finally start at the San JosÃ© Process in Costa Rica.
This is important because, naturally, it will be a political dialogue there; there will be a cooperation programme, and there will also be free trade negotiations.
But it will be a compact programme.
Social cohesion will be among the most important issues in the whole of Latin America, including Central America, and there this programme also has a very great importance.
Indeed, juvenile violence and violence against women are issues that we find have to be there because we have to all do everything in order to diminish violence in society.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot ignore the reality of feminicide in Central America.
In many regions of the world, women make an essential contribution to the most worthy societal structures of humanity.
Thanks to their feminine intuition, women enrich our understanding of the world.
They help to make human relations between people more honest and authentic.
The time has come to condemn and severely punish all forms of violence perpetrated against women, not only in Central America but also in several countries of Europe.
In this regard, the participation of women in managing material aid and assistance given to the victims of this violence could be of fundamental importance.
Ladies and gentlemen, if the EU Member States can bring their experience to resolving problems, we should not withhold our expertise.
That is why I remain convinced that bilateral cooperation between the Member States and the states of Central America can be effective.
I bear witness here to a frankly sensitive job within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Romeva, for his political sense and cooperation.
We have tabled some amendments by common agreement.
If these amendments are adopted, we can take pride in a job that may improve the situation of women and thus of the whole of Central American society.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for the excellent work done, for the ongoing dialogue with the shadow rapporteurs, and for the openness and receptivity to suggestions presented to him.
Many people took part in the process and I think that is quite exemplary.
The Socialist Group will therefore support the content of the report and the proposals for amendments tabled.
We know that when there are problems of any kind it is always the women who suffer most throughout the world, Europe, America, Asia, Africa, everywhere.
Poverty and social exclusion are the lot of women, as are violence, psychological and physical violence and extreme violence resulting in death.
This report deals with that extreme violence, with the death of many women in Central American countries and Mexico.
I had the opportunity to visit Guatemala, along with the rapporteur under the umbrella of the European Union-Central America Delegation, and to hear the amazing accounts and reports of many non-governmental organisation officials.
We know that many feminicide murders are committed in Guatemala and in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.
Feminicide, as the report mentions, cannot be explained purely in terms of a general climate of violence.
Account must be taken of the context and of the discrimination which still continues against women and it is an absolute tragedy that many cases go unpunished.
There is, moreover, the case referred to in the report of two Dutch citizens who were also feminicide victims.
Therefore, although some progress has been made and some measures have been taken, these are not enough; we need to go much further and, above all, we need to create effective protection measures for witnesses and victims, so that the perpetrators may be punished and the European Parliament's missions to those countries can always place that item on their agenda.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, violence against women in Mexico and Central America has, in recent years, reached dramatic proportions, with thousands of women having been the victims of violent deaths, which on many occasions have been extremely cruel in nature and often accompanied by sexual abuse and torture.
Although in many cases the perpetrators of such atrocious crimes are sick-minded individuals, in many situations organised criminal activity is very much involved, and the implication of human trafficking, prostitution and drugs is largely in evidence.
It is very sad that in Mexico and Central American countries the functioning of the rule of law in certain cases leaves a lot to be desired, either because of real organisational deficiencies in the police and judiciary systems, or because of corruption and impunity.
The rapporteur, Mr Romeva i Rueda, is to be congratulated for making sure that this report is strong enough to send the necessary message not only to the governments of the countries concerned, but also to the world as a whole, about the totally unacceptable high level of femicides in the aforementioned states.
The small number of final amendments - which incidentally have the rapporteur's full support - are useful and make this report more complete.
My group fully supports all those amendments.
It is to be hoped that this report will be voted through this House with a very large majority, so as to give a very clear signal to all concerned that the problem of the killing of women in Central America, as indeed in other parts of the world, is a matter that should attract our full attention and necessitates the taking of very drastic and effective remedial measures.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, as a member of the Mexico delegation, I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and specifically the rapporteur for the fact that this problem, which has also cast a shadow on many discussions with our colleagues in Mexico, has been dealt with.
I am hoping for a very broad majority tomorrow, which expresses one opinion and which emphasises how seriously we heave dealt with this problem.
In view of the appalling figures, the reports on the harassment of witnesses and solicitors, death threats and threats of torture, harassment of families, of situations which can in no way be accepted, it is the European Union's duty to speak out and it is also its duty to point out the peculiarity of this phenomenon.
It represents a particularly dramatic development of a global phenomenon concerning the way in which women are treated, which must be quickly brought to an end in the 21st century.
It must be addressed on a very amicable basis with our counterparts in the countries concerned because a positive development is only possible in a society when women are able to live free of fear and aggression and when threats, which are made against them and from which they suffer because they are women, are prosecuted appropriately.
I therefore welcome all the positive measures being adopted here.
We need witness protection, we need a better legal system, we need education.
Then we shall be able - so I believe - to support women in Mexico, in Latin America, in order to achieve a level of protection for them that is acceptable to us.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you, Madam President.
I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for his excellent work and also for his commitment and the knowledge that he possesses in this area, and I want to say straight away that our Group fully supports this report.
This form of feminicide that we are now discussing has grown, above all in areas where we have companies investing in subcontractor plants and where women are completely dependent on men, socially, economically, in all areas.
The young women employed in these assembly plants are not only likely to be affected by the increased violence but they also work under highly degrading conditions that reinforce the image of women as inferior beings who can be murdered, tortured, kidnapped and so on. I note the measures stated by the Commission, but I would also want to see even tougher and stronger pressure being put on these countries by the European Union.
We must show that it is completely unacceptable to sign agreements on respect for human rights while murder is still going on.
We should be able to freeze trade agreements until we can see that the demands we have rightly made are being complied with, until for example the governments in the relevant countries invest sufficient resources in finding and bringing to justice the authors of the crimes.
This wide-scale brutality against women has now been going on for almost ten years and rather than being reduced, it has actually grown, so it is high time to take action.
Thank you.
(ES) Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work and, in particular, for being willing to express Parliament's inescapable and unwavering commitment to the serious and urgent problem of violence against women.
I welcome the fact that, since it was in committee, this report has become more balanced, less paternalistic and has gained the right perspective, as, sadly, violence against women is not confined to one region, one country or one continent, but is global and universal, and we should take this into consideration for future work done by this House.
Unfortunately, and perhaps under different circumstances, it also happens in the European Union.
I would like to say, without going any further, that in my country the statistics are devastating: 166 000 cases reported to the courts, 48 000 people detained last year (one every twelve minutes) and almost 70 women murdered; the last one yesterday, her throat cut by her partner.
I think that these terrible statistics, Madam President, should lead us to think profoundly about the role of our Parliament, which I do not see as a court that punishes and pontificates, but as an institution that has its own effective strategies for seeking, by mutual agreement with our partners and on the basis of dialogue, cooperation and good practice, solutions for eradicating this process.
The case of Mexico, which is very significant and is cited in the report: this is a country that has a high level of violence to start with, which European Union citizens have been victims of, and whose families we stand with.
However, we also have to recognise that it is a society that is fighting, which is not happy with the situation and is valiantly struggling to overcome this problem, by mobilising the State authorities, the federal authorities and the local authorities, and the whole of society and all its political parties, and therefore, Madam President, the report recognises the progress that has been made.
It is important, and I will conclude with this, to ask the Commission for the human rights action plan to be concluded quickly and ambitiously, Madam President.
I would like to finish by saying that violence against women is a problem of abuse, it is a problem of cowardice, it is a problem of intolerance and, above all, Madam President, it is a problem of fear and powerlessness, of fear of accepting the will of others and, above all, fear of peacefully imposing will and reason based on argument, peacefully and not through violence.
(HU) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his report, which takes a position on an important problem.
I am very pleased that, as a fellow member, he is taking the situation of women so seriously.
Violence against women is a violation of human rights that prevents women from exercising their fundamental rights.
It therefore counts as one of the greatest global barriers to equality of the sexes in society.
This phenomenon occurs to differing extents but is present globally, and so action must be taken against it globally, in harmony with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
States themselves, Mexico in this case, are responsible for respecting and creating the freedom and safety of their citizens, so they must guarantee the instruments necessary to prevent, shed light on and punish violence against women, even if the violence occurs within the family.
I think it is very positive that Mexico has taken legal steps towards equality for men and women.
Nevertheless, the fight against violence against women cannot merely be restricted to the use of legal instruments, since this is a complex phenomenon that requires complex treatment, legal, administrative, preventive, advisory, victim-support, dialogue and monitoring tasks and obligations for the state in question.
The European Union - which has committed itself on several occasions to ensuring global equality, and which has defined the road map for equality for the period 2006-2010 published by the European Commission, and to which the Commissioner referred as one of its main priorities, as well as the halting of violence against women - cannot remain silent in the face of such atrocities.
When forming external relations, developments in human rights and the equality of women must be considered as emphasised criteria.
The report is excellent, and I recommend that it be adopted.
(PT) We cannot stay indifferent to violence committed against women in any part of the world, in particular in our own countries.
We are therefore paying particularly close attention to this serious problem in Mexico and some countries in Central America, where there is still feminicide which cannot be attributed solely to a general climate of violence.
We know that it is also necessary to take account of discrimination within the local social and economic context which is unfavourable to women and is even worse in the case of indigenous women living in serious poverty and economic dependence, with the additional problem of the activities of criminal gangs.
Here too, we therefore proclaim our solidarity with the women who are victims of such violence and add our voice to the call to see women's rights upheld, and their dignity respected; we naturally support the report of our fellow Member, Mr Romeva.
(ES) Madam President, firstly I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
I would like to highlight a few issues from it and also point out one aspect that I think perhaps is missing.
In order to win the battle against murders of women and against impunity we need to attack on a variety of fronts.
In the short term, we need to eliminate all discrimination in legislation, facilitate reporting of crimes and protection measures for victims, witnesses and family members, and improve the judicial and prison systems.
In this field, I agree that there is a need for the European Union to offer its full cooperation to these countries in order to overcome the difficulties and delays in the implementation of women's rights in legislation, to encourage the ratification of international agreements on the protection of human rights and to support the revision and updating of national legislation in this field.
I will therefore support the Obiols-Estrela amendment along those lines.
Improving the situation in the long term requires that we promote education in values through gender equality and education campaigns and awareness-raising from childhood in schools, in order to promote a social conscience that will bring an end to violence against women and the stigmatisation of the victims by the authorities.
Perhaps a more specific mention of the issue of education is what I think is missing.
I think that all the efforts that we are making in this direction will do little to put an end to this blot on society that should not have a place in 21st century societies.
Madam President, many thanks for this truly important debate, and in particular my sincere thanks once more to the rapporteur.
As I said a little while ago, as a woman and as the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy this issue is of course particularly important to me, and it is absolutely correct to say - as indeed I did at the start - that it is a general issue, one that unfortunately affects all of us in all countries.
This includes the European Union, but it is of course much more the case in poor countries, countries without the proper socioeconomic conditions, countries lacking, in particular, an effective police system - meaning that difficulties arise even at the detection stage - and also, in most cases, an effective judicial system.
After all, that too is crucial.
We are also aware that, in many of the countries that have been mentioned here, such as Central America and Mexico, along with many others, the phenomenon of corruption still exists, and mafia organisations work together with leading figures in the judiciary in some cases, which means that the detection rate is still very poor.
I agree with much of what has been said today: firstly legislative measures and secondly implementation measures.
In addition, I can reiterate that the Commission already has programmes in place and is working on these matters.
However, the time factor also has to be taken into account, of course.
Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not one that can be eradicated overnight; it can only be brought under control gradually in the context of socioeconomic development.
Sadly, it is something that we shall all have to deal with for some time to come.
Preventive measures must be taken, of course; I have just highlighted the example of 'Pro JÃ³venes' as it is such an interesting programme.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you ever return to El Salvador - or even Guatemala, but particularly El Salvador - I would recommend taking a look yourselves.
This is at least a dash of good news.
I can only affirm that we shall of course continue our programmes, and shall also continue to conduct our assuredly critical dialogue with Mexico, but I readily admit that, as Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra said, Mexico itself must be prepared to tackle this issue and take up the cause.
The thing is that, when a crime has been detected too late, it is very difficult to determine all aspects after the event.
Consequently, it is also very important to draw on all the relevant methods of modern police technology, as detection is the first factor and justice the second, and of course the question of general non-discrimination in society is also decisive.
I can only assure you that I am most certainly on your side in this matter.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 11 October 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (SK) On 8 March 2007 on the occasion of International Woman's Day, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament began its campaign for the eradication of violence against women.
This report on feminicides in Mexico and Central America is part of the overall initiative, the aim of which is the global eradication of violence against women.
It is in these countries in particular that the number of violent deaths has grown significantly in the past years.
According to the official Mexican statistics, 6 000 girls and women were killed between 1999 and 2006.
The most alarming statistics come mainly from countries that have deep-rooted economic inequalities in society, and in particular where women traditionally are economically dependent on men: countries such as Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras - the third poorest country in South America - and Nicaragua.
Feminicides in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez and Guatemala are particularly alarming, and for this reason I welcome today's debate.
I believe that only through in-depth analysis of these issues, which should take place prior to the 2008 EU-LAC summit in Lima, will we be able to assess the measures adopted, including the experience of the Mexican authorities, which will help to combat violence against women both in the EU and South America.
We must step up our efforts to protect women from all types of violence.
The problem of feminicide and the impunity of the perpetrators in Mexico and Central America has not improved in spite of massive efforts.
Therefore, the governments of Mexico and Central American countries should continue to step up their endeavours towards the prevention and detection of feminicide and other cases of violence against women.
In this connection, I would ask the governments of Central American countries to intensify their monitoring of the exercise of corporate social responsibility by the maquiladora (sub-contractor) companies.
In addition, the European principles of equal opportunities and equal rights for women and men must influence the proactive human rights policy of the EU more strongly.
Consequently, I call on the Commission to make a proposal concerning how the various European initiatives designed to combat feminicide can be better coordinated with local authorities and institutions in future.
All the available external policy instruments must be used.
In this connection, I would ask the Commission and the Member States to step up activities to verify compliance with the democracy and human rights clauses of existing and pending agreements.
When negotiating the association agreement with the countries of Central America, an assessment of the impact on gender equality should be carried out as part of the assessment of the impact on sustainable development.
The European human rights policy, and in particular women's rights, must on no account be up for consideration as a result of economic and geopolitical interests.
One-minute speeches (Rule 144)
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Madam President, 7 October last year will be remembered as a dramatic wake-up call to what is going on in Russia.
On that day, Anna Politkovskaya, considered to be a living symbol of honest journalism, was brutally murdered.
President Putin dismissed Anna Politkovskaya's role as marginal and her case still remains unsolved.
Last October in this House parliamentarians called on the Commission and the Member States to honour the legacy of Anna Politkovskaya by making the restoration of free media in Russia a primary condition for the further development of our relations, because, only if we send a clear signal that we value Anna Politkovskaya's quest for truth and freedom more highly than oil and gas, will conditions in Russia start to change.
There is no question that we in Europe share the values for which Anna Politkovskaya gave her life.
Sadly Mr Putin does not seem to share these values.
Respect for Anna Politkovskaya commits us to make this clear to President Putin in forthcoming summits.
(RO) I will speak about the issue of zoological parks in Romania.
According to the assessments performed by some nongovernmental international organizations of this field, the transposition of the Directive regarding zoological parks into the Romanian legislation is considered one of the best in Europe.
Nevertheless, bringing the 41 Romanian zoological parks up to European standards within the established deadline, namely by the end of this year, seems to be almost impossible to achieve.
Under the pressure of this deadline and the conditions of an existing public-private partnership, I support the importance of immediately implementing the common action plan, which comprises the next priority steps: to conduct a national study for classifying the existent zoological parks, to organize an emergency rescue team and to temporarily prevent the reproduction of animals.
I also consider it is necessary to offer some time for implementing this plan, before making the decision to close the zoological parks that do not meet the legal requirements.
(PL) Madam President, despite the numerous remarks that have been heard in this Chamber in respect of Mr Schulz, he has not ceased his attacks and insults on European Union members, which are not worthy of this House.
As someone who holds an important position in a Community institution, he is interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State and constantly insulting its representatives.
Most of those in this House would never dream of interfering in the democratic elections of peoples of the EU.
I am curious to know how this gentleman would feel if an MEP called on the German people to change their Chancellor, because there are organisations legally acting to spread Nazi thinking and to undermine the borders between European states.
I think this gentleman is sorry he was born so late, in the wrong historical epoch.
Mr President, earlier today Mr PÃ¶ttering made a statement on the World/European Day against the death penalty and said he rejected the death penalty 'in any form'.
He seems to assume that we all agree with him.
I do not.
Last Sunday, just a mile from my home in London, an innocent boy of 17, Rizwan Darbar, was stabbed to death in West Ham Park because, it is reported, he attempted to stop a friend's mobile phone from being stolen.
This is not an unusual occurrence in Britain.
Innocent people are being shot, stabbed and beaten to death with increasing frequency.
Why is this?
It is because the thugs and criminals do not fear the law.
Even if they are caught and convicted, they often receive very lenient sentences.
Personally, I would like to see the reintroduction of the death penalty in Britain for perpetrators of these kinds of murders.
Of course this could not be done unless we were outside of the European Union, which is yet another good reason for leaving.
Mr President, we have already had mention today of Libya, and I want to give it another billing.
Libya, quite properly, was made to pay for the Lockerbie terrorist atrocity, but Libya as a global sponsor of terrorism has yet to make full reparation.
The IRA's vile campaign of terror reached its most deadly when equipped with Libyan Semtex and weaponry, permitting Martin McGuinness and its other army council leaders to unleash the most vicious phase of their campaign.
Without Libya, hundreds of innocents would not have died.
Thus, tonight in this House, I want to back the present campaign by the victims' group in Northern Ireland - by the name of FAIR - to bring Libya to international account by forcing it to pay compensation, as occurred with Lockerbie.
Just as the EU pressurised Libya over the Bulgarian nurses, so it should support justice for IRA victims by pressing Libya to settle the litigation now issued against it by FAIR in the United States of America.
(RO) Through the Committee on Budgets, the Parliament has made an extremely important decision.
Through the 30% reserves established from administrative expenses for the European Social Fund, the European Fund for Regional Development and the Cohesion Fund as well, we send a strong signal to the European Commission.
The approval of operational programmes should be done within the time specified by the European directives, in this case four months.
Although Romania was one of the first countries that submitted these documents as early as in January, at present, two of the most important operational programmes have not been approved yet.
I am talking about the operational programme for administrative capacity development and the operational programme for human resources.
Taking into consideration the fact that we are not the only Member State in this situation, I would like to know the reasons, if they are not bureaucratic, that cause the Commission to postpone their approval to November.
According to the common statement we adopted together with the Council following the conciliation of July 13th, the Commission should ensure the rapid approval of the Member States' programmes and projects and submit a roadmap for their adoption.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to raise the report on industrial relations in the postal sector, which has just been published by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
Indeed, I wish this report had been available before we voted on the postal services.
But even now, it is a timely wake-up call for all governments that will be privatising their postal services over the next number of years.
In the EU we are committed to the Lisbon Agenda, more and better jobs.
Unfortunately, this report tells us that privatisation of the postal sector so far has delivered fewer but, more critically, worse jobs with poorer working conditions.
The report states that since the beginning of the liberalisation process, sectoral pay developments in all but three countries have been below the average.
But crucially, in all countries, a pay gap exists between employees of the main providers and those of the new entrants or the alternative providers.
If left unchecked, the situation will, and I quote from the report, 'erode employment conditions and lead to more conflictual industrial relations'.
So far, postal privatisation has failed the Lisbon test.
(PL) Mr President, during the present term of the European Parliament I have already appealed several times for an end to discrimination against Poles, especially Catholics.
This time too we are viewing the demand being made by certain media to withhold the subsidy for the University of Social and Media Culture as a blatant expression of discrimination and of a motivation driven by criteria other than intrinsic merit.
The accusations levelled against that institution by certain media are no more than slanders formulated by people who at one time enslaved Poland and the Poles.
Nowadays, in democratic times, they cannot come to terms with the loss of absolute power.
The University, which is appealing for financial support, provides education and training in a universal value system, and particularly for students from poor families.
A tightening of criteria and refusal to allocate funds resulting from the media witch-hunt, particularly in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All, would, in our view, be not only a manifestation of discrimination in respect of religion and outlook, but actually a symptom of the application of totalitarian methods, which stands in contrast to the declared values, standards and requirements of European law.
(PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention to a very important problem in the European Commission, and one which is constantly neglected here in the forum of the European Parliament: it concerns transport communications.
The shortest transport route from Scandinavia, the north of Europe, to the south - to Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria - lies via the Central European transport corridor.
This is a corridor that would begin at Ystad, in Sweden, would run through the Polish cities of Szczecin and WrocÅaw, the Czech city of Prague, the Slovak city of Bratislava, Vienna, and on through ConstanÅ£a, Thessaloniki and Trieste.
This route continues to be ignored, and in my view, its inclusion on the list of European road and rail routes would speed up and shorten transport routes along this line, and would also give a boost to the whole Central European corridor and to all the cities and regions that lie around this line.
Mr President, earlier today we had the publication of the European Transport Safety Council report on EU progress on reducing road deaths by half by 2010.
It contains some good and some bad news.
Yes - countries have made improvements, and that is to be welcomed, but overall road deaths are still too high and the EU will not, on current trends, achieve its road death reduction targets.
In fact only three Member States - Luxembourg, France and Portugal - will achieve the target set.
They have succeeded in reducing road deaths by over 8% a year.
It is worth remembering that over 39 000 people were killed on the roads in the EU in the last 12 months.
Had we achieved our targets, 5 000 people would still be alive today.
I regret that Ireland, my own country, is still in the lower half of the league when it comes to making those necessary improvements.
We could take messages from the best performing countries.
They have put in a great deal of commitment and political will to improve enforcement in a number of key areas.
The EU has just three years left to put in place measures that could see us achieving our targets of reducing road deaths by half.
The experience shows it can be done but we need a fresh impetus at EU level to achieve that.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the problem of Kosovo and, particularly, to the need for the European Parliament to be able to answer for this European internal matter and to ensure that the right of the people to determine their own future can, quite rightly, be respected.
Many political elements are appearing and exerting pressure to bring about the partition of Kosovo, which is not an answer.
This is very clear to us, particularly in relation to the problems associated with the Palestinian Territory and the division of that territory in 1946.
Strong pressure should therefore be brought to bear, with the European Parliament, to prevent a partition, to prevent conflict from being generated in this way and to enable the people to decide their own destiny, making sure that the European Parliament can be present, present on the European stage, and also present throughout our territory.
Mr President, unfortunately, by the time I have finished this speech, two people will have killed themselves.
This is because worldwide one person commits suicide every 30 seconds.
A staggering one million persons, many of them young men and women, end their lives every year.
Suicide is very relevant to the EU because five out of the top ten countries in terms of suicide rates are EU Member States: Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia and Latvia.
In fact, Lithuania has the highest suicide rate record in the world.
These are very sad statistics for the EU as, in most cases, the cause of suicide is preventable.
The EU has a duty to its citizens to urgently reduce suicide rates in its Member States.
I request you, Mr President, to address personally all EU Member State governments and national parliaments, especially those of the five aforementioned countries, and urge them strongly to redouble their efforts to prevent suicide amongst their citizens.
By so doing, many thousands of lives may be saved each year.
(RO) A recent study shows that, in Romania, approximately 170,000 children in the 5th-8th grades have one or two parents that have left to work abroad.
The large number of children left with their grandparents or families increases every day in the European Union new Member States, as well as in the candidate countries.
For this reason, I would like to emphasize the need to create adequate structures, which would help children and parents be together, as well as the need for a social policy that would focus on solidarity.
I consider that the facilitation of family reunion, as a factor of economic and social integration, should constitute an essential aspect of the legal immigration policies.
At the same time, I request the European Commission both to draw up a strategy regarding the situation of children who remained in their countries of origin after their parents left and to provide support for creating adequate structures in the Member States, in order to help children and parents adjust to new family situations.
That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Financing the common agricultural policy
The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy - C6-0116/2007 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about the report on Regulation 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis and the committee members for their efforts.
The Commission proposal contains two items which are of political importance.
First, to provide for the necessary follow-up on the relevant part of Article 53b on the Financial Regulation, which stipulates that the transparency obligation and ex post publication of beneficiaries by the Member States must be ensured by sector-specific legislation.
Second, to reinforce the mechanism by which financial discipline is safeguarded through a new reduction-suspension mechanism of agricultural aid, which is more structured and more transparent than the current mechanism already laid down in the Regulation, and by introducing the possibility for the Commission to make financial corrections for failing ex post controls.
The Commission is very much in favour of openness and transparency.
One element of this is the right of the public to know what is happening with the Community aid and to see who is receiving what amounts.
Article 53 of the Financial Regulation sets out that there should be an ex post publication of beneficiaries by Member States.
The follow-up to this general obligation is, as far as EAGGF and EAFRD spending is concerned, to be found in the Commission's proposal.
The Commission insists very much on the Member States publishing this information, as, under shared management, they are the contact for the farming community and are therefore in a much better position than the Commission to validate the information to be published.
I am very grateful for you support on this issue.
The Commission will take inspiration from some of the amendments proposed when it adopts the implementing legislation, but it would not be in line with better regulation and simplification if all the - sometimes very technical - details were put into the Council regulation.
However, let me make one thing clear.
Beneficiaries are to be informed beforehand of the fact that certain information needs to be published, and publication will take place only within the context of the full respect of the privacy legislation applicable.
As you know, there is already a reduction-suspension mechanism in Regulation 1290/2005.
In comparison with that mechanism, the proposed provision offers a new transparent and effective mechanism allowing a further simplification of the existing possibility to reduce or suspend payments to a Member State in case of serious and persistent deficiencies in the national control systems.
This new provision has the advantage that certain elements are determined in advance, so as to ensure a more efficient use of such an instrument.
It goes without saying that the reduction mechanism already in place will continue to be applicable for other types of cases.
However, amendments aimed at diluting the reduction mechanism are not acceptable to the Commission.
Finally, I have noted quite a number of amendments aimed at further reinforcing the overall system for the management of agricultural expenditure which are not related to our proposal.
On these, I think that the present text strikes a good balance, and we should give all actors time to put it into practice before considering any changes to the rules which, after all, just entered into force less than a year ago.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for finding the time to be present here this evening despite the late hour.
Indeed, the issue under discussion is not just some unimportant, marginal one - it is the common agricultural policy.
I would like to start by reminding the House what this common agricultural policy actually means to the vast majority of our nearly 500 million citizens.
After all, it is with these citizens in mind that such plenary debates are held.
Nevertheless, it can be noted in this regard that many citizens see the common agricultural policy first and foremost as an advertisement for the EU - but unfortunately an extremely bad one.
Export subsidies, supposedly unfair trade with 'third world' countries, feed scandals, farmers' protests, excessive subsidies, genetically modified plants - the number of negatively perceived issues relating to the common agricultural policy is immense and unfathomable.
Misdemeanours in the common agricultural policy have contributed significantly to the EU's poor reputation in many parts of Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, this reputation is not something that can be dismissed out of hand this evening.
This report, however - provided the Council supports it - could put the common agricultural policy on a new course, one that is closer to the ideas of the majority of citizens.
I should like to start by discussing the Commission proposal once more.
It essentially comprises four elements: transparency, i.e. the publication of the names of the beneficiaries of agricultural payments; introduction of the possibility of suspending payments to Member States under the first pillar in the case of serious breaches in their management and control systems; shortening of the periods of time for Commission auditing if Member States fail to comply with their control obligations (exceptions to the so-called 24-month rule); and adaptation of implementing powers.
In political terms, the proposals on transparency are certainly of outstanding importance to the EP.
With these, the Commission is finally implementing the decision of the Council and Parliament on the 2007 budget.
In general I warmly welcome this project, although the Commission proposal is rather late in coming, probably partly owing to the incorporation of further facts into the text.
Commission implementing regulations on the EAFRD are already envisaging publication of the names of all beneficiaries of payments under the second pillar.
The other funds too (European Regional Development Fund, European Fisheries Fund, Cohesion Fund) now all contain publication rules.
The budgetary decision has meant that, in essence, transparency has ceased to be controversial: it is no longer a case of if but only of how.
Eleven Member States are already publishing all payments comprehensively.
We need more transparency, therefore.
The absence of transparency has allowed the emergence of rumours and campaigns of disinformation, which have harmed the CAP more than the odd actual error.
The only problems are with the how: after all, the Commission gives no details of the procedure and wishes to lay down all the more detailed provisions in implementing regulations.
As we are looking at an intrusion on the right of self-determination over personal data, my report proposes some clarifications regarding which data are to be published and under what conditions.
These expressly follow an opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor.
In spite of the desire for speedy implementation, data protection must be taken very seriously - and the European Parliament is doing so.
The objectives of this report are as follows: greater transparency, and at the same time clearer data protection requirements.
In addition, the general public must be informed.
How can this balancing act be achieved?
In my view, it is essential to inform those concerned in advance, and there is no transparency unless the figures mean something.
Therefore, I propose differentiating more clearly, for example according to intervention purpose.
