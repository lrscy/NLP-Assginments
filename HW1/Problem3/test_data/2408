They are not perfect and we expect to see improvements in second reading as the Council further refines European thinking on this important topic.
But they represent a further responsible step on the journey of dealing with the consequences of pollution across Europe and the wider world.
Mr President, the objectives of the proposal for a directive are very ambitious and are designed to minimise environmental damage using both preventive means and means of apportioning the cost of restoring the damage.
The amendments we support represent a necessary compromise, not just to prevent the adoption of the directive from being put off, but also to ensure the entire protection system is viable and to prevent distortions of the market.
My congratulations to my honourable friends Mr Manders and Mr Papayannakis on achieving the necessary compromises.
The implementation of the polluter pays principle is of fundamental importance.
However, it calls for the introduction of new concepts and innovative institutions which, however much we want them, are difficult to introduce at once.
The compulsory financial guarantees for restoring environmental damage are a conditio sine qua non for efficient environmental protection.
Without doubt, our long-term objective must be to introduce a system of compulsory insurance which will function as a disincentive.
However, compulsory insurance must be introduced gradually in cooperation with the operators involved.
Account must be taken of the fact that insurance companies need a certain amount of time to prepare.
In all events, however, the phases for imposing a compulsory insurance system need to be defined as of now in the text of the directive, together with the type of damage it will cover and the activities to which it will refer.
As far as restoring environmental damage is concerned, we cannot accept broad derogations from operators' liability.
Otherwise, the final financial burden will be shifted to the taxpayer.
The exercise of activities for which permits are granted and which are not considered harmful at the time they are exercised must not preclude the operator's responsibility; however, the fact that there is a permit or that the harmful consequences of the activity at issue were not recognised in time could function as a mitigating circumstance when apportioning the cost of restoring ecological damage to the operator, provided that the operator was in full compliance with the terms imposed under current legislation or the permit during the exercise of its activity.
We are right to accept the report's differentiation criteria for compensation, from which we can indirectly see the size of the company, thereby ensuring that the viability of small companies is not jeopardised.
The foregoing also demonstrates that, if environmental protection is to be effective and ecological disasters are to be prevented, the activities that come within the scope of the directive must be revised on a regular basis, together with an evaluation of the most recent scientific conclusions and the experience acquired in the meantime.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on environmental liability was the missing link in an effective environmental policy.
Given a strong and courageous directive, we could reduce environmental pollution and damage, and make the polluter pay.
Will this proposed directive face up to the challenge?
After a gestation period of twenty years, the proposal is disappointing, but it can be greatly improved by the amendments put forward by the Greens and the left.
For how can we protect the environment while excluding nuclear activities and GMOs?
To try and protect and remedy biodiversity with a directive which establishes liability for only 13% of our territory is unacceptable.
Yet the worst thing is the hypocrisy of certain Member States on the issue of environmental liability.
French conservationists, who take umbrage at the level of the IOPCF payments, would do well to ask Mr Chirac, who takes pride in his environmental charter, to change the position of his government, which is campaigning in favour of exceptions to permits and against compulsory insurance.
This is totally at odds with a real environmental policy, because with permits and without compulsory insurance we can expect dozens of disasters like the Prestige and the Erika.
We refuse to accept this.
That is why we are asking everyone to vote in favour of our amendments.
Mr President, the tightening up of the environmental liability legislation that we are discussing today is a very important subject.
It is necessary if we are to repair and tackle environmental damage, but we also need it as a big stick to wield against damage occurring in future.
The report before us seems to me to be a very workable compromise that should win a majority of votes.
The rapporteur has, and I am very grateful to him for this, taken back one or two things like his tree fund, and the shadow rapporteurs Angelika Niebler and Markus Ferber have been working with the rapporteur to do all they can to achieve a workable compromise.
That does not mean that I am completely happy with what we have before us.
I have, however, promised Mrs Niebler that our group would support her because I want to give the proposal the benefit of the doubt.
Why am I not happy?
I wonder whether excluding certain sectors - the oil industry, the nuclear industry - is sufficiently well covered by the international agreements that are in place.
I doubt it somehow.
Secondly - and this is actually contradictory - we will be creating a new way of bringing the GMOs that are permitted back under this legislation.
I have my doubts about this.
Then there is the definition of habitat.
What will it cost when two wild hamsters are removed when an industrial park is built; who can pay for that?
I still have problems with the way in which habitat is defined.
Thirdly, I believe that there is too little commitment regarding insurance.
I would have preferred insurance to be made compulsory, because this would be relevant to small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
This will now be reviewed after five years.
Whether that is enough for it to work, I do not know.
Mr President, like everybody else in the Chamber, I welcome this directive.
For too long now we have operated on the polluter pays principle, but what has the polluter paid in the past?
The polluter has paid a small fine which never bears any resemblance to the actual clear-up costs of a site.
It is high time that we got round to not 'the polluter pays', but 'the polluter restores the site'.
That is what this directive sets out to do.
However, the directive, as amended by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is a weak directive at the moment.
We have left it unclear, we have left it vague.
I will point out some areas in which we have done that.
The definition of biodiversity is a very weak and very vague description.
It gives no comfort to the operators, no comfort to the environmental organisations and no comfort to the general public.
That is why I support the compromise amendment put forward by my own group, the GUE/NGL and the Verts/ALE.
Another point which the directive, as amended by the Legal Affairs Committee, has failed to address is that of mandatory financial insurance.
As it is formulated at the moment, it will allow bad operators to continue to be bad operators.
If they fall foul of the law they will go into insolvency.
Who will pick up the cost of that?
It will be the general public.
It will pick up the bill for restoring the site and operators will walk away once more.
We cannot allow that to happen.
Again, I urge people to look at the compromise coming from the three groups that I mentioned earlier.
On the question of permit defences, again, a full permit defence could be seen as a licence to pollute.
We must not allow that.
We must look at giving Member States and the courts the power to intervene if they believe that there has been pollution by somebody with a permit defence.
My group, and the European Parliamentary Labour Party, has some difficulty with the question of GMOs, not because we are against GMOs but because we think this legislation might weaken existing GMO legislation.
Therefore we will be asking for a split vote on one of the amendments.
Mr President, environmental liability should be one of the jewels in the crown of European environmental legislation, but up to now it has been a tragedy.
The Commission has taken 20 years to translate the polluter pays principle into legislation.
It is not getting industry to pay, however, but the national governments.
The polluter pays principle has been desecrated by the Commission.
Unfortunately, Mr Manders has made the mess even worse and has trimmed the already weak proposal right down to the bone.
It is not surprising that the whole of industry is rallying round Mr Manders.
If industry has an environmental permit, it can never be liable.
A car driver needs a driving licence to use the roads, but if the car driver causes an accident, he or she is most definitely liable.
That is where compulsory car insurance comes in.
We must introduce exactly the same responsibilities for industry.
That is the core of the polluter pays principle.
We must be able to claim against the perpetrators for accidents like those involving the Prestige and the Erika, as well as nuclear accidents and pollution caused by genetically modified food.
Hopefully the left liberals, the socialists, the greens, the regionalists, the communists and individuals on the right will achieve a majority tomorrow.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and also the shadow rapporteur from my group, Mrs Niebler, for the effort they have made to work together and to confront the pressure from the industry and from governmental organisations.
I believe that, at the moment, at a time when there have been numerous disasters in Europe, including the Prestige disaster, we must insist on the polluter pays principle.
I will focus on two specific points of this important Directive.
With regard to Article 9, which deals with exceptions, it should not be assumed that all exceptions and all authorisations lead to pollution.
The establishment of exceptions, such as activities covered by permits, as well as activities covered by the state of the art, correspond to the principle of legal certainty and legitimate confidence, which are being upheld by numerous judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Furthermore, this exception exclusively exempts damage caused by emissions and actions which fall within authorised parameters, and we should remember the principle of the IPPC Directive on the integrated control and prevention of pollution.
I therefore believe that Amendment No 37 perfectly covers the activities permitted specifically and explicitly by the laws.
With regard to financial guarantees, I believe that this is one of the key points of this report and that we must try to establish some sort of obligatory system of financial guarantees, on the part of the operators, in order to cover the responsibilities stemming from this Directive.
Bearing in mind the fear of certain countries that the insurance companies cannot take on this responsibility, the step-by-step approach would undoubtedly allow the financial guarantee to be ensured and the possibility of insuring against environmental damage.
The fear that small entrepreneurs may be harmed by the measure would be solved by means of the establishment of a minimum threshold or a minimum insurance.
This is an important aspect of this Directive and I believe it is taken up appropriately in Amendment No 92, presented by our group.
Mr President, I think it is very important that we should now obtain common legislation on environmental liability.
That is something for which we have waited for many years.
I do not believe that the Commission's proposal for a directive is completely satisfactory.
On the other hand, to adopt Mr Manders' report unamended would be totally to undermine environmental protection in the EU.
It would genuinely undermine the Commission's actual proposal.
There is a need for important changes.
First and foremost, it must be ensured that the polluter pays principle is applied without exception, and we must at the same time ensure, along the lines indicated by several other people, that there are financial guarantees of the polluter's also actually being able to pay, either through compulsory insurance arrangements or in some other way.
We should have strict or objective liability for forms of environmental destruction resulting from commercial activity.
When it comes to the issue of reducing biodiversity, I think it important that we obtain as broad a definition as possible so that all the habitats and species protected by Community legislation and corresponding national legislation are in actual fact covered.
Finally, I believe that the directive should also cover pollution of the countryside by genetically modified organisms.
I cannot begin to understand why there is no desire to address that issue in this directive.
In conclusion, a remark on access to the complaints procedure.
I believe that, in this area too, we must provide cover that is as broad as is humanly possible so that people really are given the opportunity to make complaints about environmental pollution, and the same thing should of course apply to non-governmental organisations or NGOs.
As a very last point, a couple of remarks about the legal base itself.
I appreciate that some people would like, in a few years' time, to transfer the legal base from the environmental protection provisions to the internal market.
That would, in my view, be a total mistake, and it would in actual fact destroy the rules governing environmental liability already established in many Member States.
That is therefore something I would very strongly oppose, and I would state that I shall only be able to vote in favour of Mr Manders' report if it is amended in relation to the points I have just mentioned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now that we have the opportunity to vote in favour of a proposal that will put a stop to a situation in which those who cause pollution are able to evade their responsibility.
I believe that both politicians and ordinary people are genuinely amazed that it has been possible for this situation to go on for so long and are demanding that it now be brought to an end.
At the same time, we must also be consistent and not allow unduly major exemptions in connection, for example, with genetically modified organisms, nuclear power and marine transport.
If we want to be consistent, we must also vote in favour of Amendment No 93 and the following amendments by the group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and progressive people from other groups.
As many others have already pointed out, Amendment No 107 is very important for, if the polluter pays principle really is to work in practice, there must be financial guarantees, even if a company goes bankrupt.
There is therefore also a need for an insurance system to be developed.
It is also very important for Article 175 to form the legal basis so that, as the previous speaker too pointed out, the existing systems are not undermined.
Mr President, a legislative framework on environmental liability is necessary because it is right that the polluter should pay.
However, the legislation must be well-balanced and take into consideration the expressed requirements of European industry.
The position adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is summarised in Mr Manders' report - and I would like to thank Mr Manders for this important document - is an acceptable compromise, although it does involve some sacrifices.
Some of the amendments being tabled now are particularly dangerous, in that they would make it impossible for operators to quantify insurance coverage.
The definition of environmental damage is central to the structure of the directive, as are the definitions of biodiversity and biodiversity damage.
As I see it, Amendments Nos 23, 84 and 98 are unacceptable: if an incident does not have harmful effects, then it is risk, not damage we should be talking about.
Amendment No 95 is not acceptable either, in that it disregards the polluter pays principle.
Indeed, the concept of liability is independent of the relationship of indefeasible right to use a site.
The definition of GMO soil contamination is inappropriate in that it is part of a general definition which does not list all the sources of contamination.
There needs to be a reference to proportional liability, not joint and several liability, which would create a system based on mistrust.
Prevention can and must continue to be the highest priority in activities which might affect the environment.
Lastly, the financial guarantees: in order to allow the insurance market to consolidate, we need to ensure maximum flexibility even after the first five years of application of the new legislation.
I therefore urge the Members to support the Committee on Legal Affairs' compromise, which is a clear, powerful signal furthering environmental protection but does not penalise European industry.
Mr President, it is essential for the polluter pays principle to be rigorously applied.
There are examples in all Member States of industry polluting an area and then moving on or going into liquidation. In Co.
Tipperary, Ireland, toxic dust has been blowing across the countryside from an abandoned 147-acre open-cast mine for the last 20 years.
It is not right that the company, which made vast sums of money - most of which tax-free - should walk away and leave the taxpayer to carry the cost of cleaning up the site.
I would also strongly argue that the principle of covering radiation pollution should be included too.
The people of Ireland will regard this directive as a sick joke if radiation is not included, as Sellafield is one of the single most serious threats to the Irish environment.
If this issue is not covered in this directive then it simply will not make sense to many Irish people.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and also Mr Papayannakis, on their work.
Adopting a directive on environmental liability would be of enormous value.
It would give credibility to environmental legislators, increase protection of the citizens and would send a clear message to economic operators that polluting does not pay.
I therefore welcomed the proposal for a directive with great expectations, but although it is a step in the right direction, I believe it falls short of what is needed.
Furthermore, in seeking to resolve any legal ambiguity, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has ended up further weakening the environmental objectives.
Consequently, with regard to the directive's scope, I would first of all admit that the issue of damage to biodiversity must be clarified but the solution does not lie, in my opinion, in excluding it from the directive.
The loss of biodiversity in the European Union is a reality and the commitments given in Johannesburg and Gothenburg must be honoured.
Secondly, I believe that, in addition to the damage to the ecological and chemical makeup of water, the directive should also cover damage to its volume, as laid down in the framework directive on water.
Thirdly, I feel it is unacceptable for oil pollution in maritime transport and radioactive pollution caused by nuclear reactors to be excluded from the directive's scope.
These activities are amongst the most damaging to the environment and international instruments do not properly address the prevention and remedying of the damage these activities cause.
Lastly, Mr President, I call for the directive to contain clearer provisions on making insurance compulsory, particularly for operators in more dangerous activities, in order to prevent taxpayers having to pay for damage in the event that companies become insolvent.
Mr President, I insist on congratulating Mr Manders as I think that he has performed his task admirably.
Not only has he got through a pile of work and consulted broadly; he has also managed to achieve a balanced compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market despite the hundreds of amendments and great controversy.
This debate makes it clear that the controversy is by no means resolved, but what Mr Manders is presenting is well-balanced, workable and reasonable, and it provides for updates within the next five years.
It is important - more than important - to repair the riches of the environment and even more important to prevent damage.
It goes without saying that a strict liability scheme can to a great extent contribute to this.
Even though the legislation is not yet complete, this report is taking us a considerable step towards better protection, because let us not forget that in addition to the obligation to repair, we are also introducing objective liability.
Objective liability - that means that neither blame nor negligence are relevant.
We have naturally been used to this modus operandi in other sectors for some time, but it is and remains a far-reaching principle.
I think that we must accept this far-reaching liability scheme, but at the same time I am convinced that the scheme must be legally secure, workable, efficient and reasonable, and therefore I am prepared to vote for the report as it has come from the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has, in my view, produced a workable proposal.
Let us hope that the Council follows Parliament's example, takes a decision and does not delay the directive.
Parliament should accept this proposal as a basis for a decision and extend the directive to environmental damage caused by nuclear activities.
The directive is important in my view because it will make the polluter pays principle a European principle that can be asserted in practice and because it will strengthen the European model of an environmental and social market economy.
Mrs Flemming and I tabled 35 amendments on behalf of the Austrian contingent.
Of these, 11 were accepted verbatim and 7 have been incorporated in the compromise amendments.
In my opinion, the following five points are particularly positive and deserve to be mentioned: firstly, the directive will apply to all those activities that are listed in Annex I and which are now described more clearly thanks to our amendment.
Secondly, liability is precluded for normal operations that have been approved by the authorities and for emissions or activities that are not regarded as harmful based on current scientific knowledge.
This provides legal certainty.
Thirdly, the principle of shared liability has been accepted instead of liability based on solidarity, which means that the costs will be split in cases where there are several polluters.
Fourthly, the directive seeks to have environmental damage made good and for that reason the provisions on compensation for interim losses have been deleted.
Fifthly, the committee is in favour of voluntary financial security measures and of capping liability and is against compulsory insurance. This also represents a balance between different interests.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, numerous environmental disasters such as the latest one concerning the Prestige oil tanker, which was shipwrecked on the Spanish coast, have sped up the progress of environmental liability legislation in the EU.
In my own country, Finland, furthermore, people are worried when they see the dreadful condition of some of the oil transporting vessels that sail along our coasts.
People's health is inseparably linked to the environment around them.
Questions of environmental liability are thus naturally close to the hearts of our citizens and therefore also constitute key areas of focus in our policies.
A third of the petitions that arrived at the European Parliament last year, around 1 700, concerned these very problems relating to the environment.
The Commission's proposal for a directive aims to ensure that the polluter will pay the costs of remedying future environmental damage.
This to be a harmonised framework across the European Union, allowing us to avoid a situation whereby a company chooses to establish its registered office wherever the most favourable legislation applies.
In order to avoid distortion of competition in the internal market, it is important that the directive is implemented in as uniform a manner as possible in the EU Member States.
It is also important to retain the legal basis relating to the internal market, that is to say Article 95, after a five-year transition period.
We discussed the Commission proposal on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and we are proposing numerous necessary amendments to it.
Our amendments are generally aimed at clarifying the legal interpretation of the directive and striking a balance between the interests of industry and of environmental players.
To avoid any legal uncertainty we proposed that the field of nuclear safety, which is already regulated by means of international agreements, should be excluded from the directive.
The international conventions on nuclear safety are at present being revised, and comparable environmental liability regulations are to be included in them.
It would be unwise of the EU to undermine the importance of the international agreements right now, as they are being revised and will be expanded to apply also to the new Member States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on environmental liability provides for a balanced approach which will apply pressure on operators to avoid contamination and to remediate damage whilst suggesting only a light regulatory touch in order to achieve this.
Any fundamental changes to this proposal for a directive would have produced an unworkable and impractical solution to what is already a complicated subject, and I feel that the work carried out by Mr Manders and others in committee represents the great possible convergence in view of this constraint.
In fact, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not made any fundamental changes to the Commission's approach, but it has clarified a number of essential principles.
The directive does not apply retroactively.
The permit and 'state of the art' exceptions should be retained.
There should be mandatory liability but not compulsory insurance - the guiding principle of the directive is that the polluter must pay for environmental damage caused by their actions.
An awareness of the financial implications of such damage will also lead to greater efforts to prevent environmental damage occurring.
The polluter pays principle therefore aims to address remediation and incentivise prevention.
A mandatory financial security regime might destabilise this relationship: operators would know that their financial liabilities are covered by an insurance policy, fund or levy and, as a consequence, the incentive to prevent damage is removed.
A mandatory system of financial security might well be described as the 'insurer pays principle' in that the risk of liability has been transferred from operator to financial security provider.
We all must be socially responsible about protecting the environment because it is inherently a finite resource.
Operators need to recognise that there are consequences to their actions and that they will pay for any damage that they cause with intent or by way of being reckless.
The 'polluter pays principle' is acceptable on these terms.
Thanks to the reasonable approach advocated by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, a Directive will have been created that reflects the interests of both industry and the environment.
Mr President, I should like to thank Members for all those valuable speeches and constructive ideas on how to improve this proposal.
Let me begin by commenting on two things: the polluter-pays principle and the scope.
Several Members referred to the long history of this proposal; the debate reflected the different views and the need to find a balanced approach in the end.
I also understand that many Members want to be more ambitious: to overload this proposal with a lot more.
I can understand that, but it is important to see it as a step-by-step approach, because we have a practical view on this.
We do not want to overload it with aspects that we are negotiating at the same time in international fora.
I am sure that there would be more chance of losing the whole proposal if we were to try to burden it with these aspects.
The polluter-pays principle is the guiding principle behind this whole proposal, and that is why it is quoted in the first article.
The idea behind it is to create responsibility and, via that, to achieve prevention.
It gives that very clear signal.
We also touch upon the fact that in many cases it is not possible to find the polluter, or to make the polluter pay.
In that case, there has to be remediation.
We want to see an insurance system.
However, we believe that market forces should be allowed to create that kind of system.
We do not want to impose it today in a situation where it is not clear that we would achieve the desired effect.
In reply to Miss Breyer's point: all accidents are covered.
I do not know what Members' presumptions are about the targets for this legislation, but our presumptions are very much based on the facts that there are too many accidents and too many cases of negligence, and also that short-sighted greed is behind much of the pollution.
This is why we have designed the proposal this way.
Therefore, all accidents are covered and we have also covered cases of negligence; this will create a polluter-pays principle and, in the end, pave the way for prevention.
What about the scope?
It was very important for us to ensure that we have legal clarity if we want to introduce a new system covering biodiversity, because traditional damage - economic damage or damage to people - is already well covered by the legislation in all Member States.
We do not have to take over that at Community level, but we want to harmonise the rules for covering damage to biodiversity.
That was the starting-point.
If we want to do this and have a credible system, we need legal clarity and a system which is manageable and which can be applied.
If the definition is too wide - as it is proposed, it would cover, in some cases, the whole biosphere - it will be unmanageable.
For example, we would have to cover damage to weeds!
Is that something insurers will be happy to cover?
Would that be a manageable system?
Digging the foundations for a house would hurt worms.
Do we want that to be covered?
Is that reasonable?
You have to be sure about the scope and make a definition that provides legal clarity.
We have to see it as a step-by-step approach.
I am sure that as we apply this legislation there will be more legal clarity.
However, if we are too ambitious at the beginning and think that we can cover the whole biosphere, then we would not be serving environmental interests.
On GMOs, nuclear and marine pollution: we can see that this is an area in which we would also like to be more ambitious.
However, we have a very practical reason for not covering this in this particular proposal.
We are negotiating to improve the rules on these areas.
We have international fora and conventions that cover these matters.
We do not want to duplicate work: we want to be practical.
We do not want to overload this system by taking it on here.
We need another few years to work on incorporating these aspects.
For international activities, there should be international rules.
As I have already said, traditional damage is already covered by legislation in Member States.
What about oil or marine pollution?
The polluter shall pay!
This is the only rule that can apply.
It is a scandal that we have let it go this far.
We have seen accident after accident.
But, again, this is a truly international activity and we have to work towards international rules that apply the polluter-pays principle.
I understand that the Director of the IOPC Fund has announced that claims for compensation would only be covered by up to 15% of this amount.
This is not acceptable.
The Commission is well aware of the situation and this is why we have always supported the attempt to raise the funds available up to EUR 1 billion.
I understand that this week a diplomatic conference is being held in London to sign a protocol to raise the ceiling of the funds available for compensation.
I hope that this conference will be a success; we are all determined to work on marine pollution and to do everything we can.
We want to avoid loopholes and also the absurd situation where neither the directive nor international conventions apply.
That is why the Commission agrees that the directive should apply in all cases where the relevant international convention is not yet in force.
For the same reason, where the relevant conventions are not in force, the Commission does not support the notion of waiting for five years before the directive is applicable.
It has also been proposed that after a five-year transitional period, the Commission should develop proposals so that the directive applies eventually in a complementary manner to the international conventions where liability or compensation is insufficiently regulated within those conventions.
The Commission does not believe that letting the directive play the role of filling in possible gaps in existing conventions would be either constructive or workable.
The conventions contain exclusivity clauses that bind the States' parties to the conventions and prevent them from imposing any complementary legal instruments, so Member States would have to denounce conventions they had ratified to be able to follow Community rules.
Before letting it come to that, it would surely be preferable to try to improve those conventions by renegotiating them in the proper international context.
What about regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art and development risks?
Some amendments have been tabled that seek to maintain the so-called permit and state-of-the-art or development risk defences as proper defences and, as far as permit defences are concerned, with a formulation that would better specify its scope.
Other amendments aim instead to introduce regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art as mitigating factors.
The Commission believes that proper defences, with the proposed improved wording, constitute a preferable solution in terms of insurability and legal certainty.
The Commission considers it useful, however, to better specify the scope of the so-called permit defence to avoid any suggestion that this might be tantamount to a blank cheque to pollute, because this is not the idea.
The Commission does not find it appropriate to impose liability on the competent authority when damage is caused by a permitted activity, nor does it find it appropriate that there should be a link between the state-of-the-art defence and any environmental audit and management system.
I am sure that these issues will come back during further decision-making on this issue.
Amendments have been tabled to impose either proportional liability or joint and several liability.
The Commission considers, however, that Member States should retain the right to opt for either joint and several, or for proportional liability, or a mix of both, according to their national legal traditions.
I recall in that respect that the proposal offers some safeguards to operators, since it provides that operators who are able to establish the extent to which the damage results from their activities, be required to bear only such costs as relate to that part of the damage.
It has been proposed that the Commission should present a proposal to supplement the regulatory framework on liability for damage caused by GMOs.
Apart from the fact that such a requirement would unduly impinge on the Commission's right of initiative, the Commission is currently considering the issue of economic damage to conventional and organic farmers in the context of the so-called coexistence debate.
The outcome of that debate should not be prejudged here.
Again, this is what will cover traditional damage.
On financial security: amendments have been tabled either to propose that financial security become compulsory after the directive enters into force, or to oppose such a move towards compulsory financial security.
I think we can agree that financial security will become an important factor in the proper implementation of the directive.
Member States and market operators, as well as the Commission, will have an important role to play in encouraging a timely emergence of financial assurance systems, products and markets to that effect.
Having said this, it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace; solutions which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions.
In addition, financial markets should be given time and leeway to develop market solutions following the demand for insurance that is very likely to take off once the new liability regime is established.
In the light of this, it appears premature to impose fully-fledged financial security for all Annex I operators within a few years.
That said, it would certainty be fruitful to revisit the situation when the Commission carries out its general review of the implementation of the directive.
There is general agreement that the polluter-pays principle should imply, for the liable operator as polluter, to pay for all the damage it causes to the environment.
In addition, there is a clear need for a common understanding within the Community that the costs of environmental damage should be borne by the polluter.
Furthermore, the rules set out in the proposal specify the full range of remediation actions to be carried out by the liable operator.
Amendments have now been tabled to narrow down the scope of damage remediation by suppressing the remediation of interim losses, together with suppressing the concept of a natural resource service.
Deleting elements from this range of actions would inevitably result in the polluter not having to carry the full cost of the damage he causes.
Finally, in the difficult context of this debate on environmental liability, the Commission has tried to reach an overall balance which has already been built on compromise solutions.
At this stage the Commission is still of the opinion that the proposal is fair and workable in many respects and should be supported.
I am also aware, however, that we are still at the beginning of the legislative process, and thus entirely conscious of the need for all the institutions involved in this process to reach agreement in due course.
Such an agreement implies necessarily the willingness of all parties to find appropriate and satisfactory compromises.
The debate has reflected this need to ensure that we bridge the different views and find a workable solution in the end.
I shall hand the Commission's position on all the amendments to Parliament's services for publication
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The proposal for a directive on environmental liability is of great importance in ensuring improved environmental protection and combating all kinds of pollution.
Whether we take the example of AZF in Toulouse in 2002 or the Erika and Prestige oil tankers, these disasters cost human lives and lead to serious, long-term environmental damage.
The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes a more conciliatory position with regard to business interests, weakening the initial proposal for a directive.
On the contrary, the provisions laid down should be strengthened with protection measures, making polluters bear the cost of environmental damage, giving NGOs and citizens the opportunity to take their case to court, and including in the directive damage caused by GMOs.
At a time when the IOPCF has just announced a ludicrous compensation rate of 15% for the damage caused by the Prestige, causing amazement and anger among the people and associations, and rightly so, Europe now has a duty to send out a completely different message.
It must send out a clear message of justice and determination.
. (IT) Mr President, the Commission communication on environmental agreements is part of the process of simplifying and improving the legislative framework, which we all support.
Indeed, it is necessary for Community legislation to be further adapted in view of current issues, the challenges posed by enlargement, local situations and constantly developing technology.
The object is to maintain the legal certainty of law on the territory of the Union by means of greater involvement and dynamism on the part of economic and social operators.
This is the backdrop to the issue of environmental agreements.
I support the line taken by the Commission, which makes a distinction between two types of environmental agreement and, having made a number of amendments, I fully acknowledge the usefulness of these instruments to supplement regulatory measures, to be used only with a view to making improvements in the environmental field with a scope equal to or broader than those to be obtained by means of traditional legislative procedures.
The Treaty does not contain any specific provision concerning environmental agreements.
Such instruments must therefore be used in full compliance with all the provisions of the Treaty and the Community's international commitments.
The basic structure of Community policy on the environment is and has always been legislative provisions, which in only a few specific cases may be combined with voluntary agreements.
In drafting the opinion on which we are about to vote, taking account of the debate held on the subject and Parliament's positions, I felt that a number of clarifications and guarantees still needed to be included before the instruments mentioned in the Communication could be considered to be acceptable and genuinely practicable. Five binding preliminary conditions are identified in particular, which I will now summarise briefly.
Firstly, I tried to make the concept of voluntary agreements as instruments for integrating Community legislation more explicit. Secondly, I called for upstream definition of the sectors which might be the subject of voluntary agreements, through both coregulation and self-regulation instruments.
New regulatory instruments should, in fact, be used on the basis of a common reference framework showing, from the outset, the intention to use voluntary agreements in that specific sector.
The specific intention to use a voluntary agreement should be mentioned in the Commission's annual work programme, or in documents with broader scope, such as White Papers or Thematic Strategies. Thirdly, I proposed further analysis of the assessment criteria needed for correct use of environmental agreements.
I consider that, in order to guarantee the transparency and effectiveness of voluntary instruments, it is necessary to define the conditions of application and verify the implementing procedures.
As stressed earlier, the objectives of the agreement - defined within a legislative reference framework or set out in a Commission recommendation - must, in any case, entail obligations for the parties concerned.
Failure to respect or achieve the objectives laid down would trigger recourse to supplementary legislative mechanisms or the replacement of the agreement.
All things considered, the distinction between coregulation and self-regulation is appreciated here. In the first case, the instruments have to be included in a binding legal framework giving the Council and Parliament the right to participate and adopt objectives, providing for public access and participation and introducing effective monitoring and sanction mechanisms.
In the second case, the Commission's role may be to stimulate or encourage, by means of a recommendation, or to recognise, by means of an exchange of letters with the representatives of the sectors concerned. Whatever the choice of instrument, Parliament and the Council retain their power to scrutinise the results achieved and the possibility of using typical legislative instruments at any time.
With regard to these bases, which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has improved and endorsed, we give the green light to the Commission so that, in the sectors mentioned, first and foremost the PVC sector, we can start to put this mix of legislation and voluntary commitments to the practical test.
We have enhanced and rearranged the tool box: now let us all use it to the full!
Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, for the work that has gone into this report and the motion for a resolution.
I welcome the overall positive tone of the report and the motion for a resolution.
The report broadly endorses the approach set out by the Commission in its communication.
I am particularly pleased that Parliament explicitly recognises environmental agreements as a useful complement to legislative measures.
I reconfirm the Commission's commitment to making use of voluntary agreements at Community level on a selective case-by-case basis only, checking them against the criteria laid down in the communication and respecting procedural requirements that ensure proper involvement of the European Parliament.
My only regret is that the legitimate concerns of Parliament to exert its democratic control have resulted, in some points, in a call for control requirements that are not in balance with the voluntary nature of the instrument.
It is important to satisfy the need for transparency and control on the one hand without, on the other hand, discouraging economic actors from taking up the instrument of environmental agreements by imposing excessive requirements.
The Commission will make the choice between self-regulation and co-regulation on the basis of an ad hoc assessment of the individual agreement, the legal context and the policy issue at stake.
It would not make sense to define general abstract criteria to this effect.
As I have already indicated, imposing ambitious monitoring requirements on spontaneous agreements that are not formally acknowledged by the Commission appears to be overly burdensome and a real disincentive for industry to come forward with such agreements.
The Commission proposed general rules on impact assessment in its communication of 5 June 2002.
It would not make sense to go beyond the requirements imposed on legislative acts when it comes to environmental agreements.
I am pleased that our tentative list of policy areas in which the instrument could be used meets with your agreement.
I also appreciate the suggestion that environmental agreements could be used in the sectors defined in the action plan set out by the Johannesburg world summit.
In conclusion I would like to emphasise that I consider Parliament's resolution an overall positive signal that will contribute to facilitating the use of environmental agreements under transparent and acceptable conditions.
Mr President, I am very happy with Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's comments.
I am also relatively happy with Mr Sacconi's report.
My only criticism of your report and of a number of the amendments submitted by Mr De Roo concerns the comments that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m also made.
Let me say the following: there is now a new instrument that has two kinds of voluntary agreements.
One is based on legislation in the form of co-regulation; you can build on that, things can happen more quickly, we do not have to prescribe everything straight away.
The second suggestion that now appears in the new memorandum is completely voluntary self-regulation in which partners in the market agree something with each other which may anticipate what will be agreed at some point in the future.
This is based on voluntariness.
I feel - and this has just been expressed by Mrs WallstrÃ¶m - that anxiety is often the worst adviser in this Parliament, that we prescribe so much and that we are becoming so detailed that we are in the process of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, although we should be pleased with the large number of agreements there are.
May I perhaps say - Christian democracy being the midfield defender incarnate in my country - that very many things would not have happened without voluntariness.
Take the packaging covenant, for example.
That is a voluntary agreement that goes much further than the one that the most extreme would like to achieve now on a European level.
It is a voluntary agreement.
Give a clear field to voluntariness, I would say.
Let it take the place of the instrument, if it must.
Mr Sacconi, that is why I am asking everyone to approve the amendment that I have submitted on behalf of my group.
The same goes for the PVC strategy.
We could have achieved much more if this Parliament - including the liberals, incidentally - had said at the time: we are now going to ask the Commission to develop a new policy together with industry which will enable them to energetically go about ensuring - and in fact you were the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi - that that PVC is used up.
The same applies to pedestrian safety.
We could prevent 2 000 deaths a year if we act quickly.
I would like to ask for the other group to be allowed more leeway and to be trusted. I am in favour of a good environmental policy.
All of us here are; please make sure it is a good one.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am one hundred percent behind the basic views expressed in this report by the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, on voluntary agreements, and especially the notion that the basic assumption behind such voluntary agreements must be that they act as a supplement to existing legislation.
It is as if their role is to find a path to improved legislation.
Perhaps when the results of voluntary agreements are analysed, they will lead to new laws that will go further with regard to environmental issues than is presently the case.
Operators that are prepared to participate in these voluntary agreements may be regarded as pilots of a sort.
At the level of business this will also mean that when there is the willingness to start looking for better applications, companies can then take advantage of this in their own marketing strategies, which hopefully will lead to a situation where consumers will also start demanding these better applications on a wider scale.
Taking everything into consideration, however, we have to ensure that these voluntary agreements actually yield results and do not just remain a pious hope.
For that reason, we really have to make sure that we can measure the results precisely and that there are certain deadlines by which time results must have been achieved.
There are many operators at regional and local level, besides companies, that have been interested in concluding voluntary agreements.
In this connection, we have to make sure that if the party to an agreement operates at regional level, then central level is also informed about what is taking place, in order to avoid overlapping and so that we can ensure as far as possible that the benefits are realised, and also answer questions on financing.
On the whole I think these voluntary agreements provide added value, but with the provisos that are also linked to the Commission proposal, that is to say, we have to improve legislation, not replace it.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to congratulate Mr Sacconi on his excellent report, with which I am in complete agreement.
Although in theory, voluntary environmental agreements are to be applauded, reality has shown that, precisely because they are voluntary, many of these agreements are ultimately not observed and, furthermore, have frequently been used as a pretext for not bringing into force more ambitious legally binding initiatives.
We all remember what happened with the emissions trading directive: many people tried to prevent it being adopted because some States had voluntary agreements in place with industry.
I therefore believe it is greatly to be welcomed that the Commission has taken the initiative to define clear rules for recognising voluntary agreements at Community level.
I think that there are some rules that must be respected: first of all, the voluntary agreements must be seen only as a complement to environmental policy and not as a basis for it; secondly, they must be used only when they are proven to have advantages over conventional instruments; thirdly, they must be promoted only in cases where they attempt to go further than traditional legislation; fourthly, they must be geared towards technological research and be based on benchmarking criteria: it makes no sense to have voluntary agreements that do not promote the best technologies.
Lastly, there must be deadlines, timetables, clearly defined targets and mechanisms for monitoring results and ensuring compliance.
Mr President, I too must thank Mr Sacconi for a really good report which, in my opinion, states very precisely the prior conditions and requirements that must be present if an environmental agreement is to become a serviceable legal instrument.
I should like to say to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that I think that voluntary agreements are important but that it is also important we be clear about which conditions must be fulfilled if the agreements are to be beneficial, in environmental terms too.
On this, I completely agree with what Mr de Silva said, to the effect that the environmental agreements can only be supplementary in areas in which they can be used to bring about improvements, or added value, in the environmental sphere, and that they should not just be used to avoid environmental regulation in a particular area.
In addition, it is important that the objectives and deadlines be carefully specified in connection with the agreements and that they also be sure to cover a representative sample of the relevant businesses and production in the area in question, so that one group of businesses is not given the opportunity to freewheel.
I think that complete openness in relation to the public, to this Parliament, to the environmental organisations and to civil society is also important.
There must be openness in connection with plans to enter into the environmental agreements, but also considerable scope for objecting to the use of environmental agreements in a specific area.
Finally, it is important, in connection with the agreements, that a monitoring and penalties system be established so that it can in actual fact be monitored whether the agreements, and objectives laid down in those agreements, are also being fulfilled during the periods of the agreements.
In my own country, Denmark, too, we have experimented with environmental agreements in some areas, for example the PVC area, in which there was not enough in terms of provisions governing monitoring and penalties. It emerged, when the period had elapsed, that absolutely nothing had happened in terms of improving the use of PVC materials.
It is therefore very important that these matters be clarified in connection with entering into environmental agreements.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report now before us is an important contribution to the aim of simplifying and improving environmental legislation in the Community.
For this special thanks go to my colleague, Mr Sacconi.
The feedback hitherto on environmental agreements has shown that a significant number of environmental and civil society players have viewed voluntary agreements with suspicion, even when the act of making the agreement in itself has been voluntary (although the agreement itself is binding).
On the other hand, it has been the wish of industry to spread the practice of making voluntary agreements in order to achieve positive results from the point of view of flexibility, and so also, hopefully, that of the environment.
As I see it, the gap is now becoming well and truly bridged.
The report works on the assumption that voluntary agreements may be applied when the impact can be assessed using an integrated method and the added value for civil society can be measured using indicators of sustainable development.
Secondly, we have to be able to define our objectives and set clear deadlines for them.
In addition, we must insist on the agreement being representative.
In practice this would mean that badly organised sectors or those that provide opportunities for 'free riding' would not be suitable for inclusion in any voluntary agreement.
With voluntary agreements it is just as necessary as it is with legislative measures to take account of public participation and to guarantee the transparency of agreements.
In addition we must ensure the binding nature of any agreement, the assessment of results and possible penalties.
With these conditions in place there is no risk attached to the use of voluntary agreements.
The conditions mentioned will guarantee that an agreement will produce a better end result than legislative instruments, from the point of view of the environment and society.
I must also therefore say that the amendment proposed by my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, should be supported.
The procedure for concluding an agreement generally instils a sense of genuine commitment to the objective in the party to that agreement.
It often goes deeper than the wording of the agreement or the letter of the law.
Thus, operators will not be using up their resources looking for loopholes; instead, they will be seeking ways to effectively implement the objective.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0128/2003) by Mr Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (COM(2002) 719 - C5-0002/2003 - 2002/0298(CNS)).
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, for the excellent work he has done in preparing this report on the Commission's proposal to amend the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers.
I should like to record briefly the background and purposes of the reform under discussion today.
With this proposal the Commission is keeping to the commitments it made in the White Paper on European Governance and in its action plan on better regulation, namely, inter alia, to give the Council and the European Parliament equal rights in monitoring and overseeing the executive.
The two branches of the legislature must be placed on an equal footing, as supervisors of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers in matters subject to codecision.
The European Parliament should, as co-legislator, be given the right to object not just to the scope of powers delegated to the Commission under codecision - the current right of scrutiny granted in Council Decision 1999/468/EC - but also to the substance of a measure implementing a codecision act.
It is the hope of the Commission that such reform will ultimately pave the way to a wider review based on Treaty changes.
To this end, the Commission made concrete proposals to amend Article 202 of the Treaty in the framework of the European Convention, notably by introducing the concept of delegation of legislative powers in the Treaty.
I emphasise that a temporary reform of the system is all the more necessary as the uncertainty surrounding the ratification by 25 Member States of the new constitutional treaty is not inconsiderable.
The Commission therefore welcomes the support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the proposal and hopes the Chamber will confirm this favourable stance.
Mr President, I very much welcome the Commission proposal which, if adopted and adjusted slightly, would bring forward a substantial improvement to the current system and indeed could form the basis of solving once and for all this problem of the so-called comitology system that has been a difficulty for years.
All systems, be they national parliamentary or European Parliamentary systems, have methods of delegating powers to the executive: implementing powers, secondary legislation - call them what you like.
I will not get into a theological argument about the definition of such powers.
But it is normal practice.
What is not normal is the way we do it in the European Union where we set up, alongside the Commission, committees of national civil servants which, in some cases, have the powers to block the Commission.
Indeed so many committees have been set up that the name comitology was invented to describe a system that was so difficult to fathom and so difficult to get to grips with.
The system was greatly improved in 1999 when the revised system was adopted by the Council: greater transparency, a greater guarantee that Parliament has access to all the proposals and all the documents.
That is very good, but it has left two fundamental problems.
Firstly, the Commission's powers are scrutinised only by committees of national civil servants, which alone have the power to block the Commission and call back the decision to the legislative authority.
Secondly, if a decision is called back, it only goes to one branch of the legislative authority, namely the Council, even when it is codecision legislation adopted in the first place by Parliament and the Council jointly.
That is something we find unacceptable.
We want equal rights of call back for Parliament and the Council - Parliament by an absolute majority, the Council by a qualified majority, as is the bottom line now when a matter goes back to the Council.
We should have the right to call back an implementing measure. If it is called back there should be equal rights of scrutiny for both Parliament and the Council.
The Commission proposal almost achieves that.
It comes very close to doing that.
The fly in the ointment is the word 'possibly', which is in the Commission's draft.
In other words the Commission, if we object to a draft, will possibly amend it to take account of our objections or refer it to the legislative procedure.
In my view and that of the committee, the word 'possibly' should go because only then will we really have a basis for a definitive solution to this issue.
Why does the Commission insist on the word 'possibly'?
It says that the current legal basis of the Treaties does not allow it to go any further.
I beg to disagree.
If you look at the fact that the legislation is adopted anyway, in the first place, under codecision by Parliament and the Council, it is up to Parliament and the Council to put in place any system, and any checks and balances that they want.
If one argues that such checks and balances must conform to Article 202, then let us look at that article.
It says: 'The Council may impose certain requirements in respect of the exercise of implementing powers.'
'Certain requirements' is the wording on which the whole comitology system is based.
If such a complex system can be set up on the basis of that clause in the Treaty, there is absolutely nothing to prevent the Council from setting up a different system - the one which we are advocating - that gives the Council and Parliament equal rights to call back and equal rights to scrutinise.
Article 202, in other words, is much more flexible than the Commission's legal service seems to believe.
I would therefore urge the Commission to accept our amendment concerning the word 'possibly'.
I give notice now that if the Commission does not accept that amendment then, before the final vote, I as rapporteur will move that the issue be referred back to committee, where we will pursue further negotiations with the Commission on this issue.
We have also sought to amend the Commission proposal to make it slightly more flexible.
This is something I hope the Commission will welcome.
We propose to give the Commission the right simply to withdraw an implementing measure if Parliament objects to it or indeed if the Council objects to it.
This is common sense.
Some implementing measures are discretionary, not obligatory.
If we think that the Commission does not need to adopt an implementing measure at the time or of the style that the Commission envisages, and we object to it, the Commission should be able to withdraw it.
That is already provided for in our Rules of Procedure.
I understand that the PPE-DE is opposed to that amendment.
I look forward to hearing their arguments on this, but it is in conformity with what Parliament adopted in the Bourlanges report only a few months ago.
We similarly propose to give the Commission the right to maintain an implementing measure, provisionally, when Parliament has objected to it, pending a full legislative procedure to review, amend or repeal the implementing measure - again an element of flexibility that I expect the Commission to welcome.
Finally, we propose to keep the special procedures that were agreed under the so-called Lamfalussy procedures.
I gather that is not a matter of controversy.
I am pleased to say that other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which has a lot of experience with comitology, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has begun to deal with the Lamfalussy procedures, fully support the approach that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken on this.
If we manage to find a solution to this issue now we will have eliminated a problem that has messed up and held up numerous legislative procedures, and we will have removed one of the obstacles to Parliament being willing to delegate far more implementing powers to the Commission than is the case under these procedures.
If we have the right to call back in the way that is envisaged we will be able to delegate much more than we can now, knowing that we have the safety of being able to scrutinise and call back if necessary.
That is something that all should welcome.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to submit my opinion on the issue of comitology. In so doing - and this was of course mentioned at the end of the previous intervention - I am focusing in particular on the Lamfalussy process and the Lamfalussy procedures for legislation creating the internal market in financial services.
Like the Lamfalussy Group, our aim is to produce legislation in this sector that is close to the market and practicable; that is what all of us want and are working for.
However, we must of course take a close look at what form the procedures may take in the future.
Precisely in our role as Parliament we need to ask ourselves whether the future procedures also have sufficient democratic legitimacy, because of course we are also getting increasing numbers of so-called soft laws, that is legislation at international level.
I only need to mention Basel II or the International Accounting Standards, which will soon become law in Europe once the necessary steps have been taken by the European Commission and after adoption in the Council and Parliament.
If in the future all of this were to happen in a comitology procedure, with a framework directive only giving general instructions, we would have a basic problem of legitimacy, and Parliament reserves the right to have a say on these very important issues in the future.
For this reason I can only support the rapporteur, Mr Corbett.
It is vital for us in the European Parliament to retain our influence at European level.
This does not mean that we also wish to discuss the technical details in the plenary or in committee.
That is not our point.
But if we feel that provisions are heading in the wrong direction it is vital that we be able to say so, and for this to happen it is essential that the constitution being drafted by the Convention give us a right to call back in the future, which means that if we are not happy with something we can recall it, change its focus and correct it.
That is why it is essential for the Commission and the Convention to support us here so that we can have the relevant provisions added.
Mr President, the aim of Mr Corbett's report is to strengthen Parliament's powers of control over the texts implementing legislative acts prepared by the Commission in the context of what is mysteriously known as comitology.
The PPE-DE approves the main thrust of the report and in particular it supports the idea that, in the case of a disagreement between Parliament and the Commission on a draft implementing text, the latter should not be able to override Parliament's opposition.
If the Commission did not agree with Parliament on this point, the PPE-DE would gladly support the request that could be made by the rapporteur for a referral to committee.
There are two points on which we disagree with Mr Corbett's report, however.
Firstly, it lays down that if Parliament does not agree to the text proposed by the Commission, the latter may simply withdraw its text without preparing a new one and without taking any legislative initiative.
This power seems to us to be completely excessive.
It is equivalent to an authorisation to go on strike as far as the production of implementing texts is concerned, and we cannot support it.
The aim of our requests for a separate vote is to rule out such a possibility.
Secondly, Mr Corbett's report suggests that, if the Commission were to undertake a new legislative initiative, because it thought it would be impossible to overcome its disagreement with Parliament simply by amending its text, the text prepared by the Commission would be provisionally applicable until the adoption of the new legislative text.
We do not believe that this is acceptable.
In fact, it seems to us to be an abuse to allow the Commission to override, for a very long period, the opposition of Parliament, even when the disagreement between the two institutions is so serious and so deep-seated that it cannot be overcome by a simple amendment to the draft, but requires recourse to a legislative procedure.
To give the Commission the power to impose the disputed text, for several months or even years, would be to acknowledge officially that the Commission has the power to ignore or violate the law.
Those are the two reservations that we have.
We have not tabled amendments, but merely requests for a separate vote, the aim of which is to correct the report on this point. Otherwise we approve the report and we congratulate the rapporteur for his work, which is remarkable for its quality.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Corbett.
This is not exactly a straightforward subject.
Perhaps the easiest way to explain it - since we always have a few visitors with us at this time of day - is to say that we are talking about building a bridge.
The Corbett report is an attempt to build a bridge out of this European confusion of non-competencies or mysterious clan competencies, which mean, as Mr Radwan said, that all of a sudden rules directly affecting the lives of millions of people are adopted at a lower level, when there is no direct democratic legitimacy for this.
This is to a large extent due to the history of the European Union and its failure to have a clear separation of powers.
This state of affairs means that many issues fall in a grey area and are delegated.
In some cases laws are still made by civil servants; in certain areas this is a practice that is even on the increase.
The fact that the European Parliament is putting up a fight is, I think, a historic achievement and also legitimises its existence.
But what is crucial now is undoubtedly for the Convention, which is of course occupying a great deal of our attention at the present time, to make it much more clear what happens where, and it is of course vital that this include the power for the European Parliament - this representative body of the people - to be able to call back such implementing powers once they have been delegated.
The success of this project will depend on this, but also on whether we can find the words and expressions - once Mr Corbett has built this bridge - to explain this to the public and the electorate in a way that they can actually understand, so as to bring clarity and transparency to the issue, so that there is nowhere that anyone can hide any tricks.
With this in mind I would stick to my ceterum censeo, that there can be no democracy without transparency.
Mr President, I am distinctly uneasy about this proposal, but there does not seem to be an easy answer.
On the one hand, Mr Corbett wants to give the Parliament equivalency with the Council, suggesting that somehow this improves the accountability of the system and by inference its democratic legitimacy.
On the other hand, the Council reflects the primacy of the nation-states, in theory at least, and should have the final say on whether a legislative instrument should have legal force.
Again, on the one hand, the problem is that the secretive and complex system adopted by the Council does not facilitate external scrutiny, which therefore negates any resemblance of accountability and therefore democracy.
On the other hand, the Parliament, despite its pretensions, lacks the European demos and therefore cannot claim to be a democratic institution.
On that basis, the current state of affairs is not satisfactory, but nor is what is proposed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's implementing powers: it all sounds so harmless and yet it conceals a multitude of problems that all of the committees that deal with European legislation have to contend with, and have been doing so for two decades.
The Council Decision of 1999 reduced the Babylonian confusion of over 20 variants of such committees in the Commission to three procedures, namely management, regulatory and advisory procedures.
The decision also laid down criteria for deciding which committee procedure was appropriate.
All of the relevant European Union legislation, consisting of several hundred directives and regulations, had to be brought into line with it.
Mrs Frassoni's report in March 2003 - just a few weeks ago - brought this work to its conclusion.
The consequences of our consultations today would be that once again all of the European Union's legislation, that is once again several hundred legal instruments, would have to be brought into line with the new texts.
Should the Convention - and here I am talking about Article 202 - propose alternative solutions to the ones that we are discussing today, then this process of adapting all European legislation would have to be repeated.
Once again, as with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are only debating an interim solution.
This is expressed very clearly in Amendment No 1 of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
In my judgment, the Commission proposal does not enable us to achieve the objectives of transparency and improved legislative supervision of the Commission when it enacts implementing provisions.
On the contrary, the proposed changes are designed to remodel Parliament's existing right of supervision as a hearing procedure pure and simple.
De facto the Commission's proposal amounts to abolishing the management procedure, which also considerably curtails the Council's and the Member States' influence and supervisory powers.
This might well not matter to us in Parliament if our influence and supervisory powers were enhanced accordingly.
That is the intention of Parliament's amendments.
But the Commission, as Mr Corbett has already said, is refusing to delete an essential word, namely 'possibly'.
This means that in the future it may only possibly take into account the substantive demands made by Parliament with regard to the implementing legislation.
We cannot support this as a Parliament and are in complete agreement with the rapporteur here.
Mr President, in the Convention - and this has already been mentioned several times today - we are holding intensive discussions on abolishing the old comitology system.
I believe that the end result will indeed move in this direction.
Why are we doing this?
That too has already been mentioned.
We are doing it because the old system of comitology has essentially resulted in underground law, produced by way of methods that are undemocratic, and above all, lacking in transparency.
No one in the outside world knows what is done, how it is done or why it is done.
Above all, no one in the outside world knows what positions have been put forward here, by whom or why.
We have to change this.
That is why we will, in the Convention, be abolishing the old comitology system, but - and this too has already been mentioned - this is only possible if we have something with which to replace it.
We need delegated lawmaking, but we need delegated lawmaking with clear responsibilities, with clear rules of delegation, with mandates that are clearly understood, and above all with the possibility of recall, an equal right of recall for both the Council and Parliament.
In this context I have already referred several times to our discussions in the Convention.
Our concern is to ensure that the people of Europe have a clear picture of who is exercising legislative powers, why and for what reason, and the results that emerge on this point will soon be available as a constitutional proposal.
This does not however make the work on the Corbett report superfluous; quite the opposite.
Until we have included this result in the constitution and implemented it, we need the results of the Corbett report, which are to a large extent along the same lines as what has been said in the Convention.
With this in mind not only do we congratulate the rapporteur but we also hope that the resulting proposals will be accepted as unanimously as possible and that an appropriate reform of the way in which this important issue is dealt with will allow them to replace the old, undemocratic system of comitology for the next few years.
Mr President, allow me to reply to some of the points that have been raised.
Firstly the question as to whether this is an interim solution.
In my view, the Commission proposal with our amendments can be the basis for a solution to the comitology problem that is compatible both with the current treaty and with what is likely to come out of the European Convention.
Of course, the Convention must do its work and get rid of the apparent contradictions between Articles 202 and 251 of the Treaty, and perhaps put some of the principles governing the delegation of implementing powers into the Treaty and into the constitution itself, but in my view what we are doing here could be entirely convergent with the work going on in the Convention.
Secondly, despite the great convergence we have achieved in general, I would like to mention the issue of the two points which, according to Mr Bourlanges, the PPE-DE Group intends to vote against.
I must say I disagree with the PPE-DE Group on this and I would point out that the position that I am defending is based on what was adopted by Parliament in Mr Bourlanges' own report.
So I am consistent with what is in Parliament's position up to now, and, indeed, in our own Rules of Procedure, where we have called upon the President of Parliament to ask the Commission to withdraw or modify any implementing measure that Parliament objects to, or to bring forward a legislative proposal.
So I am on the solid ground of what Parliament has consistently argued for over time in this and I would hope that the PPE-DE Group would rethink its position before we vote in half an hour's time.
Also, on the question of the provisional adoption of a text pending the legislative procedure, this is important in certain circumstances in order to avoid a legal vacuum.
The measure applies provisionally while Parliament and the Council go through a legislative procedure to review it, amend it or repeal it, depending on what we decide to do.
But it can also be important to have a stopgap solution without a legal vacuum pending that legislative procedure.
In other words, I am asking for a menu of options.
If Parliament or Council objects to an implementing measure that the Commission has put forward, the Commission can either withdraw it - I think it has that right implicitly under the Treaty anyway but let us make that explicit - or it can amend it to take account of our objections, or it can put forward a legislative proposal.
If it does the latter it can apply the measure provisionally, if this is necessary to avoid a legal vacuum, or not if that is not necessary.
That range of opportunities is, I think, appropriate.
We should maintain the full list and I hope the PPE-DE Group will rethink its position and vote accordingly.
Mr President, first of all let me stress that the proposed amendments and the speeches made indicate that much thought and effort has gone into the examination of this proposal, which aims to enhance the role of the European Parliament in the institutional triangle.
As far as possible, the Commission will take into account the detailed amendments proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The Commission can accept, in whole or in part, Amendments Nos 1, 2 (in part), 4, 7, 8, 11 (in part), 13, 14, 18 and 19.
However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 10 or 11 (in part), as they could complicate the Commission's negotiations with the Council.
The Commission's proposal aims to give the European Parliament and the Council equal rights as co-legislators in controlling the Commission; but the proposal cannot go further than or beyond the scope of the present Treaty, which does not provide for explicit delegation of legislative power to the Commission.
The Commission, as the sole executive, should be able to retain full responsibility for adopting executive instruments.
This political responsibility goes hand in hand with the freedom of the Commission to adopt a decision, taking on board or not the objections raised by the legislator.
The deletion of 'possibly' would tie the hands of the Commission and prevent it from exercising its responsibility as the executive.
The withdrawal option, as formulated in Mr Corbett's Amendments Nos 3, 10 and 11, would effectively amount to replacing the freedom of adoption by the Commission by an explicit withdrawal or non-action by the Commission.
If the Commission's views are not in line with those of the legislator, the Commission would be obliged to renounce the adoption of an implementing measure.
Substitution of the Commission's responsibility and freedom to adopt an implementing measure via the non-action option would also send the wrong political signal to stakeholders.
The proposal is, on the contrary, based on the assumption that action is needed and that the Commission will take responsibility for it.
Given the scope afforded by the current Treaty, these amendments are therefore not acceptable to the Commission.
The proposal indeed goes as far as possible towards granting the European Parliament the control rights that, as a co-legislator, it should possess.
The reform, as I have just mentioned, cannot go as far as a more thoroughgoing reform conducted in the process of amending the Treaty.
In the framework of the European Convention, the Commission has explicitly suggested that the Council and the European Parliament should, under delegation of legislative powers, have the possibility to oppose a text proposed by the Commission.
In this scenario the latter would indeed either renounce its text, modify it or present a legislative proposal.
To conclude, I can assure you that the Commission will endeavour to achieve progress on this issue in the Council.
I would like to conclude that the Commission needs Parliament's support in negotiating the strengthening of the European Parliament's prerogatives with the Council.
I am confident that the Commission can count on Parliament's continued support in the process of clarifying the roles and competences of the executive and the legislator.
Mr President, on the basis of the observations which the Commissioner has just made, I should like to know what the rapporteur's position is, because it is rather important.
I believe that the Commissioner is wrong.
As soon as we in this Parliament object, those objections have to be taken into consideration.
Otherwise we should be denied the power to object, which I could quite understand.
However, the idea that we can object but that our objections can be ignored seems to me to be a serious matter.
I should like to know what the rapporteur's attitude is, and whether or not he intends to ask for a referral to committee.
Mr Bourlanges, that was not a point of order.
Mr President, the Commission is wrong in insisting on maintaining the word 'possibly', especially if we are offering it a menu of different options anyway.
It should be obliged to choose one of those options and either modify its proposal to take account of our objections or withdraw it - I would underline that we are not obliging it to withdraw the proposal, it is just one of the options - or present a proposal under the legislative procedure.
Since the Commission has those three options I really think the word 'possibly' should disappear.
Otherwise it would have the right to choose no option whatsoever and to completely ignore the objections made by Parliament, which would be thoroughly undemocratic.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.51 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)

Mr President - yes, thank you very much for your enthusiasm! - I can also tell you that in its common position the Council has been persuaded of the wisdom of many of our astute proposals from the first reading.
As you know, this draft regulation seeks to improve the quality of statistics, firstly by reducing the time limits for the transmission of the main aggregates of quarterly national accounts from four months to 70 days, secondly by abrogating derogations accorded to the Member States - unfortunately others are retained - and thirdly by having the employment data transmitted in a common unit, namely that of hours worked.
These changes are necessary so as to have statistics on GDP that are as accurate as possible available quickly.
Bank economists have been warning for years now that our economic statistics are insufficient; this leads to mistakes in monetary policy, the effects of which we all feel in our pockets.
Last year, Mr Solans, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, writing in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, even called for greater quantities of relevant statistics for the eurozone.
As you know, this is in everyone's interest. A great deal remains to be done, however.
At the moment, for example, the Commission is compelled to produce its initial estimates of gross domestic product for the eurozone on the basis of incomplete data, which undermines the reliability of these indicators and can have an unfavourable impact on the financial markets, and above all on the measures taken by the central banks.
The Commission's estimated values for GDP in the eurozone are currently produced 70 days after the end of the reference period.
Compared with the USA, where these data are available after 45 days, this is far too late and makes it difficult for the European Central Bank to fulfil its duty to provide guidance.
You often lament the fact that Mr Duisenberg's monetary policy reactions are not as quick as Mr Greenspan's.
If you adopt these measures today, that will be rather less the case.
I therefore hope that you will vote in favour of the common position and I should like to thank you for taking such an enthusiastic interest in this report.
(Laughter and applause)
Mrs Lulling, that ovation shows you how much better we now understand the transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts.
Mr President, our group has tabled four requests for separate votes.
Three of them have the same goal, namely to delete the phrase 'either [or 'or'] to withdraw its draft' from three different places.
These are requests for separate votes concerning Amendment No 3 and Amendment No 10 and a second request for separate vote concerning Amendment No 11.
Whatever your decision, ladies and gentlemen, I would consider it logical, although I do not know whether this is compatible with the Rules of Procedure, for a single vote to apply also to the other two in order to ensure the coherence of the text.
Good news: what is logical also complies with the Rules of Procedure.
We shall therefore take a single vote. That way we may be sure that this is all along the right lines.
Mr President, Mr Bourlanges is entirely right on the procedure: it would make sense to have a single vote instead of three votes on that.
I would, however, point out that if we follow him on the substance, then Parliament would be contradicting what we voted both in his own reports and in my recent report on revising the Rules of Procedure.
I would urge colleagues not to follow him on the substance, although he is right on the procedure.
I think that is clear to everyone.
We shall take a single vote, taking account of the comments on substance made just now by our rapporteur.
Before the vote on the draft legislative resolution
. I would like to hear from the Commission whether it can accept the amendments proposed by Parliament.
- Mr President, the Commission can accept Amendment No 1, Amendment No 2 in part because we do not want the words 'full information' ...
(Laughter and applause)
... it is not as bad as it sounds!
Amendments Nos 4, 7 and 8 can be accepted, Amendment No 11 is acceptable in part owing to the word 'possibly', and Amendments Nos 13, 14, 18 and 19 are also acceptable.
We cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 10 and 11 (in part).
On that basis, Mr Corbett, do you wish to invoke Rule 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure?
Mr President, I would invite Parliament to avail itself of Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure and refer the report back to committee to pursue negotiations with the Commission.
What the Commissioner has just said amounts to insisting on the word 'possibly' remaining in the text.
In other words, the Commission would 'possibly' take account of Parliament's objections and the Commission would 'possibly' amend its text to take account of our views.
That would be unacceptable to Parliament and I therefore ask for the report to be referred back to committee.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I therefore put to the House the rapporteur's proposal to defer the final vote on the draft legislative resolution.
(Parliament decided to defer the final vote)
Report (A5-0123/2003) by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on environmental agreements at Community level within the framework of the Action Plan 'Simplifying and Improving the Regulatory Environment' [COM(2002) 412 - C5-0622/2002 - 2002/2278(INI)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0124/2003) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2002 [2002/2018(INI)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
. (PT) I congratulate the rapporteur on the fine proposals he makes in his report, the aptness of which has been confirmed by the support given to them by the European Parliament delegation to the conciliation process.
The merit of the directive that such proposals aim to achieve is also clear.
This directive seeks to establish and regulate a formal system for occurrence reporting in civil aviation to ensure that all players involved have access to these incidents and are aware of them.
Indeed, the intention is to ensure that all players involved in this activity learn from each other's mistakes, thereby making educational and positive use of bad practices.
This will help us to establish a system that is safer for all users.
This directive complements the 1994 directive, which contains a series of measures on investigations into accidents in civil aviation, and which is not likely to produce significant results due to the fortunately lower number of accidents occurring.
For its part, the reporting system on which this new proposal for a directive is based has greater potential in terms of the quantity of data it can provide.
Also to be welcomed is the proposal for a directive's provision to force Member States to set up a system for removing personal data in the event that they decide to set up a system for the non-mandatory reporting of data useful to air safety?
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) In the context of achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy - which are intended to increase employment, economic reform and social cohesion in a knowledge-based economy - and of the open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion, a common framework must be created for the systematic production of statistics.
The aim is to enable rigorous and timely comparisons to be made between the situations of Member States on income distribution, levels of poverty and social exclusion.
This is an instrument of the utmost importance, which has been lacking.
I therefore voted in favour of this Recommendation, which accepts the Common Position adopted by the Council on the approval of the European Parliament and Council Directive.
This framework provides for the use of common indicators, flexibility in the field of data source and for integrating new sources into national statistics systems, which will enable proper monitoring of the situation and new developments in the Member States.
From 2004, the Member States will transmit their data to Eurostat on an annual basis and Eurostat will undertake methodological studies to assess the impact on the comparability of national data sources and to identify the best practices to follow.
. (PT) I agree with the approach pursued by the rapporteur who, having decided not to draw up a report for second reading, has accepted without amendment the Council's common position on statistics on income and living conditions in the EU.
The unanimity achieved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs also confirms the aptness of the Council's common position.
If the intention is to draw up an annual synthesis report containing Community statistics, the process of compiling data on the Member States must use harmonised definitions and methods.
Unless this happens, we risk ending up with a study that uses differing variables, which change from Member State to Member State, and which consequently do not make comparison easy.
The EU's financial contribution to each Member State, for four years, for the costs entailed by their work, will ensure the first edition, in 2007, of a belated initiative, which stands out even more clearly due to the way in which the EU addresses one trivial issue after another.
. (PT) I support this report, which has examined a draft regulation forming an integral part of the 'Action Plan on EMU Statistical Requirements'.
In order to be consistent in promoting the objectives of the European Employment Strategy, it is clearly crucial to harmonise national accounts employment data, transmitting this data in the unit 'hours worked', as a means of clarifying labour relations, and of making the measures consistent and the aims viable.
The European Commission initiative: the future of the European Employment Strategy 'A strategy of full employment and better jobs for all' (COM(2003) 6 final), principally laid down three wide-ranging objectives: full employment, quality and productivity in work and an inclusive labour market.
The Lisbon and Stockholm targets for overall employment rates (an EU average of 67% in 2005 and 70% in 2010), for women's employment (57% and 60% respectively) and for the employment of older workers (50% in 2010) can therefore only be achieved if both the particular nature of labour relations, and the quantitative indicators, in particular the 'number of hours worked' are determined by uniform methodologies.
. (PT) This report should be seen as part of the process of creating an internal energy market for the EU, in response to the call made at the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 and reaffirmed at the Barcelona and Brussels Spring Councils, to speed up the process of liberalising the electricity and gas markets, which entails further deregulation of the market and stepping up cross-border trade between Member States.
Furthermore, it seeks to speed up the privatisation of state-owned companies, given their historically dominant position in this sector and to speed up the process of concentrations and mergers at Community level.
I have always been opposed to this process, not only for socioeconomic reasons and for reasons of quality and concerns about guarantees of public service provision, but also because this sector is of strategic importance to development, which affects the independence, sovereignty and security of energy.
The Commission proposal therefore seeks to adapt VAT rules, in the field of gas and electricity, to the needs of the markets that have been liberalised.
The amendments that have been proposed will essentially mean that taxes collected are returned to the Member States in which the final consumption takes place, thereby facilitating cross-border trade in energy.
The ultimate aim remains, therefore, that of meeting the needs of the single European market in the energy sector.
We Moderate Members of the European Parliament have voted against the above report.
It is regrettable that the South Korean shipbuilding industry receives significant state aid, but that is no reason for also subsidising the European shipbuilding industry.
The matter should be vigorously pursued by the EU within the WTO.
Setting up a European consortium to go some way towards controlling and influencing the market situation would not solve the problems of the European shipbuilding industry but be in danger of exacerbating the situation in the longer term.
The situation of the shipbuilding industry is increasingly worrying, given the major fall in world demand seen in shipyards in 2002.
New orders represent less than 60% of those made in 2000, although in the European Union this figure was 77%, to which we can add falling prices.
The unilateral application by the EU of the principles established in the 1994 OECD agreement, intended to end aid to the shipbuilding industry, was one of the main causes, since the current temporary defence mechanism proved to be inadequate in the face of the unfair competition and dumping by South Korean shipyards, which have negative margins that vary from 20% to 40%, supported by State aid.
The EU's share of the shipbuilding market fell from 19%, in 2000, to 10% in the first quarter of 2002, resulting in the closure of several European shipyards, unemployment and ever-present threats of further cuts, as I saw on a visit to the shipyards at Viana do Castelo.
The EU must, therefore, propose new mechanisms to preserve and develop the strategic shipbuilding sector, through a genuine Community programme that promotes research and vocational training and which takes account of the priorities of modernising the Community fleet, ship repairs, maritime transport and fisheries.
We Swedish Social Democrats do not believe that the Community should prolong its aid to shipbuilding, or introduce new forms of such aid, in order to protect its shipbuilding industry against South Korea.
The European Union's shipbuilding industry is in a serious situation, since the manufacture of certain vessels has been struck a serious blow due to disloyal competition from South Korea.
South Korean shipyards have practised dumping with regard to the manufacture of gas tankers through having different prices on the domestic and export markets. Prices on the export market have been 25% to 30% lower.
On the other hand, the EU has withdrawn aid from its shipbuilding industry, leading to limited production capacity and social problems.
Sweden abolished these forms of aid some years ago.
We therefore have our doubts about reintroducing them.
We are generally opposed to this type of state aid, but understand the concern caused by unfair competition on the part of South Korea.
We believe that issues of this kind must be dealt with within the WTO in the context of its dispute settlement procedure.
The EU's restoring or prolonging state aid to certain vessels would not help. Instead, it would only be in danger of further distorting the market mechanisms.
In the light of these considerations, we Social Democrats in the European Parliament are voting against all forms of state aid to the shipbuilding industry.
We do not believe that such aid should be promoted and are therefore voting against the whole report.
. (EL) The policy of restructuring the shipbuilding industry and the resultant cutbacks in it have resulted in tens of thousands of unemployed workers.
The loss of half the EU's share of the global market within a mere two years is due to the stand taken by the ?U and the Member States which, instead of supporting and improving this strategic sector, are supporting and multiplying the profits of the monopolies, mainly in Germany and Denmark.
This once highly developed sector has been especially hard hit in Greece, a country with a long maritime history and one of the largest fleets in the world.
The ship repair industry could, with another policy, have become an important sector of the economy rather than all but disappearing.
Small businesses are today being persecuted, while the larger shipyards have been sold off to the private sector for a pottage of lentils and their activities cut back.
Thousands of workers in this sector are literally starving and entire areas are being condemned to decline, with unemployment over 80%.
Another wooden shipbuilding company, Hippokambos, closed just recently, turning a further 300 workers out into the street.
Those working in this sector are beginning to realise that they cannot wait for answers from the ?U, its policies and the international imperialist agreements being proposed, which is why they are joining forces and fighting for a different, anti-monopolistic, and anti-imperialist policy.
. (PT) The European Strategy for sustainable development adopted at the Gothenburg summit must involve Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
Companies have obligations above and beyond the legitimate aim of maximising profits.
Today, SMEs and large multinationals must realise that their success depends on responsible behaviour, in terms of the environment and respect for fundamental rights and in terms of promoting social cohesion.
It is an accepted fact that social and environmental responsibility increase competitiveness.
Consequently, Corporate Social Responsibility must be supported and encouraged and good practices must be disseminated, involving companies, social partners and educational and training establishments.
I wish to highlight the importance:
of including gender-related issues in the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility, specifically promoting entrepreneurship amongst women and helping women to combine professional and private life;
of the role of the Multi-Stakeholder Forum on CSR, which will enable us to hear all partners, help to define the limits and challenges facing companies and to share good practices;
of the European Eco-label as a guarantee of quality for consumers and companies, because consumers are placing increasing value on Corporate Social Responsibility in their buying decisions.
The EP must be involved in this process, specifically at the final meeting of the Forum and in the exchanges of information between the institutions.
. (PT) This report is simply an enormous cosmetic and marketing operation designed to favour employers at European level, as a result both of the deliberate intentions of the entire process and of the EU's economic and social guidelines, which seek to promote the deregulation of the economy, in particular in the labour market, through wage flexibility and job instability.
Taking Portugal as an example, we could actually talk about corporate social irresponsibility, with multinationals closing and relocating to countries where salaries are lower and social and environmental laws are more flexible where profit is concerned, making thousands of workers redundant, calling into question the development of the least-favoured regions, breaking contracts with local authorities and States that have guaranteed them considerable amounts of public aid and tax benefits.
Reality shows that many of these companies wishing to promote themselves internationally have no sense of social responsibility whatsoever.
What they do is make use of job instability, short-term contracts, salaries in arrears and precarious labour conditions.
They unfairly and illegally lay off employees, forcibly impose flexible working hours, encourage child labour and demonstrate a lack of responsibility for pollution.
There is a climate of impunity and non-compliance with legislation in force, which must be brought to an end.
. (PT) The resolution on the 'Intelligent Energy for Europe' Programme (2003-2006) broadly warrants our support, given that:
it seeks to ensure continuity by means of a programme in the field of energy that follows on from the current framework programme (1998-2002) in this field, with regard to sustainable development, security of energy supply, energy efficiency and electricity produced from renewable energy sources, amongst other aspects;
it recommends an increase in budget appropriations for this programme, although only to a level that is still extremely inadequate (from EUR 190 million to EUR 200 million), given the strategic importance of the fields covered: energy efficiency and rational use of energy; new and renewable energies; the energy aspects of transport and international cooperation, particularly with developing countries;
it calls for an appropriate balance to be struck between monitoring the programme's implementation and the need to ensure that its allocations are fully spent, and proposes easier access for prospective proposers.
As to the issue of creating a European Intelligent Energy Agency, we believe that the issue is essentially a political one and hinges on concerns over whether or not we should have effective policies for researching and promoting energies that provide environmental and economic advantages.
. (PT) I broadly agree with the report, although I believe that the case for creating a European Intelligent Energy Agency - one of the solutions suggested by the rapporteur for increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources of energy - remains to be proven.
Simply creating yet another bureaucratic body is no guarantee that the best use will be made of resources, whereas, according to the principle of subsidiarity, we should first consider the possibility of promoting the exchange of information between Member States and adopting good practices, without overruling national legal provisions or creating artificial structures that come into conflict with these.
Despite this difference of opinion as to the method, I share the environmental and efficiency concerns expressed by the rapporteur, and her conviction that without the participation of local and national organisations, the recommended measures will not be properly implemented.
By the same token, I feel that the concern and the particular care the rapporteur demonstrates towards the enlargement countries and the changes they will need to make when they join the Union are extremely clear-sighted.
.
Overall, the amendments adopted by the ITRE Committee on 23rd April do not improve on the Commission's text.
The amendments have produced an extremely complicated proposal which would be even more harmful to the generally large industrial CHP plants which are the main UK interest, than the Commission's original proposal.
These amendments taken as a whole are based on the assumption that all cogeneration 'with an efficiency level of at least 80% always leads to substantial energy savings in comparison to the separate generation of energy and heat and may therefore be regarded as efficient.'
It is not true that an efficiency of 80% will guarantee substantial energy savings is disputable.
Schemes with the same overall efficiency do not necessarily save the most fuel and displace the most CO2 emissions.
It is important to value electrical efficiency more than heat efficiency and the report as tabled does not do this.
Overall, the approach is too academic and takes little account of the practical difficulties of implementing the approach at industrial sites - some of which can be extremely complex.
Adoption of the proposal would seriously damage the prospects for cogeneration in the UK.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1)of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) I broadly share the rapporteur's concerns with regard to the need to promote the rational use of energy and to the strategic preference for non-polluting forms of energy.
In fact, in addition to the lower volume of CO2 emissions that it will lead to, the decentralising nature of cogeneration generally hampers the construction of major energy-producing units, thereby diminishing the environmental effects of their infrastructures and their lines of transmission.
It has become clear from the discussion on this issue that this is not fundamentally a political issue, but rather a technical one.
This is why instead of the expected split between right and left, we have seen the various approaches that northern and southern Europe are bound to bring to the problem due to the differences in their climates.
These differences must be taken into account, just as we will have to look into the feasibility of the requirement for Member States to present detailed reports on their national potentials.
Despite the perception that some procedures and technical definitions concerning the use of cogeneration remain contradictory, I believe the principles guiding the drafting of this report to be broadly correct, and I agree with the compromise approach that ultimately emerged from the work undertaken in the Commission.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
.
Although there is no evidence to suggest that airlines operate without adequate insurance, we agree that making the requirements more transparent is a positive move.
However, our continued support for the draft regulation depends on the Commission addressing the major concerns that the rapporteur raised in his speech last night.
In particular the Commission must clarify how the rules relating to overflying will be applied in practice.
The answers given to the committee on this matter suggest that this issue has not been adequately thought through.
We cannot support draft legislation which cannot be properly and consistently applied and unless the Commission can provide satisfactory answers to how the legislation will apply to aircraft diverting into European airspace in unforeseeable circumstances or how the sector is to obtain cover for war and terrorism, we shall not be able to continue to support the proposals.
Finally, we must insist that the Commission provides a full business impact assessment before this report returns for its second reading.
Parliament cannot legislate without knowing the effect that its actions would have on European businesses and a fragile aviation industry.
. (PT) I agree with the rapporteur on the need to adopt a regulation on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators, thereby affording greater protection to users of this mode of transport, and extending this protection to all users.
I also share the rapporteur's concern about the application of the principle of equality, and welcome the solution he recommends - which provides for different treatment for small and large carriers - without which these measures could, in practice, allow this specific market surreptitiously to become an oligopoly, due to the excessive burden of insurance requirements.
Despite agreeing in principle, which has led me to vote in favour of this report, I cannot conceal my doubts as to the feasibility of some of the measures that are advocated, for example, monitoring the validity of operating licences or air operator certificates, which would make it necessary to monitor compliance with the requirements that have been set on an ongoing basis.
. (FR) The proposal for a decision on the implementing powers conferred on the Commission by the Council - prepared by the Commission itself - is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, which has just warmly approved it.
In fact, Parliament has long wanted to receive the right, on equal terms with the Council, to control implementing measures, at least for texts adopted by codecision.
This desire may be surprising because in many parliamentary democracies, including France, the elected assembly does not control in detail measures implementing laws, but simply, where appropriate, questioning the accountability of the government.
Perhaps, however, the attitude of the European Parliament, primarily dictated by the desire to compete with the Council, reveals, despite itself, something entirely different: that the Commission is not a real government, and that Parliament itself is not a real parliament.
Today, after some progress, particularly in 1999, the Commission wants to take the process to its natural conclusion, and pressure the Council into giving Parliament fully equal control.
It is forgetting just one thing: this equality is not provided for by Article 202 of the Treaty, which confers the power principally on the Council.
That is why we voted against the proposal.
. (FR) It is with certain reservations that we voted in favour of the Sacconi report on environmental agreements at Community level, which provides for a new instrument to simplify and speed up legislative work at European level: voluntary agreements.
These agreements, as part of the sixth Community action programme for the environment, will be able to take two forms: self-regulation and coregulation.
Unlike the rapporteur, we do not feel it appropriate to favour coregulation.
It is of no greater value than self-regulation.
It is not the Commission's place to set itself up as judge and judged with regard to the preconditions for the establishment of these agreements.
Furthermore, the voluntary agreements should not be considered as instruments that supplement the current Community legislative arsenal.
Voluntary agreements are flexible agreements which have their own place in the range of legislative instruments.
We welcome the fact that the Commission's initiative has taken the form of a non-binding communication.
We would like the Commission to continue along this path.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which I believe is balanced and promotes a greater degree of environmental protection.
I welcome in particular its concern for the 'applicability' of the mechanisms provided for.
In fact, since the Treaty of Maastricht, the Union has been committed to including environmental protection in all its policies.
In order genuinely to protect the environment and safeguard biodiversity, we must have the cooperation of all economic actors because, as the report also concludes, today 'the sources of environmental pollution are no longer concentrated in industrial facilities but lie in manifold economic activities and consumer behaviour', which means that a new, more creative approach is required, in order to achieve the targets for a high degree of environmental protection, targets which are as ambitious as they are crucial.
The European Commission has moved in this direction, with its proposal, as has the rapporteur, with his suggestions.
The mechanisms for self-regulation amongst operators and for co-regulation, in some kind of coordination with the public authorities are, of course, avenues worth exploring.
Furthermore, setting objectives and practical targets and trying out a more simplified and operational legislative framework that is immediately understandable to all actors involved, will certainly lead to greater awareness and to more effective environmental protection.
. (PT) This report comes at a crucial, not to say extremely difficult time in the history of the ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly: the result of the session planned for November 2002, in Brussels, being cancelled due to disagreements between the ACP and EP Members on what to do about the delegates sent by the Zimbabwean Government, despite the entry ban imposed on them.
The text that was ultimately adopted in committee prefers to emphasise that part of this crisis falls outside the competence of the APP (and specifically concerns the coherence and the hierarchy of the decisions taken by the Council and the European Parliament), and welcomes the normalisation of relations between the two parties, illustrated by the fact that that the March session took place in Brazzaville in favourable circumstances and by the positive outcome that was achieved.
I agree with this interpretation and therefore intended to vote in favour of the report.
The fact that plenary rejected the proposals for amendments tabled by the UEN Group, however, which sought to correct a serious injustice and discrimination in the composition and operation of permanent bodies of the APP led me to abstain from the final vote.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the Council statement on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very satisfied to be here with you today in order to present to you the results so far from the Council's work on severe acute respiratory syndrome.
As you know, the Presidency convened an Extraordinary Council on 6 May in order to examine this serious issue which, in addition to the obvious and significant repercussions on public health and the economy, is causing understandable concern among our citizens, which are often exacerbated by the way in which this issue is presented in the media.
Before telling you about the results of the Council, allow me to make a preliminary comment.
The case of severe acute respiratory syndrome shows once again that communicable diseases, like many other problems which touch on the public health sector, are another example of bio-terrorism which go well beyond the level of the Member States and point to the need for institutional changes that will raise health protection to a basic priority of united Europe.
This prospect will make it much easier to coordinate prevention, control and timely intervention to deal with diseases, both in the Community and internationally.
Allow me to remind you that health still does not hold the position which behoves it at Community level.
I am convinced that Europe is the best way to promote ambitious policies in the public health sector in each of our countries, especially with regard to disease prevention and control.
In today's Europe, especially after enlargement, health must acquire a stable and strong legal basis which allows for immediate, coordinated, scientific, reliable, efficient intervention.
I should like now to tell you about the results of the work of the Extraordinary Council.
I would remind you that the Council on 6 May was attended for the first time by the Ministers for Health of the acceding countries and by Mrs Brundtland, the General Director of the WHO, so that she could bring us up to date with current developments in atypical pneumonia at worldwide level.
As for the scientific, epidemiological side of the problem, according to the experts at the international organisations, we know in brief that a coronavirus which was unrecognised until its recent emergence is the cause of the syndrome.
The molecular structure of the virus was identified in a very short space of time, if you remember how long it took to identify the AIDS HIV virus.
Although it has been identified, we still do not know its exact natural history, just as we still have no special anti-viral medication to treat it and are a long way from finding a vaccine to prevent it.
As for the method of transmission, there are strong signs that it is transmitted by close contact, most probably via droplets.
There is no evidence that goods arriving in the European Union from SARS-infected areas pose a threat to public health.
As far as the epidemiology is concerned, the number of confirmed or suspected cases in the Member States of the European Union remains limited and patients have been effectively isolated and treated, thus so far avoiding further spread of infection and, most importantly, there have been no fatal cases.
The Council had a thorough and constructive exchange of views with Mrs Brundtland and noted that the World Health Assembly which is to meet next week will provide an excellent opportunity to review the prevailing situation worldwide and evaluate efforts being made to deal with it.
As far as Community measures to deal with the problem are concerned, I would start by recalling that the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States.
At Community level, a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases is already operating and is responsible for coordinating measures.
The network has provided a very effective basis for the exchange of information, in which the acceding countries have fully participated.
The Council endorsed the guidelines agreed on 10 April 2003 by the Network Committee. They are summarised as follows:
rapid detection of all suspect cases through good surveillance,
protection of those at risk of infection through effective isolation in hospitals, with special emphasis on measures to protect carers,
particular attention to be paid to air travel, which appears to have been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably through screening of passengers leaving affected areas, onboard advice to passengers and, finally, through information at airports of entry.
These measures must be applied in all the Member States.
As far as future action is concerned, the Council decided that Community action and efforts being made via the communicable diseases surveillance network and the new programme in the public health sector should continue.
Cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and the World Health Organisation also needs to continue in order to contain and eventually stop the spread of this atypical pneumonia.
This cooperation must aim mainly to assist the affected areas and develop diagnostic tests to promote research on vaccines and their availability in sufficient quantities.
The Council also urged the Member States and the acceding countries to implement fully all the guidelines of the surveillance network, to contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on severe acute respiratory syndrome under the Network Committee and to provide by 15 May all relevant information to the Commission on measures taken to address SARS.
Finally, I would point out that we encouraged the Commission to continue coordinating the Member States' action and keep the orientations of the surveillance network under regular review.
The Council will review the situation and developments at its meeting on 2 June, at which the Commission will submit a report on measures taken by the Member States.
On the basis of this report, the Council will take any further action it deems necessary.
Similarly, it supports the Commission's intention to submit an initial draft proposal to create a European Centre for disease prevention and control.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have confined myself to this brief presentation of the work of the Council and am available to answer your questions.
Mr President, today's second reading on serious acute respiratory syndrome comes, I think, at exactly the right time once again because, as we see, there are new cases every day and people are dying from SARS.
What is important, as the Minister said, are the immediate measures that need to be taken to protect the public.
He mentioned some of these immediate measures, but the main point is what the next steps will be to deal with these diseases, which have significant social and economic repercussions, because with current levels of mobility, with millions of people travelling all over the planet, tremendous potential has been given to communicable diseases.
SARS is a typical example, with cases occurring from China, where the disease originated, to places a very long way from the original source.
The second important issue is that we are seeing sudden epidemics of new diseases.
Thirty new infectious diseases or variations on old diseases due to mutating viruses have been reported over the last twenty years.
Even old diseases, such as tuberculosis, are reoccurring.
There is also talk of an imminent pandemic, an outbreak of influenza.
We therefore need constant vigilance and monitoring and to find a coordinated response to health threats.
The Minister quite rightly stressed that there is the network set up under Decision 2119 in 1998, for the surveillance of communicable diseases but unfortunately, Minister, this network is inadequate for an organised and coordinated response to these health threats.
I agree with you that you need to push for a monitoring centre to be set up in accordance with the Commission proposal, like the one in the United States.
We need a monitoring centre at European Union level to coordinate the various national centres, because it is of course the Member States' responsibility, but also to coordinate reference laboratories, so that we can have a fast, coordinated response to communicable diseases and even to bio-terrorism, which is what threats with viruses or bacteria spores are.
You also quite rightly said that public health must take its proper place in the new Treaties for Europe.
I am sorry to say that, so far, the constitutional Convention has not sent us this message or this position.
As you quite rightly said. Just as the environment has an eminent position in the Treaties, so should public health.
Health services are one thing - there is the question of subsidiarity - and public health protection is another because, as you know, viruses and various diseases and bio-terrorism do not recognise borders and can pass from country to country, from Member State to Member State and we must be able to respond in a coordinated manner.
If we are to be able to do so, we need public health to have an eminent position in the Treaty of the European Union.
So I agree with you and I would ask for you to persuade the other ministers to agree to set up this communicable diseases monitoring and control centre at European level and for us to persuade the constitutional Convention and the Council to give public health an eminent position in the new constitution of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you for your report from the Council and I am well aware that messengers, or bringers of bad news, should not be shot, which is why that is far from my mind.
Nevertheless, I do admit that I found the results of this Extraordinary Council meeting very disappointing, if we consider that where SARS is concerned all we have are questions.
This is an unknown virus.
We do not really know what the routes of infection are.
We do not know of any way of treating it, and we do not really know anything about the mortality rate.
There are so many questions that the debate about a centre is just a distraction.
I may be happy to discuss it in six months' time, but at the moment that is a course of action that glosses over and covers up what is really necessary.
I feel exactly the same when I hear that the Member States have had a constructive exchange of views and are responsible for taking preventive measures.
This is something that we have to change.
It is high time that there was a Community competence for health policy, and I mean in the Treaty.
If we do not recognise that now then I do not know when we will.
We ought to have realised this even in the days of BSE.
Much of what I am hearing today and have heard in the past is familiar to me: the economic impact - we said that too in the days of BSE.
In the Minutes it says not to talk out loud about the dangers of BSE because heaven knows what economic consequences it will have.
What consequences did it have in the end?
What I would have liked from the Council is for it to have done something practical for once.
Incidentally, I would have liked to see the Commission do the same.
Mrs Schreyer, I regret having to say this to you; I know that you are not responsible for this.
I will repeat it to Mr Byrne; indeed, I have already said as much to him in this House.
It is not acceptable for Mr Byrne to say, yes, research funding is a tricky one, the funds are tied up for such a long time.
He should have gone straight to the Commission and said: come on then, chop-chop, release funds from the research framework programme, and do it now!
We need money for research immediately, so that we can get things moving and mobilise all of our researchers so that we can establish what kind of a virus it is, whether it is possible to treat it and what vaccines are available.
The Member States ought to have done exactly the same.
When they were dispersing last week after the extraordinary meeting of the Council, I would have expected them to say: each of us is committed to putting x% or so many hundreds of thousands of euros on the table straight away for research.
I should like to make another unpopular statement: why are we not talking about restricting travel?
Other countries are doing that.
There are countries that have introduced entry restrictions.
Why are we not doing so?
Why are planes from my German airline and other airlines still able to travel around all over the place?
We do not know anything about the infection channels.
We have no idea how long the incubation period is.
Is that as it should be?
Why are we not having an honest discussion about quarantining?
I think it would be responsible to do so, and I think that what the Member States have done and also what the Commission has done is both insufficient and irresponsible.
I am denouncing that here and I would like you - that is those who bear the responsibility for this - to justify it to the people of Europe.
Mr President, I would like to thank the minister for his explanation.
The Council meeting naturally took place at a time when rumours and speculation about SARS were taking on huge proportions.
The risk of confusion and misunderstandings about this highly infectious disease is therefore also increasing at an alarming rate.
At the moment, however, we are still seeing different Member States giving conflicting travel advice about the so-called infected areas.
It is the European Union's duty to try to avoid this kind of confusion and misunderstandings.
My country, for example, only issues negative travel advice on Beijing, Hong Kong and the Guangdong province.
Other Member States are doing so for all infected areas.
Why is there no clear European line on this point?
The European Union, not only the Member States, should be taking action in this regard.
That is not enough, however.
SARS is pre-eminently a problem that does not respect national borders, and reminds us that problems such as these may also arise with other infectious diseases.
When we see how quickly SARS has spread - perhaps not yet in Europe but certainly elsewhere - we must learn lessons from this, and not only now in respect of SARS.
The Council of 6 May called on the Commission to continue to coordinate the EU's action in respect of SARS and to consider developing a plan concerning a general preparedness for transmittable diseases and public health threats.
The European Centre has once again been mentioned.
Perhaps this is enough at this point.
Perhaps SARS is indeed something that has not spread so far that more stringent measures are needed.
What would we have done, however, if something like this had got out of hand?
That might have happened.
That could already have happened. Take the situation in Toronto - hardly a developing country, but a city with top-quality medical facilities that was suddenly gripped by SARS.
That could have happened to us.
What would we have done?
Would we have asked the European Commission to do some consulting and coordinating?
Would we have convened a meeting to see what we could do about it?
No, what is lacking is the possibility of the European Commission implementing crisis management measures at such a time.
I think that the European Commission should develop an emergency plan for this kind of situation, a plan which enables us to take concrete action in response to emergencies and then take measures such as those our American and Canadian colleagues are taking: quarantining people suspected of having the infection, providing additional funds for preventing the spread of the virus and support for people who are in voluntary or enforced quarantine.
The problems are broader than this.
It is not just about SARS.
Commissioner Byrne informed Parliament on 7 April about the possibility that the SARS virus was transferred to humans from animals.
Take the Hong Kong flu last century, the Spanish flu last century, viruses that mutate, the fowl pest in the Netherlands at the moment, about which the World Health Organisation has expressed its concern.
What should we do about these?
The European Commission needs to be able to implement practical crisis-management measures quickly for these kinds of situations in particular.
I also welcome what the minister has said about this.
The role of public health in the Treaty really must be laid down and reinforced now.
Mr President, people cannot be vaccinated against new diseases in advance.
They can also not be healed with medicines afterwards.
There are only three ways of limiting the consequences.
The first is to limit the chance of infection.
The second is to reinforce and accelerate scientific research into preventing and fighting such diseases.
The third is to offer help to those with the disease so as to increase their chances of survival.
In the fight against the advance of SARS, only this third opportunity is being paid full attention.
Hospitals are being prepared to ensure that they have quarantine rooms and breathing equipment available.
It is a good thing that we are already taking on board the possibility that this infection could gain a significant foothold in Europe, but it looks as if this is as far as we are going.
The second method is not being given much thought.
In the past, various Member States of the European Union have cut back on scientific research into new diseases.
Today's experts are interested volunteers who have been taken away from other medical and biological research.
That must change if we are to be able to effectively fight and eradicate new diseases in the short term.
Our biggest shortcomings relate to the first method; containing the spread on a global scale.
People from South-East Asia can quickly export SARS over great distances because of international air travel.
Checks on incoming traffic at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, Europe's fifth biggest airport, seem to be minimal.
Passengers arriving from South-East Asia are allowed to just pass straight through.
It is actually a miracle that more people have not been infected in Europe.
Following a declaration by the European Commission, I asked on 7 April for action to be taken against the risks posed by incoming air traffic, involving a previously announced compulsory period of quarantine for people at risk of infection if necessary.
I am surprised that on 6 May, after consultation with the World Health Organisation, the Council decided not to do this and to rely instead on checks in the country of departure and written declarations by interested parties.
Let us avoid a situation in which we find out afterwards that we failed seriously in our attempts to keep this disease out of our countries, and let us be pleased with our free press which, unlike in China, informed us in good time.
Mr President, Minister, members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on 7 April last, we addressed the issue of the SARS crisis in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, a matter which concerned more or less all the Member States and other countries as well.
I must point out that the proposals advanced to the Commission by the UEN Group on that occasion have almost all been adopted by some of the Member States, including Italy.
In the same speech, I warned that the virus could be transmitted via goods and animals from infected countries which were not yet known to be carrying the infection.
After that difficult period of heated discussion between optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints on the possibility and necessity of stopping the spread of the virus, the European countries are now paying more heed to the issue, and more preventive measures are being taken too, but the time has come to concern ourselves with another factor. The problem which is gradually emerging in many Member States is that of public healthcare - are there enough staff, resources and facilities available to assist SARS patients?
It is time to ask ourselves whether each Member State has these resources and appropriate centres for treating virulent infectious diseases such as SARS; if they do not, then all the measures taken to delay its arrival in Europe will be in vain.
Today, I would add, the issues which need to be addressed most urgently are these: the lack, not to say complete absence, of negative pressure isolation rooms, necessary to prevent nosocomial infection, in the principal hospitals of the States of the European Union; the impossibility of quarantining a patient highly likely to have the disease but who refuses to be placed in isolation, due to the fact that there are no laws imposing enforced hospitalisation except on grounds of mental health; we need to start thinking about training, setting up specialised healthcare teams in the individual states to treat patients with diseases such as SARS, who cannot be given specific treatment but only adjunct treatment and who require input from a wide range of specialists - lung specialists, virologists, anaesthetists, resuscitation specialists, internists, dieticians - and nursing staff capable of managing and caring for patients suffering from SARS.
I would like to invite you to consider this viral disease as proof for Europe of the possibility of the transmission of diseases which are currently unknown to us or which we have stamped out in the past but which globalisation could bring back to Europe, as I said in my speech on 14 November 2001.
The European Parliament and, in this case, the Commission - which I am addressing here - must learn from this experience and recognise the crucial role played by public health services.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 7 May, a Commissioner who is not present in the House today - and I regret that because, for once, I would have liked to congratulate a Commissioner - said: as regards the prevention of animal epidemics we have developed a cutting-edge system, creating a Committee of Veterinary Experts which lays down the law for every Member State, whereas, when it comes to human health, we have no say on the matter.
I reiterate, we have no say on the matter.
Incidentally, thus far, the Commission has had no say on the matter in this House either.
This absurd situation does, however, reflect the times in which we live.
I agree with some of the points made by Mr Mussa just now, but we must bear in mind that you, Antonio, are calling - like of many of us, moreover - for structural reforms, reform of nosocomial, hospital and even scientific structures.
Structural reforms need to be first adopted by vote, desired and then implemented; then come the bribes and all the rest of it.
In any case, we must have guidelines.
Today, however, there is an aspect which, as far as our area is concerned, is related to trade privileges, which sometimes play the role here which political and system interests play in the communist states, in the totalitarian - let us call them communist - states.
(There are some minor fascist, nazi variations but the essence is the same).
In actual fact, we have a situation of impending rampant zoonosis: in other words, diseases can be transmitted from animal to human being.
Public health in Europe - here in our own countries - is under ever-increasing, extremely serious threat, for the world is becoming increasingly globalised and there are an increasing number of densely populated areas.
Now, and I quote, Europe has been suffering for many months from orthomyxovirus strains causing - I repeat, which are currently causing, in other words this is happening right now, President-in-Office of the Council - extremely dangerous centres of avian influenza.
Here in Europe, there are currently a number of extremely dangerous centres of avian influenza, the danger of which is often played down.
Why is that?
So as not to block the huge flows of foodstuffs exports.
The introduction of a vaccination would, of course, affect the export of these foodstuffs.
We therefore chose to stamp out the disease instead, culling entire farm herds - 25 million head were destroyed in Holland and Belgium alone!
It is true that these animals cost us a dollar a day - money which we do not give the world or even our unemployed in some cases - but it is also true that the culling is subsidised.
We are therefore in a situation where we lack specific knowledge - even after some, after many years, I am still not at all sure what the difference is between HIV and AIDS.
All we can say is that infection experts fear an explosion in the autumn over and above the usual seasonal variation.
I would point out that 600 000 died in Italy from Spanish influenza alone - as many as in a major world war.
Take heed!
This is not Europe - it is an absence of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is less than two months since we were first informed of the spread of this disease and there have already been over 7 000 cases reported and over 500 deaths, with more than 20 cases of infection reported in the Member States of the Union.
Minister, the Extraordinary Council called for by the Italian Minister for Health, Professor Sirchia, yielded results which, although not minimum, were minimal and unsatisfactory.
The outcome was a proposal to introduce medical protection in airports within a deadline of two months to check passengers leaving for these countries, in other words people returning to China, Hong Kong and the other areas where there is an epidemic situation already declared.
In addition, the Extraordinary Council decided to create a European Coordination Centre to address health crises, which is only due to become operational in 2005.
Well then, I believe that, despite the requests made essentially by Italy and Spain, we have given in to purely economic reasoning.
It was you, Minister, who said that a difficult climate for the economy and society would be created.
We believe that the citizens' health is a question of much more than the mere short-term economic impact, although that is, of course, a consideration to be borne in mind, but it must not take priority over the citizens' health.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt rightly said that we know nothing about the disease, and that is true, but we have not set up a European-scale filter which could be genuinely uniform and effective.
Then Mr Panella pointed out the absurdity of the fact that we are equipped with a cutting-edge system for preventing animal epidemics but we have nothing for human beings.
Everything is still in the hands of the states, which are giving economic considerations priority over respect for citizens' health.
It has been said that Spanish influenza claimed hundreds of thousands of victims.
That is not true, ladies and gentlemen - it claimed over 20 million!
More recently, in 1957, Asian influenza claimed a million human lives, and then, in 1968, the Hong Kong variety caused 700 000 deaths.
I wonder what we are doing to monitor the risk of an epidemic situation occurring in countries such as Africa or India, whose health systems would be totally incapable of controlling it at all, considering that even Toronto has been thrown into crisis.
I therefore believe, Minister, that the Council or the Commission must change their tune, speed up their decision-making and alter the citizens' health policies.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Health Council, serious acute respiratory syndrome is yet another reminder of the need for coordinated action in the public health sector.
We cannot talk of prevention, control and timely intervention with communicable or other diseases unless we put the conditions in place for Community cooperation, especially today with enlargement and with citizens able to travel easily and quickly.
I am delighted that all the honourable Members who spoke referred unanimously to this need in their speeches; this has never happened in the past.
Just like environmental problems, communicable diseases know no frontiers.
Epidemics such as this atypical pneumonia epidemic call for transparency and direct information, a surveillance system that operates efficiently and health systems that get beyond bureaucratic malfunctions and offer the best possible services in the public interest.
The role of the World Health Organisation is fundamental, which is why cooperation between the WHO, the European Commission and the Member States has been effective.
It is important to emphasise that the measures introduced at European Union level have restricted the spread of the disease and, most importantly, there have as yet been no fatalities in any Member State.
As regards the Extraordinary Council held last week, I think it is important that the Council is pushing for the setting up of a special expert group on SARS to draw up joint programmes and advice on hygiene measures throughout Europe and provide information on measures taken so far and their results.
It is also necessary to provide all manner of assistance to the affected areas.
Exit points must be controlled in the same way as - if not more so than - entry points, using all administrative and scientific means.
Allow me to express my concern about the adequate application of measures decided so far.
It would be advisable for the Commission to exercise as much influence as it can in this direction.
Finally, may I congratulate the Greek Presidency on the sensitivity and readiness it demonstrated in convening the Extraordinary Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, people are worried about SARS; as has already been said many times, there is a great deal of uncertainty, and that of course makes the whole thing very difficult.
I have personal experience of this: some of my family are about to travel to China on business.
This is a situation that is facing many families in Europe, and we are not actually able to offer any definite advice, which is very difficult.
I should like to take up that keyword, China.
We must denounce the complete inadequacy of the action taken by the Chinese Government here.
It first played the issue down and kept it under wraps and then - at least in some cases - overreacted, even taking measures appropriate to a police state.
In my view this provides yet more proof that in a dictatorship the challenges of modern society are not properly handled.
That is one of the many reasons why we should continue to speak up for human rights and democracy, including in China.
What are we doing now in Europe?
I am very grateful to Professor StÃ©fanis, the President-in-Office, but also to Professors Sirchia and Mattei, who were very active in supporting the initiative, and very grateful that this issue has been put on the Council agenda.
The results are obviously not what we would have liked, but it is important to make a start and we may have more success at the next Council meeting.
In Europe we have an internal market.
I think that this is once again a time to point out that we can only have an internal market and that its advantages can only really be felt if we also take into account other aspects apart from the more narrow economic situation.
There are many examples here and health is one of them.
There are some people in my country who say that Europe should not have any competence for health protection.
I am not one of them.
I believe that at least when it comes to providing protection from infectious diseases and where bioterrorism is concerned we need additional competencies for the European Union.
I have already discussed this problem with Commissioner Byrne and also with our Members in the Convention.
Mr Brok, the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Convention, has of course followed this debate and he agrees with me that we need additional competencies here.
This will not, however, be a universal panacea.
We cannot now shift the current crisis into a Convention debate, but must look carefully at what measures it might be appropriate to take even now.
That is why it is right, for example, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt said, to mobilise research funds quickly.
It is right, as Mr Maaten pointed out, to issue uniform recommendations on travel into and out of the EU.
I believe that we should do these things quickly, but at the same time we should send out the right signals in the Convention.
Mr President, SARS poses a huge challenge to the EU and the applicant states and, as the minister says, we do not know what causes the virus.
As the global death toll rises and infection increases in China, there have also been cases in the EU, although the disease would appear to be very much under control here.
However, 6% of people who contract SARS will die.
To take the example of one survivor, Dr Henry Likyuen Chan was only 34 years old, but he had a high fever, was racked with a cough and when taking a shower felt as if he was running a marathon.
The concept of an EU centre for disease control and prevention similar to the US model in Atlanta, which is not a new concept and is being promoted through the public health programme, goes some way towards coordination.
However, it will take until 2005 to have such an agency up and running.
Is this too little too late?
It may be the right step to take for the future but it is very important for the Council to be open about the extra resources that it will make available for the centre, to deal not just with SARS but also with the issues surrounding TB, smallpox and bio-terrorism.
The added value of working together is what the EU is all about in public health policy, but this all comes at a cost and we should be very open about that.
