We have been highlighting the problems in detail for some time, including the follow-up and implementation of the legislation, the and the development of social dialogue.
These are not easy subjects for the accession countries.
In this connection, I would also like attention to be paid to progress in European employment strategy and the use of the open coordination methods with regard to social exclusion and social protection.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to apologise for the fact that Mrs Diamantopoulou cannot be here and ask you to be tolerant, as you have to make do with me.
As you are aware, the Nice European Council laid down the social policy agenda.
It was also agreed that a mid-term review should be carried out in 2003, the object of which was to be to target more specifically the actions and measures considered necessary and to present a timetable for the second half of the period ending in 2005.
The mid-term review, adopted by the Commission at the end of June, is based on an overall evaluation of the first years of implementation, which have been the subject of annual reports in scoreboards and on a review of the most significant challenges and of the drivers of change.
The review also sets out the Commissionâs thinking as regards the realisation of the EUâs overall objectives, and the creation of more and better jobs and also greater social cohesion, all within the context of the further pursuit of the Lisbon strategy.
The Commission has announced a comprehensive package of initiatives and actions, in which all the relevant actors will be involved.
Let me say, in response to your two questions, that the Commission is using its right of initiative to propose the specific measures that are required and that have been announced in the mid-term review.
These include, for example, new draft legislation, such as the proposal for a directive on temporary workers, or the simplification of existing ones, such as those in the area of health and safety at work.
The Commission is also availing itself of its right to consult the social partners and to join with them in discovering those problem areas that still remain to be attended to.
One of them, for example, is the issue of the portability of occupational pension rights.
Another is the following-up of the revision of the Working Time Directive.
This has to do with the European employment strategy, in particular with the proposals for guidelines and recommendations relating to it.
At the same time, the Commission is encouraging the Member States to work together in modernising social security and promoting social inclusion.
As regards your second question, I have to stress that the mid-term reviewâs priorities as regards the structuring of the next few yearsâ work are twofold.
One is to further develop the agenda for an enlarged European Union. The other is, as a matter of priority, to monitor the transposition and implementation of the in employment and social affairs and to ensure that this is done properly.
In order that this goal may be achieved, it will be necessary to pay particular attention to involving the relevant networks of national representatives, who are to perform a supporting role in transposing and implementing European law, and also to make use of the monitoring instruments still at our disposal.
Although the primary emphasis will be on assistance and advice, the Commission will not hesitate to apply appropriate enforcement measures or, where appropriate, to take legal action.
That applies, though, not only to the new Member States that will be joining the European Union next year, but to all the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer.
When I look at the social policy agenda and see where we are at the moment â we are mid-term â we are a year away from elections, and enlargement is also just around the corner.
I think that we cannot avoid taking this into account.
If we have to choose between the priorities, then for me, enlargement is the top priority.
There are numerous social directives.
We are encouraging the development of social dialogue.
We are encouraging the creation of administrations, services and institutions that can guarantee social security in these countries.
We all know that despite the fact that these countries are acceding, it is still very difficult to implement a large number of these aspects.
If this implementation does not go well, if social dialogue does not take place, if there are insufficient institutions in place to apply all of this, this will cause a delay everywhere. Including here.
It goes without saying that this will entail a delay.
After all, you cannot simply concoct a whole series of new directives when the countries that are joining next year â thus creating a global Union of 25 countries â are unable to comply with a particular dimension of this European Union.
It is extremely important for social policy to develop in the enlargement countries.
It is developing much too slowly and on much too narrow a scale.
I therefore believe that this is a top priority, because it will adversely affect the growth of social policy at a European level, whether we like it or not.
Our second priority is employment.
I think that the Commission is making a good choice, including in its priorities.
I agree with that.
As we can all see, the things that were proposed in Lisbon, namely an employment level of 70% and so on, are progressing extremely slowly.
When the new countries join, employment levels will naturally fall, not increase.
We will therefore be even further away from the Lisbon targets than we are at the moment.
The whole policy surrounding employment must be stimulated and supported.
Then there is a third point: the review of certain directives.
I think we can do that, for example the review of the Renault directive, the review of the works council directive, even the review of the directive relating to health and safety at work.
A great number of our directives need to be reviewed.
For me, that is the third priority that we could introduce.
If we want new directives, we will really have to make choices and establish priorities.
We are no longer in a position to introduce 40 new directives, not even 10.
I think we must limit this and I think that one of the priorities in new directives should be to do something for the disabled.
We have already had an extensive debate on this.
This social group still has a difficult time accessing the labour market.
I think that we need to regulate a number of things specifically for them.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commission's mid-term review is actually an exercise in marking time.
It is full of hot air with very little substance.
There are a range of issues outstanding.
We now have a three-year delay in the revision of the European Works Council Directive, despite the recent occurrences at Genk and a whole series of earlier problems.
There is a blockage in Council on the temporary agency workers directive, a vital part of our effort to balance security and flexibility.
We have a very uncertain timetable around the revision of the working time directive and an end to the scandalous abuse of the opt-out in my own country.
There is an outstanding call from Parliament for a directive on individual dismissals and the social security aspects of atypical working: no action on those fronts has been taken at all.
I also share Mrs Smet's concerns over enlargement, the , the application of the â particularly in the area of occupational safety and health, the development of social dialogue, open coordination in the European Union as it will be this time next year.
All of these things are causing us deep concern and we have seen little, if any, action on all of these important issues.
Let me make it clear that we fully understand the pressures and the obstacles being put in the way of Commissioner Diamantopoulou and her efforts to deliver on these important issues.
Some of these come from inside the college of Commissioners, some from Council, some involve governments of a socialist complexion.
All I can say is that we will redouble our efforts to try to ensure that we support her in overcoming those obstacles and moving the social agenda forward.
That is vitally important.
Unless we can deliver and move the social agenda forward, there is a very real danger that the overall, carefully-balanced policy mix established at Lisbon will be destroyed.
If that happens it will be a major disaster for the future of the whole of the Union.
Â Â  Madam President, the increase in unemployment, in insecure employment and in social exclusion cast doubt upon the concept of a Europe that champions social justice and solidarity.
We know that there are more than 15Â million unemployed people in the European Union and more than 60Â million who live on less than 60% of the average national income.
These are problems that mainly affect women, but also the elderly living on very low pensions, immigrants, children, people with disabilities and workers in insecure and badly paid jobs.
The situation is considerably worse in the candidate countries that will be joining the Union in May next year.
In light of this worsening socio-economic situation, measures must be adopted that are different to those used to date, because disparities have increased, cohesion has weakened and no real progress has been made as regards gender equality policy.
The current situation calls for absolute priority no longer to be given to complying with the Stability Pact and, on the contrary, for this to be suspended so that its irrational criteria for nominal convergence can be reviewed.
The current situation calls for the primacy of monetarist and competition policies to be ended and for resolving these serious social problems to be put on the agenda, for compliance with the Social Policy Agenda and for an effective public investment policy in order to create the fifteen million jobs that the European Union needs.
Consequently, as stated in my recent report on implementing the Social Policy Agenda, which this plenary adopted in September, priority must be given to solving the serious problems of unemployment and poverty â including persistent poverty â in all Community policies, specifically in competition policy (and since the Commissioner responsible for the common agricultural policy is here with us, this could at least help us to look at farming issues and here too amend policy, with a view to combating poverty and social exclusion), not forgetting the Structural Funds and the Stability Pact.
We regret the fact that the Commission is not only failing to comply with the Nice social agenda, but also still has no plans to present new initiatives in areas already requested by the European Parliament, which has insisted that these be drawn up rapidly.
This is a long list, which other speakers have already referred to, but which we also adopted at the sitting of 3Â September and for which I once again express my support, in addition to agreeing with all the questions that have been put here.
I repeat the need for effective measures, for mechanisms for intervention in the field of company relocations, and of the directives on ArticleÂ 13, both with regard to womenâs rights in all the various areas of employment and to people with disabilities.
We must make good the delays in improving the directives intended to promote health and safety in the workplace, specifically for women, and the proposals that this Parliament has approved must be implemented.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I share MrsÂ Smetâs view that the great challenge in the socio-political area too has to do with enlargement.
The introduction of the EUâs socio-political legislation on the working environment and labour law will mean a very great deal for wage earners in the new Member States.
It will also, however, mean something for the present Member States.
The risk of social dumping between our countries will be much reduced, something that is incredibly important.
Another important issue in connection with enlargement is the dialogue between the two sides of industry.
In many of the new Member States, there is no dialogue up and running, and no employers and employees used to participating together in the socio-political agenda.
A third issue is the Lisbon cooperation, which we must review and stick to.
This must not, however, mean that we do not put forward proposals in new areas, for example in the area of the working environment in response, for example, to atypical jobs.
We must therefore cope successfully both with enlargement and with new risks and new socio-political challenges.
Â Â  In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs earlier this week I already really let fly at the Commission on one point on the social agenda; the Posting of Workers directive.
It is incomprehensible that the evaluation of this directive has not been seized as an opportunity to better assess the problems of cross-border employment of workers and to take new initiatives in this area.
Enlargement is just around the corner, and I have already told Commissioner Verheugen and Commissioner Diamantopolou that this transitional period is absolutely not a solution to the problems that enlargement may bring with it.
We must pursue a proactive policy and we must create better conditions for active workforce mobility.
My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already mentioned the temporary agency workers directive.
The impasse we have reached in this area must naturally not be taken as a reason for not doing anything else in areas relating to the situation of non-typical jobs, including in connection with this directive.
I am thinking of the position of the self-employed who are not actually self-employed but are in fact employees, for example, and the social security of the non-typical employee.
If we do not create a better framework of definitions and labour and social regulations in Europe, this social will soon only apply to a small minority of employees, and they will not be the ones who need it most!
Finally, a word of warning.
I think that if we do not manage to implement this social policy in Europe, a lot of people will turn against Europe.
Â Â  . Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, let me say, very briefly, that I have taken written notes of all the suggestions, demands, and aspirations you have expressed here today, and that I will pass them on to MrsÂ Diamantopoulou.
Basically, the one thing I can tell you is that I share your view, firstly, of the enormous significance of the policy set out in what we term the Lisbon targets, and also of the tasks we are presented with in the field of future social policy.
I also agree with you that it is now in particular, so to speak on the eve of enlargement, necessary that we have to give particular attention to how these issues fit into this context, and, like you, I believe that this is a matter of urgency.
Fundamentally, I believe, we have to continue to take action on both fronts, for we must not overlook the close connection between issues of employment and social security and the question of whether we will succeed in recreating proper growth in Europe.
That is one of the basic conditions, and we will bring about growth of this only if we take appropriate action regarding the various elements that are necessary if our European economy is to be restructured.
On the other hand, though, it should not be thought that this is only about growth, in other words, only about the economy; it is also, of course, about social protection.
I have already told you in my opening remarks what the Commissionâs current plans are.
I hope that these measures will indeed enable us to make the necessary improvements to the situation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0333/2003) by Mrs DybkjÃŠr, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, on Election 2004: How to ensure balanced representation of women and men [2003/2108(INI)].
Â Â  We are in the middle of an exciting and demanding period in the history of Europe.
We are increasing the number of EU Member States, and we are at the moment devising and debating a new framework for treaty-based cooperation based on the nation states and the people.
There are quite a few prior conditions of involvement in EU cooperation, but one of them is the need to practise democracy and observe human rights, that is to say people must have equal opportunities to develop, and exercise control over, their lives.
When we look at what is actually happening in Europe, who is it that takes the decisions?
Who determines the laws?
Who manages daily life in international, European, national, regional and local assemblies?
Who personifies public power?
The answer is quite simply that it is the men who do this.
If there is any doubt about this, it is enough to try asking how many women there are among Heads of State or Government.
The answer is, none.
If we look at the family photo from Copenhagen in 2002, there are 64 people in that picture, including just eight women.
Is that the case because there is a shortage of women in Europe?
Is it a case of our constituting a minority?
There are, now and again, people who tell us that we do, whereupon we are placed among other minorities.
In that case, we must, however, tell ourselves that, no, this is not the case.
We constitute at least half the population.
Women form at least half the electorate, so it is not therefore a question of there not being enough women.
Is it, therefore, a case of there being no competent women?
No, that is not the reason, either.
There are in actual fact women â and, as time goes by, more women than men â who enter higher education, although that is no longer, of course, always a criterion for participating in political life.
It is not this that forms the background to the situation.
There are quite a few reasons why there are not enough women, and these apply everywhere.
In this case, we shall concentrate on the election we face next year.
As has been said, we are at present building the new Europe.
Women constitute half the new Europe, and it is absolutely fundamental that this half should also be involved in deciding the framework for, and content of, further cooperation.
One of the places in which they can do this is, moreover, in the European Parliament.
Today, we are in a situation in which 30% of Members of the European Parliament are women.
We are now enlarging the EU to include ten new countries and, in that connection, we are obliged to take a brief look at how women are represented in those countries.
Unfortunately, matters do not look too good.
Obviously, not all the countries are right at the bottom of the table, and the fact is that we also have, among the Member States, countries that are low down on the list where womenâs representation is concerned.
All the same, we have to say that the average is low.
What, therefore, we have to concentrate on in the forthcoming election is getting more women to stand and finding out why others do not wish to do so.
Are they in actual fact just not invited to stand, or does the old classic pattern apply whereby no one voluntarily surrenders power, neither men nor women for that matter.
Personally, I believe it is the classic situation.
Naturally, men do not voluntarily relinquish power, just as we women also find it extremely difficult to give up so-called power over our children.
None of us are saints.
It is now important, however, for us to try to discuss this matter and to understand that, if we are to have this EU cooperation accepted among the EUâs populations, it would perhaps be a good idea if we were to try inviting women to participate and if, above all, we were to devise systems that might give women opportunities to be elected if they were finally to appear on the lists.
Gaining acceptance of EU cooperation will certainly take some doing.
Over there sits a Swedish Commissioner and I, who speak now, am a Dane, and if there is anywhere it is hard going obtaining grass-roots acceptance of European cooperation, it is in Sweden and Denmark, with the greatest scepticism among women.
Experience in the Scandinavian countries shows that it is not, therefore, a case of women not being elected.
If they stand on an equal footing, they are in actual fact elected.
The fact is that, if there are women who have any chance at all of being elected, then elected they are.
It is not therefore a case of voters generally believing women not to be up to scratch.
On the contrary, they are happy to vote for them.
The truth is that they have no opportunity to vote women representatives in.
It is extremely important that we discuss this matter now because, at present, 31% of MEPs are women.
Among the new countries, matters appear lopsided.
In a Parliament with greater influence upon European legislation than we have ever had before, we are thus now in danger of having far less than 30% women, because women are so poorly represented in, for example, the new countries.
There are two countries that have sent no female observers at all.
It really is unbelievable that democracy can be practised and human rights observed on that basis.
I think we must all try to help each other ensure that there is a proper proportion of women in the European Parliament so that people feel represented in this House.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, that was an excellent contribution by MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr.
I am able to concur with it 100%.
It was an excellent introduction to what this debate needs to be about.
First of all, I naturally wish to congratulate the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities and also MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr as rapporteur, for having taken the initiative regarding this report.
This too emphasises the importance of bringing about balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process, especially in the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament next year.
We must take democracy seriously and take account of the equality issue in decision-making.
If we profess democratic values, the representation of the people and citizensâ active participation, we cannot at the same time exclude half the population from the bodies in which the decisions are taken.
Increased participation on the part of women also means better opportunities for society to take care of its citizens.
We lose out on both resources and experience if women cannot be a part of political life.
Women must be given access to the labour market and to politics in order to be able to advance professionally at a pace commensurate with their qualifications.
In that way, proper use will be made of their skills.
Unfortunately, it has so far been too often the case that men have been elected.
That is something we must change.
As pointed out in the report, all the Member States have committed themselves to implementing the UNâs action plan from the 1995 Beijing Conference, together with a series of other international programmes in support of the principle of equal participation by women and men in decision-making bodies and in the decision-making process.
These constitute the international framework within which we must all work.
Balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process and in all areas of life is also the central theme of the Commissionâs 2003-2004 Work Programme.
The work on assessing which projects are to be subsidised from the gender equality programme is in its final phase right now.
I am also pleased to inform you that the Commission is at present developing a database on âWomen and men in decision-makingâ.
The database is one of a series of measures for developing and maintaining statistics, which are also important as a tool and for providing background information.
The preparations for publishing the initial results from this database are currently under way.
At the beginning of 2004, the content will be presented on the Commissionâs web site.
It will then be updated each year.
The main aims of the database are firstly to measure progress in relation to the commitments made and, secondly, to bring about increased awareness in the present Member States, the EEA countries and the candidate countries of the situation regarding women and men in decision-making positions.
May I also mention the measures on decision-making which were recently adopted by the Italian Presidency with the support of the Commission and to which attention is drawn by the report.
The Syracuse Conference, together with the subsequent informal meetings between the ministers for equality, emphasised the need to maintain the efforts to achieve balanced representation of women and men in the decision-making processes at all levels.
It was also proposed that, by agreement between all the political parties, at least 30% of candidates they appoint to stand for election to the European Parliament should be women.
The parties should, moreover, actively strive to achieve the objectives laid down by the Lisbon and Barcelona European Councils, particularly those affecting women directly: an employment rate among women of at least 60% by no later than 2010, together with regulations concerning access to good childcare at a reasonable cost.
These objectives are also among the tools and basic conditions that will enable women to participate in political life and the life of society generally.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the important report she has produced and at a time such as this, on the eve of the European Parliament elections.
We all know that equality between men and women is a fundamental principle in Community law, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which included equality between men and women as an objective in all programmes.
We therefore call for concrete measures to facilitate the presence of women in electoral lists and, therefore, in the European Parliament.
In this case, this request could be extended to the other regional or national parliaments in which the representation of women is still low in comparison with the percentage of women, who make up half the population, and in some cases rather more than half the population.
We know that when there is no special assistance, through positive action measures, with laws to facilitate this great presence of women, we women have real problems accessing institutional posts, political posts and therefore political decision-making posts and positions of power.
We have had experience over recent years of the presence of women continuing to increase slightly, but in no case has it passed much more than 30% and we are right to fear that in the next European elections it may be reduced.
As the rapporteur has said, the presence of women amongst the observers coming from the enlargement countries is really low; some countries have not presented women at all as observers, and we fear that, following the elections to the European Parliament, this presence will be no greater than 15%.
It is precisely for this reason that it is important and significant that we are stressing this at the moment, and we are not forgetting the countries which currently belong to the European Union, in which the percentage is no greater than 30% in the majority of cases â with the exception of the Nordic countries â and in others that percentage is even lower and women are still facing significant difficulties in terms of accessing decision-making positions.
They are still significant because there are no electoral laws â with the exception of two countries â laying down the obligation for women to be present on lists and because our ability to be present in decision-making bodies and parliaments depends essentially on the political parties, on the mentality of political leaders and on the awareness we are able to communicate to society on the importance of this issue.
This is therefore the appropriate time and it is a task which we, as women committed to the presence of women, but also men, and Members of Parliament and political leaders must take on: this challenge of achieving greater presence for women within the political institutions.
Only the political will of leaders, of parties, when it comes to making decisions, will ensure that there are really more women following the elections and therefore a better balance between men and women in decision-making.
Â Â  Madam President, it really is curious, after 50 years of European policy on gender equality and 100 years since the right of women to vote was claimed and recognised, that we are trying here to persuade everyone of the self-evident, in other words that men and women should share all the responsibilities and all the obligations of both private and public life equally and fairly, that there should be a balanced participation of men and women in democratic institutions and in all political decision-making centres.
In the run up to the European elections in June, MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr's truly exceptional report is of particular value, because it sets the framework within which all the Member States should move, especially the accession countries, in order to ensure that the percentage of women in the House as a result of the European elections should at least be no smaller than it is at present, which is 31%.
And I should like to name the two countries, Estonia and Slovenia, which did not bother to send even one woman, even one as an example, with the observers they sent to the European Parliament.
Our fears are also reinforced by the traumatic experience we had last year, with 17% participation by women in the constitutional convention for the European constitution.
That is why our committee, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, has put promoting the democracy of equality at the top of its priorities and has taken initiatives to mobilise governments, national parliaments, political leaders and women themselves in order to achieve this objective, an objective which does not simply concern the application in deed rather than just word of gender equality, but also the financial and social development of Europe through the rational use of the valuable human resource which women represent.
The Lisbon strategy, like other ambitious European policies, urgently needs the full participation of women at all planning and decision-making levels in order to achieve its objectives.
The future of Europe cannot be planned in the absence of women.
In the run up to the European elections, we need additional strategies and legislative measures, positive action, quotas or political agreements which will safeguard the balanced participation of men and women in electoral combinations and in the elected bodies which result.
I hope the new European Parliament of the 25 will attain this objective and will operate as a shining example and standard for the other parliaments in the world.
Â Â  I would also like to warmly congratulate Mrs DybkjÃŠr on this report.
It has come at exactly the right time, just before the European elections, and it has been mentioned here by several speakers already: we will have to do our utmost to match this turnout percentage of 30-31% that was achieved for the European Parliament elections.
This is certainly not helped by the accession countries, where we only have 14% at the moment.
I therefore believe that in the context of the verification of these countries, we will have to ensure that gender equality forms part of our future fundamental community law, and that we must therefore make sure on an internal level that this is also done in the relevant parliaments.
It is all very well pointing the finger at other countries, however; but we also have examples of women being seriously short-changed in our own countries.
In my country, it was not so long ago that only one female minister was appointed.
There was a great deal of protest against this, but fortunately that cabinet soon fell and we now have five female ministers and five female secretaries of state.
To my great regret, neither of the two ministers appointed by my own party, which purports to do a great deal for women, is a woman.
Not because there are no capable women, but because there are always other people who are more important and who have to take priority.
As long as we carry on in this way, women will have no chance.
I am also of the opinion, however, that we ourselves must keep hammering on about gender equality and that we must keep a very close eye on it.
For example, I would have nothing against following examples like those mentioned in Mrs DybkjÃŠr's report â like in France where party financing depends on the number of women on the list â because we cannot stand still, we must do something.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission to pay additional attention to this point in its consultations with all Member States.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrsÂ DybkjÃŠrâs report deals with something of which all of us in this House have very long experience: actual life in the political organisations in which we participate.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said that men elect men.
Yes, men in political parties, especially, elect men.
They elect men to a greater extent than the electorate does, a fact that is very interesting.
When women enter politics, the organisation of political work changes, and new issues appear on the political agenda.
What is more, women naturally have different political and ideological perceptions.
In the course of last year, we saw the composition of the Convention and the way in which issues of equality were manipulated when it came, among other things, to the legal status assigned to equality.
We still see, after many years of decisions to use âgender mainstreamingâ as a method in decision-making, that this is completely absent from most areas of politics.
It is now also proposed to cut back on the areas of competence of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities.
This is completely contrary to the trend.
It is even a phasing-out of gender equality in politics.
It is rather ironic reading the Council recommendation from December 1996, which stresses that the under-representation of women in decision-making posts leaves their experiences unused and undervalued and thus constitutes a loss for society as a whole.
I do in fact agree with the Council recommendation but, when the Councilâs own composition throughout the years is examined in the form of photographs shown after the Council meetings, it is seen still to hark back to another era.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my warmest thanks go to MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr for this eminently timely and important report.
We all share a concern about how balanced the representation of gender is going to be in the European Parliament in the next legislature.
We have a good six months to work hard to dispel this concern and we should not be afraid.
Equality is one of the European fundamental values which the new Member States have also committed themselves to respecting.
There can be no genuine democracy if women are unable to participate in decision-making at all its levels.
The fact is that the establishment of pluralist parliamentary democracy does not in itself guarantee equal participation of women and men in political decision-making.
We could have rid ourselves of the problem entirely by developing a common European act regarding elections, in which gender equality would be guaranteed.
Female politicians have to be made strong professionals in their field with the help of training and financial and moral support.
This way the reasons for the lower areas of competency with regard to the women in a quota system compared to their male colleagues would become groundless and fade away.
The aim of an equal society is dimly visible as decision-making without the need for quotas, with the highest decision-making bodies representing the genders equally.
It would not seem, however, that we will achieve this without an interim stage, with the EU, the Member States and the political parties actively involved in working jointly on behalf of equality.
The political groups should agree common policies to reach a position where in the end equality becomes a reality in economic, political and social life.
I now want to throw down the gauntlet, as it were, and ask the male Members of the European Parliament here to think about whether they have ever voted for a woman.
Furthermore, if you are also influential in your countryâs political arena would you propose a woman as President of the Commission?
Moreover, if there is an office of President of the EU, who might the woman be whom you would vote for as President?
Â Â  MadamÂ President, I am able to support what MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr has said about gender equality, so I shall instead use my speaking time to talk about a genuine success where such equality is concerned.
I was elected to Parliament as a representative of an all-party movement, the June Movement, which has now operated for ten years on the principle that we should draw half of all our parliamentary candidates and half of our partyâs leading members equally from both sexes.
We have just recently prepared a new list of parliamentary candidates, consisting of ten women and ten men, with the vacancies divided on an alternating basis between male and female candidates.
For a long time, we had more men than we could make use of and only half the women we needed to have been elected.
We therefore began searching through our membership, and we finally obtained the list we wanted and needed.
The outcome would, however, have been a lopsided list if we had not adopted regulations committing ourselves to having a list divided equally between both sexes.
The outcome was that gender equality operated to the advantage of the men.
Some of the women did in fact obtain more votes at the party conference than some of the men but were listed beneath men with fewer votes because, according to our rule, every other person on the list must be a woman.
This outcome was not intended, but I can sincerely recommend all parties to introduce gender equality for all their lists.
Women consistently hold back, even in those countries that are most advanced in terms of gender equality.
Women do not want to put themselves forward unless they feel certain of being on top of everything, ideally more so than their male colleagues.
We also know this from job applications.
When men apply for a job, some of the many qualifications they reel off have to be discounted.
When women apply, qualifications have to be added.
That is the way things are, but it is something we can counteract by requiring the same number of candidates from each sex or, as I would prefer, at least 50% women.
If, as a result, qualified men were deselected in favour of less qualified women, I should not recommend the system, but, in the case of ourselves in the June Movement, the system has operated perfectly at each election, given women the necessary helping hand and provided us with a list that better reflects the electorate.
This is, then, an arrangement I should like to recommend to everyone.
We have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list.
Nine of our candidates are under 40 years old and seven of them under 30 and, what is more, all of them are qualified.
Our youngest parliamentary candidate, who is only 18, also has several yearsâ experience of EU issues.
We have no special quota arrangement for young people but have made a conscious effort at renewal so that it is possible to give women and young people a real chance to compete with us old men.
It is a pleasure to be able to contribute a success story from the real world to the debate on equality.
In the EU Convention, MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr and others fought bravely for gender equality but, unfortunately, this was only incorporated into the values of the Danish edition.
The other countriesâ editions just talk about equality rather than gender equality.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are debating today refers of course to the forthcoming European elections, but it also has wider significance for the participation of women in political life.
The rapporteur's report contains interesting data on the current situation in the Member States and in the European Parliament.
It also touches on all the aspects of the problem and makes interesting proposals on dealing with it, proposals which come mainly from the experience of the various countries.
I think that promoting exchanges of these experiences is very important because it raises the awareness of the competent agencies, it gives them ideas about applying measures and evaluating progress.
The European Commission should, I believe, provide facilities for such action.
This year is dedicated to the action programme on equal opportunities for women to participate in positions of responsibility.
I should like to know if there have already been any results from the application of the programme.
However, I suspect that it has nothing interesting or progressive to tell us, because the initiatives of the non-governmental organisations, to which the programme mainly refers, cannot bear fruit if there is no public dialogue in the Member States on the subject which will engage the parliaments, national and regional, where they exist, and will bring parties, local authorities and social agencies face to face with their options and responsibilities, in order to make the whole of society aware of the issue of the participation of women, an issue which concerns the future of the whole of society and not just the future of women.
We also need an open dialogue between the parties themselves so that everyone is informed and aware, from the leaders to the regional cadres, of the deficit in the participation of women and the need to apply a strategy to support and promote women cadres to positions of responsibility.
Finally, I should like to say, in the run up to the European elections, that we need to raise the awareness of and inform women as citizens and voters about the meaning of these elections and their importance.
Plebiscites and referenda, where they have been held, tell us that women are the citizens most distanced from the issues of European policy and the most Euro-sceptical citizens.
This is a challenge which concerns us all, at both European and national level, and the European elections give us an opportunity to demonstrate our determination to face up to it.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it can only be a source of delight today to see two front page headlines in the popular press devoted to the positions that the Commission and the European Parliament wish to adopt in order to ensure the equality of the sexes as regards both their access to goods and services and their representation in Parliament.
At last these matters are being talked about.
We can only congratulate our fellow MEP, MrsÂ DybkjÃŠr, who emphasises the wide-ranging importance that the change in attitudes to integrating women into political life on an equal basis with men may have for the entirety of the social and political contracts we have with our fellow citizens.
It is acknowledged that positive action is crucial if the balanced representation of women and men is to be achieved.
It is acknowledged that involving both sexes in policy development improves policy and makes it more relevant to a varied population.
The transparently weak representation of women in the decision-making process raises the problem of the legitimacy of the political structures, for the operation of a democratic system reflects the society it advocates or defends.
Equality is a European value, which the Member States must respect.
We cannot sustain this incoherence on the eve of enlargement when we wish to maintain, and even enhance, the representation of women in a House, which must spearhead this new trend and, at the same time, be the crucible that enables new behaviours and new strategies to be imagined.
If this is to be possible, and not only desirable, we need from now on to act in such a way that the 2004 campaign affirms and brings to fruition the principle of effective democracy in which both sexes are represented, for the slightest decline in our representation would be a signal that might be misinterpreted on the eve of enlargement.
Â Â  I would like to draw your attention to the greatest inequality of power that exists: the one between men and women, and I would like to thank the for her report, which once again emphasises the need for parity.
We still have a long way to go even in this Parliament, where one third of us are women, and the best performing country, Sweden, has recently gone from 40% to 45%; still not parity, although we all envy Sweden.

We have made progress in Belgium, going from 11% to 23%.
The new countries could learn something from this, as we have put a lot of effort into achieving it.
If we leave it to the goodwill of, let us say, men, nothing will change.
If we leave it to a change of mentality, then we could still be having this discussion when our great-granddaughters are MEPs.
We must make the effort ourselves, and that applies just as much to the new countries.
None of these countries reaches the 30% mark which we are already used to here.
Only three countries have more than 20% representation by women.
Only 14% of their representatives in this Parliament are women.
If we have 100 new members of Parliament, then in the worst-case scenario, if the same ratio applies, we will have 86 men and 14 women.
This is a general regression for women in the European Parliament.
It should not be the case that the accession countries help our Parliament to become even more male-dominated.
That is why we in the European Parliament want to give firm support to all women and to all governments who want to change things for the better, because nothing will happen without voluntary action.
The quotas are often criticised for not being justified, for having to leave everything to the spontaneous evolution of democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are lawmakers, and a lawmaker knows very well that you cannot leave everything to spontaneous evolution and that action is required.
The countries where the best results have been achieved have been those governments which have amended their legislation.
Let me quote you the example of Belgium, where it is not permitted to have three candidates of the same gender at the top of the European list.
We want an equal number of candidates to be put forward now too, and I hope that the excellent recommendations made in this report will be adopted by governments.
I expect the Commission to introduce an initiative, I expect initiatives to be introduced by the Council, so that equality in this Parliament, both and does not decrease but improve after accession.
Â Â  â Madam President, I share the concern expressed in MrsÂ DybkjÃŠrâs excellent report regarding the under-representation of women in the European Parliament.
It is unfortunately true that, as I look around now, there are noticeably few women here, particularly young women and women with families.
As many have commented, in the light of statistics the situation seems even more alarming than before with regard to next yearâs elections after enlargement.
The proportion of women working in the national parliaments in the new Member States is not more than 30% at best and in more than half of the new Member States the proportion of women members of parliament hovers around the 10% mark.
We must nevertheless remember that things could also be better in the current Member States, including my own country, Finland, although Finland can be considered one of the pioneers of equality between women and men.
Why are women not being voted for, then, if more than half of the electorate are women?
The report identifies constituency parties and the selection mechanisms as the main reasons for the under-representation of women.
Systems like the Finnish election procedure have guaranteed an equal representation of women and men.
Here in the European Parliament almost half the Finnish delegation are women, so there is probably nothing wrong with the system.
Instead of parties employing long and hierarchical systems of listing names, in the Finnish election system you vote for both the candidate and the party, and in practice the European Parliamentary elections have been to a large extent about electing an individual, with candidates given priority over parties, which stay very much in the background.
In these conditions women have done well.
Of course traditions and election culture also have an influential role to play.
It nevertheless shows that women are voted for if they simply stand for election.
Why, however, are young women in particular not interested in politics?
Why are women not encouraged to participate in the wielding of power to a greater extent?
These I think are questions that furthermore give cause for introspection.
Why is the EU not interesting?
Women often see EU decision-making as too distant, abstract and highfalutin.
Women are workaday heroines who like to stick to more concrete things.
The work situation is often difficult, especially for women with families.
I myself have come to realise, whilst expecting my first child, how hard it has been to combine motherhood with the career of a Member of Parliament.
The EUâs rules on maternity leave directly oppress young women.
Maternity leave is not really a familiar concept and, for example, in Parliament it is put on a par with absence through sickness.
There is much room for improvement in this matter and the situation is reflected in the situation regarding employment in Europe as a whole.
Women are not sufficiently encouraged to establish a career and start a family.
The result is that many women deliberately put off having children.
The message coming from the EU should not be either career or motherhood.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, we have now heard a great deal about a very old topic, one that we have already been discussing for years â always, in fact, on the same level â and I wonder what progress we have made.
We take pride in the 30% of Members of this House who are women.
If we had 50%, that would be parity.
We content ourselves with only 30%, or tell ourselves that we have made progress because we have done very well in comparison with other countries.
What this means is that, for a century, we have been progressing one millimetre at a time, and that what we have achieved is far from being secure.
When I say that there is the danger of us sustaining more setbacks in this area, I am not just referring yet again to the new Member States, but also to the present ones, which have to make enormous efforts to get that sort of quota into this House.
Yesterday, when the progress reports were presented, I heard not one word said about the under-representation of women.
This is something else that we should take into account and incorporate into progress reports of this kind, enabling them to show what is lacking and where changes still have to be made where equal opportunities policy is concerned.
If we say there is a lack of women candidates â something of which we are very often accused â then we have to give some thought to how women are supposed to combine career, family and politics when they are constantly, too, having their consciences pricked by questions like: how can you do this, that, and the other, as well?
This, I think, is where society has a part to play, and this is where there must be consequences for those Member States that fail to do what they have undertaken to do, namely create really equal opportunities.
I find myself wondering what mechanisms there are and what are the consequences when they fail to do that.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, firstly, I wish to thank you for this discussion, which really has illustrated the importance of the roles we all have to play.
The Commission must accept its responsibility.
I am aware that my colleague, MrsÂ Diamantopoulou is right now investigating the possibility of organising round-table discussions in the Member States and the candidate countries in order to discuss the issue of gender equality.
I believe that these discussions must cover everything from nominations to the way in which subsidies and forms of support might be designed to enable us also to promote gender equality.
In this area, there is, of course, also a very important role for the political parties, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations.
They must work closely together on improving womenâs representation.
In the run-up to the European Parliament elections, it is quite clearly an important task to ensure that we maintain, and ideally increase, womenâs representation.
All the contributions have also made it clear that the new Member States too must be made aware of this, if we are to ensure that women are well represented right from the start.
This is an issue that, for better or for worse, we shall have to live with for a long time to come, for we unfortunately live at a time when it is easier to split an atom than to overturn a prejudice.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.(1)
Â Â  Colleagues, I am delighted to inform you that the members of a delegation from the National Peopleâs Congress of China have taken their seats in the official gallery.
I extend a warm welcome to the Chinese delegation.
They are here to attend the 20th EP-China Interparliamentary Meeting, and are led by Mr Wang Yingfan, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Peopleâs Congress of the Peopleâs Republic of China.
We look forward to a constructive dialogue, and we wish you all !
Â Â  We now continue with the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have risen before on a vote on reports like these and no doubt I will be doing so again in the future.
I would normally rise before each report, but if you are agreeable, I shall make this statement once and we could accept it for all three reports in the culture package.
Rule 63a of our Rules of Procedure states that we have to ensure that all reports are financially compatible.
To make sure that we are in line with that Rule, I would propose that we add an oral amendment to all three reports which would read 'Considers that the financial statement as amended is compatible with the ceiling of headings 3 and 5 of the financial perspectives 2000-2006'.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I strongly urge Parliament to adopt this amendment.
Parliamentâs legal department has stated that the earmarking of cultural organisations is clearly in contravention of the Financial Regulation.
This proposal will make possible a gentle period of transition, which is to say earmarking can continue in any case until next year.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to ask the House to really stand up for its rights.
Earmarking is the only thing that we â by which I mean we rather than the Commission â can really do for culture.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . It is crucial to develop a true picture of immigration in the various countries making up the European Union and we should, therefore, support all initiatives, in particular in line with UN recommendations, that promote knowledge of this extremely important situation, which encompasses situations of unacceptable and inhuman humiliation and exploitation such as trafficking in human beings or the exploitation of a labour force that has no rights whatsoever.
This situation needs to be better understood, so that we can better combat its underlying causes, which are social injustices and inequalities or wars and all those who exploit these, particularly those who take advantage of the countless people in an âillegalâ situation.
We must understand the situation, but only in order to provide meaningful support for the victims of criminal networks â men, women and children who are simply fighting for an opportunity, for the right to have a better life.
It is another matter to use this necessary effort to communitarise immigration policy, by proposing, as the report does, to establish âbinding European legislationâ.
It is another matter altogether to get a picture of the reality to strengthen the implementation of todayâs repressive immigration policies, in order to create a âFortress Europeâ.
This is something that we reject.
Â Â  . Standardising the statistics used by national authorities and organisations, which are currently all compiled on different bases, is one of this communicationâs more interesting points, mainly because of the ease and frequency with which statistical data is manipulated by the bodies that publish them.
There is a need to improve the collection and analysis of Community statistics in a common area as important as asylum and immigration.
I regret, however, the excessively belated presentation by the Commission of its communication â to which the rapporteur also referred since the Action Programme corresponds to the period 2002-2004, whereas the communication dates from April 2003! ...
I also support the rapporteur when, in calling for transparency in the collection of statistics and for them to be intelligible and accessible to the public, he suggests that the New European Migration Network will be able to fulfil the role previously conferred on the European Migration Monitoring Centre.
Bearing in mind that one of the consequences of the Action Plan will be a substantial increase in the production of statistics, we cannot exclude the possibility, as the rapporteur reminds us, that future budgetary rules might have to be revised.
I therefore supported the positions advocated in the report and voted in favour of it.
Â Â  We would defend subsidiarity and assert that the EU institutions should not interfere with the Member Statesâ electoral systems or the political partiesâ systems for establishing their electoral lists.
We have therefore chosen to vote against the own-initiative report by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities on âElection 2004: How to ensure balanced representation of women and menâ.
Â Â  It is very good to want to abolish discrimination in election candidacies, as proposed by the DybkjÃŠr report, but it is still better not to add to the discrimination.
The French law of 11Â AprilÂ 2003, which regionalises the method of balloting for the European elections, clearly puts the small to medium-sized parties at a disadvantage.
In these conditions, it may be maintained that this law infringes the decision of the Council of European Ministers of 25Â JuneÂ 2002 according to which, when â as is the case in France â a European ballot taking place in a single national constituency is regionalised, the reform must take place âwithout affecting the essentially proportional nature of the voting systemâ.
Strangest of all, the European decision of 2002 has, in accordance with Article 190(4) of the Treaty, been adopted by France by means of a law enacted only on 16Â OctoberÂ 2003.
In other words, the proper procedure is now apparently to adapt the French law of AprilÂ 2003 to the European decision approved in October.
Unfortunately, it has also to be said that no provision has been made for removing such a contradiction between national and Community law.
Â Â  . This initiative, which is intended to promote a more balanced representation of women and men in the composition of the EP following the 2004 elections, is to be welcomed, although it has limitations.
Increasing the participation of women in social and political life is a concern and an objective that we support, but simply calling for more women to participate in political life is not enough.
As we know, progress in the field of womenâs rights and in genuine equal opportunities is only achieved when these rights have solid foundations and as the outcome of social advances that have been won in battles by workers and women for their rights and not merely through elitist, artificial and administrative measures.
I must underline the need, however, for greater participation by women in the social and political life of every country and in the EP.
The problem is that the current neoliberal capitalist offensive to dismantle countless social achievements affects, today as in the past, but even more harshly, working women.
Working women are the main victims, in particular as regards exercising their rights, including the right to have a job and to be elected to participate in social and political life.
Lastly, I simply wish to recall that, in the elections to the European Parliament in 1999, on the lists of the (Unitary Democratic Coalition), of which the Portuguese Communist Party is a member, 11 of the 25 candidates were women, as was the candidate heading the list.
Â Â  I had tabled a host of amendments to the draft report by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, and a number of them have been adopted.
Their purpose was to qualify certain proposals and requests made to the political parties and national governments, not in order to weaken such proposals and requests but in order to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the independence of parties and governments and to prevent interference of doubtful quality which would, moreover, be in danger of being counter-productive.
In my opinion, asking for quotas to be introduced by means of legislation or insisting on legislating on the principle of parity democracy is going too far.
I therefore consider that, in this area, there must be no head-on clash with countries and parties that â often, incidentally, out of respect for women â do not want quotas for women, such quotas implying that women are apparently incapable of carving out a place in the parties and in the eyes of the electorate.
That place may also be won through the endurance, courage, aptitude and quality that should also be shown by the men who wish to take their places here.
I was keen to make these points in order to prevent this report, for which I voted, from being counter-productive in terms of its objective, which I share.
Â Â  . It is no longer the case that certain family duties and certain careers are reserved for men or women.
Policy is no longer determined by what men think is important.
Women are no longer expected to leave the most important decisions to men.
This development contributes to greater equality between people.
Unfortunately, this is not happening simultaneously throughout Europe.
We can see from the number of women elected to national parliaments that the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands are in the lead, that the southern European and English-speaking countries are trailing way behind, and that the role of women in the East has even been forced into a decline.
There is a justifiable fear that after the enlargement of the EU, the number of women in the next European Parliament will be lower than it is at present.
We will only be able to bring about change in this area through the greater participation of women in areas where there are conflicts of opinions and interests, and through their participation in the organisations involved.
We must eliminate the obstacles to this.
Electoral legislation may contribute by abolishing systems based on districts, but not by legislating on the composition of candidate lists.
My party, the Socialist Party of the Netherlands, has lists for the Upper and Lower Houses which comprise 50% women in electable seats, but we do not do this through coercion but through conviction.
The feminisation of politics is achieved from the bottom up and by pursuing the struggle outside Parliament.
Â Â  Voting against this report should not, of course, be construed as any show of hostility towards the representation of women in politics.
Apart from the fact that the general philosophy of the report â namely, positive discrimination â is contrary to the constitutional traditions of certain Member States and, in particular, to the republican universalism on which French law is based, rejection of this document is based solely upon respect for the distribution of competences between the EU and the Member States.
In the event, and in the absence of a uniform electoral procedure, the European Union has no competence at all to intervene, as this report invites it to do, in defining the rules governing the organisation of the European elections.
As a result, the European Parliament cannot legitimately ask the national political parties âto introduce quota systems, such as [what is known as] the zipper systemâ, whereby men and women appear alternately on the lists, âand/or [to] take measures so as to promote a balance in participationâ or to ask the Commission to distribute information on the mysterious concept of âparity democracyâ or to urge the funding of âawareness raising campaignsâ on the subject.
Â Â  . I voted against this report because I disagree with the measures the rapporteur recommends to ensure a balanced representation between men and women.
I totally reject this illegitimate attempt to interfere in the internal political organisation of the Member States and the ongoing confusion between equality and egalitarianism.
Adopting legislative measures for positive discrimination that facilitate womenâs access to political posts must always be considered very carefully, so as not to distort the genuine rules of democracy and of free choice and also not to offend and discriminate against women who, of their own free will and on their own merits, have risen to the highest positions without any artificial mechanisms to promote them.
The approach adopted by the rapporteur belongs to the radical feminist clique, which appears to have hijacked the committee in which this report originated.
This approach does not match the vision and the concerns of most European women who, on a daily basis, prove their worth without any complexes about their standing and without giving in to or wanting to impose a sexist approach.
I must also emphasise, to add a little humour, both the veiled threat of civil disobedience that the rapporteur slipped in, on the grounds of a supposed breakdown in the âlegitimacy of decision-makingâ and the arrogance of ârewritingâ the âsocial contractâ by decree.
Â Â  . In this report, the Commission is being asked to distribute information on the concept of parity democracy.
The Commission must not be allowed to respond to this call.
Parity democracy hinders the complete emancipation of women as citizens.
Parity democracy aims as a last resort to introduce electoral laws that specify that half the seats in elected bodies should be reserved for women and half for men.
This boils down to âsexual apartheidâ and implies a contravention of the free and individual right to elect and be elected.
Parity democracy is based on the philosophy of differentiation and assumes that there are âessentialâ differences between men and women.
It is not the task of the Commission to implement these one-sided, dangerous concepts.
I share the opinion of the French philosopher Elisabeth Badinter that the state must not be allowed to reduce people to their sex.
The Commission must provide objective information on the effect of different legislative and other instruments.
Interestingly, the best results have in the past been achieved in countries in which political parties have taken the initiative themselves by putting more women on their candidate lists and where the dogma of (legally enforced) parity democracy has virtually no support.
Â Â  . As a liberal, I am always in favour of dialogue in Parliament.
That is what democracy is all about.
And as rapporteur, I have always tried to be an honest, objective intermediary and maintain dialogue between the various European standpoints in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and between the various organisations.
Right from the beginning I could see that there would be a problem.
I have tried to defend a compromise in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. One regulation with two chapters.
I am sorry that this has ultimately turned out not to be the official point of view of Parliament, but I will remain at your disposal.
I have abstained from the because I want to be in a position to maintain the dialogue between all the institutional players involved in this issue, which is so very important for Asia and Latin America.
We have only one aim: to accept a definitive regulation in the near future with consensus between the various standpoints.
Â Â  Mr President, in view of the words of the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, who did not manage to have her point of view endorsed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, nor in plenary, she has recognised that she cannot share the conclusions or the result of the vote.
I believe, Mr President, that the most honest and reasonable thing for Mrs Sanders-ten Holte to do would be to relinquish her responsibilities, since she cannot accept the opinion of plenary and since she has not been able to win the support of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Â Â  We have voted against the Sanders-Ten Holte report on would-be âCommunity cooperation with Asian and Latin American countriesâ, except in the case of a few amendments concerning humanitarian aid in the hope that this will not disappear into the hands of corrupt local political leaders.
In our view, the amount of this aid is derisory.
It is enough to note â and this is something we denounce â that a pretended increase in aid to Latin America entails a corresponding decrease in aid to Asia.
Spread as thinly as this, such aid is quite incapable of offsetting the drastic consequences of the plundering that has always been engaged in, in these regions and in others, by large companies or European and North American financial establishments.
By seizing raw materials at low prices, by carving out areas of influence for themselves or, again, by imposing their services at high prices, the rapacity of large European companies, wedded to that of their local friends, is the very source of the impoverishment of the populations of these continents.
In recent years, this has even led to the collapse of several national economies on these two continents.
That is because, far from eradicating poverty, all these economic trends in the European Union serve, instead, only to increase it.
Â Â  . British Labour MEPs had to vote against the amended report due to serious concerns about duplicating and complicating legislation, a reduction in resources for Asia, and benchmarking.
The Parliament has an agreed position in favour of simpler rules and procedures, and it makes no sense for a technical, legal regulation to do the work of Country Strategy Papers and National Indicative Programmes.
Creating two separate regulations will undermine the objective to streamline and clarify development policy programmes and, as the world's poorest region, transferring funds from Asia to Latin America cannot be justified.
We could not support Amendments 1 and 2 to split the Regulation; 93 and 94 to reduce funding for Asia and increase funding for Latin America; 3, 18, 56 and 97 on benchmarks and a Bi-Regional Solidarity Fund for Latin America (creating a cumbersome and wasteful extra layer of bureaucracy); or 18, 28, 29, 56, 57, 95, 96, and 99 which create a rigid framework for programmes intended for poverty reduction.
It remains to be seen what the implication of today's vote will be in the Commission and Council.
The result could be that we have not served the interests of either Asia or Latin America.
Â Â  . The purpose of EU aid is to fight poverty.
The greatest proportion of the worldâs poor live in Asia.
It would therefore be a mistake to transfer EU funds from Asia to Latin America.
Furthermore, we believe that, as proposed by the Commission too, a single regulation for Asia and Latin America with a separate chapter for each of the two regions would be a sound solution.
This would help prevent bureaucratic red tape and duplication of effort.
Unfortunately, Parliament today voted in favour of two regulations, which will lead to a long drawn-out process involving the Council.
For these reasons, we have voted against Amendments 1 and 2, to the effect that the regulation should be split into two regulations; Amendments 18, 56 and 97 concerning the creation of a Solidarity Fund for Latin America; and Amendments 93 and 94 about transferring financial resources from Asia to Latin America.
Â Â  . We agree in principle with the idea of providing more support for young people, but this Commission proposal, showing a clearly federalist attitude, which is unacceptable, gives more or less sole priority to large organisations, many of them supranational, such as the European Youth Forum (EYF) and NGOs in the field of youth.
This is happening at a time when the involvement of young people is clearly geared towards youth movements on a national and local basis, which is totally ignored in the aid being granted.
The so-called EYF is a body that is nothing but a sounding board for the EU: it is far-removed from the European youth movement and completely ignored by the millions of young people throughout Europe.
The proposal that has been tabled clearly demonstrates the EUâs desire to confer legitimacy on its own youth policies, in which funding is only given to âyouth superstructuresâ in an artificial attempt to promote the non-existent participation of young people in EU policies and to contribute to stifling the critical spirit of young people and of the youth movement.
Consequently, even though the report makes some positive proposals, they are clearly inadequate given the serious problems facing young people today.
Â Â  . I fully share the rapporteurâs surprise at the fact that the European Commission only adopted this proposal at the end of May, thereby forcing the awarding of the first parts of the grants to the beneficiary organisations to be postponed.
The budgetary allocation proposed for youth organisations, as the rapporteur also emphasises, must be increased, particularly as a result of enlargement.
The demographic structure of developing countries and the need to stimulate the interest of their young people in European issues requires just such action.
Also to be praised is the suggestion to the Commission to ensure that the funding programmes which have been announced and embarked on are properly implemented and, specifically, to reduce the number of applications which are rejected for purely technical or formal reasons.
I supported this report and consequently voted in favour of it.
Â Â  . The Commission White Paper advocates the principle of public participation in defining and implementing policy, which is to be welcomed.
Nevertheless, the EUâs broad policy guidelines are being implemented without and sometimes in opposition to the will of the people, particularly of young people.
Although the financial assistance that is proposed for education and training bodies proves that there is a desire to contribute to developing our education systems, it has an elitist vision, which is far removed from the problems facing young people today and does not match the needs of each Member Stateâs educational systems.
The attempts to contribute financially to actions that will help to improve education and training conditions are, however, to be welcomed, especially if they take account of the seriousness of early school leaving in some countries, such as Portugal, ongoing illiteracy, the need to end child labour and to promote education and training.
Also to be welcomed are the proposals for a debate on these issues and for the programme to be monitored by the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to speak briefly on the explanations of vote on the Iivari report in order to thank Mrs Iivari and to declare that it was with much conviction that I voted in favour of this report, which has now clarified a number of points and created the conditions for the necessary means to be used, especially where the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages and Mercator are concerned; whilst, of course, the other issues in this report are close to my heart, this one is particularly so.
I believe that this House has, recently, been consistent about this, and that it is taking the lead, and I hope that the Commission, just as it has attempted to clarify these matters, will continue to do so by way of the languages action plan and will demonstrate in practice the further commitment that Parliament has demanded.
Â Â  . This proposal is intended to establish a multiannual programme (2004-2008) for awarding grants to promote cultural organisations, in order to establish a legal base for existing grants, which were previously included in the Commissionâs administrative expenditure.
Now, however, following changes to the Financial Regulation and rulings of the Court of Justice a legal base is required for these grants.
This line must be approved so as to ensure that existing cultural organisations receive Community funding, in particular the Cistercian Route line.
It is a pity that the budget has fixed a total of only EURÂ 30Â million for the entire period.
Lastly, I welcome the rejection of the proposal for an amendment attempting, unacceptably, to give Nazism and fascism equal standing.
Â Â  . As is to some extent implicit in the Oostlander report on the âAction Plan for the collection and analysis of Community Statistics in the field of migrationâ â on which we have also voted in this plenary session â what is here expressed quite explicitly is an initiative to create an instrument intended to achieve the communitarisation of a repressive migration policy, in line with the idea of âFortress Europeâ.
Just look, for example, at the political interpretation made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy: âThe creation of the immigration liaison officersâ network can be considered as a step in the direction towards the establishment of a common external service of the EU ...â
As a matter of fact, the stated aim for the activities of âimmigration liaison officersâ is, as the rapporteur points out, to combat illegal immigration â as the individuals responsible for implementing this policy in the countries in which this immigration originates, including the task of compiling ten categories of information that these officers will have to gather.
The rapporteur states that, as regards the aim of âcontributing to the management of legal immigrationâ, âthe form which this management might take is never spelled out elsewhere in the Regulationâ.
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  . I support the creation of a network of immigration liaison officers in order gradually to implement the coordinated and integrated management of our external borders.
As the Commission stated, close links already exist between immigration liaison officers, and the aim now is to ensure that this informal cooperation is placed within a framework that would strengthen it and increase its effectiveness.
In this area, as in others, I believe it would be positive and useful to adopt instruments for coordination, with the aim of addressing issues that affect some or all of the Member States.
This applies specifically to the enhanced â and by this I mean more precise and more efficient â exchange of information between liaison officers, to a better definition of the type of information exchanged, to the nature of the channels of communication used for the purpose and to the time limits to be observed when a request for information is received.
The proper training of such agents takes on particular importance, as the rapporteur points out, primarily because, according to the survey conducted by the Commission amongst liaison officers, this is a for the creation of a genuine network.
I have therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to talk about the way in which a temporary committee has finally been approved to investigate the effects and consequences of the unfortunate accident off the Galician coasts.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has made great efforts to prevent this committee from investigating everything that happened in the days preceding and during the unfortunate incident.
We finally have the committee and I hope it can shed light on all of this.
I would like to insist, however, on something: despite all the measures this Parliament has wished to implement in the European Union to prevent any similar accident, if today we had a case such as the we would run the same risk; because the was not entering or leaving any of the European Unionâs ports: it was simply passing through our Community waters, and we have not yet got to grips with this, that is to say, we have not taken any decision to control âfloating dustbinsâ â such as the â which sail through our waters on a daily basis, and this is a challenge which we still have before us and which we must deal with if we want to prevent unfortunate accidents such as the in the future.
Â Â  . Setting up a temporary European Parliament committee on improving safety at sea is the commitment that will enable us to overcome the hostility of our colleagues on the right to any initiative that would help to determine the causes of the major disaster that resulted from the shipwreck of the and to determine who was responsible.
I refer specifically to the possibility of setting up a committee of inquiry, as we proposed.
The creation of this temporary committee, which we welcome, is therefore the outcome of a long and persistent process of negotiation.
We want the results of its work to make a real contribution to improving safety at sea, achieving the aims for which it was created, which are:
- to study maritime disasters, in particular those of the and ;
- to analyse their social and economic consequences, with regard in particular to fisheries, industry and tourism, as well as the environment and health;
- to assess current international safety standards and the way in which these are applied;
- to help to ensure implementation of the recommendations that have already been adopted by the EP and to complement them if necessary.
In the EPâs recommendations that must be implemented, I would highlight, amongst others, withdrawing single-hulled petrol tankers, increasing resources for inspections, appropriate training for seamen, increasing resources for emergency pollution control measures and setting up safe havens, equipped with emergency apparatus.
Â Â  Basically, the June Movement believes that suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings should enjoy the greatest possible legal certainty.
The report deals, however, with a proposal from the Commission intended as a further step in the slow development of a European legal area.
The June Movement is naturally unable to support such an initiative.
The June Movement has therefore voted in favour of all the points and amendments aimed at introducing minimum standards for suspectsâ and defendantsâ rights, but has voted against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . This recommendation should be seen in the context of the debate about the Green Paper on procedural safeguards, in particular of a proposal for a framework decision on common minimum standards governing procedural law, in which the rapporteur highlights various rights that need to be safeguarded and advocates including a non-regression clause for standards already established in each countryâs legislation â bringing these into line with the highest levels.
It is regrettable and significant, however, that Parliament has not adopted the proposals for amendment tabled by my group insisting on the âentry into force of the framework decision on procedural safeguards being a precondition for the entry into force of the European arrest warrant and for the full implementation of the principle of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters in the European Unionâ.
As some of my fellow Members have stated, it is hard to understand how, by not making the framework decision on procedural safeguards a precondition for the entry into force of the âEuropean arrest warrantâ the rights to a defence will be safeguarded in this context.
I would recall that we fully rejected the âEuropean arrest warrantâ, which is about to enter into force.
Â Â  . I have abstained because Amendments 1 and 2 have been refused.
We must bear in mind that the new reform of the Spanish Penal Code, proposed by the PP and supported by the PSOE, opens up the possibility of holding incommunicado for 13 days.
Lawyers will not have enough time to prepare the cases, and for Basque political prisoners, an impediment will still remain to their being assisted from the time they are arrested, by lawyers they can trust.
Â Â  . Setting common standards for all Member States on respecting and protecting the individual rights of suspects, defendantsor those convicted in criminal proceedings, as the Commission proposed in its Green Paper, would be useful.
The laws must be understood and justice must be predictable and, as we know, an arbitrary approach will always result in unpredictable justice.
Furthermore, ignorance of the law is no excuse for not obeying it and does not benefit wrongdoers, who must know that criminal proceedings await them.
This takes on even greater importance when the individual in question is a foreign citizen.
I therefore agree with adopting common basic standards for procedural safeguards, which will increase the confidence both of the public in the judicial authorities and of the various agents of each Member State in other Statesâ judicial systems.
What has really turned me against this report â in its final wording â is that it promotes standards that far exceed the âminimumâ, for example, the register of translators, âcompensationâ in the event of insolvency or the presence of a psychiatrist.
In other words, I disagree with the recommendation for an extremely lengthy list of changes, which would ultimately lead to better safeguards for foreign citizens than for nationals.
Unfortunately, therefore, I could only vote against the report.
Â Â  . The opportunities provided by the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the contribution they make to changes in society are self-evident.
The aim of the information society is also effectively to provide information that is immediate and at prices that are feasible for all citizens.
Imbalances remain between men and women in the field of training and employment in the new ICT and I therefore voted in favour of the report.
- The European Commission and the Member States must draw up policies that will help to increase the participation of women in ICT.
- ICT must be integrated into education from the most elementary levels to higher education and vocational training.
- The Structural Funds must be used to provide courses for specific training in this field that will enable women to enter or re-enter the labour market.
These measures must also be implemented in the candidate countries and in the developing countries in order to increase womenâs opportunities in the labour market, and to ensure that information is exchanged in various areas.
Â Â  . The decision to draw up an own-initiative report on promoting womenâs participation in what is known as the ânew information societyâ was a good one.
I welcome in particular:
- its condemnation of the policy for the development of new ICT, which has largely been focused on economic aspects, and in which control is left mainly to the private sector, without any assessment of the social impact or proper incentives policies for equal rights of women and men.
As the report states, this approach leads to the inappropriate perception of open participation to all.
- its warning about the growing danger of social exclusion caused by the inability to use ICTs â so-called digital illiteracy â which mainly affects women.
- the need to pay particular attention to women, particularly older women, unemployed and low-income women, migrant women, women belonging to ethnic minorities and women with disabilities.
I do not agree, however, with the uncritical tone the report adopts towards the neoliberal policies advocated in the so-called âLisbon Strategyâ and in the âguidelines for employmentâ, consequently sweeping under the carpet the main causes of inequality and social injustice, of which women are the main victims.
Â Â  . I have voted in favour of this report for the sole reason that I believe the European Union must focus its policies on promoting everyoneâs access to the rights that legitimately pertain to them, in particular those relating to knowledge.
In this context, women â and also men, incidentally â must not suffer discrimination.
I regret the fact, however, that the text is unable to resist the temptation to indulge in feminist rhetoric and populism, in the guise of supposedly neutral language.
Because it is so keen to serve a radical agenda of ideas and language, it does not even realise how totally ridiculous it ends up being as a result of its pretentious commonplaces and plain stupidity.
Take the rapporteurâs irony, for example â when she explicitly states her desire to combat stereotypes â but then suggests overcoming the social exclusion of âgirls and women â immigrants, women with disabilities, the poor, single mothers and women farmersâ, women belonging to ethnic minorities and the elderly, by providing role-models of âsuccessful, independent and satisfied womenâ in the field of Information and Communication Technologies.
Can anyone take this seriously?
I also share the concern the report expresses at linguistic diversity on the Internet, and consider it to be a universal factor for social exclusion, although it needs to be said in this context that the situation is exactly the same for men as for women.
Â Â  Better coordination of the Member Statesâ taxes on cars may appear necessary, but it must not be the opportunity to put a European tax system in place.
Taxation of passenger cars cannot be divorced from a general tax system involving VAT, excise duties and income tax or corporation tax. It constitutes, moreover, an instrument of budget revenue and, as such, comes under the sovereignty of the Member States.
Nor am I happy with the environmental approach chosen by the European Commission.
Taxing passenger cars at European level, as proposed, seems inappropriate to me because, as a result of persistent lobbying, many sectors that cause a greater amount of pollution are not affected and because the structure of the automobile market is specific to each Member State.
There are, for example, small countries and large countries, flat countries and mountainous countries, countries with little in the way of road infrastructure and countries with long traditions of public transport. These are differences specific to each Member State, and they cannot be levelled out all at once through the harmonised taxation of passenger cars.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is important to eliminate the final obstacles to achieving the completely free movement of people, goods and services.
I have therefore no hesitation in agreeing with the proposal of the European Parliament to call on the Commission to come up with a concrete proposal for abolishing registration taxes.
The differences in the taxation of passenger cars in the EU are resulting in great differences in car prices, fragmentation of the passenger car market, double taxation and a whole heap of red tape.
People in the EU pay too much for their cars and are prevented from taking their cars with them when they move to a different country.
With this proposal, the EU has an opportunity to fundamentally improve the free movement of people. A chance we cannot afford to miss!
Â Â  . I supported MrsÂ Honeyballâs report because I believe it demonstrates the European Parliamentâs support for the Commission so that this institution can open up a real debate in the Council on the crucial harmonisation of tax in the automobile sector.
This proactive attitude is what the vast majority of European citizens want because they associate the excessive red tape and high administrative costs, and also the fragmentation of the car market, with the difficulties in consolidating the internal market.
I wish to add that the crucial environmental dimension, which is covered adequately in the reports, requires a new attitude to the taxation of cars.
Â Â  The Honeyball report tackles the differences in taxation of passenger cars between one European Union country and another, together with the resulting administrative and financial problems when people move to other countries.
It advocates increasing the Annual Circulation Tax rather than the Registration Tax and, above all, systematising the fight against pollution by applying principles of harmonised taxation.
We do not feel at home with this method.
Of course, we are disgusted by the absurd and socially unjust development of urban organisation and of the transport system and by its effects upon the environment.
It is, however, particularly hypocritical to cause wage earners who purchase cars, including the most ordinary ones, to bear the penalties for pollution.
Changing the transport system so that it is more efficient and less polluting means, in the first place, hugely extending public transport, drastically reducing the proportion of road transport by lorry in favour of less polluting and less dangerous forms of transport, and imposing stricter anti-pollution standards upon manufacturers.
The change to the transport system should be funded from profits and from direct taxes that increase progressively on the basis of income.
Because we reject the dissipation of responsibilities proposed by this report, we abstained from voting on the latter.
Â Â  . Although this report contains many positive ideas, I do have some difficulties with the excessively lengthy passages on environmental taxes.
The âpolluter paysâ principle is generally acknowledged, and has even been incorporated into the EC Treaty, but the introduction of an environmental tax on fuel is highly controversial and should be dealt with at national level, as closely as possible to the public, so that there can be proper public debate.
I can only advise against introducing it through the European bodies.
In many Member States, my own included, people have for the last few years heard about nothing other than tax increases planned or decided on by the EU.
Let me only remind you of the debates on the excise duty on alcoholic beverages, the plans to impose VAT on postal services, the proposed abolition of the lower VAT rates, the introduction â as part of the energy package â of minimal taxation on fuel, and so on. If introduced, the environmental tax that is being called for would have a catastrophic effect on the EUâs image, especially at a time when various Member States have announced referendums on the adoption of the European Constitution.
To introduce tax increases would be to play right into the hands of anti-EU populists and would be counter-productive in terms of our efforts to stimulate economic growth.
Â Â  . As the rapporteur quite rightly points out, as long ago as 1998, the European Parliament declared itself in favour of strengthening the internal market in this field and fought to end double taxation â specifically through the registration tax (RT) â in support of the European Commission proposal.
The Council has still not delivered an opinion.
The Council has not delivered an opinion despite the fact that most citizens agree on the need to establish more equitable conditions for car buying within the European Union.
Look at Portugal, for example, where one tax â the Car Tax, â makes the final selling price much higher than in other countries in the European Union.
The proposed links between levels of taxation and CO2 emissions are to be praised, as is the much-desired closer harmonisation of market conditions and the observation the report makes that competition between Member States in the field of taxation is reasonable and advantageous for strong economic development in the EU.
Furthermore, I must recall that this subject falls, objectively â see ArticleÂ 95(2) TEC â outside the EUâs sphere of action.
Since these ideas go considerably further than being simply recommendations, I decided to vote against the report.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.(1)
Â Â  I would like to get my thoughts on the discussion between Mr Salafranca and the rapporteur off my chest.
I think that the rapporteur has behaved courageously, and that it is a pity that it is so difficult to bring about change in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my astonishment at the opinion expressed by the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, because although it is true that everybody exercises their votes as they can, as they wish or as they see fit, this report for which she has been rapporteur has been the subject of much debate in our Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the vote today has been very clear; therefore, I believe her proposal that we must seek a solution to be inappropriate.
I believe that the solution has been expressed by this Parliament, through very clear votes, in favour of there being two separate regulations to eradicate poverty in Asia and in Latin America.
Â Â  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 6Â November 2003.
Â Â  Colleagues, as you will be aware, on Saturday 15 November 2003, 15 people died and 28 were injured after the collapse of a gangway on the new cruise ship , in the French shipyard of Saint-Nazaire.
On behalf of the European Parliament and in my own name, I express my most profound sympathy and solidarity with the families of the victims of this terrible and tragic accident.
It is also my sad duty today to express on behalf of this House our condemnation and grief at the two car bomb attacks on synagogues in Istanbul also on Saturday, which killed at least 23 innocent civilians and wounded hundreds more.
We send our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the Turkish Government.
We also commend the swift and vigorous action of the Turkish Government in seeking to apprehend those behind an indiscriminate, senseless and criminal anti-Semitic attack, one that struck at the place of traditional peaceful coexistence between different religions.
Intolerance and anti-Semitism in all their manifestations are abhorrent to the values that we represent.
I should also like to inform the House that the President would like, at the opening of tomorrow's sitting, to pay a personal tribute to the Italians who died in Iraq.
For the moment, I ask you to observe one minute's silence for the victims of the accident and the attack I have just mentioned.(1)
Â Â  The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 13 November 2003 has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:
I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group for a separate debate on its Oral Question on Eurostat to be taken immediately after the Commission statement on the legislative and work programme for 2004.
Â Â  Mr President, both my Group and I appreciate that when we are seeking parliamentary time it is advisable to be brief.
That being so, we recognise the Conference of Presidents' decision last week to refuse to have a separate debate.
We would therefore like to propose that this oral question be attached to the overall debate on the legislative and work programme for 2004, because over the weekend we heard that President Prodi will be raising the question of OLAF during that debate and we have a number of questions we would like to ask in that context, which are included in the substance of this oral question.
That is a reasonable way for the House to proceed.
It is what happens in normal practice.
We will not be asking for a separate debate, but we have questions we wish to raise when Mr Prodi is with us on Tuesday.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to speak against the proposal, but I shall do so in a special way.
I want to say to the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that it is puzzling, their having become interested in this proposal.
When we had the opportunity to tidy matters up, it was you who lifted the carpet and swept the dirt under it, so I think you are playing to the gallery in this case.
I therefore think we must say no.
The members of the PPE-DE Group are deeply untrustworthy in this matter.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, we members of the Communist Party of Greece also observed a minute's silence for the Italian soldiers and policemen killed in Iraq recently and for the victims of the bombings in Istanbul.
We deeply regret the deaths of so many young people and we send our condolences to their families.
We regret even more that these young people lost their lives serving an occupation â I refer to Iraq â as the result of the unprovoked, illegal, barbaric invasion by the American and English imperialists, with thousands of victims and massive destruction.
Fortunately, the just resistance of the repressed Iraqi people is developing against this occupation.
The Italian Government alone, which has hastened to help the invaders by taking part in the occupation, is solely responsible for the unjust and inglorious loss of the Italian soldiers and policemen and it must answer to the innocent victims' families.
At the same time, we cannot fail to observe that the European Parliament has not demonstrated the same sensitivity to the thousands of Iraqis who have died as victims of this barbaric invasion or to the victims of the imperialist interventions in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan or to the victims of Sharon's barbarity in Palestine.
We consider that the only real way of honouring the dead is to immediately withdraw the occupying forces from Iraq and to prevent any other military intervention in the internal affairs of states in order to stop further bloodshed and this crime against humanity.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like you to ask Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, to raise with the Commission the situation regarding Mrs Radia Nasrawi, who has just completed five weeks on hunger strike in protest at the intolerable human rights situation in Tunisia.
She is one of the leading human rights activists in that country.
Her life has been made unbearable by the activities of the Tunisian authorities, who oppose her human rights work.
This situation is one which has been repeated many times over in relation to other human rights activists.
I would particularly like the Commission to ensure that the European Union representative in Tunisia makes direct contact with the Tunisian authorities in writing, insisting that the human rights of Mrs Radia Nasrawi and others in Tunisia be respected.
The only European Union embassies to have taken a stand on this issue are those of the Netherlands and Finland.
It is quite disgraceful that the European Union itself has not made its views known on this matter at this critical juncture for Mrs Radia Nasrawi.
Â Â  Mr President, we have all been able to witness the fact that about a week ago, the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, sounded the starting shot for the Italian election campaign.
Mr Prodi has issued a political manifesto, in which he has outlined the strategy and necessities that the Left needs to embrace in order to secure an election victory in Italy.
We take the view that the President of the Commission must maintain a certain political neutrality, that he must be above party-political wrangling.
It is now clear that he no longer does that.
The Eurostat scandal would have been a good opportunity for Mr Prodi to take his political responsibility and to step aside.
The publication of this political manifesto is going too far.
He should shoulder his responsibility: either remain President of the European Commission and concentrate fully on that task, or else conduct a political campaign in Italy.
Â Â  Mr President, drugs are, of course, a big problem in Thailand, and it is entirely understandable that the Thai Government, being also under pressure from the international community and from the United States, should wage war on drug smuggling.
This war on drugs, however, also has a flip side. During my visit to Dutch prisoners there last week, including Machiel Kuyt, I saw the abject conditions under which she, along with other Europeans, is being held, and how, consequently, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Thailand has been party since 1997, is being violated.
Extremely long detentions due to a shortage of judges and overfull prisons illustrate this point.
Two things need to happen in order for this situation to change.
First of all, in the framework of the country strategy paper on Thailand dating back to May 2002, the European Union should turn its attention to legal aid, so that the seriously overtaxed legal system is relieved and the rights of the suspects are better respected.
Secondly, the Union should urge its Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with Thailand, which enables the transfer of prisoners.
These agreements already exist with a number of countries, such as Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, and certainly also with my own country, the Netherlands; other countries should also conclude them, and Thailand is very much in favour of them doing so.
Â Â  Mr President, over the past few weeks, I have received various complaints from Spanish and Dutch meat transporters who apparently have been threatened by Breton farmers and attacked when delivering their products.
Supermarkets too are being threatened if they want to buy meat from Spain and the Netherlands, and the French Government is refusing to take action.
Although it is the insurers that compensate the direct damage, the damage incurred in the long term, because the meat is no longer bought for fear of threats from a few gangs of thuggish Breton farmers, is a thorn in my side.
It is also in contravention of the internal market and the free movement of goods.
I therefore ask you to urge the Commission and the French Government to put a stop to this as soon as possible, because if it is not, French wine and champagne may well similarly be rejected in other European countries.
This would not benefit the internal market and would even spoil our Christmas to some extent.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to return, albeit briefly, to the massacres which have scourged Europe, and not just Europe, in the past week.
I feel it is right that we should express our fierce condemnation of terrorism and specifically of these incidents.
I would like to remember, in particular, the 19 Italian victims of the massacres in Nasiriya.
It is important that the President of Parliament expresses our sympathy for the victims and our condolences to their families tomorrow, but I feel that it is also appropriate to thank all the armed forces of all the European countries who are currently on peace missions throughout the world.
Lastly, I hope that Parliament will make a firm commitment to implementing increasingly effective measures to combat terrorism, for the message which must be sent out by the European Parliament is that none of the European peoples are going to let themselves be intimidated by these cowardly attacks.
Â Â  Mr President, Secretary of State Colin Powell and President George Bush are both in Europe this week: Colin Powell to meet with EU Foreign Ministers and President Bush on a state visit to Britain.
I hope that the Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister Blair will impress on their guests the need for transatlantic understanding to flow both ways.
Europeans are rightly alarmed at the unilateralist policies of the US administration, its readiness to contemplate pre-emptive strikes and its refusal to internationalise the occupation of Iraq.
Europeans are deeply unhappy at the prospect of military commissions imposing the death penalty or unlimited detention for the Guantanamo Bay detainees, and at the way the US is trying to sabotage the International Criminal Court.
These are some of the reasons for the demonstrations against President Bush.
They must be peaceful protests, and as such I personally intend to join them.
I have just returned from Washington as an ad hoc member of the US delegation.
Our hosts were gracious and hospitable, we had useful discussions and we have a huge amount in common.
However, as well as us understanding their position, the Americans need to understand our objections, and our Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister must convey these objections this week.
Â Â  Mr President, you have already quite properly expressed the sympathy of this House to the Turkish Government and to the families of those killed and injured in the callous and indiscriminate terrorist attacks that took place in Istanbul on Saturday.
These attacks on innocent civilians remind us all of the grave security threat that terrorism poses.
We should remember that the Neve Shalom Synagogue was the subject of a horrific attack 17 years ago.
The democracies must work closely together to combat terrorism in whatever form it takes and whatever excuses are used by the perpetrators.
We must not allow any difference in other areas of policy to undermine our unambiguous solidarity.
With reference to the previous speaker's remarks, we should remember that the United States is carrying enormous burdens on behalf of all of us and we should stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in these difficult times.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope I will be forgiven for moving from matters of life and death to more commercial matters.
This House, in its role as legislator, is deeply concerned about intellectual property and the need to protect holders' rights in the interests of consumers and of fair play.
It is all the more alarming if the holders of the rights themselves abuse the rights to the disadvantage of consumers.
I regret to say that this is what is being done now in Scotland by Diageo, the multinational spirit drinks producer, which produces Cardhu whisky.
The supply of Cardhu single malt has run low.
However, now Diageo is producing something called Cardhu pure malt whisky.
Not all Members of this House may be aware of it, but there is a very big difference between pure malt whisky â which is a blend of various malts â and single malt, which comes from a single malt distillery.
It is vital to the health of this Scottish and European industry that consumer trust is maintained and that sharp practice by producers is eliminated as quickly as possible.
This industry has often sought and obtained the support of the European authorities.
We should insist that they themselves play the game.
Mr President, please write to the chief executive and get Diageo to stop this!
Â Â  Mr President, since the Thessaloniki Summit, five months ago, several young Europeans have been detained in Greek jails.
Specifically, there are two twenty-year-old Spaniards, Carlos MartÃ­n MartÃ­nez and Fernando PÃ©rez Borraiz, who are facing extraordinary accusations. These are young people who were there taking part in a demonstration under the slogan, âAnother world is possibleâ.
I believe we must concern ourselves with their plight.
They have begun a hunger strike and they are facing possible death.
I would ask the Presidency to call on both the Greek Government and the other institutions to adopt measures in relation to this problem.
Â Â  I should like to point out that I shall not reply to each contribution individually.
They will all be passed on to the President of Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, on 8Â November 2003 I was in The Hague participating in a demonstration in favour of the release of Slobodan Milosevic.
I am not going to speak about Mr Milosevic now, since I have done so on a number of occasions in the past.
I should like instead to refer to the fact that the demonstrators in The Hague, most of them Serb immigrants, were not allowed to write slogans in their own language.
Speaking to the police I found out that there is a general rule against slogans written in languages that the police do not understand.
This is apparently so that the police can control their content.
It is obvious that the Netherlands, so tolerant on many things as we all know, will not tolerate uncensored political expression.
Another incident occurred last Saturday at the airport in Paris when I was going through a security check on my way to Athens.
The staff insisted that I take off my jacket, although I had removed from it all metal objects and had gone through the metal detector.
Upon my refusal, the police were called and the next minute MrÂ 466294 and Mr 485684 â they would not give me their names â appeared and tried to convince me that this was the rule and nobody was supposed to contest it.
Behind this unacceptable behaviour I see a clear effort to terrorise people by having them obey stupid orders.
I also see the presumption of guilt of terrorism for any person going through a security check.
Moreover, if a Member of the European Parliament can be subjected to such embarrassing and humiliating treatment, I wonder what would happen to others, in particular those whose complexion is a bit darker than average.
These two incidents show signs of a police state being gradually built up in the European Union, in line with the wish of the ruling class to exercise full control upon their subjects.
I look forward to your reactions, Mr President.
Â Â  Mr President, many Members will be aware that there are several hundred Eritrean demonstrators outside our building this evening.
They are here because of their concern that the Algiers Agreement â which was a settlement of the boundaries between Ethiopia and Eritrea â has not been agreed by Ethiopia.
On behalf of Mr Cox, the President of Parliament, I have received a petition signed by 22 000 Eritreans living in the European Union and in Norway.
Both countries are to be urged to accept the provisions of the Algiers Agreement, which was based upon the decision of the Boundary Commission.
Ethiopia is reluctant to agree to that decision at this time.
Mr President, would you please ensure that a letter is written to the Ethiopian Government to urge it to respect that decision, in order to restore peace between the two countries after what has been a bloody and terrible war.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to bring to the House's attention the situation concerning a local councillor in Lancaster in the UK, who made public a decision made in secret by the cabinet of the City Council to suspend the local taxation owed to it by the local nuclear power station owned by British Energy.
The Commission has indicated that this taxation relief could amount to the unlawful granting of state aid.
In response to the publication of this information, this particular councillor, Councillor Dowding, has now been suspended for three months as a penalty for making public allegedly confidential information.
Depriving the electorate of their only representation on the local council, and making an example of somebody who has brought to the public's attention an act which is not in the best interests either of that council or the European Union, is hardly an incentive to others to raise such issues.
As the House is committed to transparency and financial probity, I am sure it will join with me in regretting the action of the Standards Committee.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to return to what our fellow Member said regarding MrÂ Prodiâs untimely remarks of a few days ago.
I should like, through you, to ask our President, Mr Cox, what action he intends to take to remind the President of the Commission that positioning himself as leader of the Italian Left at a time when his own country holds the presidency of the European Union, and at a time when Italy is engaged in a bloody ordeal in Iraq, is inelegant to say the least.
Taking such a stance is in any case contrary to the spirit of the rules governing the European institution in question and contrary to the most basic of political ethics.
I would request, MrÂ President, that you pass on this comment to Mr Cox.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, approximately two years ago, information was circulating to the effect that Roma women were being sterilised against their will in Eastern Europe, especially in Slovakia.
On 17Â October 2003, MrÂ Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of Europeâs Commissioner for Human Rights, published a recommendation on âCertain aspects of law and practice relating to sterilisation of women in the Slovak Republicâ.
The recommendation states that there has been no organised policy in this area. It has, however, happened that women have been sterilised against their will.
In March 2002, I put a question about this to the Commission, which promised to follow up the matter and enquire of Slovakia whether proof had been found of such compulsory sterilisation really having taken place.
MrÂ Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Council of Europeâs Commissioner for Human Rights, has now published this evidence, and I would ask the Commissioner to fulfil its promise.
We cannot have an EU in which what is most fundamental is not respected: a personâs right to his or her own life.
I hope that everyone else who, later in the debate, discusses issues of life and death will also consider this aspect.
We cannot accept such things in a European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposed that the question of serious democratic violations during the recent elections in Albania be included in this week's topical and urgent debate.
The purpose of this proposal was to send a suitable message to the Albanian authorities and prevent any further attempt to undermine the democratic morale of the citizens and candidates of this country.
Unfortunately, this proposal was rejected by all the political groups and, again unfortunately, it was borne out by the sad events during yesterday's repeat elections in Albania, which saw very serious cases of intimidation, bombing attempts and so on, against citizens and candidates.
I trust that the European Union will draw the necessary conclusions from this unacceptable situation, which reveals attitudes and conducts which are absolutely foreign to the European perception of democratic values and process.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to join with you in condemning these atrocious attacks on the Jewish synagogues in Istanbul.
As we all know, Turkey is a country that is proud of the fact that, when the Jews were being persecuted by the terrible pogroms in Europe in the Middle Ages, it gave them refuge.
It is right to be proud of this part of its history.
When these terrible attacks took place, the Turkish president happened to be out of the country on an official visit to support an illegal regime which Turkey and the Turkish armed forces have created and are obstinately maintaining in northern Cyprus, contrary to the directives of the international community.
This coincidence alone speaks volumes and I hope that it will enlighten Mr Erdogan and that he will take Turkey, as I am sure he wants to, off the road of illegality and tyranny which only harbours tragedy for Turkey itself and the rest of the world.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to revert to a subject raised during the previous session in connection with the fact that the Pakistani authorities are still holding the Greek seamen from the hostage.
The accident happened in July 2003, 4-5 months ago, while the was being piloted by a Pakistani pilot in the port of Karachi.
The procedure to restore the environment and pump out what oil could be pumped out then commenced.
On 17 August, once the shipwreck had already been cut in two, a team from Greece headed by the shipbuilder, Mr Pappas, went to Pakistan in order to clean up the area.
As we speak, both the ship's crew and those who went to clean up the area are being held hostage by Pakistan without charges and, apart from the fact that they have not released them, this is preventing the companies which have undertaken the clean-up operation from going there, because they are frightened that perhaps they too will end up as hostages.
In all events, the ship was insured.
The Pakistani Government may have differences with the insurance company. However, under no circumstances can the seamen, especially those who arrived well after the event in order to help clean up the environment, be held as hostages as a negotiating element between the Pakistani authorities and the insurance company.
I therefore call on Parliament to do what it can to help free these hostages.
Â Â  Mr President, I represent the south-east region of England and am the only Member to live in the county of Hampshire, very close to the port of Southampton, the home port of the new , which will be the greatest liner in the world.
This liner, built in France, will sail from England, showing there is some life left in the .
I know that the people of Southampton, and the port workers of that city, would wish to associate themselves with the condolences expressed to the families of the people killed and to those injured in the awful accident at Saint-Nazaire.
Â Â  Mr President, the speech by the Greek Communist Member who condemned the USA as an imperialist occupier of Iraq is a little rich from a party which in its day supported the USSR's invasion and crushing of the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the Czechoslovak 'Prague Spring' in 1968 and the Afghan invasion in 1979.
The USSR would never have left these countries if it had not been forced to do so by the economic collapse of the Communist system.
Unlike Baroness Ludford, I welcome tomorrow's state visit by President Bush to the United Kingdom, and his commitment to hand over power to a democratically elected Iraqi Government by the end of next year.
I salute the courage of all the brave coalition forces in Iraq who are fighting for law and order and freedom and justice in that country, and against international Islamic terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall not comment on what the previous speaker said; I shall merely say that it is inconceivable to me that such reasoning should be heard in this House.
I should like to ask you to allow me to inform the House about a number of serious infringements which I noticed during my recent visit to Estonia and Lithuania.
In Estonia, as in Latvia, although half the population is Russian or Russian-speaking, the Russian language is not recognised as an official language.
Public-sector services, courts and laws are all in a language of which they have an inadequate command.
In addition, they are denied the nationality of the country in which they and their fathers were born.
They are made to sit humiliating and highly specialised examinations in language, the constitution and history, which very few are able to pass.
The universities and schools are closed to Russian.
In all three Baltic States, the communist parties are banned and their cadres persecuted.
In Lithuania, the leaders of the Communist Party of Lithuania, Mikolas Burakevicius and Koulalis, have been in prison for ten years on prefabricated charges under a law passed long after they were arrested.
This and much more goes on in the Baltic and in other former socialist accession countries, despite assurances to the contrary by Mr Verheugen, who has repeatedly expressed his support for these flagrant violations.
I should like to draw your attention to a letter containing specific facts âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, I was extremely shocked at the fact that the behaviour of the police in The Hague was likened to that in a police state, only because they insisted on the placards that were being carried during a demonstration being intelligible to the public for whom the demonstration was intended.
This is extremely odd.
It is, in the first place, all very well for people to travel to The Hague especially to demonstrate in favour of a totalitarian dictator, but then, on top of that, they refuse to write the placards in a language that is intelligible to Dutch people.
What is the reason for that?
It is very obvious.
If they are written in a non-intelligible language, they may contain all kinds of racist messages.
If they are accepted after all, then the next thing is, the newspapers carry photographs that give the impression that the Dutch police is standing by while these awful things are being written.
It is therefore entirely logical that a request is made beforehand to draft the messages in an intelligible language so that the Dutch police can ensure that the placards themselves do not infringe the law.
If that is seen to be a police state, then that is taking matters very far indeed and is clearly indicative of what those who are behind Milosevic think a police state is like.
Â Â  Mr President, on the subject of commercial arrangements between Ryanair and the airport of Charleroi in Belgium, may I remind the European Commission that it tolerated airline monopolies and exorbitant prices for air travel in Europe for years. Ryanair has helped to reverse air price arrangements in Europe; it has secured favourable deals from private airports.
Surely in this era of competition we should permit public airports to compete with private airports for the generation of air travel business, because at the end of the day it will mean cheaper air prices for consumers.
This in turn will send out a positive message from the European Union that it is actually supporting measures which promote air travel at a competitive price and help the consumers of Europe.
Before Ryanair started to fly to Charleroi Airport it was a deserted field and now Ryanair flies 2 million people in and out, to the satisfaction of consumers using this invaluable air link.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the European Year of People with Disabilities (2003).
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity to report to you on what has been achieved during the European Year of People with Disabilities and how it is to be followed up, given that it is only six weeks until the end of the year.
We must bear in mind that policies relating to people with disabilities are national policies. What we were trying to do in 2003 was to find all the methods, tools and gateways which we can use to give European added value to national policies.
So far, the Year has achieved significant results to do with raising awareness about the rights of people with disabilities.
We have had thousands of events in all the Member States at national, regional and local level, debates in parliament, fora and exchanges of best practices between the Member States, while of course the non-governmental organisations and the Disabled People's Movement have also made a real contribution to an explosion of events and to passing on the message about the rights of people with disabilities.
The European Parliament supported the Year without reservation right from the start.
On 3 November 2003, the first reading about lifelong learning facilities was organised with young people with disabilities and a few days ago, on 10 and 11 November, the European Parliament of People with Disabilities sat and passed a resolution on the subject.
Of course, we should emphasise that the Year marks the start of a European procedure and that all the efforts and planning do not come to an end at the end of the year.
It is especially important that we use the momentum created and we must say that today, in every country, initiatives and innovative action are being taken, which was not the case in the past, and we also have important, exceptionally advanced legislation in certain countries.
On 30 October, the Commission issued a communication about the follow-up needed to this Year.
There are three basic objectives:
The first is to achieve the adoption and full application of the directive on equal treatment of the disabled in employment and at work.
The second is the successful incorporation of issues relating to people with disabilities in all policies.
This relates to our agreement on mainstreaming, so that this policy is not just a matter for the ministries of social affairs or the ministries of health or the ministries of employment, but is a horizontal policy which concerns all the ministries in each country and all portfolios at the Commission.
The third is improving access for all people with disabilities.
As far as the first issue of the application of the directive is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that, in the year 2000, an anti-discrimination directive was adopted in record time, which was unprecedented in the European Union, but of course we have to say that its promotion by the Member States did not proceed at the rate we expected.
Today, a large number of countries have still not adopted the draft directive on equal treatment for people subject to discrimination.
The deadline expires at the end of December and, basically, only two countries have adopted the directive.
However, we have to go beyond adoption to implementation, where important changes will be needed to the rules which apply today in certain Member States.
This will have an impact on employers, in both the public and private sectors, and on the working practices applied to people with disabilities, because the directive, which concerns reasonable adaptations, will have to be applied to the letter.
In other words, the workplace will have to be adapted to the needs of people with disabilities.
The Commission will perform its duty in full as guardian of the Treaty, as regards the adoption of the directive at the correct moment in time, its proper transposition â not in the wrong way and not without there being specific references to the European text â and of course its implementation.
The communication, as I said earlier, also focussed on the issue of horizontal policies relating to people with disabilities, in other words incorporation into all individual policies.
We already have examples at European level, with an important step in the field of transport and in the field of electronic communications, for which Commissioners de Palacio and Liikanen are responsible.
The incorporation of these issues into all the relevant policies must focus mainly on access issues, access to goods, services and buildings, and must be linked to the principle of 'design for all' expressed in the Commission communication which immediately preceded this communication.
The communication introduces a multiannual, rolling action plan.
The first priority is employment, which is also the most important factor for the social integration of people with disabilities.
I would say that our philosophy is essentially encapsulated in the slogan that people with disabilities must have the right to work and not to benefits.
Consequently, the first stage in the application of the action plan, which is to be developed between 2004 and 2005, will concentrate on putting the necessary conditions in place for promoting the employment of people with disabilities.
Today we calculate that there are 3 million people with disabilities in Europe who could be integrated into the labour market.
There is an even bigger number who, with special policies, with investment in these people and with skills which matched their capabilities, could be integrated into the labour market.
Our policy for the workplace will focus on four priorities: access to and staying in employment, lifelong learning, new technologies â which we consider to be one of the most crucial elements â because, with innovation and research, a series of new tools really can give people with all sorts of disabilities the power to deal with their disabilities.
At the same time, however, these tools must be cheap and accessible to everyone.
Today, the European market is extremely difficult for these people.
Every country has its own specifications to a large degree, each social system is linked to its own undertakings.
This results in the same tools being cheap in one country and expensive in another.
Hence, this field of new technologies and access for people with disabilities to the technologies in question at European level is one of the challenges and, finally, the fourth priority is access to public buildings.
As one way of supporting the successful incorporation of these issues in policies, the Commission is proposing the publication of a biennial report on developments in each Member State, focussing each time on planning and new choices of priorities.
We think that this report, the first of which will be published in 2005, will be an important tool for exerting pressure on the Member States, who will have to announce developments at institutional level and at implementation level, which we shall publish every two years.
Finally, the Commission is proposing to further strengthen the contribution of all the interested parties and of the basic protagonists in the policy-making dialogue, so that we have major and permanent changes in the economy and society as a whole.
I should like to express my satisfaction about the facility being given to carry out a study, as called for by Parliament, on the situation of people with disabilities living in institutions, who make up another large category of our fellow citizens, with special problems of another sort.
Of course, this type of problem has a very large dimension in the candidate countries.
Mr President, the expectations of the Year were great.
I believe that we have significant results, especially if we think â as I stressed in my introduction â that these policies are, to a large extent, almost purely national policies.
I believe, however, that with all this activation during the Year in 2003, the issue of people with disabilities became a top priority on the political agenda both of the Member States and of the European Union itself.
Most importantly, however, it brought the policy of the Disabled People's Movement itself to the forefront, by putting into practice the slogan 'Nothing about us without us', meaning they must be involved at all planning and decision-making levels.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now approaching the end of the European Year of People with Disabilities, which is to be concluded in Rome on 5Â December 2003 under the Italian Presidency, and it was the President-in-Office of the European Union himself, who, in his speech at the start of his six-month term of office, made what I consider to be a powerful, historic gesture where social policies relating to people with disabilities are concerned.
He explicitly stated that the Union Presidency would take steps to lay the foundations for legislative measures to combat discrimination, producing, in practice, a directive protecting the independence and equal rights of millions of people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life in the new Europe, giving them genuine hope for the future.
However, to date, the Commission has neither provided a timetable for a future horizontal directive on the rights of people with disabilities, covering not just work but all aspects of life too, nor even given specific undertakings to integrate the rights of people with disabilities into policy, as confirmed in the recent communication, which would seem, rather, to be no more than the announcement of good intentions.
Indeed, it is not clear how the objective of boosting equal opportunities is to be achieved if such opportunities are only available in certain aspects of life such as work.
Here are some examples: with the directive on employment, the Commissionâs aim is to achieve full employment of people with disabilities, which would be a step towards eliminating discrimination.
This is all well and good, but how is a person to penetrate the labour market nowadays and work towards getting a worthwhile, high-quality job if people with disabilities are not provided with adequate teaching, education and training, for instance?
Integration starts early on, as you can see; indeed, it has to start at school.
People with disabilities are not divided into sectors or compartments of inactivity, they are girls and boys, men and women who are entitled to full integration, not integration in some areas: thousands of children with disabilities in Europe still live in institutes rather than with their families, for example.
The coordination method could come to our aid here too, but there is too little mention of it in the communication.
Lastly, I would say that the European Year is certainly closing with quite a positive result as regards the goals set of raising awareness of disability issues.
I feel that what was lacking was a specific, effective measure from the Commission, which did not act diligently on the strong, firm pressure from Parliament or the calls from the Council Presidency.
I will end by calling on President Prodi, if Mrs Diamantopoulou will relay the message, to be, perhaps, a little more active and more diligent, even though the Commission is at the end of its term of office, as regards an issue, the issue of disability, which is of such great importance in human, social and cultural terms.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that 2003 is drawing to a close and with it the European Year of People with Disabilities.
It is the perfect time to take stock of the situation, but also to reflect on the future of Community policy in this field.
The achievements of this year should be welcomed, Commissioner; it has been a unique opportunity, as you hoped it would be, to promote the rights of people with disabilities and to take into account their legitimate claim to play a full part in social, economic and political life.
The momentum created by this year, with thousands of varied events on offer at national, regional and local level, is considerable, and we are grateful to you.
Today, however, we need to capitalise on this momentum and use this experience as a launching pad for new measures, both at the level of the Member States and at Community level.
The communication that you are tabling does, I believe, properly reflect what is at stake here.
I welcome this, but think that it also needs to be said, as one of my fellow Members already has done, that, given the reticence of Member States, greater affirmation of political will is still needed in this field.
The lack of enthusiasm shown by Member States to transpose the directive on equal treatment in employment, for example, should be widely denounced, and compels us to do even more.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists has a clear position in this regard, and my colleagues and I are convinced that difficulties related to disability should be addressed across the board in an integrated way, taking as our model existing legislation on equal opportunities between men and women.
We were very keen to improve a number of legislative texts.
You mentioned transport.
I should like to say that where corporate social responsibility is concerned, companiesâ policies on disability should be one of the criteria for assessing that responsibility and the quality of their contribution to society.
At the same time, the European Parliament of Disabled People, which met last week, regretted the fact that a specific European directive on disability would not be concluded during this important year.
Admittedly, the gamble taken on the employment issue is absolutely fundamental â no one can dispute that â but we want to believe, Commissioner, that this is just one step towards implementing Community legislation that needs to be even more ambitious.
Where disability is concerned, perhaps more than in other areas, I think it is appropriate to finish by sharing with you a personal conviction.
These Community legislative measures are essential, and we recognise this, given the impetus that they should unleash, but we also know that it is at national, regional and local level that a whole series of coordinated policies need to be brought on stream, policies that must be accommodated within civil society by industry, the social partners and â let us not forget, where school-related issues are concerned â teachers.
In conclusion, allow me to say, Commissioner, MrÂ President, that where rights are concerned and where the dignity of those who today live with a disability is concerned, we cannot afford to rely solely on Member Statesâ goodwill.
We need to come up with greater incentives, as I hope you are doing in the communication.
We are counting on your multiannual report, Commissioner, precisely to exert pressure on those Member States that are not moving in quite the direction that we are recommending.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that the Commission has produced the action plan on lifelong learning, new technologies, access to the built environment and so on, but we need to go much further.
As rapporteur for the European Year of People with Disabilities, all of us set out with very high hopes for this year.
We wanted to see positive outcomes and indeed that is what I wrote in my report.
We need to mainstream disabled peoples' rights, get away from the medical model of disability once and for all and move to the social or rights-based model of disability.
We also need to highlight the achievements of disabled people.
Some of those things have been done, but I did not want this just to be a pat on the back for the Member States for having held conferences in major cities, or for them to say simply 'how wonderful we are to have had a European Year of People with Disabilities'.
We must make sure that disabled people really are at the top of the political agenda and that means that the employment directive must be fully implemented.
I would like to know which countries have not implemented the employment directive, which countries have not put into place anything to start to implement that directive and what sanctions the Commission is going to take against those countries to make sure they implement it.
Furthermore, we need, as Mr Mantovani and Mrs Gillig said, a specific disability directive.
If we do not get that specific directive, I, along with a lot of disabled peoples' organisations, feel that the European Year of People with Disabilities will have been a failure.
I am sorry to have to say that because we have made some progress, but without the commitment to a disability directive we have not gone far enough.
Â Â  Mr President, it is true that some important initiatives for debate have been launched during the European Year of People with Disabilities, such as the Congress on Autism, held this weekend in Lisbon, and the European Parliament of Disabled People, which took place in Brussels last week.
Everyone had hoped for much more, however, at both Community and national level, particularly in my country â Portugal â which suffers from serious social problems, the highest rate of poverty in the European Union, many forms of discrimination and has seen cuts in fundamental public investment in areas such as education and health.
These factors have hit people with disabilities particularly hard, in the name of complying with the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact.
Regrettably, we are reaching the end of this European Year without having made any progress on a disability policy and without issues relating to discrimination and the human rights of these individuals being made the top priority of the various Community policies.
Until this is done, there can be no real social inclusion.
I must point out that the report I drafted on the scoreboard on implementing the Social Policy Agenda, which Parliament adopted in September, focused on the need to present a proposal during this Year of People with Disabilities for a directive based on ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty to combat discrimination on grounds of disability.
Regrettably, this did not happen.
In the documents adopted by the European Parliament of Disabled People last week, priority was also given to the call for this new directive to prevent the raising of further obstacles and to stipulate that the existing obstacles faced by people with disabilities must be eliminated throughout the European Union.
This should really happen in the near future.
The directive on equal treatment in the field of employment and occupation should also be transposed, establishing a broad definition of disability and laying down strict and effective penalties to be applied if the law is broken.
We hope that this year will spark effective policies in this field of supporting people with disabilities and bring recognition of their rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Year of People with Disabilities is approaching its end and it is time to examine the results.
What do we see?
Can a year really make any difference?
Have we been able to achieve anything concrete that could help us to have an impact on the day-to-day existence and quality of life of disabled people?
I would hope after this year some permanent changes will remain in the way at least some disabled people cope in their everyday life.
A good example would be the use of assistance dogs throughout the Union, which, along with technical tools and information technology, mean greater scope socially, educationally, and professionally for people with visual, aural and motion disabilities.
I will take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her genuine interest and encouragement regarding this issue, which I hope will continue to make progress and extend throughout the new Member States too, possibly with the aid of EU funding.
There is nevertheless the question of how to incorporate accessibility, non-discrimination, and full citizensâ rights for people with disabilities in major policy lines at all levels.
Right now too we are introducing more major areas of policy for the future.
I am involved in adapting a proposal for a directive on public procurement and we are now trying to settle two important issues for people with disabilities and the enforcement of their citizensâ rights.
To what extent can we take the special needs of disabled people into account in planning the built environment and its other physical aspects and developing transport and other services?
Another essential question that remains unanswered is the criteria for production methods.
In my opinion, it is also mainly a matter of democracy.
These two directives involve taking important decisions on just how great the power of decision of the local authorities should be.
Furthermore, there is an implied danger under the new draft constitution that healthcare and other social services would be opened up to competition.
How then would the special needs of people with disabilities be affected?
Â Â  Mr President, last week, we had an excellent Parliament for the Disabled.
I would, in fact, like all of us, as much as possible, to try to act on the recommendations that this Parliament made.
Despite the fact that a large proportion of the policy for the disabled â particularly its medical component â is national policy, it is, however, the case that employment policy, social exclusion policy and internal market policy are of key importance to people with disabilities.
I therefore hope that the Commission will give this due consideration.
The main reason why we are here today is, of course, as various speakers have already mentioned, this specific directive.
I believe that we should really go ahead and adopt it.
Mr President, there is something I fail to understand.
The Commission has, after all, always referred to the fact that this directive would be too controversial at this point in time, but, Commissioner, you yourself adopted a draft directive two weeks ago that is much more controversial than what we have here.
By so doing, you have, in effect, totally undermined your own argument.
If you are prepared to table very controversial directives in another field, then I applaud this, for I am always pleased when the Commission is brave.
However, you should at least commission the studies so that it is possible to submit this proposal as soon as possible.
That is, after all, what we have asked for.
Finally, as you indeed already indicated, we will need to give a great deal of attention to the new Member States.
I think that it will be some time yet before we know precisely how policy is conducted over there.
I found out this week that certain categories of people with disabilities in some countries are not even entitled to identity cards.
A great deal still needs to be done there, but this also applies to the current European Union, because people with disabilities are still too much the invisible citizens whom we forget all too easily.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must, no doubt, all concede that we were somewhat surprised by how very successful this year was.
I am myself always sceptical when âEuropean Yearsâ devoted to social policy objectives are declared, and, at the end of them one cannot actually point to anything having been achieved.
Such was not the case with this one.
This may be because this âYearâ was something special, above all in that it promised much, and because the idea for it was put to politicians by non-governmental organisations and associations of handicapped persons.
There were discussions of a wide variety of topics, in which disabled people themselves discussed national and European approaches.
Rather than having discussions about disabled people, we discussed things with them.
In my own country, too, a debate has got under way, which has as its objective, not only legislative measures but also, of course, the raising of public awareness.
We want unrestricted participation, no longer to be cared for outside society in the way we once were.
We want full equality rather than the former demeaning sympathy, and, instead of being patronised by well-meaning people, we want the right to autonomy.
For that, of course, we need legislative measures.
I might add that we in this House agreed that this Year should not remain a one-off, a concern that the Commissionâs new action plan takes up.
I think the Commission is still being a bit too hesitant as regards the timescale, as we should make use of the present commitment, which is evident everywhere, rather than putting things off for another two or three years.
I am also glad that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has managed to get a line inserted into the Budget, not merely for a survey, but for following up all the things that have gone well in this European Year.
I would like to close with a very fine slogan that you, Commissioner, mentioned at a recent event, when you said that we should use âGetting on Boardâ as a slogan.
I would like to end with a slogan for the future, when disabled people will not just be âGetting on Boardâ but also âStaying on Boardâ.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Union's permanent preoccupation, at the level of communications alone of course, with people with disabilities, forms part of the effort to conceal the tragic reality, which is that there is 90% unemployment in the European Union â and not 70% as the leaders assert, with a dramatic increase in unemployed people with disabilities, in conjunction with a dramatic reduction in disabled children attending special schools or parallel departments in recent years.
In Greece, only 7% of disabled children attend special schools, which are financed by the insured, not the state.
For autistic children over 14 years old, there is not one rehabilitation centre, while few children with mental health problems attend some sort of school.
Of the 2 000 rehabilitation centres which should exist in Greece, there are only 200 sub-standard centres in Athens.
The problem of people with disabilities is deeply class-based.
Equal opportunities for people with disabilities mean a free national health and welfare service, special education, assistance and dignified work for everyone.
It means a different policy, which the European Union, by its very nature, is unable to practice.
That is why it takes refuge in âlying on a massive scaleâ, as we say in Greece.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I have to conclude once again, as I have also told you at the end of the European Disability Forum, that literally across the entire political spectrum, another directive is being requested, a broad directive which goes further than the directive that has not yet been applied in the Member States and that only pertained to work and vocational training.
There is no argument that could justify why this directive has been neither transposed nor implemented.
The ultimate deadline is early December, and as far as I am concerned, you can initiate proceedings against Member States that have not done anything by then, and, with the help of Parliament, put pressure on those Member States.
Following this, however, a broad directive must be adopted immediately, not only in the form of studies.
Studies are a start; something must certainly be done about that too.
However, we would like your word in the mean time that this directive will actually be adopted.
This was also a request that was made by the European Disability Forum.
They have, in fact, got the directive all ready on paper, and we would ask for progress to be made in that area in the meantime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should not wish the European Year of People with Disabilities and the parliament we had last week to be seen as the end, but rather the beginning, of something.
Demands have been made in a number of areas. Now, it is a question of implementing them.
The Commissioner said that mainstreaming should apply to disability issues.
I share that view.
Disability policy is not a policy area. Disability issues are part and parcel of all policy areas.
In those areas in which the EU has competence, disability issues are therefore also an area of responsibility for the EU.
For example, one area of competence for the EU is peopleâs freedom of movement.
That applies to everyone, including people with disabilities.
Transport is also one of the EUâs areas of competence, and transport for all, including people with disabilities, also falls therefore within the EUâs competence.
It is regrettable that the Member States have not implemented the directive concerning the equal treatment of people with disabilities in the workplace.
That must not be used as an excuse for not producing directives in other policy areas.
What signal would that give to those Member States which do not want to do anything?
They would, of course, imagine that, if they did not do anything, no further measures would be put in place.
We know that directives are needed that cover all the relevant policy areas, and that is what we demand.
I shall conclude by mentioning two other important areas to which attention should be given over the next few years.
The first is the new Member States.
Even though we face challenges in the present Member States, the challenges are still greater in the new Member States.
The second is the debate about the future.
We must push our demand for majority decision-making when it comes to anti-discrimination.
The country that is least ambitious where discrimination is concerned must not be allowed to determine the agenda.
That is why majority decision-making is needed in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, opportunity has been taken of the European Year of People with Disabilities to express numerous proposals and to formulate interesting ideas. Generally speaking, we have a wealth of material before us which, however, needs to be mastered if we want to have an integrated policy on people with disabilities.
This is the most difficult point of the entire strategy.
If we want to be efficient, we need to focus our policy on three objectives.
First, we need to persuade the constitution writers that it is high time we moved on to a new generation of rights which are recognised in the countries' constitutions as an integral part of fundamental rights, because only if people with disabilities are recognised as having special rights will they too be able to enjoy the fundamental rights which are generally recognised for all citizens.
Secondly, we need to persuade finance ministers to recognise that expenditure on people with disabilities should be seen not as consumer spending, but as an investment in human potential and, consequently, as productive expenditure.
This will pave the way for taking the measures needed to stop the exclusion of these people.
Finally, but equally importantly, we need to introduce a strategy to convince the rest of the population that the problems of people with disabilities relate not to a specific category, but to society as a whole, if we want to have a society with cohesion and superior living standards.
In other words, the indifference or even, on numerous occasions, the negative attitude of our fellow citizens towards the special characteristics of these people needs to be overcome.
Only if the problem of people with disabilities becomes a common problem will it have an auspicious outcome.
In particular, as far as the employment sector is concerned, we need to persuade businessmen that they stand to gain a great deal from becoming involved in measures to support these people and make use of their potential in undertakings because, as experience to date has shown, these people are the most loyal of employees.
To close, I should like to congratulate you on the initiative which you have taken and on the programme which you have announced; however, both I and my fellow Members would say that, if it is to be successful, it needs to be integrated straight away and to include legislative measures.
Â Â  Mr President, in this year we should highlight the problems but also celebrate the achievements of people living with disability, not just people of genius â the Beethovens, Miltons, Van Goughs and Stephen Hawkings â but those who are unknown.
For example, the boy from the north of England who had learning difficulties and was written off by the education service, but was then found to have musical ability.
Whereas had he had a job in industry he could not have read the safety signs, he went on to play in the orchestra at Covent Garden.
Then there is the dancer who trained at the Ballet Rambert School.
She was profoundly deaf, but learnt to dance through the rhythm of her feet and went on to dance with the Portuguese National Ballet.
I knew a tiny, frail, 23-year-old girl who had been confined to a wheelchair all her life and had undergone 26 lifesaving operations.
She was a trainee at the SHARE community.
She decided to do a sponsored wheelchair push, self-propelling the wheels with her tiny hands.
As she herself said, it was the first time in her life she had the opportunity to help other disabled people.
People can and do achieve, despite severe physical and mental disabilities.
For a few that means successful careers in business, politics, the arts or professions.
For most it means more local, private, domestic achievements: coping with living and contributing to the lives of those around them.
We have a duty to help not in an intrusive or invasive way, but by removing legal, physical and psychological barriers.
They bring the courage.
They deserve from us the opportunity and the dignity.
In government I was able to bring in a system of direct payments so that a person was not provided for by social service departments if he or she preferred to have the cash equivalent to purchase the services from the supplier of their choice.
If you buy your own services, meals, transport and so on, then you are in charge, you have a form of dignity and independence which too often is lacking in the relationship between state services and citizens.
That is the route we should be seeking from this year on.
Â Â  Mr President, I was not surprised that the European Year of People with Disabilities was a success.
Anyone who has consulted and spoken with NGOs, activists and community groups on the ground, as I have in my constituency, will know that the people who represent our 37 million fellow Europeans are very clear in what they demand from us.
At the weekend, I was told by one group in my constituency that they are happy that the European Year will have some follow-up, but they want clarity about what that will be.
As Mr Bouwman said, they were promised an employment directive that would be implemented by Member States, and yet they see the Member States still dragging their feet.
That is not to say that the Commission and colleagues have not pushed those Member States to implement the employment directive in its disability provisions, but it is not being implemented.
They are therefore concerned that implementation will be lacking in other spheres.
