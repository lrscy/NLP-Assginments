We must, however, make sure that our common history is punctuated by more events like the recent Samara summit.
We need the world to see us as a united entity more often.
We must speak in a single voice, because that is the only way we can rise to the challenges facing us.
It is my sincere belief that we can succeed in this, precisely thanks to our common identity, and that is something that no legislation can guarantee.
Mr President, I should like to say to the Prime Minister that the Constitutional Treaty is not about losing identity but about organising solidarity in a just, effective and sustainable way.
Those who oppose it on grounds of identity are not in fact afraid of citizens losing control over the State but of the State losing control over citizens.
In a world where the market, crime and poverty are globalised, the European Union must be political and coherent.
We therefore need the double legitimacy of the European Union as a union of states and citizens and double majority voting.
You will agree that the European Union is simply unable to exist without legal personality and is unable to decide whether the single-country veto is its decision-making rule.
While accepting that subsidiarity should be an important principle of the Union, we should also accept the precedence of European legislation over national legislation.
We cannot expect European citizens to be loyal to the European institutions if their fundamental rights are not legally binding.
Likewise, without a social dimension, the European dream simply will not take off.
However, a social Europe is not sustainable without a harmonised tax policy and European Union funds.
Ultimately it is not possible to imagine a Europe which is economically and socially effective without a common foreign and security policy.
By considering this aspect in a positive way you will certainly bridge the wishes of your citizens and the aspirations of other Europeans.
Mr President, I am very much indebted to the Members of Parliament for their comments further to what was said on the subject earlier.
I should like to start by clearing up a serious misunderstanding.
I have heard a number of speakers, including Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Voggenhuber, talk about things such as the national anthem, the title of Foreign Affairs Minister and the flag, as if these were Dutch issues.
This is not the case at all.
I have indicated to you that the question is whether these symbols - that are wonderful in their own right and I have nothing against them - should be enshrined in a constitution.
They are merely examples of the question whether we want to work on a constitution or would prefer to change the treaty.
This is what this is about.
Let us simply treasure our symbols, the question is only whether they should be included or not.
What I meant went a lot deeper, as I indicated.
I have tried to give answers to concerns that are around.
In my contribution, I indicated that we must think in terms of a treaty amendment, a test of subsidiarity by the national parliaments.
I will say more about this in a moment.
The kind of things that matter to us are majority decision-making in relation to the powers of Europe and the inclusion of the enlargement criteria.
Seeing things only in terms of symbols would turn the Netherlands' vision into a caricature.
I also paid close attention when the comment about nationalism was made.
It was one that I did not understand.
During the debates which we held in the Dutch Lower Chamber and after the 'no', I made it quite clear that our future is in Europe.
A positive message about the meaning of Europe in everyone's life.
We cannot do without Europe.
This has always been my message, and I have no desire, therefore, to be associated with purely nationalistic trends.
There was also the assertion that Europe is about nothing but economics. to which, you, Mr President, of course referred.
Everyone says certain things.
You referred to the actions of a young media person.
I should like to remind you once again that when we held the presidency of the European Union, I repeatedly said that Europe is much more than a market and currency.
Do you remember that I took the initiative to organise conferences on values in Europe?
I then raised the question: what makes us Europeans?
What are our common motives?
What makes Europe this continent?
It is my dear wish that the debate on European values be continued.
We cannot do without this debate.
So do not try to tell me that this is just about economics.
When we consider Europe's future, we face the question as to what the challenge is we are facing.
Mrs Martens from the Netherlands made a pertinent comment in this connection.
What is actually the ideal situation?
What are we trying to achieve together?
This subsequently leads to a host of concrete questions which have also been raised on this platform.
I cannot address all of them.
There are simply too many and we are also limited in time.
Allow me to single out a few issues, though.
One of the points that was made was the issue of powers and of subsidiarity.
It is my firm belief that we must spell out what we mean.
Mr Duff made no bones about the fact that the Union has only those powers that the Member States grant it.
We should lay this down in very specific terms.
When these powers are implemented, this is when the issues of subsidiarity and proportionality come into play.
Of course, the national parliaments have their part to play in this.
This is also true of the Netherlands.
The Upper and Lower Chambers, and the Joint Committee, have reflected on the question as to what Europe should and should not do.
This is extremely beneficial for involvement.
Indeed, for too long, the debates were avoided and postponed.
This is also the method by means of which we would like to say that national parliaments should be fully involved in what is happening in Europe.
If there are points of criticism, they should be made.
We, for example, commented on the harmonisation of criminal law in the fight against counterfeit goods, something with which Commissioner Frattini has concerned himself.
This is the sort of thing that should be open to discussion.
This is how national parliaments can operate.
In a wider sense, it is also a good thing that the question of subsidiarity is also addressed in national parliaments.
We should avoid a situation in which national parliaments and the European Parliament are pitted against one another.
You have different powers and you play your own role in democracy.
We should not see this as a sign of weakness, but rather as one of strength.
I should now like to turn to the criteria of services of general interest, a subject that Mr Van den Berg raised, along with other questions.
It is my firm belief that we need clarification.
We can discuss the way in which this is done.
At the same time I can see Mr Maaten - we know each other well from the days when we both sat on the town council of Amstelveen, a town near Amsterdam - we go back a long time.
I can understand very well what you are saying about the internal market.
Of course, we must consider this consequence, but I, in turn, would say, if we discuss pension systems, pension funds, schools, let us closely examine how the principles of the internal market work there.
We need clarification on this and we can obviously discuss the way this should be brought about in greater detail.
I understood very well that you talked about the importance of the Charter of fundamental rights.
With good reason, because these fundamental rights belong to the values which Mr Daul mentioned.
The question is only - and I would like to ask the same question - whether this should be included in a Constitution or if other methods could be applied.
We need to find a solution for this.
I have listened carefully to what you said and heard how important the topic is considered here.
It was a pleasure to hear Mr Dehaene speak.
I value him for his involvement in bringing about the Constitutional Treaty and the Convention at the time, and we have found ourselves thrashing things out on many occasions.
I am pleased that you feel for the position that we are in, when people say 'no' in a referendum.
You have also indicated what is needed to resolve this situation.
I would respond to that by saying that we must be a little more pragmatic, as Mr Maaten indicated, but obviously whilst retaining the ideals we all share.
If we can reach this solution, we will need to be mindful of the positions on either side.
It is for precisely this reason that I repeat today that it is necessary that we look beyond the existing positions, that we should not take sides in Europe and that this, as I see it, can be done by means of an amending Treaty.
I think it is possible to find solutions swiftly.
Many comments have been made, which I find difficult to address, although I have taken note of them all for personal use.
I listened carefully to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, who mentioned - and I should like to finish with this remark - national anthems.
You referred to the Dutch Wilhelmus, our anthem which, it is true, contains the sentence: 'de koning van Hispanje heb ik altijd geÃ«erd'.
The fact, though, that our anthem includes the line 'I have always respected the King of Spain' was related to the fact that Spain was involved in totally different things in the Netherlands, which culminated in a fight for independence and an 80-year war.
This is now such a great time, a time in which we, for the first time in Europe's history, are experiencing peace and security so that we can discuss things here in friendship.
I remember very well when I was in Madrid and visited the monastery where Philip II stayed.
It was interesting, alongside our version of history, to hear the Spanish version.
This is what is so good about Europe, that we can be different.
Europe is a continent of diversity, but we also need unity.
What is so special about Europe is that we boast this culture and religious pluriformity.
This is what has made Europe strong.
If we are talking about the ideals which we stand for, then I would say: let us use what has made Europe strong: human rights, democracy and working on security.
Let us remain keenly aware that this should be a combined effort.
Let us recognise the powers of national parliaments, let us get the European Parliament to do what needs to be done without any restrictions.
I always find it extremely stimulating to be here, because the European Parliament is the symbol of a united Europe.
I believe it is a good thing that national politicians enter into debate with you.
I experienced the debate with you today as extremely stimulating.
Of course we do not need to see eye to eye on everything, and of course I can take criticism, but there is more that unites us than divides us.
If we are guided by the European dream, then we will undoubtedly be able to find solutions for the problems that have arisen.
Together we can make a difference; together we can work on this solution.
(Applause)
We in this House believe that there is no longer any basis for nationalism, and so the term ought not to have been used today.
I would like to thank you sincerely on behalf of all our Members for being here, and will wish you success in your policy in order that we may find a way to preserve the substance of the constitution, in the shape of the necessary reforms and the values we seek to embody.
My thanks also go to the Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner Frattini, and to Mr Gloser, the Minister of State.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Nigeria (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Nigeria.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the situation in Nigeria is of great significance for the stability of West Africa and, ultimately for that of the continent as a whole.
The latest elections in Nigeria turned out very disappointingly, as the Council indicated in its statement of 27 April; there were numerous irregularities and acts of violence, with up to 200 people being killed and many more than that injured or intimidated, and the Council expects the persons responsible for these acts of violence to be called to account for their actions.
It is fortunate, at any rate, that there was no evidence in these elections of religious or ethnic conflicts.
The elections took place within an improved legal framework, with substantial funds being made available, and all this led us to expect that the 2007 elections would pass off better than those held in 2003.
While we are still awaiting the final report from the EU's election observation mission, initial assessments give credence to the suspicion that the 2007 elections were an even more badly run affair than their predecessors in 2003.
The main problems were in the lack of organisation exemplified in particular by the late opening of polling stations, the lack of ballot slips and the lack of secrecy around the voting process.
What was even more serious was that, in addition to widespread irregularities, there was visible evidence of considerable electoral fraud.
Another major problem with the elections was that failure to publish detailed results from them, with, moreover, those results that were available not being calculated in comprehensible ways, and we should now ask the Nigerian authorities to publish the results with the figures broken down according to the polling stations where the votes were cast, for this is the only way in which the election system can be guaranteed to be transparent.
The Council did, however, find positive encouragement in the indications of greater independence on the part of the judicial system during the election campaign, and we hope that this tendency will continue in the post-election period.
The lively debates in the privately-owned media before and after the election were also encouraging, and the Council has been impressed not least by the commitment of the Nigerians themselves to the democratic process, in consequence of which the involvement of civil society organisation is, and will continue to be, of very great importance.
The Council has appealed to all the political actors to use peaceful means and to demonstrate an attitude of responsibility by having consistent recourse to the legal channels in order not to disappoint the Nigerian people.
We hope that the independent national election commission and other bodies will make haste in producing the evidence that the electoral tribunals require in order to complete their work with the minimum delay possible.
The Council also hopes that the Nigerian state authorities will be sympathetic to the idea of repeating the election process in instances where there is irrefutable evidence of grave electoral fraud.
This is not, however, the time to turn our back on Nigeria - on the contrary; Nigeria's stability and development matter not only to its own people, but also to Africa as a whole, and, if the Millennium Development Goals are not achieved in Nigeria, we are not going to be able to achieve them in Africa at all.
Nigeria's future government will have numerous challenges to face; one fundamental area of concern will be the need to monitor efficiently the resources allocated to the federal states, and another will be the continuing insecurity in the Niger Delta.
The EU should support Nigeria as it faces these challenges, stepping up its efforts to strengthen responsible governance and democracy and promoting respect for human rights in Nigeria.
It must involve itself in these areas in cooperation with Nigeria and on the basis of that country's government's unequivocal consent.
The Presidency will therefore continue to keep a watchful eye on developments in Nigeria.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, as we have just heard, Nigeria has recently held important elections that will determine the transfer of power from one civilian president to another.
On the invitation of the Nigerian authorities, the Commission fielded a large independent election observation mission (EOM), which performed well and cooperated closely with other international and domestic observer groups.
I appointed Mr van den Berg - who had also observed the elections in 2003 - chief observer for those elections, and he will shortly give us his report.
The mission concluded that the 2007 state and federal elections fell short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections, pointing out that they were marred by poor organisation - as has already been cited, a lack of essential transparency and safeguards, widespread irregularities, significant evidence of fraud and disenfranchisement of voters.
Sadly, at least 200 deaths from election-related violence were also reported.
Other international observers - including those fielded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the US National Democratic Institute, led by Madeleine Albright - were also very critical, as were domestic observation groups.
The EU Presidency expressed disappointment at these elections not having marked progress in relation to 2003, which has now been reiterated by our president, at the irregularities and at the high toll of victims.
The reactions and the messages from the international community had been consistent in urging Nigerians who have complaints about the process to use the legal provisions outlined in the Constitution and in the Electoral Act, commending the independence shown by the judiciary and the engagement of civil society and praising the commitment of poll workers and voters.
Disappointment at this missed opportunity is widespread in the international community, as Nigeria - one of the major powers in Africa - could have set an example of successful consolidation of the democratic process, which would have had a tremendous positive impact on the African continent.
This is even more regrettable as the elections were held in an improved atmosphere in which the freedoms of assembly and expression were at least broadly respected.
The elections have highlighted the many problems and shortcomings of the Nigerian democratic process, and the Commission is aware that many challenges and misgivings need now to be addressed and overcome.
In the short term, pressure should be placed on Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission to publish a complete breakdown of the polling station results, which is a basic requirement of transparency, and the judiciary should also be encouraged to act swiftly and responsibly with the election petitions.
If redress is not provided, this could have serious implications for the future.
While the lessons learned will have to be taken into account in our future relations with Nigeria, entrenching positions should be avoided.
I think the political dialogue has to restart, but future relations will have to include a deeper engagement at federal, state and Community level with a wider range of players in civil society and government.
The topic of the elections must be a key feature of the political dialogue with Nigeria, based on the recommendations of the EOM.
Our readiness to engage Nigeria in a political dialogue and the commitment to promote the strengthening of governments and democracy in the country, particularly together with ECOWAS, is highlighted in the joint EU-ECOWAS communiquÃ© issued on 24 April at the 11th EU-ECOWAS ministerial meeting.
While the main instrument for political dialogue will remain Articles 8 and 9 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, the programming of the development cooperation to be financed by the 10th European Development Fund will also provide a crucial avenue for dialogue and the opportunity to take into account lessons learnt from the elections and the outcome of the discussions with the new Government, civil society and other key players.
Madam President, both the Nigerians and the international community had great hopes for the Nigerian elections for a number of reasons.
Firstly, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and as the Commissioner said, a successful democratic process in Nigeria could set a good example that other African countries would wish to replicate.
Secondly, these were the first Nigerian elections where one civilian government would take over another, which is very important in a country with a history of military dictatorships.
And thirdly, there is broad freedom of speech in Nigeria, and the judiciary is independent.
Unfortunately these hopes of a positive example have been dashed.
The resolution we are discussing is very critical, and justifiably so.
Poor organisation, numerous mistakes and procedural irregularities, as well as electoral fraud have meant that the latest Nigerian elections cannot be regarded as credible, free or fair.
The elections met neither international standards nor the regional standards defined by ECOWAS.
Worse still, the elections were marred by violence resulting in the deaths of at least 200 people.
Questions about the significance of this violence by discussing the death toll showed that most Nigerian politicians were unaware of the problem.
It appears that long-term education in citizenship is very important in the case of Nigeria.
Sending election observers is not enough, we need to invest in education and building a civil society.
It is my belief that the Nigerians must not be subjected to blackmail based on threats that any questioning of the election results would be tantamount to inviting the military to stage a coup again.
This philosophy of 'the lesser of two evils' undermines democracy and justifies and feeds anti-democratic tendencies.
The 64 million registered Nigerian voters have a right to election results that reflect their real will, and the European Union must strive to make this happen.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to say something on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, rather than as head of the Election Observation Mission, because that is a different role.
The European Election Observation Mission has had to conclude that the elections in Nigeria were not credible.
This is unfortunate, because despite the improved atmosphere in which the freedom of expression of opinion was respected during the campaign and despite the positive and independent role played by the law courts, the election process, and subsequently the results, cannot be seen as credible.
The Council has confirmed, as has the Commissioner, that this is indeed the case.
The Nigerian elections were badly organised and intransparent; there were far-reaching procedural irregularities and there was clear evidence of fraud.
The process fell well short of the measure of international and regional standards for democratic elections.
The point which the Council made a moment ago, namely failure to publish the results either in polling stations or at higher levels, and hence the complete lack of proof and transparency is, and remains, in fact, the most serious problem, because as a result, nothing can be proven or refuted, and this takes all the credibility out of the electoral result as such.
This is simply, as we have established, one of the toughest verdicts which we as Election Observation Mission have passed in the different countries.
This was particularly painful, because after 2003, there was real hope among the people that actual improvements would follow.
The people were committed.
When many people have made the necessary efforts and have shown commitment, then something like this will hit them particularly hard.
If you compare 14 April to 21 April: at the governor's elections on 14 April, there was still a great deal of hope, whereas the situation on the 21 April was simply demoralising.
This also explains the low turn-out, despite the upbeat figures that were published afterwards.
What conclusion are we Europeans to draw from this?
That we should, emphatically, remain committed, and this is where I agree with the Council and the Commission in their conclusions.
It is, after all, the Nigerian people we are talking about, and they deserve a better future and serious elections.
This means, therefore, that in our diplomatic relations, we cannot pretend that the government that has just been appointed has been elected in a democratic manner at all.
This is, of course, a very tricky business.
We could do business as usual, provided we remain involved and active.
Business as usual would affect not only the credibility of our European Election Observation Missions, but also - and to a far greater extent - our own values for which we stand when we act in the world and in a country such as this.
We should therefore come clean and conclude that we have a democratic crisis on our hands at the moment.
This crisis has partly become evident before the courts, where a number of people have objected and tried to prove that certain things are simply wrong.
It has also become evident, and can become evident, via working parties of the Senate and the House of Representatives, who are launching investigations of their own and are trying to table fresh proposals.
And we have to wait and see, of course, how people in Nigeria come to table their own proposals on the question as to how credible elections can be held.
I have said before that it is not up to us to work this out in detail, but this is the essence and it would be good if in this respect, our resources could be put in place, preferably not with the federal government and with the state, but with all those players in society who can promote governance and democracy in this way.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, the analyses of the elections in Nigeria by international observers are, as I see it, strikingly similar: disappointment about the election process that is typified by poor organisation, large-scale fraud, intimidation and violence.
These elections do not in any way meet international standards.
This is the conclusion of the EU Observation Mission, under the leadership of Mr van den Berg, who has done sterling work under difficult circumstances.
The reaction of certain Member States who would have preferred a slightly less outspokenly negative statement from the European observers has rather surprised me, and all the more so because the Member States in question are constantly banging on about the need for more democratisation in Africa.
Diverse interests sometimes lead to diverse reactions - history is repeating itself.
The EU Election Observation Mission was right not to be seduced into adopting a political stance.
After all, as Mr van den Berg stated a moment ago, it is now up to the political class and civil society in Nigeria to do their bit.
The judgment by the High Court on the Vice-President's participation in the elections demonstrates that this should not be utopia.
Irregularities should now be reported to the election tribunals and the courts.
Our role is more of a structural one.
Accordingly, by means of dialogue, as the Commissioner pointed out with good reason, we must spell out that an independent election committee must be put in place that is capable of organising truly independent elections, and the newly elected Nigerian parliament can play an important role in this.
In summary, following promising developments in countries such as Mali, Benin and Liberia, it is a crying shame that a regional superpower such as Nigeria has missed a great opportunity.
Madam President, as we all know, the development of Nigeria is crucially important for the African continent.
Nigeria is one of the largest countries in Africa and, just as it has done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union has put effort into organising elections and observing elections there.
That being said, the chaotic and violent situation that reigns in Nigeria, especially in the delta region, must open our eyes to a number of issues - obvious and outstanding issues.
As in Congo, the issue of the exploitation of raw materials and oil plays an extremely important role in the destabilisation of this country, in the atmosphere of violence and civil war that has come about there.
On this point, I believe that we should be very pro-active in supporting the civil society and the democrats, who are fighting to obtain information and transparency on the exploitation of the resources and who are also seeking to preserve their resources.
The delta region is totally devastated and plagued by murderous conflicts, and the manÅuvres of the Nigerian army in this area sometimes do more harm than good.
I also believe that the European Union should be far stricter in making the development aid that it provides conditional on the fight against corruption and on the very clear inclusion in the State budget of the profits made from oil and minerals, because it is all the same absolutely scandalous that the people of Nigeria, who live in a state of great poverty, do not see any benefits whatsoever from these mineral and oil profits!
At a time when the price of a barrel of oil has increased, the resources should be considerable.
It is therefore most unusual that this issue has not been dealt with.
Finally, progress needs to be made, too, concerning the social and environmental responsibility of large companies - Shell, in particular, has a major presence in this country, but it is not the only one - and we should also act together on these major issues, and not just on the matter of organising elections.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with great interest to the reports by the Council and the Commission, and as a member of the delegation of parliamentary observers at the presidential elections, I can fully confirm everything that has been said so far.
The elections were definitely not conducted in compliance with international standards, since the standards laid down at international level were not reached, nor even the standards of the African states themselves.
There was even a postponement in the opening time of polling stations that was decided on and notified only the day before, so that the majority of the population was unaware of it.
Most of the polling stations closed early.
There was an absence of any kind of secret ballot - and I could go on indefinitely, mentioning, for example, an electoral commission that was independent solely in name, but in fact was closely linked to the government.
I would also like to mention the intimidating atmosphere.
Hauwa Ibrahim, holder of the 2005 Sakharov prize, was supposed to meet our delegation in a public place but requested a change in the location of the appointment because she did not feel sufficiently safe.
I would like to move the debate on to what can be done in the future.
We absolutely must call for investigations into the electoral irregularities, call for an independent electoral commission, call for the Court of Appeal to be truly independent in dealing with electoral appeals and verify this, and state that new elections are necessary.
We cannot, however, stop at just this, and I already see in the background the risk that the political choices of the Council are tending in the direction of continuing as if nothing was the matter.
Let us not conceal the reason - some people may think that what matters is to have a government that is more or less legitimised, but in a country from which we can continue to buy oil.
This cannot be the solution.
I would like to ask what the intentions are with regard to using some instruments that the European Union possesses.
For example, there is the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
Are we able to verify that the Nigerian Government remains uninvolved in the selection and implementation of projects that are financed by this instrument?
I would like to ask the Commissioner, as I have already done on other occasions, what is happening with the democratic clause on rights, which was adopted by a very large majority within this Parliament, but never accepted by the Commission or the Council.
It has never been transformed into the powerful tool that it could be, and in this case it could be extremely useful to place trade with Europe in the scales too, from the viewpoint of democratic progress.
Last, but not least, there is the issue of what role Europe intends to play regarding events in the Niger delta.
It does not seem adequate to me that individual States should do their utmost and be prepared to pay ransoms when someone is seized.
We must call for a start in talks, relations and meetings between the Nigerian Government and the representatives of local people, putting pressure not only on the government but also on the large European companies operating in that region without any respect for human rights or environmental rights.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, Demokratie als Farce was the headline on 30 April of the weekly Das Parlement - the President of the Council may have noticed how I am quite German-minded.
Above the headline, there is a big picture of two coyly smiling Nigerian boys brandishing their ballot papers.
Any comment would be superfluous.
The two elections in the most populous country in April have ended in human and political disaster, with more than 200 people killed, and fraud on a large scale - things about which the present joint resolution does not mince words.
Where do we go from here in Nigeria?
I am very struck by a page-long article and interview with Nigeria's current President Obasanjo, who spells out quite clearly that Nigeria's future lies with its relationship with China.
Cheap loans, infrastructure, marvellous, but the European Union is out of the game.
What, I ask of the Council and the Commission, is the EU's response to this?
Do you, in light of these statements and this position, have a strategy, both tangible and intangible, for Nigeria, in fact, for the entire African continent?
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, if a country is trying for the first time, in the aftermath of civil war and military dictatorships, to organise a peaceful handover of power, it follows that not everything is going to run ideally and perfectly smoothly.

We all agree, though, that the elections laid on were a farce, for what has become of democracy when a party rejoices in its own victory even before the votes have been counted, or what of the free choice of the voters when threats are made as the voting papers are counted out, when ballot slips are completed many times over, and when there seem, in rural districts, to have been scarcely any elections at all?
What sort of message is it supposed to send out when ballot papers and election material arrive too late or not at all?
How, then, are the people of Nigeria supposed to feel that they are being taken seriously?
The election process was meant to have brought the region stability and pointed people to a viable way into the future, but those hopes have proved illusory, leaving behind them a disillusioned people whose experience of elections is, at best, of a symbolic act, and an opposition whose threat to contest the election result will probably avail it but little, for the winning party is hardly likely to agree to new elections, so what we are left to consider is to what degree the European Union can and may exert pressure when power is handed over on 29 May, for the European Union itself has hardly been always the best of examples; it, too, has seen the repetition of referendums until the desired result was achieved, something that is highly dubious in democratic political terms.
Madam President, it was my first visit to Nigeria and my first African election, and I was disappointed: I had expected to see a free and fair election, and it was anything but that.
I will not bore the House with my conclusions, because they are the same as those of the leader of the Commission's delegation and of the leader of the delegation I belong to, and they can be seen on YouTube, in a short video I made, under the headline 'Nigeria's rigged elections'.
I should just like to address some lessons for the European Union from this election in the largest country in Africa.
It seems to me that the Chinese influence, referred to by Mr Belder, might be a little deeper than we perceive.
We know that China is involved in the democracy backlash around the world: working with Russia as a dirty duet, all over Africa, with Belarus, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Egypt.
There is a process under way that the European Union has to respond to, and I believe that the Commissioner is committed to making the most use of the instrument that she and I are very committed to - the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
Let me just make some specific points.
I was one of three Members of the European Parliament on this delegation, and that was not enough.
I believe we have to reconsider as a House the use of former Members of the European Parliament in such delegations.
For example, we will send a delegation to Sierra Leone in August; I will not be surprised if there are very few takers.
Secondly, concerning the independence of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, we heard that the EU mission in Nigeria is involved with the Government in approving projects.
This must not happen: this instrument is supposed to be independent of host-country control.
Then there is the question of follow-up for this election.
I know that the final report has not yet been published, but I believe that the European Union has a commitment to the pursuit of democracy in those countries and the follow-up to the process of a bad election.
Finally, the use of the United Nations as an agent for organising these very effective missions is an expensive luxury and needs to be reconsidered.
(CS) Last month I went to Nigeria as a European Parliament election observer and I saw there many interesting, often unpleasant and sometimes appalling incidents.
On the one hand, Nigerian voters often travel many miles in great discomfort to reach the polling booths.
On the other hand, those manning Nigerian polling stations do everything they can to stop these people from accessing the ballot box.
On the one hand, people cast their vote enthusiastically with a view to a better, fairer, more decent life.
On the other hand, those manning the polling stations falsify people's votes with the aim of preventing political and economic change.
Ladies and gentlemen, I feel there can be no doubt about where the European Parliament and the Union stand.
We are on the side of justice, democracy, and free and fair elections.
We are on the side of the millions of Nigerians who believe in democratic elections in the hope that democracy is the key to resolving political, economic and social problems.
Last month Nigeria had a historic opportunity to prove to itself, to Africa and to the rest of the world that it is equal to that task, that it is capable of making the democratic, peaceful transition from one government to another.
Unfortunately, it has squandered that historic opportunity.
Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to Mr van den Berg for all his excellent work as chief observer in Nigeria in very difficult circumstances.
I believe that the standing of the EU Election Observation Missions in general was enhanced by the fact that the EOM to Nigeria did not fudge but came out with a clear message that the elections had been irregular.
The great value of EU Election Observation Missions is that they are independent and completely neutral.
They are at arm's length from EU foreign policy.
The one point on which I am unhappy with the motion for a resolution is that in recital V and paragraph 15 a confusion has entered the text.
There is an association of election observation and foreign policy, whereas they need to be kept quite separate.
I hope that a way can be found around this through a normal amendment to get over the problem, but otherwise I am afraid that the ALDE Group will have to vote against both recital V and paragraph 15.
(PL) Madam President, despite its rich natural resources, Nigeria is a corrupt and backward country, where the profits from these resources, in particular its oil wealth, do not go towards economic development or improving the life of society.
Influential pressure groups who want to maintain chaos in Nigeria are stoking up antagonism between Muslims and Christians, despite the separation of state and religion, and the fact that the constitution should guarantee citizens their rights.
It seems to me, however, that the debate in this House before any pronouncement by the electoral commissions is somewhat premature.
I would, however, like to use this heated debate and the dramatic situation in that African country as an occasion to remember here, in the European Parliament, the words of the greatest authority of the 20th and 21st century, Pope John Paul II, that a state's raison d'etre is the sovereignty of society and the people, and a condition of international peace and cooperation is respect for the right of a nation to have its existence, freedom and culture.
- (PL) Madam President, over 200 people died during the recent elections in Nigeria.
The way the elections were conducted had nothing to do with democratic procedures.
The head of the EU observers Max van den Berg stressed that they did not justify the hopes and expectations of Nigerians, and cannot be regarded as credible.
Nigeria is a country riddled by social conflict based on religious and ethnic differences, especially between Muslims and Christians.
At the same time, the country has vast resources of oil and other minerals and is the ninth largest country in the world in terms of population.
Political killings, torture, and summary justice meted out by the army are commonplace.
Freedom of speech and of assembly are restricted.
Cases of repression of the Christian minority are becoming increasingly worrying.
Since its establishment, the European Union was built on the basis of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and citizens' freedoms.
On many occasions in its history the European Community - and later the European Union - has spoken out when democracy and freedom were under threat.
The examples of Georgia and Ukraine also show that only decisive action brings results.
In Ukraine, this kind of action led to a re-run of the falsified second round of the presidential elections.
This was the result not just of the resilient attitude of the Ukrainians, but also of the loud and clear signals sent by the European Union.
In my view, the European Union's delayed reaction to the events in Nigeria is also cause for concern.
Where fundamental standards are breached, instant reactions should follow.
Exactly one month has passed since the disturbances and elections in Nigeria, and we should immediately suspend all financial aid from the European Union to government structures in Nigeria, as well as aid for democracy and human rights if there is a danger that this money may go into the pockets of corrupt government structures.
(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy has lost ground in Nigeria.
The elections of Saturday 21 April, which were marked by fraud, violence and deaths, will not have been free or fair.
All the international observers, as you said, have confirmed this.
These elections were meant to be a test.
For the first time since the country gained independence, in 1960, a democratically-elected president could have hoped to succeed another.
This is a missed opportunity!
It does not bode at all well for Nigeria, at a time when the country, rich though it is, needs stability if it hopes to escape poverty.
Since the elections, the violence has increased: the international community has a duty to intervene.
I should like to remind you that, last year, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim, a Nigerian lawyer who courageously defended two women who had been sentenced to death by stoning for having committed adultery, for the Sharia is still observed in that country.
On 28 and 29 May, a coalition of opposition parties, civil society and trade union organisations, including the Nigerian lawyers' union, will organise a two-day movement to protest against the staging of these elections.
The European Parliament must support this democratic movement.
It is by doing so that we will defend Nigerians and Nigeria, a large and important African country.
Madam President, the election observation mission in Nigeria was the first one that I took part in.
I have one thought that I would like to share with you in relation to that.
The European Union was one of the biggest donors for carrying out elections in Nigeria.
Therefore we must hold a certain degree of responsibility that the aid given most efficiently serves its purpose.
The whole organisational burden for conducting the elections was carried by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.
In Nigeria, INEC was not able to meet the organisational and logistical challenges it faced in order to carry out truly democratic elections.
The shortcomings also constitute the most comprehensive part of the resolution.
I guess you must share INEC's responsibility by, for example, educating the approximately 500 000 INEC grassroots-level organisers so that more credible independent and democratic elections in Nigeria could take place next time.
(PT) Regardless of the election result - and there is good reason to doubt the validity of that result - the most worrying aspect of the Nigerian election was the electoral process, on which the opinion of the other international observers left no room for doubt: it was disorganised and fraud took place.
The report on the subject from our fellow Members who were there as observers is revealing.
The conclusion can thus be drawn that the election was used to secure a degree of legitimacy that the observers do not recognise and that is not acceptable to democracies.
The result had more to do with intimidation, fraud and violence than the will of the people.
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case on the African continent; far from it, in fact.
Despite the progress made in recent decades, much of the most persistent violence still goes on and some of the most corrupt regimes are still very much in place.
There is nothing in the geography of Africa or in the genetic make-up of African people that stops them living in a democracy, but the international community needs to be determined and resolute in the process of the democratisation of African countries.
This is not only for all the usual reasons, but also because China has become a global player, and one that does not demand democratisation in return for cooperation; quite the contrary, in fact.
Ahead of the EU-Africa summit due to take place in the second half of the year, the EU is now expected to play a genuinely effective role and not be reduced to mere rhetoric.
Not all global players behave in the same fashion but we need to work in tandem with our allies.
This is firstly for reasons both of values and principles, and of interests.
In free and stable democracies it is possible to pursue international trade that is predictable and that is of benefit to all but those who seek to fan the flames of corruption and dictatorship.
We must be tough, therefore, at the forthcoming summit, which is to take place during the Portuguese Presidency.
We do not want statements of good intent or mere recognition of the mistakes of the past; what we want is political truth and true politics.
The EU must remain the biggest provider of international aid and must actively promote cooperation.
At the same time, though, it must succeed in bringing about reform, democratisation and freedom in these countries.
Otherwise, the EU will be giving out fish rather than helping people to fish.
(DE) Madam President, having been preceded by such tense expectation, Nigeria's electoral marathon is over, and a new President, new provincial parliaments, and a new federal parliament have been elected.
The result was a certainty even before the election was held; while an overpowering victory by the governing party had been reckoned with, none of the election observers had expected the degree of electoral fraud, of falsified results, the logistical chaos and the widespread violence associated with this election.
Not only the European Union's electoral observation commission but also - and this is a new thing - that officially appointed by the West African Economic Union, were merciless in denouncing the serious defects present in this election, which have been documented in a long list to which reference has already been made in this debate.
I wish to join with my fellow Members in urging the authorities of the Nigerian state to subject the irregularities in this election to thorough and transparent investigation.
I should also like the Commission to tell us what options are afforded us by the democracy and human rights instrument for taking the necessary steps both in our dialogue with Nigeria and in our cooperation with it; as we know, it is not just Chinese businesses that are disregarding human rights and social inequalities, for their Western counterparts have always turned a blind eye to them in the quest for oil.
(HU) As vice-president of the delegation of observers from the International Republican Institute, I had the opportunity personally to take part, as an observer, in the recent Nigerian elections.
Based on my experiences, I have to say that the coordination of the work between numerous international observer delegations was an exemplary success.
As to the election itself, I can only confirm my colleagues' statement that Nigeria's elections can be considered neither fair nor free.
They have satisfied neither international standards nor the local norms set by the government of Abuja.
We witnessed serious shortcomings in the system of voter lists and in keeping the public informed.
In many instances, local polling stations opened late and had no ballot forms.
The murky process of compiling the results even raises the suspicion of fraud.
It is quite telling that the results of some voting districts have not been disclosed.
What is more, the elections were marred by violence.
As we have already heard, some 200 citizens lost their lives in clashes linked to the voting.
These massive irregularities are even more distressing in the light of previous Nigerian elections that took place in a much more orderly fashion.
This time we witnessed with sadness that the voting public's allegiance to democracy - this is very important - was not accompanied by the intent of government bodies to keep the voting within legal bounds.
We who were there saw how committed Nigerian citizens are to democratic values.
Amidst often chaotic conditions they waited with dignity for the moment to exercise their democratic right.
It is in Europe's interest too to see the consolidation of democracy in Nigeria so that it may become a model for the African continent.
For that reason, it is important for the EU to remain an active observer of that process.
(PL) Madam President, I apologise for re-scheduling my speech, as we were holding a very important vote to elect the president of EUROLAT.
Nigeria failed to make use of the opportunity the elections presented.
Our observers clearly confirmed that the elections were neither free nor fair.
This was because of corruption and very poor organisation.
The Nigerian Government is entirely to blame for this.
The elections were overshadowed by terror, in which 50 people died, most of them in the Niger Delta.
At times they were nothing but a caricature of elections, where some polling stations failed to open, while in others bandits destroyed the ballot boxes.
Europe should be especially meticulous in observing elections in this country, which is the largest in Africa and for many other African countries is a point of reference economically and politically.
Elections in a country of 110 million, of which 64 million are of voting age, should focus the attention of public opinion.
Unfortunately these elections did not boost, but have effectively weakened, Nigeria's position in the international arena.
In the run-up to the elections we noted a number of activities and tendencies not related to the election process that are cause for concern.
For example, in Muslim-governed areas, girls going to Christian schools were forced to wear veils as symbols of Islamic tradition.
This is a clear breach of religious rights and tolerance, but such practices are on the increase, and such discrimination may become even more widespread when Muslims take more power in Nigeria.
As the European Parliament, we cannot pass over this matter in silence, particularly as it is an imposition on the minds of children.
Tomorrow will be an opportunity to take a stand on this matter in the voting, and there will be voting in an amendment on this very issue.
But what will happen next, after the elections?
We should do more than just criticise, for which we have just grounds.
What we also need is a clear plan on how to force the observance of democratic rules of play in a country which plays a key role on a continent which is practically our neighbour.
In other words we have to force the Nigerian authorities to reflect democracy and free elections or - to be frank - turn off the tap of financial aid.
This aid must not be channelled towards state and federal structures.
Instead it can and should be forwarded to non-governmental and social organisations.
We must also put pressure on the Nigerian Government to act more effectively against corruption, the use of force and the sense of impunity that local authorities, which are practically states within a state, have.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to extend warm thanks to the honourable Members of this House for the interest they have shown and also for their support, and my particular thanks go to those who have performed the task of monitoring elections on the ground and who can therefore give very powerful and truthful descriptions of what happened there.
In his speech, Mr Kaczmarek gave it as his opinion that an opportunity had been missed, and to that I want to add that it was not a case of the overwhelming majority of Nigerians missing an opportunity, but rather of there having been people who would not allow the holding of free and independent elections with secret ballots that might have had a significant impact.
The question has been asked from various quarters as to what we can do about this.
In your own speech, Mr van den Berg, you also said, that we cannot stint in our commitment to Nigeria and to its civil society in particular.
It is very important that we should now, rather than backtracking on this commitment, clarify how the commitment made by us in the European Union can directly benefit the interested parties, not least civil society.
One opportunity to once again spell out what we Europeans think about how elections should be conducted, and about the ways in which they are manipulated, will be the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, at which the President of Nigeria, among others, is expected.
This first impression of what has been going on in Nigeria must not, however, exercise a generally negative influence on Africa's image in our eyes.
Some of you have already mentioned the positive examples that are to be found on the African continent.
Mauretania may not be a large country, but we have recently seen how it managed to organise a transition, and also, from its example, what sort of support is needed in order to do that.
Another consideration, bearing in mind the prospect of the Africa Summit between the EU and the African Union being held in November, is the need for it to be made clear for which values the European Union stands, and to what it is committed, in its dealings with its African partners.
We must also, at the same time, make clear where we stand in our dialogue with China, for it is not acceptable that China should have only a very limited economic interest in the continent of Africa, whilst the European Union is left to do much else in such areas as responsible action by the state and the development of civil society.
I was struck, a few weeks ago, when I attended a joint meeting between the EU and ECOWAS, to hear the participating countries say that, for many small shoots that had sprouted in them and which they hoped would grow still further, this amounted to a retrograde step.
There are also many countries in Africa that are enjoying economic growth and that are well governed.
I am glad to see that many of the public media are currently, in preparation for the Africa summit, taking note of that as they take a look at Africa, and that was another reason why it was important that the European Union and some of its Member States should show their colours while securing the elections in Congo, for there are, quite apart from Congo, a number of countries where development is progressing well.
So, then, I want to say thank you again for that.
I hope that we will, together with the Commission, and with your House's support, find ways of coming to terms with what has happened in Nigeria; I hope that there will be changes, and that we will be able to give our continued support to those in Nigeria who want that land to change and become a democratic country.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, we all agree that, unfortunately, these elections were a real disappointment, but I hope that democracy in Nigeria will become a force in the future, and not a farce.
We have a lot of work to do.
I agree that it is not possible or advisable to continue with business as usual, and certainly we will not do that.
As has been said by, I believe, a majority here, we have to engage with members of civil society in Nigeria who are willing to change the situation and the election process.
This must be part of the dialogue that we have to follow up, based especially on the recommendations of the EOM.
On the other hand, political engagement and dialogue with the Government are also needed.
Such a dialogue has to be regular; it has to be structured; it has to be held at troika, or local or even higher level, and must be extended to national and regional organisations, as was done between the EU and ECOWAS, as was just mentioned, as well as to representatives of civil society.
As regards the Electoral Commission, according to the observers, there were irregularities and fraud, but INEC in particular failed to act independently as it is required to do.
It is clear, therefore, that INEC, tarnished as it is by serious doubts over its impartiality, cannot continue to be a beneficiary of EDF support.
Issues concerning INEC's independence, mandate, structure and leadership must therefore be addressed before any decision about the continuation of our support can be taken.
As regards the Niger Delta, which has already been mentioned by some of you, the Human Rights Watch report entitled 'Chop Fine' on Rivers State is emblematic of a situation widespread in the Niger Delta, where large financial resources are made available, but very little reaches the people and even less the communities in remote areas of the Delta.
People there have been deprived of their voices and land resources, and they are not given anything in return by the Government.
The threats and challenges presented by this area are left unaddressed and will, sooner or later, have serious repercussions at national and regional level.
The ambassadors of the EU Member States have twice submitted clear and simple recommendations.
Before the financial resources allocated to the Niger Delta are increased, total transparency should be ensured and dialogue between all the stakeholders established.
Articles 8 and 9 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement have also been mentioned.
They contain all the ingredients needed to ensure the most effective dialogue not only with the Government but also with civil society and the regional African organisations, as has been said.
I consider it absolutely paramount that more coherent, more regular and more systematic action by the EU as a group vis-Ã -vis Nigeria is the only possible way of addressing the questions highlighted by these elections.
This should be a very strong thrust of our policy.
On the other hand, we have to be careful not to push Nigeria into the hands of religious extremists, including Muslim extremists.
China has been mentioned.
When I was in China in January, I made it clear that we want to have a dialogue on Africa with China.
It is not so easy to do, but it is very important and, therefore, it is important that Nigeria is being invited to the G8 Summit in order to give them these messages directly, because we have to tell Nigeria that we want our values and interests to be respected and it cannot only be a question of pure economic matters.
I shall just repeat that the EIDHR provides an opportunity to work with civil society.
It can work without the approval of the Government, but we normally have contact with the Government.
Finally, it is also important to see what our financial funding means there.
It is a mere 0.2% of the oil revenue and the total international aid to Nigeria.
Therefore this makes the consequences of aid suspension negligible from a financial viewpoint and potentially counterproductive, as it would further impair political dialogue with the Government.
But, on the whole, 25% of funding is promoting good governance.
Therefore, we should use this part in particular in order to work with civil society, as I think we would all agree.
To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution signed by seven groups has been tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon.
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (debate)
The next item is a debate on
the oral question by Miroslav OuzkÃœ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Council: Key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held in The Hague on 3-15 June 2007 (B6-0020/2007) and
the oral question by Miroslav OuzkÃœ, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Council: Key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held in The Hague on 3-15 June 2007 (B6-0121/2007).
substitute author. - (FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, the reports follow each other but are not alike, since we are at present going to deal with biodiversity.
Minister, this week will have been marked by the desire shown by the European Parliament to fight against the loss of biodiversity.
On Monday, the report by our fellow Member, Mr Amadou, and the report on Life+ were debated and, today, we are examining two oral questions tabled ahead of the next meeting of the Conference of the parties to the Convention on international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna, the CITES.
Our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, whose chairman I excuse for not being able to be here with us, questions the Member States' negotiating method and asks the European Council what key objectives the Union will uphold during the fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention, which will be held, as you said, Madam President, in the Hague on 14 and 15 June 2007.
The CITES Convention is one of the oldest multilateral environmental protection instruments.
It was adopted in 1973, in Washington, by States that were already anxious to go beyond the national regulatory frameworks.
The aim was to preserve wild plants and animals from commercial overexploitation.
The significance of this Convention compared with the other multilateral agreements on the environment is its great power of adaptation.
It directly influences trade through supply, which it restricts.
In very practical terms, it influences around 500 000 transactions - that is no small amount, 500 000 commercial transactions! - thereby restricting the overexploitation of biodiversity.
With the coming on board of the various institutional partners, nearly 170 States, including our 27 Member States, of scientists and NGOs, the CITES Convention will have made it possible to prevent the removal of particularly endangered species and to save species such as the Siberian tiger, the blue whale and African elephants.
Of course, the challenges facing the Convention are many.
On the one hand, they are structural.
The Convention struggles, in fact, to find funding to match its ambitions.
It has to deal with the over-consumption of natural species, some of which are not always listed.
On the other hand, the Convention must take account of new data, including, of course, climate change.
It must incorporate the ineffectiveness of certain instruments, such as the action plan for forest law enforcement, governance and trade, or FLEGT, with which everyone in this House is familiar.
It must review also the decisions that have had a negative impact on certain species: for example, during the twelfth Conference of the parties, the permits for the sale of ivory originating from Botswana, Namibia and South Africa resulted in almost 20 000 elephants being decimated, according to estimates.
As part of the fight against the loss of species, the European Union must at all costs speak with one voice during the conferences of the parties to the Convention.
In this connection, I should like to point out, Minister, that the European Union often abstains when decisions are taken because our Member States do not manage to come to an agreement, with the result that 27 votes are lost, and 27 votes is not a negligible amount; it is even often a large amount.
Therefore, Minister, we ask that the Council take account of Parliament's resolution, which reflects the interests of the European people and conveys that which our citizens want us to defend within the context of this CITES Convention.
Firstly, because the resolution points out certain requirements to the negotiators.
Thus, the precautionary principle must be applied with the same rigour as that imposed by the European Union in other international negotiations on the environment.
Equally, the Union must demand transparency in the voting process and reject secret ballots, a practice that really exists, especially when it comes to listing species in annexes.
In fact, the point is to modernise this slightly antiquated procedure, which no longer in any way meets the requirements of the citizens, who must be able to exercise their right to inspect the decisions that are taken on their behalf.
We know that the NGOs criticise the EU Member States at every turn for not disclosing their votes and for voting in secret ballots on certain species.
We consider this to be totally unacceptable and we call for transparency, because this Convention is special and because the Member States, as we know, have specific interests where some subjects are concerned.
The questions included in the agenda of the Conference must be submitted to the European Parliament.
We do not expect anything less.
Each time a Conference of the parties to the CITES Convention is announced, we put the same questions to the Council: we do not understand why we have not been consulted earlier, so that we know what positions the Council plans to uphold during the Conference.
I should also like to ask the Commission and the Council to involve our parliamentary delegation in the work of the Conferences so that we are not forced, as we usually are, to skulk around the corridors in the hope of gleaning some information from them, and that is when the Council and the Commission see fit to invite us!
I therefore thank you for involving the European Parliament delegation in the work done on the Convention.
Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, including those who have spoken on behalf of your colleague Mr OuzkÃœ, I would like to make a statement on behalf of the presidency.
As at previous meetings of the conference of the contracting parties to the Washington convention on the protection of species, the EU Member States will, together, put forward the position agreed by the Community.
The Council will shortly set down this position on the basis of the latest proposal from the Commission, and will, of course, inform Parliament of the position thus arrived at.
The Community's position will incorporate three overarching goals:

One is that the Convention shall become as efficient as possible, and the first thing to be done with this end in mind will be to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens; practicable and working solutions to problems of implementation need to be found, and it needs to be ensured that the contracting parties' resources are targeted where there is a real need for preservation.
Greater synergies must be established between the Convention on the Protection of Species and other instruments and processes relating to biological diversity; in particular, the resolutions of the fourteenth conference should help to bring about, by 2010, a marked deceleration of the worldwide loss of biological diversity, and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Furthermore, the European Union also wants to ensure at the conference that the planned amendments to the annexes to the Washington Convention actually do improve the preservation of the species in question, and it will, in this respect, be particularly important to ensure that monitoring is carried out, for it is only in this way that poaching and illegal trading can be curbed and the sustainability of the international trade in species guaranteed.
Elephants and whales are again the individual species on which this conference focuses.
To summarise, the Community is not prepared to give its consent to a resumption of commercial trading in ivory until such time as appropriate mechanisms are in place to prevent the more widespread illegal killing of elephants, and it thus calls on all range states of elephants to engage in constructive dialogue and to cooperate in maintaining stocks of elephants and in their sustainable management.
Since it is the International Whaling Commission that is primarily responsible for whale issues, no new resolutions should be framed in the course of our negotiations that would alter the current preservation status of whales under the Convention, and it follows that a review of whale stocks with a view to the possible downgrading of their preservation status under CITES should be considered only after mechanisms for checks on their management have been introduced and considered suitable by the International Whaling Commission.
I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the author of the question and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their interest in this important issue.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, the 14th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in the Hague is indeed the first CITES conference to be held in the European Union since CITES was put in place in 1973.
Therefore I think it will provide a very good opportunity to highlight our strong commitment to the implementation of this Convention and to raise political and public awareness.
I believe it will be the first time that a ministerial conference will address key issues regarding the future of the Convention.
Therefore the following key strategic objectives for the Conference of the Parties known as COP 14 have been defined.
The COP should reconfirm the important contribution that CITES made, or can make, to reaching the 2010 target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss.
The Community fully supports the contribution of CITES to this global target by regulating international trade in wildlife and wildlife products in order to ensure that this is sustainable.
The new strategic vision for CITES for 2008 to 2013 will determine how CITES can ensure that conservation, sustainable use and poverty reduction can also be mutually supportive and are therefore crucial for the continued importance and relevance of CITES.
The draft strategic vision also advocates that CITES should pay greater attention to the international trade in commercially exploited timber and fish species.
Given the strain on natural resources and continued over-exploitation, the Community believes that CITES could focus more on ensuring sustainable trade in such species.
We the Community have submitted proposals for listing several marine and timber species on CITES, so I think this will be a very important discussion.
Finally, a key issue for CITES COP 14 will of course be elephant ivory.
Diverging proposals are on the table from Elephant Range States in Africa.
We continue to hold the view that commercial trade in government-owned ivory stocks should not be resumed until we are satisfied that all mechanisms are in place to ensure that trade will not result in the increased illegal killing of elephants.
These mechanisms are currently being put in place and should hopefully be operational before we take a final position on this matter.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, yesterday the newspapers had some good news. It was about the hatching of some rare Egyptian tortoise eggs.
The problem was, they were hatched in Rome.
They should not have been in Rome.
They should not have been smuggled from Libya to Rome along with 275 other rare tortoises, because they are in the highest protection category under the CITES Convention.
Even worse, this is happening inside our European Union.
We know that the European Union is one of the world's largest and most diverse importers and markets for wildlife products, with demands for pets, for fashion products, ornaments and medicines.
That is why Europe has a particular responsibility to do something about it.
In my country, some 570 illegal wildlife items are seized every day by Her Majesty's Customs.
One wonders how many are not detected.
We know that the illegal trade in wildlife is the second biggest direct threat to species after habitat destruction.
We know that a quarter of the trade is illegal.
We know that billions of euros annually are made out of this, third only to the trafficking in drugs and arms.
We know, of course, that we have to take account of the local populations and their traditions and needs, and that is in this resolution.
We know there are differences of views between NGOs and between scientists, but this motion for a resolution, I believe, is a balanced one.
Lastly, I very much welcome what the Minister and the Commissioner said about the elephant, so will you please support the resolution from Kenya and Mali for a 20-year moratorium on the ivory trade.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, President of the Council, Commissioner, as has already been stated, this CITES Conference will be the first to be held in Europe, and this offers an opportunity to bring the protection of wild animals and plants to the attention of the public at large, more so than before.
Even though CITES is one of the most effective and concrete instruments to protect the international environment, the decline in biodiversity is alarming.
For example, a large number of fish species are in a bad way due to overexploitation, among other causes.
Demand for fish is enormous and still rising.
This has the depressing consequence that even at this stage, many deep-sea fish species are critically endangered, and that in many developing countries, the sea has also been emptied by Europe, or by European boats at any rate.
Unfortunately, the same is true to some extent of tropical forests.
Demand for tropical wood, despite all campaigns, remains high.
Added to that is the fact that demand for agricultural land is also rising due to the need for food and increasing demand for biofuels, and it is age-old forests that pay the price for this.
Europe's initiative to include a large number of fish species on the list of protected species deserves our unqualified support, as does the initiative to include a number of tree species on the list.
We should, however, ask ourselves how we can improve on things.
Pressure on nature is rising worldwide.
Increased prosperity goes some way to explaining this, while in a number of developing countries, it is poverty that is the motive.
We should, therefore, take a different course and realise that the protection of nature also creates prosperity and jobs.
We must take steps to guarantee that trade is truly sustainable and that the illegal trade is actually tackled and discontinued.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, there is a strong case for supporting the proposal for a 20-year moratorium on the ivory trade.
Contrary to what some southern African range States say - that they have too many elephants - estimates by the African Elephant Status Report put the population at between 10 and 20 % of what it was in the 1930s and 1940s.
The major cause of the decline is the ivory trade.
Ivory prices increased more than seven times over in China and Japan in the late 1990s.
A 20-year moratorium will send a clear signal that international trade is banned, it would suppress demand, lower prices and remove incentives for buying and stockpiling ivory.
Commissioner, could you be more precise as regards to what extent the Commission intends to take into consideration the pro-moratorium position expressed by the delegation of Western and Central African States who visited us at the European Parliament?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I should like first of all to thank Mr Gloser and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for what I was almost tempted to call their reassuring words.
However, I received no answer regarding the transparency of votes: I believe that it is crucial for us to know who votes for what within the European Union during this CITES conference.
I should like to begin by also expressing my satisfaction with the proposal made by Germany to include two species of shark - the dogfish and the mackeral shark - in Annex II to the CITES, a proposal that has also been endorsed by many associations working to protect these species.
In our view, this is a proposal that must gain full support because these two species, which are included in the IUCN Red Book of endangered species, require special attention.
However, above and beyond the specific case of these species, we should also give greater consideration to the status of the other species of shark in the waters bordering the countries of the EU, in the Mediterranean, for example, so that, on this issue, the European Union is affected as much as the neighbourhood policy.
In general, it must be recognised that the Mediterranean is an endangered sea: the indiscriminate withdrawal of fishery stocks over the last few decades, with the use of drift nets in particular, has resulted in a significant depletion of species.
The case of bluefin tuna is one such example, which has been highly publicised recently by Greenpeace.
Yet, what do we know, for example, about the sharks in the Mediterranean?
What we know overall about sharks is that, throughout the world, they are totally endangered, overfished and that they are suffering from the deteriorating marine balance.
That being said, does the European Union have any information or studies enabling it to assess the situation of the sharks in the Mediterranean?
That is the question.
If it does not have these, can it envisage serious studies being carried out so that, in the long term, it will be in a position to make concrete proposals, on the CITES in particular?
Furthermore, we also think it crucial that red coral, which is also overfished in the Mediterranean, be included in Annex II to the CITES.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the CITES Conference that is to be held in The Hague next month is of huge importance if we want to take measures against the international trade in endangered animal and plant species.
It is for that reason that I wholeheartedly support the resolution.
There is, however, one issue that I should like to single out and that came up several times this afternoon, namely that of the elephants in Botswana and Namibia.
Three quarters of the 400 000 elephants in Africa live in this region, thus resulting in inevitable risks for the people and the environment, and being detrimental to biodiversity.
This is why these countries have tabled their own proposals in order to maintain the elephant population and to reduce the risks.
The resolution, unfortunately, rejects these proposals.
Whilst it is understandable that people are keen to stop the trade in elephant products, a view which I share, it is equally important to face up to the situation in Botswana and Namibia, that boasts such an enormous expansion in the number of elephants.
We must give this matter some more thought.
After all, we cannot afford to reject solutions without replacing them with alternatives.
(DE) Madam President, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin has, in fact, already presented the substance of this oral question, which has particularly to do with what the Council is aiming to achieve through the negotiations, but also with the methods of negotiation and the way in which this House's delegation is involved in the work on the ground.
Like many other Members, I would like to return to the subject of the trade in ivory, which the Convention has prohibited since 1989, while allowing since 1997 the sale of individual items of stock.
Understandable though it is that the countries in which the trade goes on have an interest in this, the problem is that it has not so far been possible to distinguish between legal and illegal ivory, and hence there is a great danger that the legal trade will contribute to a revival of poaching.
A greater incidence of poaching putting those engaged in the protection of wildlife and the natural protection authorities under increasing pressure, and effective protection of pachyderms, which are important in terms of many countries' incomes from tourism, makes increasing demands on resources that are generally scarce; the only long-term protection for ivory is an absolute ban on the trade in it, for it is estimated that some 20 000 elephants a year are killed in Africa for their tusks.
Our resolution, then, endorses the proposal made by Kenya and Mali, and their demand for a 20-year moratorium on any kind of trade in ivory.
We hope that the Commission and the Member States will, in the course of the negotiations, give this demand their backing.
(IT) Madam President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to summarise very quickly the sense of my amendment, which is backed by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
I have called for the deletion of the seventh indent of Article 10 in the proposal for a resolution on the CITES Convention.
There is no scientific justification for transferring coral to Appendix II, since a panel of highly-respected experts working for the FAO has stated that the requirements for including the species in the genus corallium in the CITES Appendix II are not met - and this is a direct quote.
Coral can be properly preserved through a system of rotating the protected areas between producer countries.
Maintaining the current wording would strike a severe blow to the jewellery and craft sectors, as well as to the local economy and employment in various EU countries - Italy, Spain, France, Greece and Malta - and countries outside Europe such as China and Japan.
I therefore call on you to support my amendment, which is acceptable from a political viewpoint and backed up by scientific thinking.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, on the subject of elephants we are currently sceptical of supporting any of the proposals on the table, because the African Elephant Range States will be meeting directly before the conference.
We encourage them - and I think this would be the best solution - to engage in a real dialogue and thus seek an agreement on a common approach.
I have received a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate tabled under Rule 108(5).
The vote will be held on Thursday at 12.00.
Council Question Time
Madam President, we are following developments in Turkey with close attention, and I would also like to remind the House of the Presidency's statement on 28 April of this year, in which we emphasised the need for the presidential elections to be conducted in line with the principles of democracy and the rule of law laid down in the constitution.
Generally speaking, it is worthy of note that negotiations were commenced with Turkey in 2005 on the basis that Turkey would meet sufficiently the political criteria laid down by the 1993 European Council in Copenhagen, on which membership of the EU is conditional, and one of which is that a country should demonstrate institutional stability as a guarantee for democratic order and the rule of law, for the safeguarding of human rights and for respect for, and the protection of, minorities.
Over and above these, and in accordance with the framework for negotiations adopted by the Council in October 2005, the European Union expects Turkey to press on with its reform process and work towards making further improvements as regards respect for the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law, together with that for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including European court rulings on the subject.
The Council noted on 11 September 2006 that further considerable efforts would be needed in order to develop free expression of opinion, freedom of religion, the rights of women, minorities and trades unions, together with civilian control over the armed forces.
These issues are discussed on a regular basis as part of the political dialogue with Turkey, and, since the Council expects the principles I have mentioned of the rule of law and the civilian control of the armed forces to be fully complied with in the current situation, the presidency will continue to keep a watchful eye on the progress of the Turkish elections.
(EL) Thank you very much, Minister, for setting out the preconditions laid down by the European Union for the integration of Turkey.
However, I referred to the recent crisis, which could not have happened either in the countries of the European Union or in the candidate countries.
We are not accustomed to such crises in the candidate countries and I think that for us to simply - as you said - 'monitor' the situation is not enough.
We too must account to the citizens of Europe for what we do in order to address the situation and we need to rattle Turkey's cage so that it finally follows the preconditions imposed in order for it to progress towards the European Union.
We are calling for a bit more than simple 'monitoring', Minister.
Are you doing more?
In its talks with Turkey, the European Union has, I do believe, always acted with reference to the list of criteria to which I have just referred, and it also, on earlier occasions, highlighted ways in which the country might be given support and in which developments to that end might be set in motion within it.
I do believe that the European Union must be able to expect compliance with the framework requisite for accession and that, ultimately, the actors in Turkey become aware that decisions on such matters rest primarily with politicians rather than with the armed forces.
One important point - and one of which you will be aware - is that, in the course of this dispute, an appeal has been lodged with the Turkish constitutional court, and this - as the European Union has indeed stated - is the way down which the country must go.
I do not believe that more can be done at the present time.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, while your statements imply that a whole array of positions have been put on record by the Council and by the European Union, the reality is, however, that Cyprus, as a candidate for accession, failed to comply with these criteria in at least an equal number of instances.
While I am on the subject of Cyprus, would it not be possible for the European Union or the Council to become involved in ways more active than those you have announced.
We are keeping a close eye on what is going on there.
(DE) While the AKP does describe itself as being in favour of the separation of religion and state set down in the Turkish constitution, it is nonetheless known to have taken initiatives that give cause to doubt the truth of that claim; for example, it has campaigned for the abolition of the ban on the headscarf and for more extensive Islamic instruction.
To what degree does the Council share the concern expressed by critics of the creeping Islamicisation threatened by this party, and in what ways is this threat being considered in the course of the accession negotiations?
I would refer the honourable Member to the explanations given to him in response to an oral question in the April question session, and would like to reiterate that the Presidency attaches great importance to the constant improvement of integrated border control at the external borders of the European Union and, in particular, to the reinforcement of the maritime external borders to the south.
Further to this, the Council has already stressed, in its conclusions on the reinforcement of the southern sea frontier on 5 and 6 October 2006, that Frontex has to be built up by means of additional personnel and increased budgetary resources.
In order to improve Frontex' immediate response capability in emergency situations, the Commission put forward, in 2006, a proposal for the formation of rapid reaction border intervention teams.
The Council has had fruitful discussions with your House on this proposal, and your House voted on the text of the proposal on 26 April this year, so that the Council can adopt it at first reading.
The Presidency's ambition is that the text should be able to be adopted by the Council over the next few weeks, so that the instrument can be applied over the coming summer period.
In accordance with its working programme for 2007, Frontex will, as well as completing the European Patrol Network, be carrying out a number of joint operations on the maritime borders, the number and location of which will be determined by its management board.
Finally, the Council wishes to stress that the Commission, in accordance with the Hague Programme, which the European Council adopted on 4 November 2004, will, before the end of this year, be submitting an evaluation report on the agency.
(ES) The President mentioned my question of last April.
The FRONTEX system is effective, but the big problem is the interruption.
A quick interruption of a couple of weeks has led to the arrival over recent weeks of over a thousand immigrants in the Canary Islands, with the whole dramatic situation that that implies.
Our concern is that that system should be permanent and I hope that, by means of the measures announced by the President-in-Office of the Council, that system will really be permanent, since each day or week without it may mean the deaths of hundreds of people in the waters of the Atlantic.
I can assure Mr Medina Ortega that I am well aware of the problem, for we too get to see these things in the media, and the people on the ground, too, are aware of what this means for the refugees and for those who have to look after them.
I said back in April, in response to a question, that the protection of the external border is in the first instance a task for the Member State in question, while assistance may be sought from Frontex in a particular situation, in which case immediate response teams can also be formed.
This all depends on the interaction between the relevant Member States and the Frontex agency itself.
The question was about the Atlantic, but I would like to bring to your attention the human tragedy, which is taking place as we speak, in the Mediterranean, where last weekend just one person survived from a boat carrying 29 people 75 nautical miles to the south of Malta.
Yesterday 24 people were saved at sea and one person remained unaccounted for after a boat capsized.
Also yesterday, another boat with 53 people on board went missing.
It simply disappeared and could not be traced.
My question is: why have the Frontex patrols not started already in the Mediterranean?
When will they be started?
And what is the Presidency doing about this?
(FR) Minister, I was head of the election observation mission in Mauritania.
I can tell you that not a week goes by without a boat arriving, running aground, and requesting assistance, during its voyage to the Canaries.
These poor souls must be accommodated, and, as may sometimes be the case, they must be accommodated in the Mediterranean waters.
I should therefore like to know what resources the European Union - this European Union that uses up so many resources on protecting its borders - is making available to neighbouring countries, that is to say, to Mauritania, which is a transit country - these countries are not migrant countries, but merely transit countries and host countries - and what resources the European Union is putting in place to help these countries to manage this issue.
I am sure that Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou is aware that we would all like to have the opportunity or the freedom to travel in ways other than we are, but, measures have been taken in the European Union in the form of the Regulation that the Commission adopted in October 2006, in order that a certain standard of safety should be guaranteed.
The adoption of this regulation is a matter for the Commission, which has been supported in this by the Civil Aviation Safety Committee, which is composed of representatives from the Member States and was acting in accordance with its own rules.
Since the Commission has undertaken to have these measures reviewed six months following their adoption, questions pertaining to this regulation should be addressed directly to the Commission, which is responsible for such a review.
I would remind the honourable Member and the House that the Council's functions as regards air safety is limited to the examination of legislative proposals on the framework conditions for the relevant safety measures, further to which the Council and your House are currently discussing the Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the Council and Parliament to lay down common rules for safety in civil aviation, which it is intended should replace the Regulation currently in force.
(EL) Thank you, Minister, for your reply.
My question was whether citizens have any facility for filing complaints which could then be taken into account by the Commission and, if you, as the Council, could not propose the free distribution of water, even if just for short trips, and if you are seeing to an environmental evaluation of waste from this measure.
Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I do believe that it is in everyone's interests, particularly of the travellers themselves, that they should be able to fly with the maximum of safety.
None of this was done on the spur of the moment, and there were concrete reasons why security under these conditions had to be guaranteed.
It is certainly important that the persons involved be asked just what all this achieved.
It is unfortunate that there are at present no other mechanisms for examining things in a more transparent manner and perhaps as simply as was formerly the case, but none of the members of the public who are happy to avail themselves of their freedom of movement and their freedom to travel would understand persons responsible for their safety and freedom not themselves guaranteeing the highest possible standard of security.
If new technical developments make it possible to do this in new ways without such hindrances, then all parties will surely be happy to accept them.
Further to the points that you have made, despite all the information provided as to all the things that may no longer be taken through the checkpoints, there are still far too many members of the public taking their own bottles of mineral water and fruit juice or other items with them.
If people were to take some responsibility for themselves, then, it might well help reduce the amount of rubbish.
I can advise the honourable Member that there is a hearing on that tomorrow.
Picking up on what the President-in-Office has just said, does he feel that the sentiments expressed in this question are naive and include insinuations, cheap generalisations and, I would say, criticisms of valued security staff at our airports?
Further, would the Council agree that perhaps, for example, paying a bit more for water and sacrificing some convenience at our airports is a small price to pay if it means increased security for passengers, lower risks of terrorist attacks and improved welfare for all people using the airports, whether departing, arriving or transiting through airports?
(LT) Madam President, Minister, a month ago in this venue the same question was put to a European Commission representative, but we did not get a clear answer.
Really, I agree, the most important priority is safety, but nonetheless it is probably time to review that decision and either ease off on that measure or get strict with it.
What do you think?
(EL) Madam President, I am sorry but I can only assume two things: either that my supplementary question was not translated or that the President-in-Office of the Council did not reply at all to what I asked him.
I asked specific questions: if I, like any other European citizen, can voice my complaint following this control.
I also asked about the waste ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Presidency takes the view that discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, religion or outlook on life, disability, age or sexual orientation is incompatible with the foundational principles of the European Union, and the EU institutions have denounced such discrimination whenever it has appeared in any form whatever; I would also refer you to the debate held here in this House a few weeks ago.
The Presidency also promotes freedom of assembly and association and expresses opposition to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and I will take this opportunity to reiterate that any increase in racist and homophobic violence in Europe or elsewhere in the world is a matter of concern to it.
By virtue of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaties, the European Union pursues with determination an explicit policy of combating the phenomena to which I have referred not only within its own borders but also through its external policy measures; in its foreign relations, the European Union actively endeavours within the United Nations to combat discrimination, including discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and so it was that it, with others, in 2006, mounted a successful campaign for groups of homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals to be unconditionally granted consultative status by the Committee for Non-Governmental Organisations of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
Those are indeed fine sentiments, but what I am interested in is whether we are translating the sentiments into action.
We have EU Member States not only banning Gay Pride marches in the case of Poland, getting a condemnation from the European Court of Human Rights; now we have the Vilnius authorities saying that the EU Equal Opportunities Bus cannot be received in the city.
Surely this is a matter of breach of Article 6 of the EU Treaty on Human Rights and Article 13 of the EC Treaty on non-discrimination.
What is the Council and the Presidency saying to the Governments of Poland and Lithuania and other EU countries which are not respecting equality law?
Is Vilnius the right place to locate the Gender Institute in the light of these very disturbing tendencies in that city?
Mr Posselt, we do share the concern evident in your question on the position concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Northern Caucasus and Russia as a whole, and, for that reason too, we are keeping developments under continual observation.
The Council regularly brings this concern to Russia's attention in the course of the EU/Russia dialogue, to which I have just made reference in another instance, and various levels have been established at which concerns may be raised with the Russians, not only in policy dialogue at summits and ministerial meetings, but also at the human rights consultations which were introduced in March 2005 under the presidency of Luxembourg and now take place twice a year.
At these consultations, the EU regularly expresses its particular concerns in relation to the situation in the Chechen Republic.
The fifth human rights consultations are now a fixed component in relations between the EU and Russia, and the latest round took place on 3 May, with the situation in Chechnya on its agenda.
While we are on this subject, I should also like to mention that the TACIS action programme for social and economic reconstruction in the Northern Caucasus, which is funded by the EU to the tune of EUR 20 million, has now become operational, and it offers the prospect of positive developments being brought about.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, just as the Federal Chancellor, at the weekend, demonstrated that it is possible to combine firmness of purpose and faithfulness to principle with diplomatic adroitness, you are doing the same here.
I would like to ask now - and this is a very practical question - just what can be done to improve access to Chechnya.
Are you doing anything to this end?
Secondly, elections in Chechnya are held under the supervision of the OSCE, and the Council of Europe has done a great deal too.
All that has been brought to nothing.
Would it not be possible for the EU, as a community within the Council of Europe and the OSCE, to press for new initiatives for direct action in Chechnya?
Mr Bushill-Matthews, the Council would refer you in the first instance to its answer of 5 March of this year to the written question on this subject, in which it explained why it was that, in 2001, anti-dumping tariffs were imposed on the import of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps originating from the People's Republic of China, and in which it also stated that the Commission, on 17 July 2006, had begun a review further to the imminent cessation of these measures' applicability in line with Article 11(2) of the Anti-Dumping Regulation and that it was expected that this review would be completed within at most 15 months, that is to say by October 2007.
Once the Commission has arrived at its conclusions, it will forward a proposal to the Council, which will then have a month in which to decide whether or not to agree to it.
No such proposal has as yet been submitted to the Council, nor is it as yet aware of the final positions taken by the Member States.
I can assure you, however, that any decision will take the interests of all parties into account.
I am sure that you will understand that the Commission and the Council, when enacting trade protection measures, constantly consider the facts and the various interests involved - for example those of producers, users, importers and consumers - and try to keep them in balance in order to make it possible for a suitable level of protection to be guaranteed to the branch of industry in question.
What that means is that action will be taken only to such an extent as will make it possible for the Community sector in question to be protected against unfair practices in third countries, and only for such a length of time as is in the interests of the Community.
Well that was a most diplomatically crafted answer, but perhaps I could try again in a slightly different context.
I see announced in the paper today that a certain food processing company is now asking for protection against imports of sweetcorn from Thailand.
Is the Council - not the Commission - concerned at the growing tide of protectionism coming up from fellow Member States and is the Council under your Presidency going to provide any leadership to combat this?
The intention is that the agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on the facilitation of the visa system should enter into force with effect from 1 June 2007, and this, too, was the subject of a debate here in this House a few weeks ago.
The object of this agreement is to make it easier to issue visas for a planned stay of no more than 90 days in duration for nationals of the Russian Federation travelling to EU Member States, or for citizens of the European Union travelling to the Russian Federation.
According to this agreement, a national of the Russian Federation is a person possessing Russian Federation nationality or having acquired it in accordance with Russia's own regulations.
The consequence of that is that, in accordance with the law as it currently stands, the agreement is applicable to all Russian citizens irrespective of the country in which they live.
No initiatives have been taken to mandate the Commission to commence negotiations on a similar agreement with Georgia, for provision is already made in the EU-Georgia action plan and within the European Neighbourhood Policy for the initiation of a dialogue on the transit of persons, with specific reference to issues of return and the visa problem.
(FR) Minister, you have given me exactly the same answer that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner gave me three times, but you are not in fact answering the question.
The question concerns the facilitation of the visa system for persons residing on Georgian territory, in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, and to whom Russia has kindly offered nationality by issuing them with Russian passports - even though these people are Georgian - to the extent that the people of Georgia are subject to a system of double standards.
My question is this: did you weigh up the fact that, when the visa system was facilitated for Russian citizens, those persons, to whom Russia has granted nationality, with passports in support of this, and who, residing on Georgian territory, are Georgians from Abkhazia or South Ossetia, were going to benefit from the facilitation of the visa system, while the people of Georgia themselves would not benefit from it?
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, what is the Council's position as regards similar favourable visa arrangements for states such as Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus?
I think it very important that we should not forget them.
I can tell Mrs Isler BÃ©guin that, if the Commission and the Council have given the same answer three times over, that does not mean that they have given a wrong or incomplete one; that is the legal position.
Listening to your question, though, I alighted on the political issue of how one can - in view of the frozen conflicts in these regions - make concessionary arrangements for the citizens in, for example, Georgia or - as Mr Paleckis has just pointed out - in other countries.
These issues are the subjects of negotiations in the context of the specific relationships, and with Georgia, for example, within the framework of the neighbourhood policy.
It is quite clear to me that the special relationship between the EU and Ukraine or Belarus makes it necessary for us, in these specific cases, to keep on trying to bring about such agreements in accordance with the provisions of the EU and with the Schengen regime.
Thank you, President-in-Office and thank you all for helping us get through more questions than I anticipated.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.05 and resumed at 21.00)
Beniamino Donnici (debate)
The next item is the report by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the verification of the credentials of Mr Beniamino Donnici.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention in this Chamber the work carried out in committee, which has thoroughly discussed the credentials of Mr Donnici, resulting in a large majority in favour of the report.
I defend the committee, of which I have the great honour to be chairman, and I would like to answer those making petty insinuations to the effect that the committee has not been calm or objective - insinuations that clearly do nothing to honour this Parliament, given that the committee contains many jurists.
We have people and jurists such as Mr Lehne, Mr Medina, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Frassoni, to mention just the coordinators, and also very many other prominent figures throughout the committee.
Our discussions were always at a high level, and were conducted exhaustively and with great sincerity.
We always focused primarily on the role of this Parliament, which is a giant in terms of many things that it does and its role in Europe, but a dwarf on some occasions when you want to force it into a procedural corner.
The issue we were discussing comes within this major issue: the facts are known, the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto infringes the European Act, and we cannot give Mr Donnici a positive verdict.
The rules governing the European election procedure fall within the Community's jurisdiction and therefore the reference to national provisions laid down in the 1976 European Act is of a solely supplementary character.
The national provisions must, however, conform to the fundamental principals of the Community legal system, its primary rules and the spirit of the wording of the 1976 Act.
For these reasons, the relevant legislative and administrative national authorities, as well as the jurisdictional authorities, may not omit to take account of the Community legal framework on election issues.
The admissibility of the withdrawal by Mr Occhetto must be assessed firstly on the basis of Article 4 of the 1976 Act, pursuant to which Members of Parliament may not be bound by instructions and may not receive a binding mandate, and the freedom and independence of parliamentary representatives constitutes a fundamental cornerstone of the freedom of citizens.
This is laid down in the 1976 Act, but the new Statute for Members of the European Parliament, which I now quote, even though it enters into force for the next parliamentary term, is, in the current state of the Community legal system, a legislative act of primary law, adopted by the European Parliament with the approval of the Council and published in the Official Journal.
It is perfectly obvious that the withdrawal from election made by Mr Occhetto is the result of an expression of will that has been affected and vitiated by an agreement made prior to the proclamation of those elected in the 2004 European elections, that this agreement was entered into with the other member of the SocietÃ  civile Di Pietro-Occhetto list, and that this withdrawal must be considered incompatible with the letter and spirit of the Act of 1976, and specifically with Article 6.
It could not under any circumstances be validly revoked, as it was revoked.
In the grounds for the judgment holding the opposite to be true, the Italian Council of State - I want to confirm this in this Chamber, as an Italian - did not mention or take into account in any way the aforementioned principles of Community law, thereby disregarding not only the spirit and the letter of the Act but also Article 4 and Article 6 of the text.
Pursuant to settled case law by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the infringement of Community law by the authorities of a Member State, even when committed by a legal body of the highest level, through a final judgment, does not prevent the Court of Justice from holding that the supreme national court is in breach of Community law as mentioned above.
This does not, however, constitute a waiver of the responsibility of the State - in this case, Italy - to which the said court belongs, as has been established.
I believe that all this clearly demonstrates the situation in which we find ourselves.
I would like to quickly explain two things that are part of Italian law.
The act of withdrawal may validly have existing rights as its object, and in such a case the withdrawal made by Mr Occhetto with regard to Mr Chiesa is, because of its explanation, fully valid and effective.
The withdrawal also holds valid for future rights, but naturally the withdrawal may certainly be revoked before the event ends, before the withdrawing party finds himself in the actual circumstance of being able to withdraw.
The withdrawal expressed by Mr Occhetto following the proclamation of the electoral results did not alter the classification of the candidates on the Di Pietro-Occhetto list.
The final argument, Mr President, is that we must recognise as a basic principle of law the fact that withdrawal can only take effect at the moment in which the necessary prerequisites exist for the right to be realised.
For this very reason, in the decision of 3 July 2006 that is alleged to contradict what we have done - in fact because of that decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs - we have confirmed the election of Mr Occhetto, because at the time the proclamation was in conformity with the European Act, in that we recognised his withdrawal to be invalid, improper and null and void.
The exceptions with regard to Mr Donnici were then irrelevant.
It is because of this that there is no contradiction.
We took this decision last year, and today we can confirm that decision because it is consistent, thoroughly reflected on by a Committee on Legal Affairs that naturally has no partisan interest, but has every interest in promoting and guaranteeing the autonomy of this Parliament.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that we are at an important moment in the history of this Parliament.
The rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, has explained the legal reasoning, with which we agree.
My group has tabled a series of amendments aimed at enhancing this kind of legal reasoning.
We should look at the issue from a rather broader perspective, however.
The European Parliament - the Committee on Legal Affairs - has always recognised the decisions of the national authorities with regard to the appointment of an MEP, and has also recognised electoral dispute procedures.
What is not acceptable is for the Italian judiciary, practically three years after the last elections, a year after Mr Occhetto was accepted as a Member of this Parliament, to suddenly tell us that that appointment was not valid.
Mr Gargani has explained the reasons from a legal point of view, but there is a fundamental political aspect: Parliament is made up of Members appointed in accordance with national law, by means of decisions by national authorities: administrative, electoral or judicial.
Once we are in this Parliament, however, Parliament constitutes a body in its own right, with its own personality, with the right to defend itself.
I believe that the Occhetto case is going to set a great parliamentary precedent.
From this point onwards, the national administrative or judicial authorities will know that Parliament has the power, at a given moment, to declare that a national decision does not comply with the law, that it has been arbitrary.
Parliament has the right and the duty to protect its Members. If we do not do so, Mr President, we shall be exposed to a situation in which, as a result of an arbitrary decision by a national authority or national court, you or any other Member of this Parliament can have their status as MEP taken away.
It is essential to our parliamentary work that Members of Parliament should feel secure when carrying out their work.
I believe that Mr Gargani has done a great job as chairman - we have discussed many issues over many years - and in this case we have an agreement that is accepted by all of the parties, which does not reflect any party-political interest, but which responds to the need to defend the very status of the European Parliament.
The European Parliament, the body that represents the people of Europe, is established as a body in its own right and makes its own decisions.
It is not like the Council, which is subject to the vicissitudes of national politics.
We MEPs have a mandate, a fixed-term mandate that cannot be interrupted by means of an arbitrary national decision.
I shall therefore say once again that the Occhetto decision will be an historic decision in the history of Parliament, in the history of the affirmation of the personality of Parliament and of the rights of MEPs.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one thing with which I agree, it is that there is a risk that the decision by this Parliament may mark a genuinely historic step, in that it will compromise issues, problems, principles and rules that go far beyond this specific event.
This Parliament has never cast doubt upon the principle and rule laid down by the provisions of the Treaty on the national jurisdiction to settle disputes relating to electoral procedure and, thus, to proclaim those elected, with regard to whom Parliament then proceeds to carry out the so-called 'verification of credentials' - in other words, verification of electoral offices.
To confirm what I am saying, instead of commenting on it I would like to quote word for word the content of Parliament's decision, adopted on 14 December 2004 by this plenary, validating the mandate of all of us who were elected in those European elections.
The mandate was declared valid, and I quote exactly '...subject to any decisions by the competent authorities of Member States in which the election results have been disputed'.
This plenary confirmed a rule that is well-known to all!
I would like to add that in support of its decision the Committee on Legal Affairs refers to several articles both from the European Election Act and from the Rules of Procedure, referring to Parliament's jurisdiction to intervene in the event of resignations.
We are not talking about any resignations!
The issue on which the Italian courts handed down a judgment relates to the dispute or the resolution of the dispute regarding the election, once Mr Di Pietro had resigned as a Member of this Parliament, his replacement being Mr Occhetto or Mr Donnici.
The dispute was resolved by means of a provisional judgment, subject to appeal, which resulted in the proclamation of Mr Occhetto as the successful candidate; then came the judgment by the Italian Council of State - the Electoral Office, it is the same thing, Mr Gargani, it is not important - then came the judgment on the dispute, the final judgment by the Council of State, which proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate.
Let us not discuss the resignations by Mr Occhetto, their compatibility with the wording, with the letter or with the mandate - let us simply discuss the prerogative and the jurisdiction of the national authorities to proclaim a Member, whose electoral credentials are then verified.
The consequences of the vote that we are about to make would involve a serious institutional conflict, breach of the provisions of the Treaty, and a possible empty seat, because in any case it would be for the national authorities to proclaim the person elected to replace the person whose mandate was not validated.
I will end by expressing my full appreciation for the members of the committee.
Mr Gargani, nobody is casting doubt on the competence of the members; on the contrary, you have all my admiration, because the real skill of a jurist can be seen not when he is defending just causes, but when he is defending lost causes.
I have every appreciation and respect for the way in which you have succeeded in obtaining this result.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all respect to the multitude of authoritative jurists with which the Committee on Legal Affairs is swarming, more modestly, I believe that if this Chamber were to approve the Gargani report tomorrow, the European Parliament would be committing a very serious and unprecedented act.
It would be an unheard-of abuse of a Member who would see himself illegitimately deprived of his parliamentary mandate, and an unprecedented and unique breach of the treaties which, on electoral matters, clearly recognise the pre-eminence of the laws, procedures and authority of the Member States.
This would be a serious conflict with a Member State, which would be deprived of a Member recognised as such by the laws and the legal authority of that country.
Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs has usurped powers that do not belong to it.
I do not side with either of the two contenders.
I am politically indifferent because they are both from the centre left; I understand Mr Occhetto's personal problem, for which I have empathy in purely human terms.
What is at stake here, though, is the law, the correct composition of the European Parliament and the credibility of the highest Community institution.
Justice, and only justice, must therefore be done, and any hint of politics and petty political party calculations must be left aside.
What sort of trust can the citizens place in a European Parliament that distorts its own composition by excluding a Member who is eminently qualified to be a part of it?
Let us look at the facts: the legal authority proclaimed Mr Donnici as the successful candidate, in an unappealable judgment.
The Italian State notified the European Parliament of his election.
The committee was charged with verifying Mr Donnici's credentials.
It was supposed to verify the offices he held and any incompatibility in them.
It is of course true that it could examine appeals by third parties and therefore it legitimately examined the challenges put forward by Mr Occhetto.
What it could not do was to declare null and void an act delivered before a public official of a Member State.
This is a legal act that may be carried out solely by the legal authority of the Member State that has dealt with the matter and that has handed down an irrevocable and unappealable judgment.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mr Gargani, because the issue has been very complex and difficult, and the work has been completed with great wisdom and with a sense of responsibility, in accordance with just one criterion: safeguarding, above all, the rights and prerogatives of this Parliament.
The main or crucial point of the decisions taken is right and, above all, it avoids a precedent being set, namely the recognition of acts or initiatives that restrict the choices of candidates or of those who are about to become MEPs.
It is true that this is a first, and probably also sets a precedent, but this precedent and this first are fair and guarantee the prerogatives of the European Parliament.
The decisions that we are taking are linked to a function and to a prerogative that is granted to us, giving us the right to express ourselves, to accept, to assess or to reject credentials and acts that are put before us.
So this is not a case of going beyond our territory, but just the right to express an opinion that is given to us by this Parliament itself.
It is necessary firstly to protect the rights of our colleagues and secondly the rights of the European Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) I will vote against the proposal for a decision, for the following reasons which, I am certain, will be accepted by the Court of Justice. The proposal is misguided because:
1) in general, the appointment of those elected is the province of national bodies, as provided by Articles 7 and 11 of the Act of 20 September 1976;
2) in letter C: Mr Occhetto did not withdraw from the mandate at all, but from nomination by the Italian central electoral office and his position in the list of the candidates voted for; the withdrawal referred to in Rule 3(5) of the Rules of Procedure is that of a Member who has already been appointed and does not refer to acts preceding appointment;
3) in letter D: the prohibition on a binding mandate relates to the exercise of a mandate already received, and not to events preceding the appointment;
4) in letters E, F and G: the reference to the Statute for Members that has not yet entered into force is irrelevant, and so is the reference to Members subsequent to appointment;
5) in letters J, I, K and L: the Italian Council of State not only annulled but also amended the previous decision by the regional administrative tribunal, in a judgment not subject to appeal;
6) point 2: Parliament cannot replace the Italian office appointing a Member of Parliament.
Common organisation of agricultural markets (debate)
The next item is the report by Niels Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products - C6-0045/2007 -.
Madam President, I want to start by thanking Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and the rapporteur, Mr Busk, for the swift and constructive way the proposal was dealt with.
Secondly, on behalf of Mrs Fischer-Boel, I am grateful for the political support you are giving to the proposal.
I also greatly appreciate the positive thrust of the Committee on Agriculture's report.
We are discussing a very specific subject: the European Parliament's opinion on the single common market organisation, or CMO.
Simplification in the field of agriculture is one of the flagships of the Commission.
This text is different from most Commission proposals in the area of the CAP.
Why?
With the single CMO we want to make an important step towards simplifying and improving the legislative framework of the common agricultural policy.
I know that it has become popular to talk about simplification and better regulation. This proposal shows very clearly what these terms can mean in practice.
The single CMO will merge all 21 CMOs into one text. It will replace more than 40 Council regulations and almost 620 articles and it will reduce the number of articles and pages in the Official Journal by more than two thirds.
Apart from such merely quantitative parameters, the single CMO will make our market legislation more homogenous and consistent, in other words more easily accessed and read and thus better understood and applied.
According to the Presidency's planning, this proposal will be discussed at the meeting of the Special Committee for Agriculture on 29 May and 4 June and probably on 11 June in the Council.
Let me also at this stage thank Parliament for helping make this early decision possible.
From time to time the Commission is told that the single CMO is not enough to make our farmers' lives easier.
I fully agree.
It takes more than one legislative text to achieve real simplification.
That is why the single CMO is only one element, even though a very important one, of several components of simplification strategy in agriculture.
Other components, as you will recall, include the Commission's cross-compliance report, which will have a real impact on farmers' lives once its proposals are implemented, the simplification action plan, currently with 37 practical measures, which agriculture is busy implementing, and the health check, which will also be targeted at further simplifying the CAP.
But back to the CMO.
As I have already said, on behalf of the Commission, I appreciate the positive tone of the report and I will therefore be able to accept a number of amendments set out in the Committee on Agriculture report.
But you will not be surprised that I have some serious difficulties with some of the proposed amendments because I believe they would unnecessarily reduce the proposal's impact.
I would like to mention two points of particular importance.
First there is the request to keep two areas entirely out of the single CMO until they are reformed: fruit and vegetables and wine.
I do not share this view but I could accept incorporation of their substantive parts only after the reform processes are over.
The second point concerns the set-up of the management committee.
The Committee on Agriculture report recommends four subsections. This would in our view be in contradiction with the single CMO and make the new committee unnecessarily inflexible.
But I can assure you that the Commission is determined to organise the meetings of the single committee in such a way as to include the necessary expertise and take account of the specificities of the sectors concerned.
Thank you for your attention at this late hour.
I am looking forward to the discussion.
rapporteur. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I should like to thank the German Presidency and the Commission for their particularly constructive cooperation during the preparation of this report.
The cooperation has been based on openness and trust and has without a doubt contributed to this report being adopted by a very large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I would, of course, also thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for some interesting debates and for their major contribution to this report.
It has, overall, been a pleasure to cooperate with them on this matter.
The Commission has put forward a very ambitious proposal, which I welcome.
It is good to simplify and to create openness and transparency, and transparency is something that I do most certainly believe that this proposal will result in.
That being said, it should be added that this simplification is most evident of all in the legislative document itself, which overall has been reduced from 600 to 200 pages. This shows that a lot has happened.
This legislative package constitutes the agricultural industry's framework conditions, and the overarching objective should be to create clarity regarding the framework conditions, and in such a way that those at whom this report is targeted, namely the operators, also perceive the changes as a simplification.
There is no real policy change here, and the simplification will not be noticed in any way by the end-user, that is to say the farmer.
During the process, many people have complained that what has taken place has been anything but a simplification.
The operators have until now worked with one market organisation or perhaps with quite a small number of them.
These are now to be incorporated into just the one, which will comprise all the old organisations.
Some people may not immediately perhaps see the changes as a simplification.
For those, however, who use more than one of the sector-specific market organisations or those who want to obtain an overview of the different market organisations, this consolidated set of regulations is definitely a simplification.
The Commission proposes that a number of provisions of a technical nature be transferred from the Council to the Commission.
The provisions concerned are ones that, until now, the Council has been able to adopt without first consulting the European Parliament. These are what are known as the second-generation agreements.
Insofar as we are concerned exclusively in this case with provisions of a purely technical nature, I think it very appropriate to transfer these, as a regulatory power, to the Commission, which will thus be able to take some very rapid and effective decisions.
I should like, however, to emphasise that any decision of a political nature must still be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 37 of the Treaty, that is to say after consulting the European Parliament.
As a natural extension of the simplification, the Commission proposes that, in future, only one management committee be employed.
That is something I am very sceptical about, since I cannot imagine only one management committee being able to provide the necessary expertise.
There are such big differences between the many market mechanisms we have, for example as regards animal production and vegetable production, and that applies within all the various sectors.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has therefore proposed that four management committees be set up.
This is an area that I want the Commission to keep a careful eye on and that it should also report on.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like a progress report to be drawn up two years down the line.
We shall then have to look more closely at the number of management committees.
We must look at the organisation and at the support we receive from experts, and we must take an overall look at how this very important area - the market sector - operates.
In conclusion, I should like to wish the Commission good luck.
I am convinced that it will continue to be possible for the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to cooperate in this area.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur Mr Busk for the truly constructive, collegial and - in my opinion - very good work he has done in cooperation with the other members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We have all been calling for a simplification of the CAP and the market organisations for a long time.
I am delighted that it is agricultural policy, the only policy really brought within the Community, that is prepared to take this course.
I warmly welcome the fact that these 21 regulations on sector-specific market organisations are being combined into a single Regulation, and thus that the legal framework is being streamlined.
The rapporteur has already specified the benefits of this single common market organisation.
In my opinion, the CAP should be managed by means of the four basic regulations.
I fully agree with the rapporteur that this can only be a matter of technical changes, which are dealt with by the Commission, and not of changes to political decisions.
We, as representatives and Members of the European Parliament, want to, and must, insist on having codecision powers and on participating in dealing with these issues.
I also consider it important that the wine and the fruit and vegetables sectors be exempted, as the process of reform for these is not yet complete.
I am also in favour of the special management committees, as, particularly in very specific matters, things cannot just be lumped together.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and say on behalf of my group that this is a very successful report.
Madam President, the initiative to simplify the common agricultural policy and to adopt more comprehensible and transparent legal norms deserves our support, but on condition that the new regulation does not end up imposing yet another set of technical - supposedly universal - standards on the Community.
This begs the question as to whether such wide-ranging simplification is not tantamount to restricting specialisation, and the loss of sensitivity to specific agricultural conditions.
The Commission assures us that these are merely technical amendments, but in reality it also wants to take some of the powers away from the Council.
The Commission also assures us that all decisions of a political nature are taken in accordance with Article 37 of the EU Treaty, after consultation with the European Parliament.
But we know that this is not the case.
One instance of this rule being infringed was the sugar market reform.
Now, under the guise of technical amendments, it is trying to intervene in the pork market, which in combination with the elimination of maize subsidies, will destabilise these areas of agriculture and will again hit farmers' pockets.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group - (PL) Madam President, please allow me to re-iterate the fundamental facts of discrimination against the new Member States in the framework of the so-called 'common' agricultural policy.
And note that these statistics come from EU institutions.
For example, in 2004 the new Member States had 22% of the total farmland, but received just under 4% in subsidies.
Per-hectare agricultural and rural development subsidies in 2007 were EUR 148 per hectare for the new Member States, and EUR 366 per hectare for the old Member States.
A similar imbalance is expected for 2013, which means we face ten years of discrimination against the new Member States, thereby losing the opportunity to build up a strong European agriculture.
Imbalances in the allocation of milk quotas persist.
Holland, which has one-eighth of the farmland that Poland has, has a higher milk quota.
As regards the sugar market, the reform mainly favours the old Member States, which are the ones responsible for over-production in the first place.
And finally, the fruit and vegetable market, where some EUR 700 million are allocated to producers' organisations.
90% of these subsidies go to three Member States where they go to a narrow circle of the most powerful producers' organisations.
The processed fruit and vegetables market currently enjoys EUR 775 million of subsidies, of which more than 86% go to just three old Member States, and 2.5% goes to the new Member States.
All new Member States receive one-tenth of the average for one old Member State.
Ladies and gentlemen, in his speech before this House on 25 of April this year, the Indian President Abdul Kalam said amongst others that achieving a lasting solution required 'righteousness in the heart'. His message was warmly received with ovations by yourselves.
The agricultural market reforms we are discussing today has many good points: it will simplify legislation and reduce administrative costs, and make the lives of farmers easier.
But it has one fundamental flaw, and that is that it does not have 'righteousness in the heart', as it fails to correct the unfair subsidies for farmers on individual markets. It affects mainly the poorer farmers in the new Member States.
The poor get less, and the rich more.
This has nothing to do with fundamental principles of the European Union, such as solidarity.
The rules of the CAP are blatantly breached in many markets.
Repeated attempts to introduce fair subsidies for farmers in particular markets have proved ineffective.
Statistical data showing clear discrimination have been ignored.
The European Commission's present proposal retains some of the organisational defects of individual markets. It is artificial, unfair and cut off from the real situation.
Voting for simplification in this situation is voting for continued injustice and discrimination.
So I appeal mainly to the Members representing the new Member States: do not vote for simplification, because despite its apparent merits, it discriminates against your farmers.
At the same time I appeal to the representatives of old Member States: do you know that financial discrimination against the new states is a threat to the future of the entire European Union, and perpetuates the division of the EU into rich and poor by denying the idea of building a strong Europe capable of competing on the global market?
For this reason I am voting against the Commission's proposal and against adopting this report.
While I realise that simplifying legislation is necessary, it should only happen when individual markets have been organised fairly.
My fellow Europeans, let us all have 'righteousness in the heart'!
- Madam President, consolidation of 21 regulations on sector-specific common market organisations into a single regulation which combines all sectors as a simplification step is welcome.
But it is the impact delivered on the ground that really matters.
Simplification must translate into noticeable improvements in terms of a lesser bureaucratic burden for the agri-food sector right across the Member States.
If I have one major concern: we must not denude the new management committee - or committees, if it be that - of the valuable expertise which existed on the outgoing sectoral management committees.
A super CMO which, on the face of it, ticks the boxes of regulation reduction but which diminishes expert sectoral input would only be a short-term gain.
A triumph of bureaucrats over experts from the sectors is not a good deal.
Sectoral expertise has been valuable and must be preserved.
Thus, I think we need to hear more from the Commission in terms of assurances and indications as to how sectoral expertise will, in fact, be retained, utilised and respected.
- (PL) Madam President, today we are debating the simplification of CAP legislation.
On the table is the creation of a unified common agricultural market organisation in place of the 21 sectors that currently exist. We will be able to abrogate 41 Council regulations containing more than 600 articles and replace them by one single regulation.
These activities obviously deserve a positive response, if they lead to an improvement in EU legislation and will be more readily understood by farmers and taxpayers.
However, it all appears somewhat unrealistic.
Let me give you an example: the paying authority in Poland is now accepting applications for direct payments for the third time.
This year they have been so simplified that we were late in submitting them because the farmers had problems filling them in.
The whole idea of simplification will be technical in nature, and therefore cannot by metamorphosed in the latest CAP reform.
Removing intervention purchases for the pork meat market is not acceptable.
I would also tread carefully on the matter of transferring the Council's regulatory authority to the Commission, as it may give Member States less say in the decision-making process concerning the functioning of the first pillar of the CAP.
Another question that arises is what is the point of making all of these changes, when we are in the process of reforming the fruit and vegetable and wine markets anyway, and we do not know the results of the 2008 health check which will generally determine the future of the CAP.
In my view, we should streamline and simplify the system of direct payments in the EU 27 particularly, and equalise the rates of subsidies, and only then can we talk of equal conditions for competition.
As regards the simplicity of the SAPS system, we should consider its simplification for the EU 15.
Let us hope that this simplification, and the creation of a harmonised common market (...)
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good report.
He is a very experienced Member of this House and I would have expected nothing less from him.
There is no doubt that the need to streamline decision-making and removing red tape from the common agricultural policy is a primacy of importance.
It is my view that if we have to harmonise - and we must have harmonisation - we should always harmonise up to the best possible standard.
It is clear that better regulation can be achieved.
I do not want more and more civil servants - let me make that very clear - either in Brussels or in Member States making more difficulties for the farmers trying to do their job on the ground, creating and developing more problems than we would like to solve.
Yes, we need better regulation, but we also need more transparency.
I share Mr Busk's view on the need to keep intervention for pig meat, because this sector does - as we have experienced on numerous occasions - from time to time go into over-production, which is very difficult to control.
I believe that, for short periods, we require support in that sector.
I also believe that it would be going much too far, in the short term, to reduce the advisory committees, as we require a high degree of expertise on what can be extremely delicate issues.
I would give qualified support to the Commission to consolidate the existing 21 regulations.
It is my belief that we need less regulation, not more.
This is a welcome start, and I trust we can look forward to the health check to bring forward even more deregulation.
Let us destroy red tape in the common agricultural policy forever.
(PL) Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Niels Busk for his report in such a difficult area as the creation of a harmonised and common organisation for agricultural markets.
Replacing the 21 common market organisations by a single horizontal Regulation of the Council for a single market organisation will undoubtedly lead to a simplification and improvement of the legal structure of the first pillar of the CAP, and to greater transparency in agricultural legislation.
However, we must not forget that creating a uniform, common market organisation is a process of technical simplification which cannot incorporate elements of policy change.
The work currently underway on the new directive cannot mean the endorsement of the adopted rules of the CAP, and should not be a pretext for changing political decisions already taken in respect of agricultural policy.
In this regard, the Commission's proposal to remove the intervention group on the pig meat market, which in Poland at least is so important, is unjustified.
The European Commission's proposal to create a single committee to manage the common organisation of agricultural markets also arouses doubts in me.
Can one committee with a limited number of national experts function properly?
Will this solution not result in a limitation of the influence of Member States on the administration of market instruments?
How does the Commission intend to ensure the full representation of national expertise in the committee-based process?
Would the above not indicate the need for at least a few management committees, including separate committees for the meat, milk and vegetable markets?
And one final question: As regards extending the authority of the Commission, I would like to say that the competences of the Council can only be transferred to the European Commission on technical matters which do not have any effect on the functioning of the agricultural markets.
This means that the authority to define quality standards and the system of classifying carcasses on the beef, veal and pork markets, the authority to determine trading standards on the egg, poultry and live plant market should be within the competence of the Council, and not the European Commission.
Furthermore, any questions of a political nature should continue to be discussed with the Council and Parliament.
Madam President, honourable Members, this was a very interesting discussion, I should like to thank you very much for it.
First of all, let me recall that this exercise is indeed about simplification and not about another reform of the CAP or a redistribution of aid as some have feared.
I think it also revealed that there are quite a few points which I can accept or where I am certain that acceptable solutions will eventually be found, notably on the carcass classification, the reference to potato starch quotas and also a clause giving a further assurance that the status quo for producer and inter-branch organisations is maintained.
As far as the fruit and vegetable and wine sectors are concerned, and their inclusion in the single CMO from the outset and as regards the kind of management committee, I have already made my point.
In some cases the report is asking to go beyond the status quo of what we have today.
I do not think we should introduce any such amendments on this occasion as that would change the character of the exercise.
Concerning the set-up of the management committee - a matter raised by Mr Busk - organising four subsections would go against the idea of a single CMO and make the new committee unnecessarily inflexible.
But we can assure you that the Commission is determined to organise the meetings of the single committee in such a way as to include the necessary expertise and take account of the specificities of the sectors concerned.
Let me also make very clear that with regard to the role of the European Parliament, technical decisions and market management decisions need to be decided at Commission level.
In no way is the Commission receiving powers to amend substantive or any other policy decisions.
Therefore Parliament is not being bypassed.
The Commission's powers will be restricted to implementing rules.
I can assure you of that.
With regard to pigmeat, I am not so certain why an instrument that has not been used in more than 30 years should still be considered as a basic policy decision that needs to be maintained.
In concluding, let me stress once again in answer to the points raised regarding the complexity and the bureaucracy of the CAP, this is just a first step.
Others will follow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of sitting
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)
Madam President, on a point of order, under our Rules of Procedure, Annex I, Article 2, any Member who has not submitted a declaration of interests has to be reminded of this fact by the President.
If he or she continues to fail to do so, this fact is published in the Minutes.
It is then stated that, if the Member continues to refuse to submit the declaration, the President shall take action in accordance with Rule 147 to suspend the Member concerned.
I see from the Minutes of the sitting on Monday that Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Nattrass, from the UK Independence Party, have still failed to complete their declaration of interests.
It is now several months in a row that they have been named and shamed in the Minutes and I would urge the President to take action appropriate to the situation.
It undermines the reputation and the credibility of this House.
I shall pass that on, Mr Corbett.

Kashmir: present situation and future prospects (debate)
The next item is the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Kashmir: present situation and future prospects.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I am honoured to present the Committee on Foreign Affairs report entitled 'Kashmir: present situation and future prospects'.
This report correctly contrasts the situation between the world's largest secular democracy which has devolved structures at all levels - India, including Jammu and Kashmir - and Pakistan, which still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan.
It also highlights the fact that there is considerable evidence that over many years Pakistan has provided Kashmiri militants with training, weapons, funding and sanctuary and has encouraged militants to commit atrocities on the Indian-administered side.
It takes a firm line on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir.
It is also constructive as it highlights the common heritage shared by India and Pakistan, exemplified in the ancient culture of Jammu and Kashmir, and recognises and values the pluralism, multiculturalism and multi-faith nature and secular traditions of the peoples of Jammu and Kashmir, which have been kept alive in the Indian part of Jammu and Kashmir.
This is an enlightened and balanced report, which denounces terrorism and those who support terrorism; it promotes a vision of peace, coexistence, friendship and economic integration and commerce between peoples on both sides of the border and in Gilgit and Baltistan along the lines of the European Union model.
I urge this House to adopt it in its entirety, with certain amendments, so that an unambiguous message is sent to the disturbers of peace in that part of the world that the international community will not tolerate extremism or terrorism any more and that we respect and uphold the rights and ethnicity of the Kashmiri people.
I have with me a strong statement - of this morning - by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, in which she welcomes this report for drawing attention to the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people; for reaffirming the EU's commitment to the settlement of dispute by peaceful means; for taking note of the impact of the earthquake and urging the European Union to help and support the Kashmiris; for supporting the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights; for urging the Indian and Pakistan Governments to facilitate the ceasefire on the Line of Control by calling further on militant armed groups to enrol in a disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation process; for encouraging the Pakistan Government to transform the ceasefire in place in Siachin since 2003 into a lasting peace agreement; for urging both governments to allow international human rights organisations immediate and unrestricted access to all parts of the former princely state in order to investigate the human rights situation there; for calling on the Indian Government to put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings, 'disappearances', torture and arbitrary detentions in Jammu and Kashmir; for calling on the Indian and Pakistani authorities to ease restrictions on travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad; for urging Pakistan to revisit its concepts of fundamental rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religious practices in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan; for calling for the first-ever elections to be held in Gilgit and Baltistan and for seeking higher democratic representation in the Northern Areas.
She firmly supports this report.
I am proud to inform the House that Imran Khan MP, former captain of the Pakistan cricket team and now head of his political party Tehreek-e-Insaaf, today pledged his full support for this report.
The plight of the Kashmiri people has been of concern to the international community for nearly 60 years.
The European Union strongly supports regional integration, trade liberalisation and economic cooperation.
The European Parliament is keenly interested in all aspects of the situation.
Let me draw your attention to the hundreds of young people who demonstrated in favour of this report, calling for the democratic freedoms that we recommend.
They were beaten up by the police, their banners and petitions to the UN were destroyed.
They demonstrated again.
Two hundred of their relatives were kidnapped and have not been heard of since.
Subsequently, many thousands of citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir have held meetings and pledged their full support for the report.
Over the border in Jammu and Kashmir, India continues to be criticised for her large military presence.
The report is strong on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, as in the other areas.
In Gilgit and Baltistan, the people are kept in poverty, illiteracy and backwardness.
The report makes clear its support for the current peace process.
It recognises the ancient and unique heritage of the Kashmiri people.
It reflects many principles of the European Union.
I earnestly hope that this House will support the report as wholeheartedly during the vote today as it was supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Madam President, I followed with great interest the very lively debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Kashmir report by Baroness Nicholson.
There is much food for thought in this report.
It is too comprehensive for me to be able to respond in detail today, but I should like to reflect on some of the issues which it raises.
The focus on Kashmir is timely.
On the political front, there have been many positive developments, which, for the first time in many years, give some hope that this long-standing issue is getting closer to a solution.
Both India and Pakistan have indicated that the Line of Control could become a 'soft border'.
The European Union has expressed its firm support for the reconciliation process between India and Pakistan.
But the road is still full of pitfalls.
It is encouraging that the composite dialogue process remains on track despite terrorism.
I was in Delhi when the terrible attacks on the daily Lahore-Samjhota Express train took place last February.
It would indeed be tragic if the peace process could be taken hostage by terrorists.
I see no alternative to both countries addressing their differences through dialogue.
