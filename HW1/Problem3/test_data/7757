There are two issues of absolutely fundamental importance to us as a Liberal group.
Firstly, trade and the environment: for us issues such as the interaction between trade and multilateral environmental agreements, eco-labelling, the incorporation of the precautionary principle are not add-ons or luxuries, they are absolutely fundamental to the future credibility of the WTO and, arguably, of globalisation as a political process itself.
We feel strongly, therefore, that without those kinds of provisions in the next round of negotiations, it will simply become politically unsellable and unsustainable within Europe.
Secondly on agriculture, our own views are that paragraphs 23 to 25, whilst just above adequate, are a little convoluted and mealy-mouthed on agriculture.
We prefer the emphasis in paragraph 6 because it draws attention to the fundamental fact, highlighted recently by a study from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, that the greatest instrument to alleviate poverty is the further liberalisation of agriculture.
That is a fundamental principle for us which we hope will be fully respected in the next round.
Our group has not signed the compromise resolution with the larger groups for a number of reasons, but the most important one is this: We believe that fundamental reform of the World Trade Organisation's processes and rules must be a precondition for any new round of trade talks.
Reform is not something that can be simply addressed as one issue among many in a new multilateral trade round where it risks being traded off against other interests and demands.
In our view, the WTO faces such a crisis of legitimacy in public opinion that reform must come before any further negotiations, and that is the position we have put forward in our joint resolution with the GUE Group.
Now that is not a tactic for putting off indefinitely the start of a new round.
In our view, nothing has slowed down the WTO more than the debacle in Seattle which was caused in no small part by the chaotic and exclusive structures, rules and procedures of the WTO.
So, for those who believe in multilateral trade rules, as we do, serious reform is not an option but a necessity.
The lessons of the failed Seattle Ministerial were that the WTO must become a fully democratic and transparent organisation which genuinely supports sustainable development and which effectively responds to the needs of developing countries.
They need to be far bigger players in the WTO.
Their marginalisation needs to end and they need to be listened to.
In recent weeks, many poorer countries have made it clear that for them addressing concerns about the implementation of Uruguay Round commitments should be a precondition for a new round.
Just two days ago, a communication from the G77 reiterated that position.
Our group agrees with developing countries when they oppose new issues on the agenda on the grounds that expanding that agenda would over stretch the capacity of many developing countries which are already struggling to participate effectively in the WTO process.
It would distract attention from the unfinished development business and increase the risk that developing countries will end up accepting disadvantageous trade-offs.
The possible opt-outs that are on offer are not a realistic or effective way of dealing with these concerns, since developing countries still do not have the capacity now to affect the negotiations of an agreement which they may be later under pressure to sign.
Pressing ahead with a new trade round in the face of major opposition from the majority of developing countries is not helpful.
Simply calling it a development round without genuinely addressing the demands of developing countries is a sleight of hand that fails to address their real concerns.
Finally, our group agrees that strong international rules are needed to manage trade.
We agree very much that internationalism is important, but the current international trade rules favour narrow business interests and not the poor and the environment.
Changing those rules is the priority for Doha, not launching a new round.
Mr President, after 11 September, we have every reason to redouble our commitment to multilateralism.
Persisting with the Doha meeting and making it a success are, therefore, of considerable political importance.
Of course, we cannot at this stage hope for the sea change that is required, but adapting, improving and consolidating the WTO system would at least be a good start.
As supporters of the multilateral approach, we must fulfil this commitment.
The criminals who destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center know the value of symbols.
Making trade the focus of coexistence with other countries is a deeply reductive approach and directing world trade centrally is unacceptable.
Multilateralism must be neither asymmetrical nor imperialist.
Doha will not be Seattle, however.
Civil movements have helped to make their leaders think, the southern countries are, with the welcome support of the Commission, playing an increasingly important role and the time when Carla Hills wanted to use a crowbar to open up other countries' markets to her own will will soon be a thing of the past.
Doha is not a sign of a new wave of liberalisations, but nor is it an agenda for development.
It will be something vague between the two.
An agenda will be negotiated there whose objectives will remain general.
There has been no prior negotiation of the outcome, fortunately, and we approve of the principle of the Union' s mandate: to set a broad agenda, but more than just balancing liberalisation by means of rules, there is no getting away from the fact that we must try to resolve the contradictions between society' s choices and trade rules.
The social issue is symbolic.
The main front on which we need to fight is finance, and a Union which allows tax havens to flourish within its borders must put its own house in order.
Nobody can claim, though, that trade has nothing to do with fundamental rights.
The WTO may not be the place to produce social conventions, but it certainly does have a responsibility to ensure coherence.
The implementation of the Marrakech agreements and the incorporated agenda on agriculture and services will be at the centre of the forthcoming round.
The legitimacy of the trade interests of the South must be recognised but the problem will lie in preventing negotiations boiling down to a process of tough haggling over their interests and our own.
The concerns of northern societies as of those of the South must lead to a change in trade rules and to break their monopoly that favours one group.
With this in mind, we must accept that we will have to open the door to the renegotiation of certain rules, in particular, those concerning intellectual property.
Lastly, although the democratisation of the WTO will certainly not be on the agenda, it is nevertheless clear that this round will not succeed if it is nothing more than a diplomatic battle between countries, even if the European Union is happy to play the honest mediator.
Civil society must be involved; we must consult our citizens and take account of their criticism and their demands.
This is the only way to ensure that democracy will penetrate the WTO.
Mr President, Commissioner, on the eve of this new meeting of the World Trade Organisation, which I prefer to call the Trading the World Organisation, you have used the correct term: legitimacy.
The failure of Seattle, which I predicted, several weeks beforehand and in writing - forgive me if I gloat - was entirely due, in my opinion, to this twofold lack of legitimacy.
Firstly, because the WTO itself has no legitimacy and, whatever people may think, is not up to the task that it has set itself.
I am talking more precisely, however, about the absence of legitimacy of the European Union and I must say that this is not meant as personal criticism or criticism of the quality of the very idea of having a single negotiator, even if it does have a mandate, to replace all of our old nations, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, which have, since the early middle ages, expanded on the mould of this international trade, which is now global.
No one can picture you, whatever your qualities, which everyone recognises, promoting both the interests of all of these countries and maintaining the diplomatic channels that the history of our ancient nations could allow us to fulfil, either with Latin America for Spain, Africa for France, etc. There is, as always, a huge pretentiousness or even vanity, on the part of the European Union, in seeking to replace, in one fell swoop, a thousand years of history and in claiming to be able to fulfil this role.
The second stumbling block, of course, is the hypocrisy of the World Trade Organisation, which is approaching these negotiations like a wolf approaches a lamb.
Since the financial world effectively took control of the economy twenty years ago, international trade is now mainly an excuse to continually, ceaselessly and forever and beyond expand the sphere of financial speculation to the point that these negotiations are beginning to look like a big raffle held for the benefit of those organising the raffle.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, international trade is in crisis: according to the forecasts of the Istituto affari internationali, 2001 will see growth of 2% compared to the 13% in 2000.
I feel it is right to raise the issues of WTO reforms, legitimacy and transparency of decisions so that we do not lose sight of the WTO' s primary, unique mission which is to extend international trade.
This is why Doha must not fail: it must not fail because it has to ensure the sustained expansion of international trade over the next few years.
The responsibility of the success or failure of Doha lies with Europe and the other more advanced countries.
In general, I feel that we must take note of certain considerations and questions.
Firstly, in my opinion, we must stop following the line of reciprocity at all costs. Removing the barriers to trade - even unilaterally - is not an act of surrender.
It is a farsighted measure, particularly in economic terms. I commend Commissioner Lamy for taking this approach with the Everything but Arms initiative, although we will have to explain to the European citizens that, under that initiative, which was well-received and rightly so, banana duties will fall definitively in 2009, that is in 10 years time - a geologically important period in many respects - and we will also have to tell them why.
A further problem we must avoid is overloading Doha with an oversized agenda.
I would stress that Doha has a specific mission.
We must not overload Doha and the WTO by attempting to use them to put right a number of issues which we feel need to be rectified in the world today.
Certain positions expressed on the environment, health and employment standards do nothing to defend us against accusations that the advanced countries and Europe are actually using the extension of the agenda for protectionist ends.
The developing countries are in a strong position and are not so very far from the truth when they say that all these so very politically correct issues actually serve to slow down the opening up of our markets to goods which have to come, first and foremost, from the least developed countries.
With regard to agriculture, I feel that we must bring to an end this game of hide-and-seek, this game of role plays between Europe and the United States in which, while we are waiting for someone to make the first move and start to reduce agricultural protection, we are all maintaining duty levels and levels of agricultural subsidies which are incompatible with the liberalisation of trade in the agricultural sector, when, as has been pointed out, this is one of the sectors which could most be most beneficial to the developing countries.
In Europe, we grant a subsidy of a dollar a day per bovine animal - and these animals are not high quality, they are our own mad cows - when there are one billion, three hundred thousand human beings who have to live on less than one dollar a day.
There you have it: if we genuinely want the WTO and Doha to be successful, these are the issues we must address. We must be bold and, I would stress, abandon the principle of 'reciprocity at all costs' .
Unilateral measures opening up international trade benefit, first and foremost, those who have the courage to implement them.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy deserves our gratitude for referring to the much-needed institutional reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in European trade policy.
I wish to ask you Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether you can support this position when you are assembling your papers for the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference and, firstly, for the Convention for which we are all striving?
It is there that the breakthrough should at last occur, so that the European Parliament can draw even in institutional terms with the American Senate and House of Representatives.
In the next few years, the WTO will, through the imminent accession of China and Taiwan - both of which have long been important trading partners of Europe - and the eventual accession of Russia, gain a global dimension, giving it an even greater worldwide representative role and presenting it with new challenges.
To achieve this, it will have to adapt its structures and change the way it works.
With Qatar, there is the additional factor that we must make a start and genuinely involve all the developing countries, not only the representatives of the least developed, in the negotiations.
The technical aid which the EU and the other industrialised countries are called upon to provide is crucial for these countries' future real involvement in the decision-making process.
The WTO must, however, also increase its efficiency despite these changes and become more transparent and more readily understood by the world's citizens.
How will the WTO harmonise its new, strengthened universality with the need to become even more efficient and make markets more open?
Our resolution attempts to reconcile these two requirements, although surely incompletely as yet.
We Europeans must contribute our environmental legislation, our regulations on food safety, our multifunctional agriculture and our social security legislation as expressions of a tangible European reality.
Now, some weeks after 11 September, it is particularly important, partly as a response to terrorism, that we, the EU and, particularly, the European Parliament, continue without distraction on our way towards greater openness and democracy in the WTO and resolutely set about the necessary reforms.
We need to promote fair and freer world trade rather than seal ourselves off by means of protectionism and fall back upon national markets.
We must also strive to realise soon the central proposition of the European Parliament - the establishment of an effective parliamentary assembly for the WTO, to be the world's mouthpiece in trading matters.
We therefore need representatives of the American Congress in Doha as well.
We are relying on the parliaments of the industrialised states, of the emergent countries and of all the developing countries.
May we ask, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if you, at the end of your presidency of the Council, could give your support to this proposal, which we must implement as soon as possible?
We support Commissioner Lamy's efforts at using our cooperative structures to involve Africa in particular - Africa, that continent which is largely forgotten by world trade - more intensively in dialogue on the subject of a parliamentary assembly.
Our seminar on 12 April was the first example of a successful conference on trade, democracy and development to involve our friends from Africa alongside the representatives of the industrialised countries in America, Europe and Asia.
Technical support from the Commission and our parliamentary budget played an important part in this.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Minister Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic events of 11 September have led to a re-emergence of two concepts which seemed to have been forgotten: multilateralism and solidarity.
Firstly, political practice is developing in such a way that we can only confront global threats in a global fashion: all united.
Furthermore, we also know that poverty and underdevelopment are significant causes of insecurity.
A Japanese thinker, Daisako Ikeda, said that the new concept of security, which focuses on the security of States, must be defined differently, focusing on the well-being of peoples.
Only by extending freedom, human rights and development can we recover our security.
At the same time, these events have speeded up the decline in confidence in our security and the economy, areas which were already showing signs of weakness.
It is therefore now important that we send clear signs of revitalisation and attention to the concerns of our citizens and, above all, to the concerns of the countries which need it most, that is, the developing countries.
It must therefore be an absolute priority to launch this new round of multilateral negotiations in Qatar on the date set, not yet to negotiate, but at least to set the agenda in the direction we wish to take.
We want to move towards a result which provides a balance between opening up trade and subjecting that trade to rules, internal democratic, and external democratic, rules, which respect fundamental social standards, the environment and the security of our consumers.
We also want a balance between an increase in exchanges and special attention to the concerns of our citizens, as well as the concerns and needs of the developing countries, who must be allowed to share fully in the benefits of international trade.
In summary, therefore, the mandate which the Council has given to the Commission, in our opinion, corresponds to these balances and deserves our full support.
I would like to thank Commissioner Lamy for the sensitivity he has always shown towards the European Parliament and his constant cooperation.
In return, Parliament and the parliamentary delegation which will accompany him to Qatar will offer him all their support.
Mr President, in Doha the EU must show its hand.
On which side does the EU really stand in the global North-South conflict?
Things are looking quite bad.
In spite of the stream of protests from, for example, India and Malaysia, the least developed countries, the G77 group, China and a host of environmental and solidarity movements, the EU intends, together with the United States, to try to play its trump card by making the WTO' s free trade doctrine apply not only to traditional trade but to practically the whole of economic life.
According to what Commissioner Lamy said in a statement earlier today, the EU' s main objective is to open the markets of the developing countries to EU companies.
When it comes to TRIPS and GATS, too, it is obvious that the EU is on a collision course with the developing countries.
In this global struggle, which is more crucial than the fight against terrorism, a number of 'progressive' people have believed that the EU could constitute a tool actually to combat neo-liberal globalisation.
If the EU does not change its tactics, there is everything to indicate, however, that, when it comes to the crunch, the WTO meeting in Doha will be proof that all the fine declarations of solidarity are being abandoned.
It is then that a 'policy of naked interest' appears, that is to say, a policy that places the EU alongside the United States and against the majority of the world' s poorer countries.
Mr President, obviously the diverse manifestations of democratic resistance to the dangers of an uncontrolled expansion of the WTO's powers have given pause for thought.
It seems, however, that well-intentioned appeals are not going to prevent it from going down this path.
It is simply the case that trade in goods and money transactions are governed by the law of the market.
The market is, by its very nature, immoral.
Those who want to maintain their hold on the market have to make a profit or else they go under.
The WTO has obviously set itself the goal of cutting the market off from the demands of society at large and even from parliaments.
The opinions now on the table at least show an awareness of the problem.
It is right to take small steps.
However, far more ambitious steps must follow.
We cannot wash the coat of the bear which the WTO has become without getting the animal itself wet.
Our aim must be to work towards a new global economic order which distributes the wealth of this earth differently, justly and fairly, overcomes poverty, establishes and guarantees broad-based democratic cooperation giving parliaments a voice, and makes independent economic development possible for all countries.
The European Parliament should do everything within its power to challenge the Council and the Commission to do this.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank you for the efforts you have made and the strategy you have employed in preparing for the Doha Summit, to promote fairer and more balanced sustainable development on a world scale, which contributes to respect for fundamental social rights and the protection of the environment, the benefits of which also reach the least-developed countries.
Kofi Annan recently said that the Doha Summit must be the development summit.
If this is to be the case, it is essential that the developing countries can be fully integrated into the structures of the WTO and they must be given easier access to world trade.
That is why I want to insist on the importance of the technical measures for developing countries, because it is these measures which will allow these countries to take full advantage of the commercial opportunities offered by the liberalisation of the markets.
Repealing or renegotiating the agreements already adopted is not the solution.
On the contrary, in Doha the European Union must remind all the member countries of the WTO that it is necessary to respect the commitments made in the existing agreements, just as the European Union has respected its commitments.
I am thinking specifically of the textile industry, which has strictly respected its commitment to open up its market, increasing quotas and progressively increasing the application of the GATT rules in the sector, which is something that not all countries have done, including the most developed countries.
It is true that trade, even if it is multilateral, will not in itself resolve the inequalities of our planet, but it may reduce them by reconciling the interests and concerns of all the parties involved, especially those of the weakest.
The European Union has proven experience in this task and we hope that after Doha, by following the line we have taken until now, Commissioner, we can finally succeed in it.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, like others, I wear a badge which symbolises trade with justice.
Open trade - yes, but only with rules.
Our national and European interests, yes of course, but also the interests of the developing world - your approach, Commissioner, and ours.
I am going to concentrate on two frankly difficult areas - TRIPS and the environmental aspects of trade which you have already mentioned.
Firstly, TRIPS: what we now have in the agreement is not clear enough or good enough.
Intellectual property rights are important in world trade, but we thought that the 25.5 million HIV positive people in sub-Saharan Africa could have access to cheap drugs under TRIPS.
Let us ensure that this is made more explicit after Doha.
Ironically, the United States, the world's most fierce defender of intellectual property rights is now faced with the dilemma of needing huge supplies of antibiotics to combat anthrax.
Attitudes may change with new circumstances - in any case, they have to.
Secondly, environmental standards.
The EU faces charges of protectionism.
Commissioner, you know that this is not the case, that we are ready to help developing countries in any way necessary as we are helping applicant countries, that we have science on our side and that we will not abandon our hard-won progress - why should we?
Multilateral environment agreements cannot be discarded in the name of free trade and the precautionary principle must be explicitly included in WTO rules.
This is a deal-breaker for us.
We in the EU know more than any other part of the world how untrammelled free trade can be controlled through multilateral rule-making to the benefit of our citizens.
Our achievements in the EU are relevant elsewhere, and we should defend them - your task Commissioner.
I know you will be tough on our behalf.
I hope you will be tough too on core labour standards.
Seattle did not work - Doha can if it is fair and if there is a balance of trade and justice.
Good luck Commissioner.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I will just say a few additional words, which perhaps have more to do with practicalities and less to do with the substance. Firstly, I should like to compliment Commissioner Lamy most particularly on the superb cooperation which we are enjoying and - I think that I speak for everyone - on the excellent manner in which he is representing the European Union in the run-up to this forthcoming trade round.
His task will certainly be a difficult one.
The right balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, representing European interests and, on the other, ensuring that the other countries, our negotiating partners, and in particular the developing countries, are brought on board.
Personally, I believe that this round will, more than any other, be able to send out a message to the world that it is possible to reconcile trade and politics.
I trust, Commissioner Lamy, that you are in a position to achieve this, working together with your colleague Bob Zoelleck, but also with the many other negotiating partners that you have.
It will not be an easy task.
However, everything bodes well.
I am grateful to you for consistently encouraging Parliament to play a more significant role in trade policy.
Regrettably the Council has not taken the same step.
Like you, I hope that we will be able to achieve more in this respect in the future.
Incidentally, I should also like to thank all those colleagues in this House who have always supported this policy.
I should, moreover, like to remind you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you also have a task to carry out in Doha, namely organising the meeting with all of the trade ministers.
We have a good tradition of arranging for the European Parliament's delegation to meet the ministers attending the trade round.
I would earnestly request that you organise this meeting again this time and also ensure that we have a debate and that it is not just an occasion for a chat or seen as a bit of an afterthought, as the Council is wont to do, but that it really is an occasion for serious dialogue.
In addition, I should also like to inform you very briefly - my colleague, Konrad Schwaiger, mentioned this - that the parliaments will also have a joint meeting in Doha.
The invitation will be extended jointly by the President of this House and the President of the IPU.
I hope that we will make progress there.
Here, too, we need your support, Madam President-in-Office of the Council.
We have always had this support from the Commission.
Thank you once again for cooperating with us.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to extend a warm thanks to all those who have taken the floor in this debate, for the good wishes they have conveyed to Commissioner Lamy and hopefully the Council presidency too, and I hope that we indeed manage to organise a balanced trade round with a broad-based agenda.
My only comment in this respect is that I very much appreciate the fact that you have valued our respective efforts to improve the atmosphere prior to the start of such a round, and that you, as it were, assisted us in those efforts.
This is a tremendous boost a fortnight prior to the start of this Fourth Ministerial Conference.
If you allow me, Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to the specific questions that have been raised, notably those by Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann about the role of parliaments and Members of Parliament.
Mr Schwaiger, I can only respond on behalf of my government with regard to our position concerning an amendment to Article 133 of the Treaty.
I can only say to him that it was not the Belgian government that has precluded an amendment to the article.
We will continue to strive towards a broadening of the Commission' s negotiation authority under that article, and towards greater parliamentary involvement.
Secondly, I can say to Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Mann that I am delighted with the initiative for a parliamentary meeting in Doha; that appears to me to be extremely important.
I will therefore be very happy to lend my support to this effort, and I hope that it will be possible to inject a little more stability into the meeting, because I believe it to be absolutely of fundamental importance for Members of Parliament - for in addition to MEPs, the meeting will, of course, also be attended by a number of national MPs - to learn to listen to each other.
Maybe it will then be a little easier for us, members of the government, to convince our national parliaments of the accuracy of some of our claims when they hear those expressed by their colleagues from other countries, and particularly from developing countries. I welcome this development with open arms.
It is significant in itself. It will also contribute towards more transparency in the activities of the World Trade Organisation.
This does bring me to one minor remark made by Mrs Lucas who believes that the World Trade Organisation should be reformed first, before negotiations can commence.
I should like to say to her that I cannot see how any changes could be made to the way the organisation works without a negotiation round.
I should like to draw her attention to the fact that the very careful preparation of the Doha conference in itself bears witness to an entirely different approach from before. Finally, I should like to remind her that the World Trade Organisation is, in fact, a very young organisation which is very much open to improvement, and we will happily take part in this exercise.
I gladly promise Mrs Mann, I will be organising a meeting with the Members of Parliament in Doha.
Mrs Mann, you know very well that you and Mr Westendorp, as well as a few other MEPs, have had the opportunity to exchange ideas with us immediately prior to the start of the informal External Trade Council, so we will naturally carry on with this tradition.
Mr President, I too wish to thank the speakers who have stated their support for the Commission' s position - including the President-in-Office of the Council - and also to thank those who have wished the negotiators good luck.
Custom dictates that I should answer those who expressed more critical views and who, in tomorrow' s vote will not be adopting the position that the majority groups have stated they will.
I shall do so briefly, replying first to Caroline Lucas - speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - the reasoning in whose speech I consider to contain a slight contradiction.
On the one hand, Mrs Lucas, your group is in favour of tougher rules governing trade - specifically from the point of view of considering the environment - and yet, on the other, it is not in favour of negotiations taking place.
You must have some solution for changing international rules that does not involve negotiating.
Please tell me about it, because I have no such solution.
To Mr Herzog, whose group I understand intends to adopt a similar position, I would like to say that I particularly liked your expression 'tough haggling' .
There will indeed be some of that.
It is true that the WTO sometimes seems a little bit like a grocer' s shop but we must also remember that the more progress globalisation makes, the more trade develops and, occasionally, the more our values are at stake.
In these cases, I think that toughness becomes a duty, whatever resentment this may engender.
Mr Abitbol spoke on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
You lament the fact, Mr Abitbol, that the Union has a single negotiator.
I would remind you that this issue was decided for the future of the European Union 44 years ago.
You choose to see in this the vanity of our founding fathers.
Fifty years on, all I can see is their foresight.
Lastly, Mr Abitbol, on the point you made, as on other critical points that were made, I would simply remind you that although the Commission negotiates on behalf of the Union, it does so under the control of those who gave it its mandate, which are the Council of Ministers and Parliament.
Both will be attending the meeting: the Council, representing the States and Parliament' s delegation, with which you are familiar.
In all honesty, I really cannot envisage a more effective method of ensuring that the negotiator' s political responsibility is maintained throughout.
It is up to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to oversee this process of giving account but, ultimately, I shall return with a position that I have negotiated and it will be up to the Council and Parliament to state their position with regard to the Treaties.
This is how our democracy works.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
International trade
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0331/2001) by Mr DÃ©sir, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on democracy and opening up international trade (2001/2093(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transition from the GATT era to that of the WTO changed the dimension as well as the nature of the multilateral trading system.
With the advent of the WTO, trade rules were extended to a large number of new areas, including services, intellectual property, investment and rules on non-tariff barriers, that frequently affect non-trade issues.
These rules have a binding force, which is backed by a dispute settlement system with the capacity to impose sanctions.
Finally, enlargement, which begun under GATT, has resulted in an unprecedented diversity among its members with regard to international trade.
The rules of the multilateral trading system now apply not only to the countries that account for most of world trade or only to the one-fifth of world production that is traded across borders.
They also apply to goods and services that will never be traded internationally.
All countries are concerned and their internal rules affected, whatever their share of international trade.
In recent years, trade agreements have also had a growing impact on other international rules in areas such as the environment, health and social rights.
Thus, WTO agreements or decisions have threatened the precautionary principle, environmental protection and access to medicines.
The cause of this is partly the ambiguity of some agreements, such as the agreement on intellectual property, in the case of medicines, but with regard to public services, the scope of Article 1 of the General Agreement on Services is also to blame.
To this, we can add another reason for the undermining of the multilateral trade system: the democratic legitimacy of the WTO, an intergovernmental organisation, in principle, relies firstly on the equal participation of all members, on the fact that they have an equal say in the organisation.
Most of the developing countries, however, feel marginalised by its operation and cut off from the decision making process.
At least 24 developing countries that are members of the WTO have no permanent representation in Geneva, and numerous others have only very small delegations that do not allow them to follow all of the proceedings that concern them.
Many developing countries lack the necessary competences.
In such situations, form and content are real issues for developing countries because the rules and agreements more often reflect the interests of the trading powers that have negotiated them between themselves, sometimes in 'green rooms' or in informal meetings, which are far too secretive - than the interests of all members, particularly of the poorest countries.
Consequently, since the Uruguay Round, many developing countries have stated that they were not aware, when they signed, of all the legal, administrative and financial consequences of agreements such as the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, which were drawn up without their involvement.
Generally, where the developing countries are concerned, six years on from the creation of the WTO, the picture before us reveals a limited opening up of markets in the north, considerable difficulties in implementing agreements and persistent marginalisation from the workings of the WTO.
This feeling is more acute still for the least developed countries (LDCs), which, twenty years ago, accounted for 0.6% of international trade. Today the figure stands at only 0.4%.
The WTO, therefore, continues to be dominated by the large trading powers, and it is they that benefit overwhelmingly from its policies.
And, two years after Seattle, the multilateral trade system is still undergoing a threefold crisis of democratic legitimacy, as a consequence of the uneven distribution of the benefits of world trade, of the marginalisation of many of its members, as a result of the impact of some WTO rules on other basic principles, even at international level, and lastly due to a lack of transparency and the limited involvement of parliaments and civil society in the work of the WTO.
Although the WTO has started to acknowledge the need for reform, this recognition has yet to be translated into the necessary changes.
As you know, Commissioner, our committee, therefore, adopted, by a large majority - 48 votes to 5, with 1 abstention - a report which is noteworthy above all for its set of practical proposals, grouped into four main chapters.
First of all, the equal and effective participation of all members is a key factor in any new direction for the multilateral trading system.
This will require an increase in the provision of technical assistance.
The Commission has already undertaken a number of actions and we urge it to persevere in this direction.
We propose going further, however.
The Commission should propose the creation, for example, on the basis of a contribution proportional to each member' s share of international trade, of a fund or an increase in the WTO' s budget, which would enable all member countries to have a representation in Geneva.
We propose supporting regional representations, which is already being done, specifically for the ACP countries, but we feel that we need to go further; we need to establish internal transparency; until all members have a representation, we must allow non-resident countries to have rapid access to records of meetings and draft agreements; we must establish clear rules on so-called 'informal' consultations to allow all countries that wish to take part to do so, by publishing agendas in advance and by ensuring that reports of prior decisions, which are sometimes prepared, are provided to the competent bodies in good time.
We also propose that the dispute settlement system be reformed, because there are still inequalities linked to the market share of the various member countries, to ensure that the small countries, those that account for a small proportion of international trade, can, in certain circumstances, seek financial compensation.
Secondly, there is the issue of opening the WTO up to society and external transparency.
We feel that much remains to be done in this area before we reach the level of other organisations, within which observer status has been given to non-governmental organisations.
We feel that the dispute settlement procedure itself could, given the judicial nature of the procedures, be held in public, as is the case in court proceedings.
Thirdly, there is the issue of parliamentary control, which was mentioned in the previous debate, at both national and European level and also by means of a consultative parliamentary assembly within the WTO.
Where the European Union is concerned, we propose that Article 133 of the EC Treaty be reformed, that the 133 committee be opened up to Parliament's representatives, and that the European Parliament' s assent be required for all trade agreements.
Fourthly, there is the balance between international standards and establishing new relationships between the WTO and other international organisations.
We propose that all other multilateral organisations, such as the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organisation, etc., be given observer status within the WTO and that their opinion be systematically sought by the dispute settlement body when there is a risk of conflict between trade rules and other rules.
In our view, the European Union should propose a de facto hierarchy of standards at international level, with which all countries must comply. In other words, it should recognise that business law or trade law cannot supplant the principles of environmental protection, public health and respect for the social rights of workers.
It must fall to the ILO, and the ILO alone, to decide whether or not it is appropriate to adopt retaliatory measures and to impose trade sanctions on countries, and not the World Trade Organisation.
I feel, however, that the WTO must give a commitment to respect any decisions that the ILO may take on such matters.
To conclude briefly, Mr President, I would say that trade policy, which is one of the oldest of the EU' s policies and its oldest external common policy concerns, of course, economic interests, but it also says a great deal - or, in any event, the European Union says a great deal - by means of this trade policy, about its vision of the world and of north-south relations in particular. It also reveals a belief in a division between that which is the domain of the market and that which societies must do in the name of principles, such as, solidarity.
This policy must reflect the Union's fundamental values and objectives.
For this reason, the EU' s priorities must be the establishment of fair and equitable trade, a democratic multilateral system, and a reformed WTO.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, we need more and not, as has been called for several times, less, international cooperation.
For small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, we need the basic conditions to be legally certain and foreseeable.
The aim has to be to use world trade to create more wealth for our people.
In so doing, however, we must not overlook the fact that Europe has 18 million small enterprises, which, at the end of the day, employ two-thirds of the workforce.
This means that salaries are mainly being paid by small and medium-sized companies.
Sixty per cent of GDP and, important for us politicians, 80% of taxes come from small companies.
That is why where the WTO is concerned, we should not only consider involving and integrating the ILO in this process and reflect on how we might better structure it, but should also and especially bring the social dialogue and the social partners to the fore.
The Everything But Arms initiative should not contain the clause 'Everything But Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' , but instead 'Everything For Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' .
The economy is at the centre of this discussion, and this is something that we should not forget in the whole WTO debate.
Very briefly on TRIPS: here we should consider, in particular, having compulsory licences and, above all, development aid; we should consider having calls for tender and also giving countries medicines of the necessary quality.
As regards the dispute settlement mechanism, I should like to recall that many companies and individual firms are damaged by WTO rulings, for example because of carousel trade retaliation.
Here I should like to ask: how do these companies obtain redress?
How do they come to be damaged by an international agreement which is not actually in accordance with the law of the country concerned?
Finally, we need to introduce more transparency into these areas and ensure that decisions are made closer to the people.
That is why I welcome the fact that President Neyts will support the European Parliament and parliaments throughout the world in their efforts to bring more transparency and also in the end, I hope, more wealth into this world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Harlem DÃ©sir, on his very good, clear and extensive report.
Commissioner, if the decision-making process in the WTO is not made more transparent and democratic then, in the long term, the people of the WTO Member States will not stand for it, because we cannot have nation states increasingly referring crucial issues to the competent supranational organisation, while parliaments and, therefore, also society at large remain prevented from exercising their democratic right to monitor and participate in its work.
Events in the Dispute Settlement Body must also be seen in this light.
The Dispute Settlement Body needs to be thoroughly overhauled.
It needs to be transparent and changes also need to be made to its composition.
In the same way, it is necessary for us, finally, to give the developing countries the tools which will actually allow them to participate in the negotiations on an equal footing and then to assess the decisions which need to be made as they see fit.
There is, of course, a difference between a delegation arriving with 150 experts and a developing country having great difficulty sending its ambassador to the places concerned.
I should like to point this out once more here.
Otherwise, Harlem DÃ©sir has already said everything that needed to be said.
Mr President, I would also like to join in the congratulations to Mr DÃ©sir, the rapporteur.
This report strikes us as an excellent piece of forward-thinking, a blueprint for the WTO of tomorrow.
It comprehensively rejects those who claim that the WTO is beyond redemption; that it cannot be reformed; that it is inherently biased against the poor or the dispossessed; and that it is just an agent for the rule of the jungle, rather than the rule of law.
It also rejects the contrary view: the idea that free trade should prevail at all costs; that the WTO should be an agent for the dismantling of outstanding trade barriers, and should do so to the exclusion of all other political and public policy considerations.
Instead, it represents almost a synthesis of those two views, because it shows how and when and why the WTO should, and must, be reformed.
It shows how the WTO must become more transparent and legitimate.
I should add that all the emphasis that we, as Europeans, place on the need for increased legitimacy and transparency in the WTO will come to nothing if we do not reform the way in which we conduct our own trade policy in the European Union.
I was delighted to hear the presidency today say that it has supported in the past, and will support in the future, Parliament's demands for more transparent and legitimate trade policy-making in the European Council and the European Union.
The report also - and this is perhaps its greatest contribution to the debate - shows the way in which the WTO has to be placed increasingly in a context of other public policy priorities and other multilateral organisations and agreements.
It cannot rely on a role as primus inter pares on the international scene.
Instead it should learn to interact with other priorities and other multilateral agreements.
Our role is, therefore, to flank the WTO with other supporting agreements in other fields, notably the environmental field.
Mr President, international trade is fundamental in our system and, in the opinion of those who advocate a different type of globalisation, including myself, international trade must be based on fair, equitable trading bringing development and wealth to the greatest number of people possible.
Regrettably, the trade negotiations held under the auspices of GATT and the WTO did not serve to create fair international rules: quite the opposite, they left entire communities with no defence against the greed of multinationals.
It therefore follows that these institutions are suffering an unprecedented crisis of legitimacy in respect of vast sections of communities, and are in vital need of thorough reform.
The DÃ©sir report addresses clearly the limitations and dysfunctional areas of international trade, of unequal participation, and the lack of transparency and democracy and the ensuing consequences, and proposes reforms to remedy these shortcomings.
We support the report and will vote for the motion, but we feel that this must only be the start of a process of change.
The Commission and the Council must refuse to be influenced by pressure from the rest of the world.
Mr President, justice must be done, but more importantly justice must be seen to be done: the WTO is a very powerful international organisation, dealing with rules and law, and it must be seen to act justly.
Accountability and transparency are therefore exceptionally important.
Global trade requires global rules and development requires understanding of some of the problems of the developing countries.
If we are discussing transparency and accountability within the WTO process, transparency for its own sake and accountability for its own sake are just not enough.
The fundamental purpose of both is to create integrity in the system so that those who have promised to do things, and here I mean the developed countries, are forced to do them because of international public opinion.
There are many things that the developed countries promised in the Uruguay round which have not been delivered.
Conversely, those in the developing world who now have systems of corruption and bad practice will also be brought to book through the process of accountability and transparency.
In this regard, I would like to support Mr DÃ©sir in saying that he has produced an excellent report which I want to support.
It is vital to understand the permanent position of the rule of law.
Equality before the law and confidence in it is an absolute necessity for developing countries.
Without it all the well-meaning words and the great aid-giving we indulge in will come to nothing.
Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.
Mr President, international trade is of central importance if conditions for growth and development are to be created throughout our world.
The rules governing this trade determine whether growth and development are to benefit the whole of humanity or are to be confined to the industrialised world.
Mr DÃ©sir' s report is an excellent instrument for bringing about something more akin to global justice in world trade.
The developing countries must be put on the same footing as the industrialised countries when it comes to participating in the joint work of the WTO.
For me, as a Social Democrat, global justice is an end in itself.
The acts of terrorism in the United States also point to the need to limit the basis for hatred and fanaticism.
Less injustice will increase the safety of us all.
The voluntary organisations must be given scope to express their opinions when world trade is discussed.
Democracy can be deepened through the setting up of a parliamentary assembly within the WTO.
Social dumping must be prevented and employees' rights must be provided for.
Fundamental human rights must be respected, the fight against environmental devastation intensified and child labour prohibited.
We must stop dumping our food surplus in the developing countries and, instead, give farmers in those countries a chance to increase their production and their opportunities to provide for themselves.
In that way, we can make our contribution to a more just and more secure world.
Mr President, the new WTO round perfectly illustrates our criticism of the way in which this body is organised.
This is supposedly a development round, but the European ministers for cooperation and development are not taking part in the forthcoming meeting.
Furthermore, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has not been able to deliver an opinion on the DÃ©sir report.
Fortunately, the report asks pertinent questions, and it has our support.
This is supposed to be a development round, but the 49 LDCs are opposed to it and rightly so.
Liberalisation, which is supposed to lead to development, growth and prosperity, has only made their situation worse.
The WTO perpetuates the imbalance in world trade and the establishment of rules that are unfavourable to the developing countries.
Furthermore, it has ended the preferential system instituted by the LomÃ© Convention.
Similarly, the Cotonou Agreement urges the ACP countries to abide by the GATS or the agreement on Trips but the UNDP, itself, states that the liberalisation of services will only benefit multinational companies.
The GATS is basically the IMA by the back door.
It is a tool for dismantling democracy.
Mr Lamy, if negotiations must take place, then they must focus on a root and branch reform of the WTO.
It is the development of the least advanced countries that must benefit rather than the development of multinational companies' profits.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Harlem DÃ©sir for the quality of this report, which, of course, I fully support.
The point that you made just now, Commissioner, on developments within the WTO to my mind shows all the more the need for such a report.
I shall use two points to try to illustrate this.
The Commission must keep a close eye on the issues of agriculture and intellectual property, so that the current shifts we are seeing within the WTO do not continue indefinitely.
The dice have been and remain loaded against the weakest, either the poorest countries or the most endangered social categories in our own countries, because the WTO is a body that is neither transparent nor democratic.
Let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture.
They guarantee neither self-sufficiency with regard to food supply nor the right to protect biodiversity for the southern countries. They prevent the specific nature of small-scale farming in Europe from being taken into consideration, with all its quality, social and environmental aspects.
There is a danger that, in the near future, they may ban small farmers from sowing the seeds that they have themselves produced.
The Commission must exert pressure to change this, to have an in-depth review of the Trips agreement drawn up so that it is fully compatible with the Rio convention on biodiversity and the Cartagena protocol on biosecurity, as the African group within the WTO is calling for.
This will enable us to preserve the biological heritage of the developing countries and the traditional skills in the south as well as the north.
Furthermore, the patenting of living organisms must be prohibited, because these are the heritage of all humanity and cannot and must not be hijacked by private interests that want to turn life into a commodity.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will convey this message.
Mr President, Mr DÃ©sir' s own-initiative report makes a number of recommendations that are quite close to the spirit in which we are approaching the WTO ministerial conference in Doha.
You would like to see the developing countries integrated into world trade, which is an objective that we share.
You emphasise the importance of the WTO addressing the public' s concerns, over and above the traditional issues of access to the markets or of customs tariffs. We also share this objective and feel, as you do, that rapid economic change and the effects of globalisation must be managed.
The fact is that progress has already been made on many of your suggestions, specifically with regard to follow-ups with technical assistance or councils for developing countries in WTO negotiations.
The European Union, for example, is responsible for establishing the ACP countries' Centre in Geneva, which will enable these countries to better coordinate their position and consequently exert greater influence within the WTO.
It is the European Union that insisted on streamlining meetings in Geneva and on making the participation of members who do not have a representation in the WTO easier.
I am giving these two examples, to which one could add the efforts made to encourage the accession of a number of countries - and in Doha, an LDC, the island of Vanuatu, will sit side by side with China and Taiwan, for example - not to suggest that the situation is perfect or that nothing remains to be done, but in order to ensure that the debate on the proposals for reform is held on the basis of a full and up-to-date knowledge of the current situation.
On this subject, I should like to make a small correction to a point of fact that appears in your explanatory statement, Mr DÃ©sir, concerning hormone-treated beef.
Contrary to what you state, the European Union has not been condemned for banning hormones in cattle breeding.
The WTO has explicitly recognised the right in this affair of each member to set its own level of protection.
The Union was condemned because, at the time, it did not supply the necessary scientific evidence to justify such a ban.
I have a few other different interpretations, or rather differences of opinion, concerning some of your comments or suggestions.
You mention the crisis of democratic legitimacy, which other speakers have taken up.
I disagree with the content of this criticism.
Admittedly, the system could be improved: it must be made more open and the developing countries must be more fully integrated.
The challenge of reconciling our 'civil society' agenda with our 'development' agenda is indeed formidable and your report, furthermore, attests to some of these difficulties, in that, for some subjects, you propose both external transparency and fundamental social standards.
We know very well that, where these two matters are concerned, our sensitivity to the positions of the developing countries forces us to severely limit our ambitions: consequently, our own position is not entirely free from contradiction, as your report highlights.
Nevertheless, calling the current situation a serious crisis of democratic legitimacy strikes me as somewhat excessive.
As far as I am aware, the Marrakech Agreement was not only adopted by the Member State governments, but was also ratified both by the national parliaments and by your House. In other words, the Marrakech Agreement has been ratified by the European Parliament.
With regard to your statement that decision making within the WTO is the sole preserve of the richer nations, I would say that, although this may once have been true, it is increasingly less the case in an organisation of more than 140 members and, in which, small discussion groups are inevitable in its day-to-day work.
We are trying to ensure that these meetings include both rich and poor countries and that they guarantee a representative mix both in terms of geography and in terms of stages of development.
It may be the case that these informal groups make it easier to reach consensus, but they never, as we all know, take decisions.
Many preparatory meetings of this type have taken place over these last few weeks, for example, the ministerial mini-meeting in Mexico at the end of August, the Europe-Asia meeting in Hanoi in mid-September, the Europe-Africa meeting in Nairobi in mid-October and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting at the weekend.
I would also add that, in terms of the method of preparation, the lesson of Seattle has been learned and that the participating delegations are larger and better informed about the issues you have raised.
With regard to dispute settlement, an issue you have also addressed, I would make three comments.
First of all, let us not forget that the main objective of the mechanism for settling disputes is the effective and disciplined implementation of commitments that have been freely negotiated and accepted.
This is what a member of the WTO hopes to obtain when it resorts to the dispute settlement procedure.
Like you, we are also opposed to immediate implementation and to trade sanctions.
There must be more room for trade compensation.
Personally speaking, I have greater reservations about your suggestion to replace sanctions with fines.
My fear is that financial penalties would not resolve the imbalance between rich and poor countries, and might, to some extent, even allow the rich countries to buy off their breaches of obligations.
With regard to the transparency of the panels, we are also in favour of opening up the hearings of the appeals body to the public.
Let us remember, however, just between ourselves, that the developing countries have very firmly held positions on this point, which we do not share.
Where the relationship with other rules of international law is concerned, we must ensure greater coherence and prevent conflict between trade and non-trade rules.
This must apply to the very substance of the commitments in question.
As to the issue of revising the agreement on intellectual property, which you consider to be necessary, I do not think that a thorough revision would be appropriate.
If we take the examples of access to medicines or of the patenting of living organisms, the agreement provides sufficient latitude to establish an intellectual property system that responds to the concerns expressed by developing countries.
It is the task of the members of the WTO to interpret and clarify this flexibility, and we feel that it is better to do so by means of discussion or negotiation than to leave this task to panels.
This is the basis of our position in Geneva, which I mentioned in the previous debate.
Mrs Auroi, the issue of compatibility between the agreement on intellectual property and the convention on biodiversity is one of the points that we wish to see clarified in these negotiations.
With regard to the incentive measures to ensure compliance with basic standards in the field of employment law, we agree with your wish, Mr DÃ©sir, to highlight the importance of strengthening the ILO and this is why your suggestion to create a multilateral agreement within the WTO does not fill us with any great enthusiasm.
As for the incentive measures to ensure compliance with basic social standards, I would say that we must not undermine the influence of the International Labour Organisation.
This is not a weak institution that the WTO must provide with a dynamism that it would not otherwise have.
We must instead work on improving the ILO' s profile.
Lastly, with regard to creating a parliamentary forum within the WTO, a proposal that, as I stated in the previous debate, we have always supported, I shall conclude briefly by saying that we shall make use of the guidelines that Parliament has laid down for this set of work, to which we can now add your report, Mr DÃ©sir.
I would say that, as this afternoon's debate has shown, the Commission' s political line, approved and implemented by the Council, is also coherent with the position of this House.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
Common foreign and security policy (CFSP)
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0332/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy (C5-0194/2001 - 2001/2007(INI)).
I would point out that, after the rapporteur, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council, and Commissioner Patten will speak, and they will then have to leave as a result of urgent air transport issues.
This change to the agenda is due to the evacuation of Parliament, which is of course neither the responsibility of the President-in-Office of the Council nor of the Commissioner.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in recent weeks we have frequently said it, and in the light of this annual report we should emphasise it once more: since 11 September we have not actually learnt anything new.
It has become clear to us, however, and we have become more conscious of the fact that we need a new definition of security, that the old concepts of security policy actually no longer work and that, for this reason, a particular combination of external and internal security needs to be formed.
It is no longer the case, you see, that a potential enemy can be unambiguously recognised behind a border; now the enemy also has the ability to be in our midst.
Here, I believe, a coordinated approach needs to be agreed.
Admittedly, we also know that this threat can no longer be fought by individual states because the challenge is international and runs across borders.
That is why we also need to find cross-border solutions.
Each individual European state only has a chance of guaranteeing the long-term peace and security of its own people if we pool our resources, in terms of military forces, in the field of prevention and in the field of civil crisis management, but also in terms of ensuring cooperation between our security bodies and intelligence services.
For this reason, I believe, we have actually made considerable progress in the last two years in view of the decisions made since the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice and, in particular, those made at Cologne and subsequent summits.
On this basis, I think that we should press on with developing a European security and defence policy once the necessary conditions for doing so are in place.
In our opinion, we have to recognise that it will be necessary to make certain structural changes to achieve this.
This is because we believe that it will only work if, firstly, the Member States realise that only the joint institutions can act and that bilateral initiatives also weaken the individuals concerned, even if they think that it makes them appear particularly powerful in the media.
The second point is that the structures in the different institutions will also have to dovetail to avoid there being any duplication of work.
It does not, in my opinion, make any sense for there to be committees on civil crisis management in both the Commission and the Council, with the High Representative.
That is why I wish, on behalf of the European Parliament, to repeat our position that in the long term the duties of the Commissioner for External Relations and those of the High Representative should be merged within the Commission.
That should happen in order to ensure that there really is a uniform approach and so as to have uniform structures.
This has nothing to do with the merits of those specifically involved at the moment; it is a question of structure.
On this basis we must also, of course, make sure that this person has special relations with the Council so as to give their work the appropriate legitimacy at that level.
I also think, however, that we can make it clear that added value really is being generated.
I should like to give just a few examples here. I believe, for example, that the large anti-terrorism coalition would not have been formed in this way had it not been for the particular European influence exerted by the troika's travelling to the Middle East, which yielded significant results.
I do not believe that the large anti-terrorism coalition will be able to exist in the long term if the European Union does not foster stability in the Mediterranean area through the Barcelona process.
For this reason, I also believe that the European Union has the task of addressing the root causes which sow the emotional seeds of terrorism, whether it be in the Middle East, in the relations between Pakistan and India, or in other parts of the world where we should make a particular effort to make our contribution to securing peace.
In this process we have to recognise that our relations with the United States take the form of a partnership and that, regardless of all our efforts to develop our own security and defence policy, NATO is still necessary because it alone is able to guarantee the collective security.
If we wish to play a role in politics as a whole, however, we must also actively work to further develop our relations with Russia, build new bridges and provide those countries which at present cannot, should not or do not wish to be members of the European Union with a new framework and a new form of European economic area.
Nevertheless, I should also like to say that all of this will only work if we are also prepared to make the money available in our national budgets to make it possible to really keep our pledge to provide 60 000 people for the Rapid Reaction Force.
We will not be successful in terms of prevention and civil crisis management and we will not continue to play a key role in foreign policy, but will just be passive observers, including in our relations with Russia and the United States of America, if we do not plausibly demonstrate that we have our own military capability.
It is often the case that prevention only works if it is possible to show the country in which you want to intervene to establish peace that you also have military options.
It is often sufficient to possess a military capability - this is shown throughout history - to prevent military resources from even having to be deployed.
That is why realising our vision of having a 60 000-strong Rapid Reaction Force, transport capabilities and our own satellite system by 2003 is decisive for the credibility of the future European foreign and security policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Brok on his excellent rapport, in which he not only asks pertinent questions, but also, and from the outset, provides some valuable answers.
Incidentally, the report is most timely, because, with regard to all issues concerning foreign policy as a whole, in other words, the Union' s policy towards the rest of the world, security policy in all its aspects and defence policy, the European Parliament is clearly in a state of change.
I was present in this House for the discussion of the Treaty of Amsterdam, when we stated our disappointment at the little progress made on common security and defence policy.
Looking at the point we have reached today, we see that we have come a long way and especially that we have progressed very quickly.
The events of recent months and weeks have shown, whatever may have been said about them this morning, that the European Union is becoming, and is being perceived to be, an increasingly important player on the world stage.
This gives us both greater visibility and, of course, imposes greater responsibilities on us.
I am sure I am not the only person here to have been confronted over the last few weeks with the question: 'but where are the European Union' s troops?' asked by people who have completely forgotten that we are not involved and are far from being involved.
This means quite simply that we are increasingly perceived to be a player on the global stage and that we must have all the institutional, financial and other means available if we are to successfully achieve all of these responsibilities.
This result could clearly only have been achieved as a result of the energy and dynamism both of the High Representative for Security and Cooperation and of Commissioner Patten, who, in a spirit of perfect cooperation, both manage to represent us superbly on all world stages, in all crisis hot-spots on our own continent and in much more far-flung parts of the world.
We, the Member States of the European Union, are also increasingly managing - and the Belgian presidency has played a part in this - to speak with one voice in international bodies and I am thinking in particular of the United Nations, which currently play an extremely important role.
We therefore wish to see ourselves become a major political player on the international stage.
This will enable us to better shoulder our responsibilities so that we can contribute to peace and stability across the world.
This policy is progressing at the pace we had envisaged.
I am sure you know that this is an open process, in which the Fifteen want to involve the candidate countries and the allied non-Member States of the European Union.
Negotiations currently taking place with NATO are due to establish the methods of cooperation between ourselves and the Alliance, in order to ensure access to NATO' s resources and capacities and in order to avoid efforts being pointlessly duplicated.
As you know, these negotiations are not straightforward and you also know why they are so complex.
Ultimately, however, you also know - and I repeat what the presidency has already stated on previous occasions - that we have no intention of allowing this process of establishing the means to guarantee our being operational becoming hostage to events within NATO.
We shall lead the way and we shall continue to work to achieve the objectives I have mentioned.
I fully agree that conflict prevention and crisis management are amongst the foremost priorities of our action, and, as Mr Brok has said, these priorities must lead us to be committed at every stage.
We shall maintain this commitment on a long-term basis in various crisis situations, whether it be in the Balkans, the Middle East or in Africa.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis which has its origins in the terrible attacks on 11 September in the United States has shown that the European Union is capable of reacting in a rapid and coherent manner.
Our reaction bore witness to horizontal coordination and has, in fact, transcended the pillar division.
I believe that that too is, and will be, an important element in the further development of our common policy.
I should like to point out that the European Council has rarely been so outspoken over the past few weeks as it was in that context.
We have decided to adopt a voluntaristic policy vis-Ã -vis the Arab-Muslim world and we are united with many to give out the same message, namely that the crisis that has broken out and the fight against international terrorism can in no way be considered a war between civilisations.
This morning, we were reminded of the importance of resuming the peace process in the Middle East.
You know that the presidency will be making a visit to that region shortly in the hope of giving out that message and of receiving backing for this.
As I have already stated, our campaign in the Middle East is still based on the implementation of the roadmap, as can be found in the recommendation of the Mitchell committee.
(FR) With regard to the Western Balkans, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to the systematic implementation of the conclusions of the Zagreb Summit.
Cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia is one factor allowing progress to be made on negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with every country that participated in this summit, of which the transfer of Mr Milosevic to The Hague was the most striking symbol, although not the only one.
We welcome the progress made by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since its return to democracy a little more than a year ago.
With regard to Kosovo, we are focussing our action on the preparations for the general elections of 17 November, and we are delighted to see that more than 170 000 Serbs have enrolled on the electoral registers, which provides hope that the result may be a balanced one.
The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unfortunately not so straightforward and, here also, it has taken all the efforts of our representative, Mr Solana, of Commissioner Patten, and many others, to prevent the crisis that took place there from unfolding into a true civil war.
As you know, the situation remains extremely delicate and Mrs Pack even drew my attention to the matter when I reported on the General Affairs Council decisions of 8 October.
We are all aware of this and we are monitoring the situation, as you and many others are, extremely closely.
I should nevertheless like to emphasise that events in Macedonia have shown that close cooperation between NATO and ourselves is possible and that we are able to play a role in the prevention and management of crises.
(NL) Another region in crisis where the European Union is pursuing an active control and prevention policy is Africa.
The troika will shortly be making a few visits to that region, too, in order to keep the two peace processes that are running there, and are sometimes faltering, I have to say, namely the Lusaka peace process for Congo and the Arusha peace process for Burundi, on track and to ensure that they can herald the end of the military action and hence peace.
For without peace, the reconstruction of Africa is not possible.
Could I finally draw your attention to the meeting of the European-African Ministerial Conference of 11 October? It was a great success from the point of view that a political dialogue was entered into, whereby, needless to say, due consideration was given to the development of democracy and human rights.
Lastly, with regard to our strategic partnerships, I should like to emphasise that our relations with Russia have also been given a new boost at all levels.
Little by little, we are seeing the establishment, not so much of mechanisms but of forms of contact and dialogue, which enable us to envisage genuine cooperation and a genuine strategic partnership.
This development can only contribute to the stability not only of our own continent, but also to stability throughout the world.
I must, however, state quite clearly on this subject, that this rapprochement between the European Union and Russia, in no way means that we will be any the less vigilant over the situation in Chechnya.
We are continuing to discuss the matter and to insist on the need to find a political solution.
Lastly, I should like to mention the Fourth EU-China Summit, which also enabled us to strengthen political dialogue but, once again, this political dialogue includes the issue of human rights.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have limited speaking time and the fire drill did not, of course, help and for this I apologise. Out of all that has been said, however, I should like to take up, in conclusion, the three following aspects: a strong Europe, a Europe that is able to project its influence onto the international stage is, above all, a Europe in which internal cohesion supports external action; secondly, it is a Europe in which the synergies between Presidency, Member States, Commission and High Representatives are exploited to the full and, lastly, it is a Europe in which action, whether it be in the field of justice, defence, cooperation or anything else, matches the rhetoric.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Brok, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
I am sorry for the reasons to which you alluded, President.
The fire drill has meant that this important debate is in a sense an inadvertent victim of the importance of enhancing our parliamentary security.
I will unfortunately have to leave shortly because the minister and I have to get to Bucharest by dawn - a challenging journey at this time of evening from Strasbourg!
We have to be there for the opening of the Stability Pact conference tomorrow, which, and it is not entirely irrelevant to what the honourable Member says in his report, at least indicates a measure of success over the last couple of years for the evolving common, foreign and security policy.
I would like to congratulate the honourable Member, on what is a very comprehensive and valuable report.
As he said in his own remarks, the evolution of a common foreign and security policy is shown to be even more timely by the appalling events of the autumn of 2001.
The honourable Member's report gives a very accurate overview of what has been achieved so far.
I particularly welcome his proposals for a strong parliamentary dimension in the common foreign and security policy.
It is very important that we put down deeper democratic roots for the common foreign and security policy and that should involve not only this distinguished Parliament but also national parliaments.
I have made a point of trying to appear in front of the select committees in national parliaments on bilateral visits to the Member States.
If anybody challenges the progress that we have made in developing a CFSP they should compare what happened during this crisis with what happened in the run-up to the Gulf War at the beginning of the 1990s or how we coped with the Balkans in the early to mid-1990s.
We cannot yet, as pop singers would perhaps suggest, 'strut our stuff'.
But we have some reason for being modestly proud of the achievements that have been made so far.
I fully agree with the report's analysis of the prerequisites of successful CFSP action.
We have to bring together the resources and instruments of all the EU players: the Community, the Council and the Member States.
I doubt whether history will regard the present institutional structures as ideal.
I do not put it any more strongly than that, but the High Representative and I have worked as hard as we could make these structures work as effectively as is possible.
What will happen in the future is for other people greater than me to determine.
I do not want to go through all my agreement with the honourable Member on individual regional and geographical areas, not least because Bucharest calls.
But I want to stress one or two points he made.
I could, for example, have gone into a detailed paragraph or two agreeing on Russia and the Ukraine, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on the Balkans in general and on the importance of getting back to Mitchell in the Middle East.
The two points I should like to mention briefly are these: firstly, we rightly talk about the importance of trying to ensure that the international campaign against terrorism is not seen as a conflict between the West - Europe and North America - and the world of Islam.
It is absolutely right that we have to make it clear this is not a clash of civilisations.
But we have a real opportunity and responsibility in the European Union to use the mechanisms of the Barcelona process, to use the mechanisms of the Euro-Med partnership in order to strengthen the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world.
We have a real chance and a real responsibility to do this.
I hope we will seize it.
I also hope we will look very hard at our relationship with the Gulf Cooperation Council in this regard.
The other point that I want to pick up from Mr Brok's remarks and from the report is simply this: in my judgment, we have to try to ensure that we can make use of this crisis to open doors and windows which have otherwise been shut.
That affects, for example, our future relationship with Pakistan. It also, in my judgment, very clearly touches on our relationship with Iran.
I have no doubt at all that the Iranians are serious in wanting to establish a better, more profound relationship between themselves and the European Union.
I have no doubt at all that they are serious about wanting to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement with us.
They know perfectly well that any arrangements with us will involve a dialogue on human rights and related matters.
But I believe they are serious interlocutors and that it is incumbent upon us to respond as positively as possible to the overtures they have made.
On Afghanistan I will only say that I look forward - I hope sooner, rather than later - to the time when I will have to come back to Parliament and the Council and point out the financial consequences for all of us of the political promises and pledges we have made about the future of Afghanistan.
There will be an important moment when we have to put our money and our diplomatic efforts where our convictions have been and should remain.
Finally, I would like to say once again how important it is to mobilise all our institutions, all our competences, as effectively as possible in pursuit of a common foreign and security policy.
Sometimes it is possible to underestimate the contribution which the Commission can make and wants to make in the CFSP field.
There is a great deal that we can do in order to make sure that the CFSP develops effectively as a way of reflecting Europe's growing clout in the international political arena.
The rapporteur has been well ahead of his time in pressing us to do more in this field.
I hope that we will live up to his expectations in the months and years ahead.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Brok on his report on the progress achieved in the implementation of the common foreign and security policy, a report whose objective is not only to sing the praises of this policy, but also to point out its inadequacies and deficiencies.
It goes without saying that the European Community, making a virtue out of necessity, has, thanks to the determination of the Commission, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative, seen its visibility increased since the attacks on 11 September.
This morning, during the debate on the European Council in Ghent, the President-in-Office of the Council fairly diplomatically said that an awkward situation had arisen as a result of the tripartite meeting that had taken place outside the summit.
To a certain extent, Mr President, it is logical that in times of crisis each person tries to save their own skin, but, in my opinion, it is important not to give way to the temptation to act unilaterally, or, to be more precise, on this particular occasion, trilaterally.
Europe is strong when united, but when fragmented is weak.
For this reason it is important that Europe should be able to speak with one single voice.
And the European Union, in the aftermath of the situation that has arisen as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has to rethink its common foreign and security policy, including within it the fight against terrorism, speeding up the achievement of its objectives and making the common strategies mechanism more efficient.
Today, unilateralism, including that of the most prosperous and powerful countries, as we have already witnessed, is nothing but a pipe dream.
In the globalised world we are living in today, politics, diplomacy, security and defence are interrelated concepts that have to respond to the new threats we are having to face.
Security becomes a universal idea that cannot be split up, far removed from the traditional concepts of state and status quo.
In turn, defence is constantly changing its boundaries in a world in which the perception of these is ever more blurred: nowadays, we cannot only consider the territorial defence of one State faced with a possible attack by another, but rather, as has been correctly said, we have armies that lack clear enemies and enemies that lack armies.
In this world of globalisation, not only economic, but where terror, politics, diplomacy, trade, aid to development, security and defence are all interrelated concepts, it will depend on us to be capable of understanding and accepting that dangers and conflicts affect us all in the same measure and the response to these will also have to be the same for all those concerned.
But we will have to start - and I am convinced of this - by creating a true common EU foreign and security policy with a common conscience that is efficient, coherent and visible, as Mr Brok' s report recommends.
Mr President, Mr Brok's report, which, as usual, is very carefully drafted, has come just at the right time, a time when we need some pointers for where the common foreign and security policy is heading.
For us, 'common' means above all, and I am saying this deliberately now, that we must not have, or even give the impression of having, a board of directors issuing instructions and determining policy.
'Common' also means, and here I would support my colleague, Mr Brok, that the High Representative's duties need to be combined with those of the relevant Commissioner.
'Common' also means ensuring that we have a European Union Rapid Reaction Force as soon as possible.
The policy has to be European to the extent that it clearly defines European objectives, and this means that we show solidarity with the United States of America but also insist that this solidarity is not a one-way street.
If I have to read at a time like this that the United States of America is still rejecting the International Criminal Court and that Congress is even debating whether or not those who cooperate with the Criminal Court should be penalised, then this is not what I understand by developing a policy based on solidarity between the European Union and the United States.
Solidarity with the United States must therefore also mean our drawing the United States' attention to those areas where it is necessary to pursue a common policy in the world community.
My third and final point is that if we form alliances, in particular this alliance against terrorism, an alliance which we must and should form, we will more often find ourselves facing a contradiction or conflict between our strategic concerns on the one hand and our human rights concerns on the other.
We should be under no illusion about this.
Anyone who wishes to enter into an alliance, and I do, with the Soviet Union, with Russia, with China and with the Islamic States, will repeatedly encounter this contradiction.
We should simply realise that we also need to make it absolutely clear to the public that this contradiction exists.
We need to work towards both objectives.
We should never abandon our aim of securing respect for human rights in the medium and long term when we have to form a strategic alliance, because if you support the shahs of today you will get the Ayatollah Khomeinis of tomorrow.
This can happen if we do not remain vigilant and at the same time put the issue of human rights at the centre of our foreign policy.
Mr President, our group recognises the efforts made by Mr Brok in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which has been a positive effort to reconcile the various contributions.
However, we do not agree with the fundamental aspects of his report and, for this reason, we cannot support it with our vote.
As an example, I will now briefly mention three of these aspects.
Firstly, 11 September was an opportune moment for the European Union to demonstrate that it could play a positive, peaceful and reflective role with the United States, in order to find, in the International Criminal Tribunal and through International Law, a solution to the conflict.
What appeared to be taking place in this direction has now been frustrated by the emergence of the SchrÃ¶der - Blair - Chirac triumvirate which has missed this opportunity.
Secondly, the report gives great importance to NATO, when we think that NATO works against the interests of the European Union.
Lastly, it is very important that the European Union should play a role in the Middle East and in the Western Sahara, and we are also wasting this opportunity.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, entirely in line with the current international situation, the rapporteur, my fellow MEP Mr Brok, is of the opinion that the fight against international terrorism should become one of the European foreign and security policy' s core tasks.
This task allocation allows me to draw the Council' s and Commission' s attention to the security situation in the Western Balkans and the Indonesian Archipelago.
Further to a recently published scientific analysis of the question whether Bosnia might function as European base for Osama bin Laden' s terrorist network, I should like to find out from the Council and Commission whether they have any concrete indications that Bin Laden followers are indeed active in the Western section of the Balkans and if so, how the EU and its Member States, obviously in close cooperation with the US, intend to stand up to this dangerous destabilisation of that region.
Furthermore, the Brok report calls for a continuation of the political dialogue with Indonesia.
I expect the Council and Commission to constantly monitor the security situation on the Moluccas where Bin Laden followers are also conducting a jihad against indigenous Christians.
Finally, I happily vote in favour of the amendment by Mr Gahler which states that the NATO and its extension on our continent are still vital as a guarantee for security across Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know I am repeating what others have already said when I say that the tragic attacks of 11 September have changed the course of this century' s history for ever, but I feel that I can never stress enough how true this is, that the international Community is now faced with a crisis that is as great as it is unprecedented and unfamiliar, with rules and trends that not even the most experienced of political analysts is able to predict.
However, at a time such as this, it is important for the European Union to show itself to be as, and more, united than before and as, and more, capable than before of reacting with one voice.
At a time such as this, when all our worst fears are unexpectedly realised, we realise the importance of this Europe that we are integrating, the importance of being united and having coordinating structures able to operate in real time, of being able to think and act all together and in respect for all the positions.
It is certainly true that we still have a long way to go: the common foreign and security policy is not yet operative and there are still complex issues to be ironed out in its operating mechanism, particularly in the area of national sovereignties, but we now need, more than ever before, to speed up our work.
I therefore cannot fail to congratulate the rapporteur, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, on his report and on the priorities he has set for the forthcoming year in this area, particularly with regard to what - as we have been witnessing in recent months - will be the real challenge of the new millennium: preventing conflicts, finding a non-military solution to the crisis and, most importantly, combating terrorism.
You see, the greater the possibility of seeing Europe united in terms of foreign policy, of making our foreign policy practical reality, the more successful Europe' s internal politics will be.
Quite frankly, the acceleration of the euro, acceleration on the economic side of things, has not been matched by acceleration on the political front.
Well then, there must be acceleration in political matters, and the foreign policy is crucial if that is to happen, particularly at this time.
If we do this, we will achieve a stronger, more resilient Europe and a stronger euro, and we will certainly be able to take a better approach to enlargement and, moreover, to compete on equal terms with the dollar and NAFTA - Canada, the United States and Mexico - the Agreement as it stands, a market which already exists and already presents important political points of reference.
We must act and we must be fully confident in what we are doing: the foreign policy will become vital in the short-term future, especially for the new generations.
Mr President, Commissioner, if you would be good enough to take an interest in the debate, ladies and gentlemen, in our efforts to construct a common foreign and security policy we must not lose sight of the fact that, in the future, as in the present and the past, the European Union will certainly face the risk of its forces becoming involved in armed action.
Let us not be under any illusion: if this were to happen, it would never be in a 'clean' war.
No one is in a better position than a soldier to know that a war will always be 'dirty' and that, despite advances in technology, mankind will never be able to kill off all evil people just by pressing a button if only because it will find it impossible to tell the good from the bad with any degree of certainty.
War will always be dirty and will always be an evil, but it could be 'the lesser of two evils' , if it is only embarked upon in the aim of achieving a political objective that cannot be achieved through any other means.
To quote Clausewitz, 'War is only the continuation of politics by other means.'
It must, therefore, be ended as soon as its political objective is achieved and must not be embarked upon if there is no chance of achieving this objective.
What is the objective of the war we have just embarked upon in Afghanistan?
Everyone can see that it is to enable the Afghan people to rid themselves of a regime that has proved its barbarity.
This seems today to be not only desirable, but also possible.
We are sensitive to the suffering that this war is inflicting on the population and hope, therefore, that this objective is achieved as quickly as possible.
We must therefore understand that a halt to hostilities, even a temporary one, would only strengthen the position of the Taliban.
Let us show ourselves to be capable, having learned from the unfortunate experience of the Gulf war, of seeing it through to the end, in other words, to the establishment in Kabul of a regime that is acceptable to all Afghans. Let us show that we are capable of ensuring that country' s gradual return to peace and stability.
To this end, many of us hope that the European Union will give its support to the negotiations currently taking place under the auspices of the United Nations, between the former king, Zaher Shah and the opposition' s representative.
I would have liked to hear the personal opinion of Commissioner Patten on this matter. I realise that he is not present to be able to give an answer, and so I ask you, Mr Lamy, whether you would be good enough to give us your personal reaction to this idea.
Thank you.
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Brok on his comprehensive report, and I agree with him that we have made enormous progress in terms of foreign and security policy.
Almost every time I open a newspaper, I see the names Patten and Solana in connection with some new trouble spot in the world.
He is right to say that we have responded to the current crisis with a coherence and unity that we would not have thought possible only four or five years ago.
He is right to say that the coalition against terror would not have been possible without the progress we have made within the EU to bring about that unity and coherence.
Clearly a lot still needs to be done, and we have to take advantage of the current crisis to perhaps change the emphasis in our work.
We spend something like 60% of what the Americans spend on defence, but we spend 400% of what the Americans spend on what might be called 'soft intervention' - humanitarian aid and assistance.
We need to try to change that emphasis.
The Americans need to learn from this crisis that security is not just a matter of power projection.
You can have all the weapons in the world, but you will be unable to defend yourself against a few people armed with box cutters.
We need to have a multinational approach to the global problems.
For our part we have to realise that we must have greater military capability in order to back up our actions.
That is why the capability process currently under way is so important.
We must put some teeth into our common foreign and security policy.
That is why I am disappointed with the news that Italy is likely to pull out of the project for A400M aircraft.
We need strategic lift.
It is often ironic that the countries that most engage in rhetoric about European cooperation are those that often fail to produce the action.
One final observation is that at the moment we are seeing a warming of relations with Iran and Syria.
I should like to remind colleagues that there are a number of Israeli soldiers and civilians held hostage by forces sympathetic to, or controlled by, Iran and Syria.
These people are missing in action and I would hope the Commission and the Council would use this opportunity to get those hostages restored to their families.
Mr President, Mr Haarder could not make it to this session, and so on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to thank Mr Brok for a well-drafted report, and to congratulate him on this.
The report is a good one, but it still fails to take the full measure of the profound change which has taken place in international politics following 11 September.
We are still unable to grasp the full ramifications of this change; but we know that it is a very profound one.
The representatives from the United States have stated that a second Cold War has begun, and some have even talked of a third World War.
Here, in Europe, we have been wary of excessive dramatisation and have avoided using the word 'war' .
My personal view, however, is that, in time, history books will come to refer to this period as the Third World War.
We must very carefully analyse what has happened and what is currently happening, and very prudently come to grips with those problems which are now facing us.
We need a broad global perspective and grasp; we need something which, in English, can be called 'global governance'. Finally, there is the matter which I intended to mention in my own intervention.
The progress achieved in the common foreign and security policy during the last few years has been based on the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Rapid advances have been made, particularly in crisis management.
In the Treaty of Amsterdam we also took as our joint task the safeguarding of the Union's integrity and the maintenance of peace on its external frontiers.
Up to now, no definite content has been given to these new treaty obligations.
In the initial phase at any rate, the main question is probably this: how are the different geographical positions of the various Member States to be taken into account in sharing the burden and dividing the work among them?
From the point of view of the Union as a whole it may make sense for those Member States situated on its common external frontiers to direct their resources to the control and defence of these borders, and for them to take part in crisis management in a way which is in harmony with this primary task.
I hope that debate will be initiated within the Commission and the Council on the practical implications of the provisions of the Treaty concerning the integrity of the Union and the safeguarding of its frontiers.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to join with other speakers in commending the excellent work of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Brok.
Any analysis of the evolution of the CFSP would regrettably have to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty sacrificed political integration to ensure economic integration and, as a consequence, undermine the EU's potential to be a major foreign policy player on the world stage.
Nowhere was this more apparent than during the Bosnian crisis when there was significant disunity among Member States.
Our mediation efforts were dogged by bad luck.
It is also true to say we were ineffective peace-makers.
We finished up as the United States' junior partner instead of an equal one.
It seemed for a while that we had learned from this grim experience and there was a determined effort in the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure more coherence in our common foreign and security policy approach.
Although the end-result of the Treaty negotiations represented a step forward, they did not go far enough.
However, I suppose we must be thankful that considerable progress was made at the Cologne, Faro and Helsinki Summits.
Whatever institutional and other changes take place, there will never be real progress unless and until all Member States act and speak as one.
The current situation in the wake of 11 September underlines this point.
The EU had an opportunity to be an equal partner with the United States in responding to this crisis.
Regrettably, the solo run by British Prime Minister Tony Blair has seriously undermined the EU's influence and our foreign policy strategy.
This problem was further compounded by the decision of the UK, Germany and France to hold a mini-summit prior to the Ghent Council.
If actions like this continue, either on the part of an individual Member State or a group of them, the EU's common foreign and security policy will be in tatters, despite the best efforts of Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana.
Mr President, allow me to start by echoing the congratulations by my fellow MEPs for the excellent report that Mr Brok has presented again this year.
However, I have to add that I am very interested to find out how the report would fare next year, for just when the common foreign and security policy is being further detailed, it is meeting with enormous new challenges.
The events of 11 September and subsequent events greatly impact on that policy.
They will put it to the test.
It is too early to gain a complete overview of the new security framework and the new threat. However, we would like to ask the Council and Commission to produce an initial evaluation as soon as possible.
This evaluation should also touch upon the question to what extent the pillar structure forms an obstruction to effective action in the new situation.
External policy has become internal policy, and vice versa. The European Union is not sufficiently prepared for this at this time.
Conflict prevention and crisis management have taken on a different aspect.
Our approach is often still too regional and too geographic.
Horizontal issues must now be thrown into the spotlight.
Increasing use must be made of regional policy in an integrated manner to tackle terrorism and international organised crime which are interrelated in many ways.
The guiding principle in this should be to help each other.
Take countries such as Ukraine.
They form part of the problem which we are now facing because the lack of transparency in countries such as those, forms the ideal breeding ground for all kinds of crimes, to put it mildly.
We have too little control over this because we have not sufficiently developed this kind of cooperation.
Maybe we have focused our attention too much on the Balkans.
That region, too, is a source of security problems, but anyone who studies the 'map of evil' will realise that the new secondary routes of drugs, arms, illegal immigrants, etc. traverse the Slav Commonwealth.
I am pleased that rapporteur Brok insists on a more effective implementation of EU strategies.
There is more cause for this than ever before.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the congratulations expressed by previous speakers and address just two points in Mr Brok's report.
My first point concerns conflict prevention.
The case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia provides us with an example of unsuccessful conflict prevention.
If all of the Members of the Council had worked as intensively as Members of this Parliament have for years to put pressure on all Macedonian governments finally to put an end to the discrimination of the Albanian citizens of that country, then we would not be facing the difficulties and problems which we are now.
If this issue had played a part in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement then the Members of the Council would also have seen it as a precondition and the terrorists from Kosovo would not have had any support for their campaign in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Macedonians would not now be under pressure of time to change their constitution almost because of the success of the terrorist campaign, because they would have already done so.
So much for our failure to prevent conflict in this country!
A second matter which is very important to me was addressed by Mr Brok.
I think that the Stability Pact should finally mark the end of the conferences and quick start packages.
The Stability Pact should be closely linked to the work of the Agency for Reconstruction and should perhaps be extended to the Agency for Reconstruction and Development in this region.
For this reason, the Stability Pact should be incorporated in the Commission's remit; this is where all of the work has to be done in any case.
We would then be able to avoid resources being wasted because of friction, we would be able to achieve synergies and we would be able to make progress on establishing real stability in the region.
In this way, we would, for example, be able to foster significant and large-scale cooperation in the energy sector.
We would be able to make progress on the free trade area in the region, on constructing transport infrastructure and on combating trafficking in human beings and other commodities.
Many Commission officials will in any case very soon be unemployed because the enlargement negotiations in the Commission are as good as closed in some areas.
Let us give these people something to work on.
Let us hand over responsibility for the Stability Pact to those who can manage it and take it away from those who have in any case already begun to abandon it.
Let us give the Stability Pact to the Commission and, perhaps, to one other wise man, Martti Ahtisaari, in addition, so that it really is a success for the entire region and for the European Union.
I am sorry; I thought this was a suggestion and not a question.
I am not going to comment on this point.
You are probably aware that there are various ideas about the way in which the Growth and Stability Pact should be managed.
This is part of a network of institutions set up a few years ago, probably in conditions where concern for total coherence did not prevail.
We can probably do better in the future.
I agree with you, Mrs Pack, that the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo has done a good job and I think that everyone would recognise that.
The links between the Stability Pact, the Agency and the action undertaken by my colleague, Mr Patten will probably, at the right time, be open to suggestion.
It remains to be seen whether these suggestions will emanate from the Council or from the Commission.
On this point, I reserve the position of the Commission.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Turkey
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
(A5-0343/2001) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the 2000 Regular Report from the Commission on Turkey' s progress towards accession (COM(2000) 713 - C5-0613/2000 - 2000/2014(COS));
(A5-0338/2001) by Alain Lamassoure, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey (COM(2001)230 - C5-0219/2001 - 2001/0097(CNS)).
Mr President, since the last resolution adopted last November on the basis of the report by Philippe Morillon, which I welcome, Turkey has been through a year of great contrasts: it was a black year in terms of the economy, a tense year politically, and a year of progress, though unequal progress, in terms of the pre-accession process.
On the one hand, we should welcome the real advances.
Given the very serious financial crisis in Turkey since the beginning of the year, the government has had to play by ear.
At the instigation of Mr Dervis, a radical stabilisation and recovery plan was signed by the three coalition government partners.
It came into operation in the spring, under relatively satisfactory conditions, which have made it possible to undertake basic reforms, which had been put off for too long, and, more generally, to establish a healthier relationship between politics and the economy.
In the short term, however, one of its unavoidable effects has been a severe drop in GDP, of 8% this year, which may have serious social consequences.
The worsening of world economic conditions, both before and after 11 September, can, unfortunately, only make efforts to recover more difficult.
During 2001, Turkey has been genuinely committed to a process of bringing itself closer to European democratic standards.
We should welcome the fact that, at a particularly difficult economic time, a large part of government and parliamentary activity has been devoted to basic reforms linked to this European process.
In March, the government presented its national programme for the adoption of the acquis.
It is true that this first list of reforms is still vague as to the timetable for implementation and the exact scope of the proposed measures. However, since September, the Grand National Assembly has begun to consider several dozen - around 34 - constitutional amendments, the first half of which were adopted at the beginning of October.
The results still lag behind current democratic standards: the death penalty has not been totally abolished, the non-Turkish languages are no longer banned, but are not fully recognised, the National Security Council remains, but civilians play a more significant part within it.
Above all, most regrettably, the principle of the supremacy of international law - and thus, possibly, in the near future, of European law - over national law has been expressly ruled out.
Undeniable progress has nonetheless been made, which the European Commission and the Council of Europe have welcomed as such.
Furthermore, on 8 October, the government tabled a second legislative package of rights and freedoms, which relate to the penal code and penal procedure and the laws on anti-terrorism, the press, political parties, associations and demonstrations.
The third advance outside parliament was that this summer saw the beginnings of a public debate on the taboo subject of the role of the military in political life.
Finally, I would also like to highlight President Sezer' s courage in denouncing corruption, an endemic disease of Turkish society, and in using his legislative veto against texts which represented a step backwards for democracy.
Because there are also delays and even retreats.
In the political sphere, the year was marked by dramatic events in Turkish prisons.
I will leave it to Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who chaired the parliamentary committee which visited Turkish prisons, to express our views on this subject in a moment.
The draft reform of the audiovisual legislation was rightly criticised by the president of the republic, since it did not comply with the principle of the independence of the audiovisual sector in relation to the political powers.
The dissolution of the main opposition party (the Virtue Party) demonstrated that the political system has not stabilised and that changes in the law regarding the status of political parties are required as a matter of urgency.
In general, a gulf persists between good intentions and reality in the human rights field, where progress is too slow: the torture and degrading treatment of detainees continues to be widespread, freedom of expression is still unusually restricted and several thousand people currently in prison for offences would, under our laws, be considered prisoners of conscience.
The main groups working to defend human rights remain subject to what amounts to legal harassment.
In the South-East, the end of armed terrorism by the PKK has not yet been turned to account in embarking on an overall policy towards the south-east provinces and Kurdish identity, and, likewise, the unambiguous European Court of Human Rights judgment has not been used as an opportunity to set free Leyla Zana and the other former parliamentarians from the Democratic People' s Party (HADEP) who are still in prison.
Finally, since the consideration of the Poos report by Parliament, we have seen Mr Denktash' s surprising refusal to restart the negotiations proposed by Commissioner Verheugen, which I welcome, and the UN Secretary-General on the status of Cyprus.
And we note that Turkey continues to block the draft agreement between the European Union and NATO, a draft which is all the more urgent given current international tension.
In this area, as in others, the impression remains that the signs of openness which are, on occasion, expressed by governmental authorities, may be challenged by military powers, which still have an unusual influence on Turkish politics.
Since our resolution of 15 November 2000, which is cited in our current motion for a resolution, our Turkish partners have been aware of the importance our Parliament attaches to the official recognition of the Armenian genocide.
We hope that the processes of dialogue, such as those which bring together former diplomats and academics from Armenia and Turkey, will lead to a common understanding based on scientifically-recognised historical facts.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coming year will be crucial in testing the real desire of Turkish political leaders and Turkish society as a whole to move closer to the European Union.
Over the coming weeks it will be possible to gauge the exact scope of the constitutional and legislative reforms regarding the rule of law.
Coming months will be vital in judging efforts to modernise the economy.
Finally, on the crucial issue of the status of Cyprus, after 27 years of political deadlock, the moment of truth extends from now until autumn 2002.
The end of negotiations on Cyprus' s accession to the EU are set for that date, and this will make it necessary, finally, for both parties to adopt a clear position.
Our judgment will be based on the facts.
Turkey wishes to have its own models for society and democracy.
This is a perfectly legitimate objective.
The European Union does not impose one single model.
On the contrary, its special achievement lies in bringing about the coexistence and collaboration of peoples who have had very different histories, for a long time mutually hostile, and who, on occasion, have very different ideas on fundamental subjects such as the organisation of society, changing moral values, relations between religion and politics, the status of minority communities or races and the application of the subsidiarity principle.
But there are two needs which we all acknowledge.
First of all, that there are universal values which make it necessary that fundamental human and democratic rights are guaranteed in the same way everywhere; secondly, that the models conceived in previous centuries must be adjusted to the needs of this one.
European integration is a way of helping one another to comply with these requirements and to preserve our special qualities in an exciting and dangerous world.
Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to comment on the issues which relate to women's rights in Turkey, to which the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has paid too little attention.
Allow me, therefore, to point out that very little progress has been made with women's rights in Turkey, rights which we, the Committee, consider to be a sine qua non to the integration of Turkey into the European Union, because women's rights are human rights.
I understand that the Turkish National Assembly started a debate today on the reform of the Civil Code, numerous articles of which infringe the United Nations convention on abolishing all forms of discrimination against women, despite Turkey's having ratified the convention.
I trust parliament will pass this bill, as adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in June.
However, the crucial question which arises is whether the law will also apply to existing families because, unfortunately, the Justice Committee submitted an amendment exempting existing families at the last minute.
It is quite unacceptable to introduce changes to the Civil Code that only apply to future generations and I know that women's organisations in Turkey have expressed their total opposition to this.
The national programme for integration into the European Union talks of revising the constitution so as to guarantee sexual equality; however, there are no plans, whatsoever, to adopt positive measures which, as the women's organisations have pointed out, would allow all the laws which institutionalise discrimination against women to be amended.
As far as women's right to work is concerned, I should like to highlight both the high rate of unemployment among women - 39.6% and even higher in agricultural areas - and the limited number of women who benefit from national insurance.
I should like to call on Turkey to abolish all forms of discrimination against women and I should, of course, like to call on Europe to provide the economic and technical assistance needed to put this into practice.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Lamassoure for his report, in which he also points out that, as a Member of NATO, Turkey is a very significant partner particularly at this time.
Despite all of the criticism which we have rightly voiced in the past and still do today, in respect of the constitution and human rights, we have to say that, compared with most of its neighbours, Turkey is a country which is exceptionally pro-western, democratic and respectful of human rights.
Everything is relative and must be seen in its context.
We also have to recognise that progress has been made in a number of areas and that, despite the severe economic problems which Turkey is currently experiencing, it is still attempting, by amending its constitution and changing the composition of its security committee, to ensure that the civilian political forces are given more powers to act in more areas.
We will have to check to see whether all of this is sufficient.
Commissioner, you will have to help us to respect the Copenhagen Criteria.
The Copenhagen Criteria explicitly state that we need to see developments on the political aspects for accession negotiations even to be justified.
We will have to assess this on a case-by-case basis.
If further negotiations get underway we will also have to answer the question of whether Turkey is in a position to meet the conditions of the European internal market.
At this stage, I should like to mention just two points, which will provide a tangible touchstone as the European Union embarks on this very complex development against the background of a very dangerous situation for security policy.
Personally, I cannot understand why Turkey refuses to seek a compromise under the European security and defence policy over the issue of the conditions under which it will be involved and what kind of cooperation there will be with NATO.
For me this is a test case.
We should not allow there to be any blackmail on this issue.
I believe that there has to be a willingness to accept a compromise which was negotiated in Budapest and blocked by the military.
Surely we should now be in a position to find our way back to these criteria and agree on them.
The second point concerns what should be done about Cyprus.
Is Turkey prepared to seek a constructive solution in Cyprus?
If a solution is not possible, how will it react when the European Union enlarges?
I believe that these are two very tangible issues on the basis of which Turkey's credibility can be judged.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Lamassoure on his report.
It is a very good report.
Some people think that it is too soft.
I do not believe that it is too soft; it simply uses a language which leaves the way open for a dialogue with Turkey and we want to enter into this dialogue.
There are a number of hard points, however, which we need to discuss with Turkey, and certainly there is still a need to discuss the issue of human rights, in particular.
It has been mentioned that people are in prison who should not be, first and foremost Leyla Zana.
Turkey could and should, particularly in the light of rulings made by the European courts, ensure that they are released without delay.
On the issue of Kurdish rights too, much remains to be done.
It is obvious that the language, which, thanks to constitutional amendments, can now be used, should also be employed in the official media as soon as possible.
The state of emergency could then be lifted relatively quickly in the provinces in which it is still in force.
The constitutional amendments which Turkey has made are positive steps.
We definitely wish to take note of them.
However, now it is a question, firstly, of removing the constraints still connected to them, for example the death penalty, and, of course, of ensuring that the constitutional amendments are also implemented.
A major task for Turkey is to do this in the very near future.
On the subject of time, I should like to come back to an idea which I put forward when I had the honour of drawing up a report for this Parliament comprising a road map or timetable, and that is why tomorrow we will also be proposing that Turkey, itself, should table a timetable next year showing how it intends to meet the political Copenhagen criterion.
Satisfaction of this political criterion is the precondition for our also being able to negotiate with Turkey.
After all, this is the aim of the whole exercise, of which this report is also a part.
I should also, however, like to address two points, which continue to be crucial for relations between the European Union and Turkey.
The first point is Turkey's assistance in shaping an active and efficient external security policy.
We know that at the end of the day this also presupposes that we are able to use NATO resources and this is still a stumbling block for Turkey.
Turkey needs to know that this is damaging its prospects.
The final problem is Cyprus.
Here, too, I should like to say quite clearly that it is important to resolve the Cyprus problem, firstly, for the Turkish population of Cyprus and secondly, and undoubtedly, for the Greek population of Cyprus, the whole of Europe and Turkey itself.
Turkey simply has not realised this.
I would stress something which I have said repeatedly in the past: Turkey's path to the European Union is via Cyprus.
Its assistance with resolving the Cyprus issue is not a precondition for our accepting Cyprus into the European Union, but it would be a basis on which we could enter into serious discussions about Turkey's membership of the European Union.
Mr President, the Liberal Group welcomes Mr Lamassoure's report, which we find balanced and thoroughly informed.
It will be closely studied in Turkey, where the reformers will find much to encourage them in their efforts to bring Turkey forward on the track of modernisation, liberalisation, full respect for fundamental rights and social and economic progress.
So far the majorities in the Grand National Assembly for reform are great, but could I urge our colleagues inside the Turkish parliament to respond to this report in a truly parliamentary fashion?
Why not pass a resolution calling for their government fully to respect the rulings of all the international courts, including the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg?
Why not pass a resolution supporting the setting up of the Rapid Reaction Force and why not pass a resolution to bring pressure to bear upon Mr Denktash to work towards the integration of Turkish Cypriots into the European Union?
Such reciprocity between our two parliaments would demonstrate, in a dramatic way, that Turkey is truly advancing upon its European journey.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the interpreters for being here in greater numbers than us to translate this very important debate which is being held at such a late hour. Yes, Mr Pasqua, you will have the right to speak.
That will be very interesting. It is not late.
It is the morning for you. As you know, in any event our political leanings vary from morning till night.
So there is no problem.
I would like to say, not to repeat what we have said amongst ourselves since Mr Lamassoure began his report, that it is actually not only a well-packaged report, but also one which rightly says things clearly, being wise and measured.
It is also based on a high degree of consensus, since Mr Lamassoure has really tried to bring together all the opinions in this House.
One thing is clear: Turkey is trying to make reforms, Turkey is making efforts, but, nevertheless, things are moving very, very slowly.
And things are moving very slowly not out of wickedness but because of the fact that democratic culture, the culture of openness, is not a culture which, in a still very authoritarian society, has been imposed on the behaviour of all parties; on the behaviour of governors, on the behaviour of certain political forces or on the behaviour of the military.
Our role as the European Union is not, therefore, simply to give lessons, but, rather, to accompany Turkey on the journey towards democracy, in other words, to have positions to defend.
And that is why I will make a comment, and I would ask all those who still wish to tell Turkey that there was a genocide seventy-five years ago - which is true - in what way does that help the debate in Turkey today?
I do not think that that helps it.
So, what we have in today' s resolution, in this report, is the possibility of holding a genuine, heated dialogue with Turkish society, with the Turkish government, on our notion of democracy, on the notion of freedoms, on our notion of the enlargement of Europe, and, therefore, of the place that Cyprus can and must hold within Europe, and the place which Turkey can and should hold in this process.
I think we should be clear, however.
This evolution will perhaps be more discouraging at some times than at others.
The European Parliament, the societies of the Member States of the European Union, will not show indefinite patience if the situation does not appear to be improving.
I would therefore like to end by appealing to the Turkish parliamentarians up there in the gallery, and say to them that if they really want the Turkey which they love and govern today to join the European Union, they must be aware that the efforts which our notion of democracy requires of Turkey are efforts which go beyond what is being undertaken at the moment by the Turkish Grand Assembly.
They are efforts which go beyond what seems acceptable to the Turkish military.
If they do not go further, our future will perhaps not be a common one, which would be a shame.
Mr President, I think it important that we send two clear messages today.
The first must be that we want Turkey as a member of the EU and as a member of the European family.
It will be good for Turkey, but it will also be good for ourselves.
The second message must be that Turkey is faced with a number of tasks, including that of being honest about its history and its genocide of one and a half million Armenians, half a million Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians and several hundred thousand Greeks.
In addition, there are the tasks - not only on paper but also in practice and in the real world - of improving the conditions in Turkish prisons, ceasing to keep prisoners in solitary confinement, guaranteeing the rights of minorities and ensuring democratic progress not only for minorities but, I would emphasise, for the whole of the Turkish people.
There are the tasks of completely abolishing the death penalty and of getting the political process under way that is necessary if political life in the Turkish state is to be democratised.
I have read my fellow MEP' s, Mr Lamassoure' s, report very carefully.
I have to say that he is very diplomatic.
I think the report is excellent, but I also think it needs to be more precise on a number of points, and a number of amendments have, therefore, also been tabled, not only by my group but also by other groups, and I believe that most of them must be supported.
There is a single exception. I do not think that the EU should interfere in the matter of where Turkey has embassies.
However, I also think that the report is sound, and I shall recommend voting in favour of it, but also, of course, in favour of the amendments tabled by, for example, my group.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened carefully to Mr Lamassoure and the Members who have just spoken.
I will surprise nobody by reminding you of the position of the French delegation of my group.
I have tried in vain to understand why the majority of this House have an absolute desire for Turkey to join the European Union.
For a start, most of the territory of Turkey is not in Europe.
You have decided to urge her to join us.
In reality, this decision has but one justification, which Mr Brok has just confirmed, and that is that Turkey belongs to NATO, and that it is therefore desirable for there to be a certain resemblance between the European Union, as some people imagine it, and NATO.
I have just listened to what Mr Lamassoure said, and what he said in his report, which was full of reservations, of observations which should lead us to ask questions, and while I believe that we should be careful about trying to promote or impose our institutional system or our value system, which is too often our tendency, there are naturally things which are not acceptable.
And it is true that while we are perfectly aware of the difficulties faced by Turkey as a result of the presence of Islamic fundamentalist elements on their territory, which are a danger, which require certain measures to be taken, at the same time we must accept that, in terms of democratic principles, the journey they have to make is still, to say the least, very long.
And besides, many of you have said so before me.
But I will add something else.
What I do not understand, even though a certain number of countries have, unanimously in some cases, such as France, condemned the genocide suffered by the Armenians, is why the current Turkish government and Turkish people, who are not responsible for the past, but who are responsible for a collective history, are determined not to accept responsibility for that genocide.
Other countries which have been responsible for genocides have been better able to accept their responsibilities.
I think it is justifiable, here and now, to ask them to do the same.
In any event, as long as it has not been recognised, as far as we are concerned, we will remain firmly opposed to Turkey' s entry into the European Union.
Mr President, earlier this month, a leading Dutch newspaper sported the following front-page headline: 'As terrorists we can go about our own business in Europe' .
Could this be an arresting and, therefore, not very truthful headline?
Not really, for the enlightening interview with an anonymous member of the extreme-left terrorist movement, Dev Sol, was in total agreement with this disconcerting title.
The outspoken Turkish terrorist left the reader in no doubt as to the fact that his organisation makes full use of the EU' s territory as their base of operation for their murderous actions against the Turkish state and as a willing reservoir of funds, as and when required.
'For in Europe, anything is possible' , the man simply declared.
And should Europe be serious about fighting terrorism, then action will also be taken here, he threatened.
Mr Lamassoure hardly touches upon this highly topical and acute problem in his report.
Despite this, it has been Turkey' s criticism of the EU Member States for years.
The rapporteur' s appreciation, expressed in Paragraph 29, of the Turkish contribution to the fight against international terrorism counts for very little in this.
About terrorism in Turkey, the Lamassoure report concludes in recital G "that Turkey has largely overcome the difficulties posed by various forms of terrorism in the past" .
I should like to find out from the Council and the Commission whether they share this, in my view, far too rash, conclusion.
Official Turkish sources produce very different noises.
These are voices which, following the satanic terrorist attacks on the US, have gained a great deal of support.
They express the feelings of authorities that are deeply hurt.
For years, they could not even count on European solidarity in their bloody fight against Turkish terrorist organisations.
Quite the reverse, in fact. EU Member States offered, and still offer, the activists of those movements shelter.
And while the Ankara authorities condemn the West' s specific policy of tolerance, this time round, Turkey is allowed to take part in the international coalition against terrorism.
After the memorable date of Tuesday, 11 September, Turkey considers that the time has come for the European Union and its Member States finally to issue effective anti-terrorist measures.
In specific terms, this translates into meeting Turkish requests to extradite Turkish terrorists instead of offering them asylum or a residence permit.
The European Union and its Member States should, at long last, recognise the permanent internal and external threat to the Republic of Turkey.
The double standards applied by the Europeans should, at least from the Turkish angle, come to a definite end.
The EU' s emphasis on human rights in Turkey coinciding with the fact that it turns a blind eye to the fight against international terrorism is unacceptable.
At least, this is the Turkish point of view.
Is this harsh criticism levelled by Turkey at Europe justified?
It is a fact that various violent groupings of Turkish origin maintain organisational structures in EU Member States.
Certainly after 11 September, it is more difficult for Brussels and the capitals of the EU countries to ignore this in silence.
How do the Council and the Commission intend to cooperate with Turkey, a country which has, after all, formally acquired candidate country status, in future in the fight against international terrorism?
Indeed, there is no shortage of legal and political pitfalls.
The far from gentle criticism levelled at the Lamassoure report speaks for itself.
Despite this, the progress of Turkey' s accession to the European Union will also depend on Europe' s reaction to Turkey' s 'open flank' , also known as the country' s Achilles' heel for terrorist attacks.
Mr President, I would not like to miss this opportunity to join the other Members, with knowledge of the subject, in complimenting Mr Alain Lamassoure on the quality of his report.
I say 'with knowledge of the subject' because I know how passionate the debates on this subject have been over the last two years or more.
I would like to expand on just two points of the report, which have already been mentioned by Mr Brok and others.
The first relates to the geostrategic importance of Turkey, which has certainly increased as a result of the events which have just taken place and by the European Union' s realisation of the need to enter into a coalition to combat Islamic fundamentalist terrorism.
To this end, I would like to say to our Turkish colleagues who are in the gallery, how in vain it would be, to fear that European defence might develop in competition, in parallel, and therefore redundantly, with defence based on the Atlantic Alliance.
European defence is based on the Atlantic Alliance and it will continue in that direction, quite simply because Europe would not have the means to do otherwise.
My second comment concerns Cyprus.
It has been said that the resolution of the Cypriot problem is one of the conditions, in my view a prior condition, of any possible decision on the entry of Turkey into the Union.
I do not believe that the Turkish populations in Cyprus are really in danger today and I believe it would be a very important gesture for Turkey to accept, as a first step, during the current negotiations, a reduction in the number of its armed forces in Cyprus, or even better, their evacuation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should, of course, also like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Lamassoure, on his success in drafting a good report.
I am saying this, above all, because in Turkey, I often come across people making a certain assertion: those in Turkey who repeatedly accuse the European Parliament of being hostile to Turkey will now have to admit yet again that this assertion is not true.
Like the report of my colleague, Mr Swoboda, this report, too, is an objective opinion on the situation in Turkey.
As the rapporteur states, the flurry of legislative activity in the Turkish Parliament to reform the constitution really is laudable.
Given the current constraints in Turkey, our Turkish colleagues, some of whom are also here today amongst us, have really been very successful.
Now, however, they are asked to continue the work which they have begun.
The Ministries for Home Affairs and Justice in the Turkish Republic play an important role in this area.
The long-awaited implementation of the reform is urgently necessary, particularly now after 11 September, but also in spite of 11 September.
It is easy to ascertain through the Turkish media that people are still being tortured in some police stations.
There are still strange cases of people committing suicide while in police custody.
For as long as this kind of thing continues to happen in Turkey, and, for as long as Turkey is not prepared to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, there will obviously be no date for the start of accession negotiations and Turkey will remain the only country, out of 13 countries with candidate status, not to have started negotiating.
I hope that this last report will motivate those responsible in Turkey to move forward and, not only to talk about reforms, but also to really implement them.
Mr President, this very good report shows Turkey is making progress towards Europe, but more is needed.
For instance, 19 people are being prosecuted for insulting state officials because they attended a conference at which victims who had suffered torture in the form of rape in custody spoke out against their tormenters.
It is not only women to whom this happens.
It is clearly outrageous that the state should condemn the victims, rather than their aggressors.
I call on the Turkish authorities to drop these shameful prosecutions.
Secondly, I want to urge the Turkish government to take an initiative towards a political settlement with the Kurds.
The PKK have observed the cease-fire for over two years.
Its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights against the unfairness of his trial.
It is time to launch peace negotiations.
Finally, now is not the time to eject 80 000 Kurds, breach environmental standards and human rights, in order to construct the Ilisu dam.
It must not be built and EU governments, such as the UK government, must not grant export credit.
Mr President, what efforts has the Turkish government made since the Helsinki Summit to guarantee human and fundamental rights, to find a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue and to abolish the death penalty?
The latest amendment to the Turkish constitution does not go far enough.
The death penalty has only been partially abolished and the Kurdish language has not been recognised.
Is this a genuine reform?
I would answer, no.
Turkey must not be given any special treatment in the enlargement process.
I think that we run the risk of giving in to Turkey's wishes if we adopt the Lamassoure report as it stands.
The report is guarded on a number of issues so that we leave Turkey room for manoeuvre.
We must insist that a political solution be found to the Kurdish issue and that human and fundamental rights be guaranteed.
The time is right for sweeping reforms.
In my conversations with people on my trips to Turkey they have repeatedly expressed a wish for peace, brotherliness and freedom.
I, too, carry this message in my heart and will also do all I can in the future so that one day this wish will come true.
Mr President, I, too, should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur Mr Lamassoure on his recent effort to draft as objective and balanced a report as possible on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union, a task rendered all the more difficult by the particular nature of this country's problems in various sectors of special interest to Parliament, such as its record on human and minority rights, its democratic principles, its international conduct, its refusal to admit to tragic historic events and so on.
Having said which, I think that, thanks to certain amendments approved by the rapporteur and despite certain other amendments dictated by the policy of expediency, the final report which has taken shape is generally acceptable, even to the official Turkish side.
And, of course, we all know what that means, we just have to make allowances for the usual abusive response by the Turkish foreign secretary towards the honourable Mr Poos and his report, which is seen as negative towards Turkey.
So all that remains is to ascertain the extent to which Turkey will basically respond to the good will and to the spirit which dominates the report, by which I mean the spirit of constructive criticism of numerous Turkish shortcomings, the deliberately indirect reference to the continuing Turkish military occupation of Cyprus, which is unacceptable in a civilised society, the fact that previous Turkish crimes, such as the genocide of the Armenians, have been passed over in silence, contrasting with praise for any minor progress made by Turkey or any circumstantial compliance by Turkey with its contractual obligations, such as Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
Time will tell if Turkey recognises and appreciates these well-meant messages, although I fear that experience to date does not give us cause to be optimistic that we shall soon have a clear response from Turkey to the effect that it really is prepared to prove itself worthy of its candidate status and of integration into the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lamassoure report maintains that Turkey has a right to become a member of the European Union.
That is its basic message.
I, for my part, believe that membership is not just Turkey's right, it is vital to the country.
Historically speaking, Turkey has made an admirable effort to move towards Europe. An effort which started not today but a long time ago.
Turkey's efforts to modernise started at the end of the nineteenth century.
We Greeks, as Turkey's neighbours and 'historic adversaries' , if I may put it thus, know this better than anyone else.
We know from our own experience how difficult it is move forward from a tradition of eastern despotism towards a modern society.
Turkey has a particularly long tradition in this respect because it was at the top of the pyramid of despotism in our region.
Turkey suffered the historical accident of basically coming out unscathed - not unscathed as such, because it suffered a great deal - but it was not defeated in either the First or the Second World War.
Sometimes it is better to lose than to win a war.
We must not forget that France and Germany, the mainstays of the European Union, were both defeated, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the Second World War and I think that they learned that armed force and confrontation are not the way to survive in today's world.
The disaster on the 11 September has taught us, I think, that today's world needs reconciliation in order to survive, by which I do not of course mean reconciliation with the terrorists, I mean reconciling tensions between us, precisely in order to isolate terrorists and establish a safe and fair world.
Turkey is a third world European country which needs to learn the same lesson as France and Germany, that is, that if we want to move on, we have to stop waging the wars of the 1920s or the wars of the 1940s in the present day.
I think that Turkey has built up an internal mechanism and a system of external relations which is dominated by the idea of authority and it uses this to tyrannise its people - witness the terrible story of prisoners' suicides and much else besides.
Of course, the move which Turkey has to make is a difficult one.
But it is trying to make it and we must help it and our reception of it in the European Union must be commensurate with its efforts to move towards us.
Mr President, the report acknowledges certain obvious truths.
That is a fact.
However, at the same time it makes findings which have no bearing on reality.
It sees progress where there is none, it extols the famous 'national programme' and a number of individual reforms which, basically, do no more than pull the wool over the eyes of the world in order to conceal the continuing and, from certain sides, the worsening situation for the working classes.
We warned that the decision taken in Helsinki would help not to democratise but to embolden the regime.
The army is still the determining factor in political life.
The grass-roots movement is being dealt with in the crudest fashion.
Arrests, over 10 000 political prisoners, torture chambers, murders, inhumane conditions in prisons, which are extolled in the report, are on the agenda.
The hunger strikers have been fighting to the death now for 370 days and dozens have already died.
The death penalty has only been abolished for criminal prisoners, not for people fighting for democracy and freedom.
The report calls these fighters extremists and the Turkish state calls them terrorists, while the Kurds are deprived of fundamental rights, the occupying forces remain in Cyprus after their barbaric invasion 27 years ago and the report says not a word.
However, the key point of the report is Paragraph 29, which extols Turkey's contribution to the fight against terrorism, clearly dismissing the Kurdish fighters, and its peace-brokering efforts in the Balkans, obviously meaning its open support for the KLA criminals, and it incites it to facilitate the application of the ÃÃÃÃ treaty.
Allow me to finish by saying that my brotherly love towards and solidarity with the Turkish people prevent me from voting in favour of this report.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I think I was right to take my headphones off relatively early on.
It spared me somewhat.
Mr Lamassoure has submitted an excellent report, as numerous Members have said.
I should like to qualify the report as a fair report, because I think that Turkey, like every other candidate, is entitled to a fair report, meaning that we duly address all the shortcomings, but we also acknowledge any progress made.
I should like to call on our Turkish counterparts and the Turkish people to take note of the report as a whole and not just selectively, just as we are making an effort to take note of all the developments in Turkey.
Finally, I take the view that a Turkey that has made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is preferable to a Turkey which has not made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
It is a Turkey that is motivating the forces trying to overcome the unacceptable shortcomings still remaining within the country in relation to the political criteria.
It is not in a position to expect political discounts.
We do, of course, realise that we rightly wish that all Muslim countries in the world were structured like Turkey and that we would then have fewer problems, especially in the light of 11 September.
But this discount does not mean turning a blind eye when it comes to the candidate countries.
On the other hand, however, Turkey is also entitled not to have any additional conditions imposed.
For example, I think that Mr Lamassoure has chosen exactly the right wording for the point on Armenia.
Having expressly referred to the genocide last year, we note this year that things are clearly moving in the right direction.
We realise that people are getting together to talk about the past.
My own country found this a very worthwhile exercise and I think that this is an approach which we should support in this specific case, so that good neighbourly relations can develop in the future between Turkey and Armenia.
Mr President, I, too, agree that not-insignificant progress has been made, and not just in terms of the Copenhagen criteria - a rather cold, aristocratic expression which conjures up an image of this Europe that always wants to be seen as a model of democracy. I am thinking, rather, of the extremely tangible progress made in the field of honesty: the courage and honesty of a President who is able to condemn the corruption present in his own country.
However, we would be wronging Turkey if we did not make things absolutely clear to her - being clear, not hypocritical - and being clear means telling her that a great deal remains to be done in terms of democratic civilisation and behaviour, and that means reforms.
In this sense, the ability to implement political and social reforms benefiting the Kurdish minority is a highly effective parameter.
It is true and important that the Turkish Constitution intends to remove some of the restrictions placed on the use of the Kurdish language but, Mr President, I am appalled by this idea of partial removal of restrictions: the idea of partial removal of restrictions applied to a fundamental right such as the use of one' s own language is a quite horrific contradiction in terms.
I am also appalled by the fact that only a cultural right is being recognised to a minority that does not enjoy even the most basic political and social rights.
Mr President, we expect Turkey to show signs of cooperation, and a sign in precisely this area - addressing this long-standing dispute with the Kurdish people with courage and tolerance, in a tolerant, civilised manner - would be very well received by the entire European Parliament.
Mr President, I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lamassoure's excellent work as rapporteur.
Although I have been a constant critic of Turkey's human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds, I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country.
I do not agree with those who believe the boundaries of Europe should be narrow and exclusively Christian.
I want to see a pluralistic Europe.
I have always believed that Turkey could be a very important bridge-head between the current Members of the EU and the Islamic world.
This would facilitate greater understanding and mutual respect.
It is especially important in the changed world that exists after 11 September.
However, Turkey still has a long way to go.
In last year's annual assessment report the Commission concluded that, although a wide-ranging debate on political reforms had begun and Turkey had signed several international human rights instruments over the past year, the situation on the ground had hardly improved.
Let us hope that the publication of next month's annual report will show significant improvement.
In this context, I welcome the recent decision by the Turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring Turkey further in line with the acquis communautaire.
At the launch of the EU-Turkish Foundation of 17 October, Commissioner Verheugen said that these reforms are a significant step towards better protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey.
It is clear that continued support for a closer EU-Turkey relationship, including eventual accession, is the best way to accelerate political reform and progress in human rights.
However, the timetable for possible accession lies in Turkish hands alone.
Negotiations can only begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria.
It must strive harder to fulfil its obligations in that regard.
Mr President, I think that this debate, once again, underlines the fact that we all share the same premise: that it is imperative that we, in the European Union, should have increasingly close relations with Turkey, until the opportunity arises, when the time is right, that it should become a Member State in its own right.
But it also underlines another point of view that we should make very clear to the Turkish authorities: that in order for this to take place, Turkey must become a full democracy.
I agree with what Mr Lamassoure has said in his report. The Turks have made advances.
It is also true, however, that this constitutional reform contains three elements that impair its credibility. First of all, it ceases to class as crimes actions that are still crimes because they fulfil the conditions as such.
Secondly, the constitution is being reformed, but other laws remain in force, such as the Penal Code, the anti-terrorism law and the audiovisual law, which continue to uphold the existence of certain crimes of expression, of opinion, of public demonstration and association. Thirdly, and most importantly, the constitutional reform is not being put into practice.
Arbitrary detentions and violations of human rights continue to take place.
We all receive, as I do myself, constant complaints, of which, today, there have been many, that are continually causing problems for the defenders of human rights and their organisations, not to mention, of course, the situation of the Kurdish people.
Yes, the Kurdish people.
It is not enough to lift the restriction of using a language if this is upheld in law and there is no recognition of the existence of a Community as a people in their own right.
This is the case with the Kurds.
This is even more the case, Mr President, where a Sakharov Prize winner, Mrs Leyla Zana, remains in gaol, and we must continue to strongly demand that she be freed.
Mr President, I would like to call on history to remind us that, while it serves its purpose on occasions to demonstrate a point, it can also let us down.
I would particularly like to remind Mr Pasqua that he should recall where the Presocrats originate from, that Ionic art was born in Turkey, and that the truly Christian French Kings did not hesitate to call upon the Ottoman Empire to fight against the Pope and other European States in the Sixteenth Century.
However, if we continue to look into history, we will also see both good things and bad things about Turkey.
Turkey, in the strategic position it occupies, is the only truly secular state, and Europe has been founded upon this great battle to achieve secular states.
On this level, then, yes, Turkey is a totally European State.
Its efforts to eliminate religious interference, whilst having truly fundamentalist communities within its borders, is something to be admired, and which could be a factor for future stability in the region.
On the other hand, under the Ottoman Empire, the Greek monasteries, the Sufis and the Sephardis all survived.
