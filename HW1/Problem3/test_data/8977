The implementation of measures will create greater transparency and a degree of responsibility in the political process of the European Union.
European culture and its diversity will be fostered, and cooperation between citizens and organisations of various countries will be encouraged.
The same evaluation of the past, Stalin's gulags and the fascist Holocaust, would strengthen European citizenship.
It is important that this programme is accessible to all interested parties, that is non-governmental organisations and educational institutions.
This initiative is the key to citizens having a conscious effect on their own and their children's future in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, as a European and Catalan I fully support the need to reinforce historical memory in order to avoid future disasters while we learn from our past.
In Mr Takkula's report there is a proposal to finance historical sites related to the main totalitarian regimes that Europe endured during the 20th century â Nazism and Stalinism.
I agree with him, but we would also like to extend this proposal to other aspects directly related to this kind of authoritarianism.
In our case, in the Catalan country, we suffered Franco's dictatorship which was closely related in origin to Nazism and Italian Fascism.
The only president of a democratic nation killed as a consequence of World War II was LluÃ­s Companys, President of the Catalan Autonomous Government.
The first civilian population bombed indiscriminately by hostile aircraft was Guernica, the emblematic town in the Basque country.
If we neglect Franco's regime and other dictatorships in southern Europe and the need to rescue the historical memory of this dark period of our history, we avoid discussing the consequences of dictatorships, some of them very disturbing for the European Union, even today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the measures contained in the Citizens for Europe programme will help create sound principles for coexistence and interaction between nations.
They will raise awareness of each nationâs individuality and promote recognition of its national cultural heritage.
In addition, they will contribute to the elimination of stereotypes and help our citizens to become more favourably disposed towards diversity.
I was pleased to note that in the section concerning memorial sites to victims of totalitarian regimes, financial support is made available not only for remembrance of victims of Nazism but also for activities relating to Stalinism.
Throughout its history, Europe has suffered under a great many cruel and inhuman dictators, and none of this suffering should be forgotten.
In view of the meagre budget allocated to this particular aim, however, our efforts should focus only on the two most shocking and horrific of these regimes, whose effects were felt on a massive scale with consequences at global level.
Stalin and Hitlerâs regimes must become symbols of evil, and be imprinted on our childrenâs consciousness as murderous systems.
This will prevent any recurrence of such regimes.
Accordingly, we must also ensure that suitable sums are allocated to the implementation of appropriate cultural programmes in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, and this time I am also speaking as the mayor of a lovely town north of Rome.
As mayor, I have undertaken countless activities to promote a European identity, encouraging the citizens to participate and cooperate, especially through twinning and cultural exchanges in which young people and students, together with others, have played a leading role.
I find, in fact, that citizens who deal on a daily basis with problems that are often far removed from those addressed in this House need tangible demonstrations of the fact that there is a basis of common values for all 450 million Europeans.
They will have to feel this very strongly if the gap between the people and the institutions is to be closed.
I therefore support the Commissionâs proposal and all the activities proposed, especially those that promote the European values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights: I think they are valid and should be endorsed.
I therefore hope that this project will be taken forward with as much institutional and financial support as possible.
Other concomitant measures are needed, however.
First of all, there is a need to improve communications and information on the activities of our institutions at a local level, and we should therefore promote information campaigns, debates and talks on major European topics.
I also believe that any measure to promote so-called âEuropean citizenshipâ will be fruitless unless during the coming debates we take due account of the needs, demands and expectations of civil society.
Making citizens feel that they really are taking part in the many huge challenges that we still have to face is perhaps the most realistic way to create a solid, common foundation on which to build our future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to MrÂ Takkula for the work he has done, and I am also pleased that it really had the support of the whole committee.
This programme represents the only opportunity for most citizens of participating in the body of European thought, and becoming involved, as active members of our civil society.
In effect, the referendums in France and the Netherlands have made it necessary for us to explain things better, to explain enlargement, to explain the Constitutional Treaty, to dispel peopleâs fears about globalisation.
This programme makes all of this possible, with the help of intermediaries, who receive money from this programme.
I am pleased that the Commission named some of these, therefore.
Indeed, there is no need to reinvent the wheel; there are institutions that have been working on European citizenship for a long time already.
To MrÂ Allister â he is not here any more, unfortunately â who said earlier that he does not want to be a European, I can only say that I am a citizen of Saarland â a small German â I am a German, and I am a European.
It is like a Russian doll; it is possible to be all of these, none of them are ruled out.
Collectively, we are all committed to European values, however.
I deplore the fact that we have thrown ourselves too much into the issue of Nazi and Stalinist memorial sites.
In this connection, I should like to say to MrÂ Sifunakis â who has also already left, unfortunately â that he actually exceeded his powers.
His motion regarding these memorial sites was defeated in committee.
The committee decided against it.
MrÂ Sifunakis then proceeded to write to all the members of the committee as its chairman, requesting that they kindly follow him this time.
As far as I am aware, that is something that has never happened in this House in my 16Â years here.
I hope that my fellow Members will not follow him.
I should like to make one final point â one already touched upon by MrÂ Battilocchio: we need town-twinning activities, which do a wonderful job.
This is another area in which it is possible to achieve more with a little more money than a great deal of other things that could have been devised.
I would ask the Commissioner to include the three additional organisations we want to involve.
These have done a wonderful job, and he can rely on them.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, âCitizens for Europeâ means arousing citizensâ interest in Europe, informing them about Europe, involving them in decisions, offering them means of communicating, and ultimately filling them with enthusiasm for Europe.
We are unfortunately becoming further and further removed from the latter.
I am convinced, however, that the present programme has the potential to contribute a great deal towards reducing Euroscepticism.
As MrsÂ Pack has just said, one key aspect is town-twinning activities, which foster mutual acquaintance and understanding by means of common selective, but also structured, multiannual agreements.
This is a very inexpensive communication project but, unfortunately, is not being recognised as such.
If we were to increase investment in this project, we could dispense with many a brochure.
The aim of citizensâ projects is to bring interested parties together to work on European issues, which makes it possible to reach a broad public.
If included in networks, clubs and associations can be an effective tool for reaching citizens, strengthening social cohesion and preventing exclusion or discrimination among a wide variety of groups of people â an important basis for active citizenship and the European dialogue.
The âactive European remembranceâ campaign has been included in this programme for the first time, as the committee is of the opinion that European history needs to be discussed in the context of a broad public.
The discussion has also shown â and this shows that we were right â that this important issue should not be dealt with as a small contribution to this programme âÂ as a peripheral phenomenon, as it were â but calls for a programme in its own right.
This is in order to draw attention to all forms of dictatorship and their victims, including, in particular, making young people and future generations aware of the atrocities perpetrated by past regimes, and to work on ensuring that our democracies are, and remain, strong enough to render such inhumane regimes impossible in future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate MrÂ Takkula on his excellent work and outstanding report.
The first thing that I welcome in it is the proposal to change the title of the programme from âCitizens for Europeâ to âEurope for Citizensâ.
This inversion of the words encapsulates the whole meaning of the culture that, from now on, should lie at the heart of Community action: the means and not the end for Europeâs peoples to achieve their aspirations.
I am delighted that greater attention is being paid to the citizens and that there is a new-found sensitivity to issues of culture and European identity. This is shown by the fact that the agenda for this plenary session also includes the reports by MrÂ Hammerstein Mintz, on the opening of Council meetings to the public; MrÂ Cashman, on access to the institutionsâ texts; and MrsÂ Prets, on the European Capital of Culture.
We in this House therefore have the opportunity â I would even say the duty â to make this Europe more transparent, more democratic, easier to understand and, hence, more acceptable.
At such a difficult time in the European integration process as we are now experiencing, when nationalist, separatist tendencies appear to be gaining new legitimacy, disseminating mutual knowledge about our different cultures is certainly a vital means of social integration and of exalting the values that unite us, and it plays a key role in the fight against racism and xenophobia.
To conclude, that is why I think it is important to endow this programme with more substantial, more adequate funding.
MrÂ President, the sense of belonging and feeling European also needs to be developed in Europeâs citizens, who no longer want to be subject to Europe but want to create it instead.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Figelâ, MrÂ Takkula, ladies and gentlemen, in the last century the distinguished historian Hannah Arendt concluded, with wonderful simplicity, but accurately, that nothing is in principle more characteristic of totalitarian regimes and dictators than the astonishingly short space of time it takes for their crimes against humanity to be forgotten and, just as astonishingly, the fact that new tyrants can calmly appear in their place.
The chance to observe new Stalins and Hitlers has unfortunately not disappeared even to this day.
For precisely this reason our shared duty is not to allow the crimes committed by the Nazis and Soviet totalitarian Communism to be forgotten.
We must remember the horror that occurred when the insane ideas of two tyrants subjected the peoples of Europe to mass murders, people slaughtered in death camps and the distortion of destiny, blackening the pages of Europeâs history.
Regardless of the difference in their individual ideas, both totalitarian regimes can be considered equal.
Both Hitler and Stalin organised mass deportations, set up death camps and ordered mass murders, slaughtering millions of people, among them defenceless children.
I can say with certainty that nearly every European family has a story to tell about the blighted fates of fathers, brothers or sisters.
The crimes of Hitlerâs Nazis and of Stalinism cannot and must not be forgotten, particularly this year, when 14Â June will mark the passing of 65 years since the start of the ruthless mass deportations from the Baltic states.
Thank you, Christopher Beazley, for reminding us of these facts.
Today we should foster among Europeâs peoples understanding of the principles of respect for democracy, freedom and human rights.
We should do this so that no contemporary copycat Stalin could ever even dream that he would go unpunished.
We must actively support projects that preserve the memory of Nazism and Stalinism, mass deportations and the dead.
We must show our children the places connected with mass deportations and concentration camps and we must preserve the memories of the victims.
I call upon you to vote for a reunification of Europeâs history!
Â Â  Mr President, tomorrow we will vote on this report on the âCitizens for Europeâ programme, which, as other speakers have said, is intended to promote active European citizenship and which comes within the context of the Unionâs concern about the citizensâ distance towards the European institutions and the difficulties they face identifying with the process of integration.
I would like to express my full support for this programme and congratulate Mr Takkula on the work he has done.
Let us talk about Action 4 of this programme, which is aimed at the preservation of the memorial sites related to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination; I also fully support the memory of these hideous regimes that marked the European and world history of the 20th century.
I would also like to add, however, that under no circumstances can we exclude other victims, who are equally innocent and unfairly treated by history, such as the victims of fascism and other European dictatorships.
In fact, Mr President, less than a month ago, the Council of Europe adopted a resolution on the international condemnation of the Franco rÃ©gime.
If one of the objectives of this programme is to forge a European identity based on common values, history and culture and to strengthen European integration on the basis of respect, mutual understanding and appreciation and cultural diversity, the European Parliament must not fail to acknowledge the history of many European countries which for years suffered repression and murder in their fight for freedom.
Spainâs transition to democracy is inextricably linked to our entry into the European Union twenty years ago.
And, within the framework of this programme, it is right to recognise the victims of this black period in our history, because that would quite rightly contribute to strengthening the citizens' ties with the Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, the lack of budget â which is a reality â cannot justify the exclusion of certain victims at the expense of others.
We should not be comparing different wars or quantifying a massacre according the deaths involved, but rather remembering all victims, so that by preserving their memory we can prevent such events from ever happening again.
I would ask you, therefore, to support the amendments supported by more than 60 members from different groups in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, because they will enrich the programme, on the basis of the full recognition of European historical memory and with a view to strengthening a feeling of citizenship.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the detachment of the public from the institutions and bodies of the European Union, the lack of identification with the process of European integration and also the failure to involve the public in debates over the extent of future enlargement are all confronting the EU as a whole with a sizeable problem. This has manifested itself most strikingly in the French and Dutch referenda on ratification of the EU Constitution.
In other countries too, however, including those that joined in May 2004, there are negative manifestations of the information deficit.
One positive aspect is the publicâs desire for more information, and also their interest in rational and sensible activities.
The Citizens for Europe programme under discussion today is an instrument with the potential for fulfilling this demand.
Some of the actions set out in it are already proving their value today, and are being intensively pursued.
One positive example of this is the twinning programme, which any community can participate in regardless of its size.
The programme is particularly amenable to small communities, as it is very easy to obtain a grant and there are no unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles.
The minimum grant for funding, for example, meetings between members of partnership communities is set very low so that where there is demand it will not be difficult to find the financial support.
The twinning partnerships of towns, and the way that citizens work together to solve European questions or to support voluntary organisations, can strengthen shared European values while at the same time respecting national and regional diversity.
The Member States must supplement these actions with activities in the areas of culture and education.
An emphasis on the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, as well as support for multiculturalism and multilingualism should be recognised as a priority and a common interest.
I would like to end by expressing my appreciation for the work of the rapporteur and for the willing cooperation of the Committee on Culture and Education.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Takkulaâs report deals with an extremely important topic.
Congratulations on your good work.
Today the European Union is becoming a fairground where the politicians of the Member States are guided only by their own interests and the objective of satisfying their voters.
There is not enough of a feeling among citizens of the Member States of the European Union that they are actually citizens of Europe.
In order to develop a feeling of citizenship, it is important to know one anotherâs history.
Before and after the Second World War, many European peoples languished under totalitarian rule.
My homeland Estonia was wiped from the map by one of the most ruthless dictators in history, Stalin.
We no longer had our own flag or national anthem, and our capital city was Moscow.
Stalinismâs twin brother was Nazism.
These two ideologies, which were born at the same time, divided Europe among themselves with the Hitler-Stalin Pact.
Stalin held the entire eastern part of Europe under dictatorial rule for half a century.
Hitlerâs war machine violently subjugated the part of Western Europe in which local dictators were unable to seize power themselves.
In seeking the equal remembrance of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism, I am fighting against the merely token acceptance of the new Member States into the European Union.
I condemn all forms of totalitarianism.
I would like to emphasise, however, that Nazism and Stalinism are the cornerstone of all other totalitarian ideologies.
Rulers like Franco, Mussolini and Salazar tortured their victims on the example set by Hitler and Stalin.
Each Member State of the European Union should take responsibility for the just assessment of their dictatorâs actions in their home country.
At the moment, however, we are discussing Stalinism and Nazism, which transcended and did not respect state borders.
It is the duty of the Member States to collectively condemn the cruelties of Hitler and Stalin, which split Europe in two and separated it with an Iron Curtain.
Let us therefore work together, in the framework of the âCitizens for Europeâ programme, to jointly remember the victims of Stalinism and Nazism.
Â Â  Mr President, I have two remarks, one is on the report and the other is of a general nature.
Firstly, I should like to congratulate my friend MrÂ Takkula on his report.
It is his first report, it is a big report and he has done an excellent job in raising all the key issues.
I support every bit of it.
I also support all the wording on Stalin and Hitler.
I must admit that, although I am not a member of the committee, I fully support what MrsÂ Pack said.
It is quite amazing that the chairman of the committee, MrÂ Sifunakis, takes a completely opposite view to what has been decided in the committee, but so be it.
If I did not know MrÂ Takkula well, having read this report, I might even think that he is a federalist, but perhaps not this time round.
My more general remark is really about European citizenship and national citizenship.
Some people seem to think that we are somehow trying to create a European prototype, but I disagree.
I am a federalist myself, but I think that identity is first local, then national and after that European.
I have lived in Brussels for seven years.
To be quite honest, when I came to Brussels, I had a few prejudices about nationalities.
For example: Finns do not talk at all; every German has the same sense of humour as our President in the chair today; every Frenchman always speaks through three points; no Italian has ever drawn an operative conclusion.
That was the feeling I had when I came to Brussels.
Those are the national prototypes that we have.
To be quite honest, after seven years I think that my prejudices have only strengthened â in a very positive way, but, nevertheless strengthened.
So we are certainly not creating any kind of a prototype European.
It seems to me that the only time that we can really feel European is, for instance, through sport: the Ryder Cup in golf is a great example, and Eurovision is something that brings us together.
However, all in all, I think this report is great because it gives us four pieces of action.
I can support each and every one of them.
It has no propaganda in it, so I hope the Commission takes it seriously and takes on board all the changes that Mr Takkula has proposed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the programme to promote active European citizenship, used correctly, has the potential to become a very valuable tool for bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens and combating Euroscepticsm.
With a budget of less than EURÂ 300Â million for seven years and with 36Â countries involved, expectations are high.
Nevertheless, in view of its four different action fields, implementation will be difficult.
For this reason, I should like to thank MrÂ Takkula, who has made real efforts to achieve a balance and also to refrain from making any cuts in the small budget, for example in the field of town-twinning activities.
These are citizensâ projects that strengthen European consciousness and identity at grass-roots level.
We want to promote the active, civil-society projects in the EU, in which there is so much idealism: they need our attention and support.
We want to support the public-relations activities of the Europe Houses and of the institutes operating throughout Europe.
I would ask the Commissioner to incorporate our proposals.
The fourth action is also very important to me, as a German Social Democrat.
I hail from Nuremberg, the city of the Nazi Party conferences.
In the present day, the city is making efforts to shake off its old image and restyle itself as a city of human rights.
Anyone wanting to actively shape the future needs to be aware of his past, which is why actionÂ 4, âactive European remembranceâ, is so important.
We need to remember the victims of the violent Nazi and Stalinist regimes, and also the relevant places and memorial sites.
We also need to remember all the victims of dictatorships, however, and therefore I would ask you to support Amendments 54 and 55 by my group.
The reason for this request is that we should be very careful not to play victims off against one another.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I welcome MrÂ Takkuliâs report and the proposal to create an additional, fourth action entitled Active European Remembrance.
Much has been said in this House about economic and social integration, but there has been a tendency to overlook the role of historical integration as a key element of integration.
Europe has always reflected its past and continues to draw on that legacy today.
Communism and Nazism were two totalitarian regimes that contributed equally to the bloody history of the 20thÂ century.
It is not appropriate to use the term Stalinism.
Communism in general was a curse of the 20thÂ century.
The nature of relations between European countries and nations is coloured by historical experiences, but even the most difficult and painful of these can be transformed into strong ties of affection.
Pope John Paul II said that despite tremendous achievements in a number of areas, the 20thÂ century was characterised by the mystery of evil.
We have carried this legacy of good and evil with us into the 21stÂ century.
The House has debated issues relating to historical policy on a number of occasions.
I could mention the debates on the 60thÂ anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the 25thÂ anniversary of Solidarity for example.
These debates revealed the extent of misunderstanding of basic historical facts and of our historical legacy.
The notion of a European identity must be based on acceptance of the truth about our past.
Remembering the victims of mass deportations and extermination undertaken by Communism and the Nazis will not foster distrust amongst nations.
It will instead remind us all of the fundamental right to freedom, the rule of law, and respect from others.
This is the only way for the European Union to make its founding fathersâ message of unity in diversity a reality.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank all the participants in this debate for their very interesting points and contributions.
We can easily agree that, although the consensus is strong, there are sometimes questions about programmes or European identity, but that identity is none the less emerging.
We perhaps see it more from the outside than the inside, but it is complementary to our basic personal, national, local, regional dimensions; it is enriching.
It is important to remember tragedies in Europe, especially at a time when we are still looking for war criminals on the continent.
It is not such a long time ago that many parts of Europe were full of bloody places, borders and mass graves, and it is important to remember that.
I do not need to answer specific points because I covered them at the start.
Regarding finance, we are in negotiations.
I hope that strong support by Parliament, as seen recently in relation to citizenship, youth and education programmes, will be seen at the final meetings of the Troika or current negotiations on the Financial Perspective.
We will mainstream citizenship issues via different actions and different programmes, because that is important.
The last point concerns the title.
I think both the Commission and Parliament are partially correct.
It is only partially correct to state that there is either Europe for citizens, or citizens for Europe.
If you recall John Fitzgerald Kennedyâs message to the people, Europe can be built only on the foundations of mature citizens, and a mature Europe can deliver many answers to our citizens.
So, we need both: Europe for citizens and citizens for Europe.
I believe that this programme can contribute to such a mature community(1).
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday.
Â Â  â Developing a European identity, improving mutual understanding and integration, and valuing diversity through dialogue are fundamental objectives for consolidating the European Union.
European unity cannot be imposed from above, but rather must be the outcome of everyoneâs sense of responsibility.
The actors must be families, social groupings, the widespread voluntary sector and grass-roots associations.
Bringing people together and encouraging local communities to meet to exchange experiences, opinions and values are all necessary for European citizenship to mature.
Being a citizen of Europe means being part of a culture that has at its centre the richness of a life lived responsibly and loved creatively, a life to which we courageously bear witness against all comers.
Let us keep an active remembrance, in which the horrors that we Europeans have witnessed may serve as a warning for a different future.
Such a remembrance in my city, Padua, in my region, Veneto, will breathe life into the creation of a Remembrance Museum in Villa Venier, in the municipality of Voâ Euganeo.
The âCitizens for Europeâ programme is therefore an inspired idea that should be developed and passed on to every single country, town and municipality in Europe, and it has our staunch support.
The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 34, 39, 43, 46, 50(2), 51 and 61.
Amendments 12, 14, 16, 20, 27, 30, 32, 37, 41, 42, 44, 48 and 52 can be accepted in principle provided that they are redrafted.
Reserved position pending agreement on financial perspectives on Amendments 36, 45, 49 and 50(3).
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 8, 9, 11, 13, 23, 26, 33, 35, 38, 40, 47, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62 and 63.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0061/2006) by MrsÂ Prets on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2007 to 2019 (COM(2005)0209 â C6-0157/2005 â 2005/0102(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Capital of Culture action is probably one of the most popular European initiatives.
It has been appreciated by Member States and the general public alike since its birth 20 years ago in 1985, thanks to Melina Mercouri.
The main idea is still to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share, as well as to promote greater mutual acquaintance between European citizens.
This is also a topic very close to the previous one.
However, our experience has shown that some aspects of the current programme of cooperation need improvement, mainly in four areas: competition between cities, the role of the selection panel, the European dimension of the action, and the monitoring process.
That is why last year the Commission adopted the proposal that is intended to replace the decision of 1999.
That was a parliamentary request voiced by MrsÂ Prets and I promised at that time personally to introduce a new proposal.
The new system should encourage Member States to organise competition at national level between interested cities.
A mixed selection panel should evaluate the applications as part of the national competition.
That mixed panel will be made up of seven experts appointed by the institutions, together with six experts to be nominated by the Member State concerned.
The Member State will then propose one city to the European institutions.
As in the past, the Council will make the final decision concerning the designation of the city.
In addition, the proposal lays down streamlined and clearer criteria compared to those in the current decision.
Following the designation of the European capitals, a monitoring process will be put in place to provide cities with support and advice in finalising the preparation of the programme and in particular with a view to ensuring that European added value is effectively reflected.
A prize will be awarded to the European Capitals of Culture that meet the criteria and objectives of that initiative.
At the same time, I will propose a substantial increase in the Community contribution to such cities participating in the programme via the Culture 2007 programme.
I am very pleased that Parliament, the Council and Commission have worked in close cooperation in order to find compromise amendments suitable for all.
This report is in line with the Commissionâs approach and clearly improves our proposal, so I think that this new scheme creates a good balance between local and national interests and enhances the European dimension.
I am sure that this will increase the transparency of the selection process and the visibility of the action.
I would like to confirm that the Commission welcomes this report and accepts all the compromise amendments.
Consequently, I expect adoption of our amended proposal at first reading.
I should really like to thank the Committee on Culture and Education and in particular the rapporteur Mrs Prets for her efficiency and effort.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, as the Commissioner has already mentioned, some aspects of this 20-year-old agreement were in need of reform.
Although a new decision had been presented in 1999, this had overlooked the fact that we were to be joined a few years later by ten new Member States â perhaps even more â and so these new Member States needed to be taken into account.
Consequently, we now have a partnership system.
The proposal that was presented to us at that time was unsatisfactory.
In 2004, we drew up another new proposal, but an abridged one, as we were in a hurry so as not to obstruct the process for the 2009 and 2010 cities, and thus accepted its shortcomings.
The Commission kept its promise, however, and, six months later, did indeed present us with a new draft.
Our priority is to redefine the role of the panel.
We have had problems with it in the past, and so we need to ensure that we have a better one in future.
This new draft makes the panel more democratic. This means that the Member States and the candidate countries are represented on the selection panel, at the pre-selection stage, and are able to make their contribution this way: it is not only those in Brussels who have a say, which is very important.
In the second phase, there is a monitoring and advisory panel, which follows this process critically, but plays a supporting role too instead of just identifying shortcomings.
That is very important, as the cities very often feel left alone with their preparations and do not know exactly how to deal with all the rules.
Competition was another crucial issue; we wanted to strengthen the competitive element.
The Member States should bear in mind during the preparatory period that what is important is new cultural activity, and that the public and the individual regions are also involved.
Although I am stressing the competition issue, I should also like to point out that there are no doubt some smaller countries who are unable to hold major competitions.
In such cases, a single candidate city would be permissible, but it would have to meet all the challenges and requirements for becoming a European Capital of Culture.
One essential criterion, and a discussion point, is the European dimension.
The cities are required to create European added value, and the question is: what is the European added value?
How do the cities reflect it?
How can we explain to the cities precisely what task they have to perform?
The Commission has not managed to define this with absolute precision, which I can understand, as it is very difficult.
The Commission has promised to present the best practice model on a website.
This website is a very important means of giving guidance and of sharing enquiries and experiences, which is very important to the candidate cities.
I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that the guidance and website are indeed present when this project enters into force.
One satisfactory aspect is the funding â not as regards the amount, as there will be another problem in that regard.
The new Financial Perspective is likely to reduce the amount envisaged for the European Capitals of Culture, too, which we greatly regret.
If I take as an example the city of Linz, which now has an investment volume of EURÂ 60Â million, but only 0.86% of this comes from the EU, I do wonder why the burdens are so great.
Of course, one could say it is a matter of image: it helps the region, it helps the city, we are investing in the future, we are investing in sustainability â this is another important aspect.
Whilst we are on the subject of finances: it is gratifying that this prize is now to be awarded three months in advance.
That will undoubtedly help the cities, as up to now the main problem has been that cities are always left worrying about their money after the event, after everything has been concluded.
I hope and wish that this is really the case in practice and that, therefore, the European Capitals of Culture do indeed face a very democratic future.
I hope that sustainability, good reputation and the impetus given to art and European culture in general find expression in this report, and also in the activities and implementation that follow.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, even though everything has really been said already, I should like to add something, as it is a matter of great concern to me that the European Capital of Culture really become what we have believed it should be all along, namely an advertising medium for European culture.
This cooperation, which was previously intergovernmental â it was actually a government action â has now developed into an interinstitutional matter.
This means that we enjoy excellent cooperation, and also, as MrsÂ Prets has already said, our voice has been heard.
For years, we have been appealing for something substantial for the panel to evaluate and select, for the cities to make an effort to reveal European added value and not just what they already have.
This action, in particular, makes us aware of the importance of European culture.
The cities are the culture bearers and cultural mediators of the EU.
This competition gives them the opportunity to bring a very great deal of elements together; there can be cross-border cooperation between regional cultures.
I could not agree more about the importance of also holding a competition to this end.
Taking Germany as an example, I can say that the competition to find the 2010Â European Capital of Culture was a wonderful event, with 10Â cities aspiring to be the best.
The initiatives they took did not peter out, but are being passed on.
They set up a network with the Hungarian cities, and I believe that the Commission should set great store by that.
The website is a potential tool for passing on such things, too.
I am pleased that the Commission has now overcome its administrative hurdles and a prize has been established â which is not really a prize, of course, but rather the money owing to a city, and means that the city finally has this money at its disposal as it begins its work.
All in all, this action is a very good thing, which, in both this context and that of our previous debate on citizenship, helps the public to see Europeâs great cultural diversity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I want to give my honourable friend Mrs Pack an explanation as regards the letter.
All members of parliament â I say this for your benefit Mrs Pack â receive letters urging us to support amendments tabled by our honourable friends.
This is for the simple reason that we cannot all know the content of the hundreds of amendments tabled.
I receive such letters, just like everyone else.
Now, as regards a comment made by another honourable friend, the committee chairmen exercise their right, like all members of parliament, to table amendments and, even when they believe that they may not be approved in committee, they also have the right â which is not contrary to the Rules of Procedure â to table them in plenary.
I think this is something we all do.
To come back to the point, the cultural capitals are today still the biggest and best organised political institution in Europe.
No other cultural action in the European Union has the same range today or, most importantly, the same projection and mass participation on the part of citizens.
In addition, it is hard to think of many other modern European initiatives in the field of culture which have constituted a standard.
However, experience has shown, as other honourable Members mentioned, that certain specific aspects of this institution could go no further.
The main need is to improve the selection method of cultural capitals.
This is something that has been done and the honourable Members who participated in the previous committee chaired by Michel Rocard worked a great deal on this.
The current framework really does not safeguard competition, as we have heard.
Another important issue is that the European dimension is often missing from the programme; I have found this to be true of cultural events which I have attended within the framework of three or four cultural capitals.
The new proposal, on which our rapporteur, Mrs Prets, has done a very good job, tries to reconcile the various viewpoints both within Parliament and within the Council.
Finally, I want to say a couple of words about the prize.
It is important, as the Commission proposed, that there should be this prize in honour of Melina Mercouri.
The proposal that the prize should carry her name was no coincidence on the part of the Commission or, of course, on the part of the 25 Council representatives who accepted it, because Melina Mercouri was the inspiration, the artist who worked the whole time she was Minister of Culture for this prize to be established.
It was therefore her idea and I think that it is important for it to bear her name in future.
Of course, there has been a compromise in relation to the initial proposal.
To finish, I should like to add that the cultural capitals are embraced by the European Union.
At the same time, however, apart from independence of choice, what the Member States need as a guideline is to determine better the methods of intervention mainly in infrastructures if not in programmes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much like the Commissionâs proposal, which is designed to strengthen the European dimension and to improve the transparency of the selection procedure for the European Capital of Culture.
The Prets report is excellently structured and I congratulate the rapporteur on that.
Two proposals that I find highly convincing and interesting are the idea of naming the prize that the Commission proposes to award to the chosen city after Melina Mercouri, for the reasons just mentioned by MrÂ Sifunakis, and the proposal to set up a website creating links between nominated cities, encouraging the exchange of know-how and best practices, and providing information on the candidate cities.
I personally believe it is essential to strengthen the association between the European Capital of Culture programme and tourism, a major industry, so as to take full advantage of the enormous economic and social potential that an event of this scale can produce, and also to ensure that it acts as a lasting incentive for the development of the city and the surrounding area.
In this respect, I should like to resubmit the proposal that I put forward in this House during the debate on the QueirÃ³ report: to create a European capital of tourism.
Further support for this proposal is provided by the enhancement of the urban dimension.
The new agenda for 2007-2013 will in fact focus decisively on the role of cities.
As you can see, Italians are operative.
If MrÂ Stubb, who jokingly described my fellow-countrymen as being incapable of drawing operative conclusions, were still here, I would tell him, equally tongue-in-cheek, that perhaps he has been influenced by some bad examples and by his political friendships.
To conclude, MrÂ President, I hope that tomorrow Parliament will adopt the Prets report, since it is a thorough, rich text that highlights an important Community scheme designed to bring Europe closer to the people through culture, as well as to encourage the development and revitalisation of cities.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by thanking MrsÂ Prets for her committed and competent work on this report.
Even though some of the previous speakers have already mentioned the problems that occurred in specific cases, I should like to emphasise that, so far, the history of the European capitals of culture has by and large been a successful one.
The individual cities named as capitals of culture have benefited, but so has Europe as a whole, because, time and again, these European capitals of culture have made it clear how diverse, rich and varied European culture is.
Nevertheless, I should like to focus on two aspects of this redrafted report that are particularly important to me.
Firstly, the idea of sustainability requires the capital of culture action not to be purely event-based, but to make a real contribution to encouraging greater social interaction, more promotion of art and culture, and new architectural designs.
This also includes the issue of structural change, and the value of cultural activities for Europe as a whole.
Secondly, the objective of establishing a truly European outlook and exchange and of emphasising European added value is a really decisive point in the redrafting of this programme, and there is still more to be done in this regard.
The best way we can win people over and generate enthusiasm is to make it clear what European interaction really is, and not to refer just to what was already available without it, but to get together with many European players and develop new facilities.
That will make the idea of European capitals of culture even more attractive in the years to come.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, much experience has been gained from European Capital of Culture events. The celebrations have had both positive and negative consequences.
On the positive side, we have noted a flourishing of creative activity, cultural exchanges abroad and patronage for cultural events.
The cities have been promoted and their citizensâ cultural ambitions awakened.
On the negative side, I could mention the concentration of effort and resources on specific cultural events at the expense of social and cultural movements in the city and region concerned.
I could also refer to the lack of a detailed impact assessment of the programme undertaken, and the imposition on Member States and city authorities of criteria that are often inappropriate to the needs and traditions of the cities and regions.
I should comment too on the lack of clarity and transparency regarding the financing of activities from European funds.
Latterly, a tendency to restrict the role of Member States and selection in identifying European Capitals of Culture has become evident.
This is a worrying development and we would do well to consider what is most desirable, effective cooperation or imposing oneâs will on others.
Personally, I am in favour of dialogue and the creation of conditions for active participation in culture, so as to promote its beauty and diversity.
Thanks are due to MrsÂ Prets for her report and all the efforts involved.
I trust that in the course of future work we shall endeavour to draw on positive experiences.
I hope too that we will eliminate aspects that are not conducive to further development and which, on the contrary, limit the cultural diversity that is vital to bringing about integration and national dialogue.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I have placed on record a minority opinion in accordance with Rule 48 of our Rules of Procedure and I shall not vote in favour of this draft.
Nonetheless, I thank Mrs Prets for her work.
I shall give you the reasons for my position.
The project that aims to designate each year a European Capital of Culture gave rise, at the time of its inception, to enthusiasm and to a desire to stand out from the crowd, as well as to the awareness that culture is a valuable asset.
For a decade now, the Commission and Parliament have been trying to inject a new dynamic into the project, but they have gone about it using the same resources that are crippling the European project in general.
Instead of rebuilding the initial enthusiasm, with citizens who were supposed to identify with the project, the Commission and Parliament are setting themselves up as judges.
With my amendments, my proposal was to give the Member States the task of designating the European Capital of Culture according to their own criteria.
That would have encouraged them to shoulder their responsibilities.
Instead of strengthening subsidiarity in order to construct the European identity, an identity that is founded on our diversity, the institutions are now acting as project managers: they dictate, make selections and judge, without, for all that, bearing the cost of their decisions, since the European Unionâs financial contribution remains small.
Bureaucracy rises like a rampart between local initiatives and, Commissioner, I can only hope that future panels will be more conscientious than those who judged the Luxembourg 2007 project without even all being present and without being informed about the plan to extend to the Great Region and without realising that Luxembourgâs proposal to choose Sibiu in Romania as a partner town was to become so innovative.
Culture amounts to more than just publicity events.
The Capital of Culture project should be more than a long firework display of events and, in order to ensure continuity, I proposed to link with the consultations a network of Capitals of Culture to be organised with the support of the Commission.
Instead of that we are now witnessing the parody of a network that jumbles together some of those that have been legitimately appointed with those who have assumed this title for themselves.
It is time we finally protected the title of the European Capital of Culture.
Â Â  Mr President, needless to say I totally disagree with the previous speaker, with all respect.
I wish to congratulate Mrs Prets on a thorough and carefully set out report.
It is universally recognised that the programme of the European City of Culture, or European Capital of Culture as it was later renamed, is a well-tried and very useful concept and much credit must be given to those who set it up back in the mid-1980s, especially to the then Greek Culture Minister, Melina Mercouri.
She was indeed an inspirational and talented woman who, in her stormy life, fought courageously for democracy and for the promotion of European unity through culture.
Programmes such as the one we are discussing tonight indisputably help bring European citizens closer together and strengthen the bonds between them.
They help promote understanding amongst our people and increase the appreciation of and respect for each othersâ diverse but unifying cultural history.
Over the years some problematic areas have been identified and this Commission proposal, which will eventually be amended by Parliament, will no doubt improve and enhance the programme further.
Hopefully, in speaking in what is for me a foreign language â English â I am assisting in unifying our European aspiration to have a common language of communication some time in the future.
On the basis of the experience gained in the 20 years that the programme has been in operation, and due to changes necessitated by the recent enlargement, a review is now urgently needed.
Two of the main alterations necessary are improvements in the selection procedure to be followed and putting a system in place that will ensure that once a city is chosen, a well-planned programme will be carried out successfully.
I would like to highlight the wisdom of two innovations of the proposal: the pairing-up system and the prize.
I do not have time to go into detail.
I once again congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report.
Â Â  In a culturally and ethnically diverse Europe, it is very important that we build bridges between nations.
Our guiding principle must be, and must continue to be, to preserve our own culture and to become acquainted with the cultural riches of other nations.
Culture is the most unobtrusive and effective link that binds nations who want to live in peace and mutual cooperation.
The European Capital of Culture makes such a link possible. At the same time, it also offers an opportunity to many host cities for greater investment in cultural facilities and projects, with longâterm positive effects on the economy.
This project also encourages citizens to become culturally involved and to familiarise themselves with culture in all its dimensions.
I also welcome the proposal for a prize to be awarded if a city meets the criteria for the European Capital of Culture, as previous organisers have, in many cases, complained about a lack of resources, as the European Union allocated these only after the report had been submitted.
Our total commitment represents only a fraction of the contribution compared to the amounts invested in European Capitals of Culture by local communities, the Member States concerned or the private sector.
For this reason, we must not complicate the process of raising funds with demanding administrative procedures.
Instead, we must make the job easier for the organisers, as that alone will contribute to a better relationship between citizens and European institutions.
The proposal for a joint selection panel to nominate the capital city is also a good idea, because it takes more account of the international dimension, and there will be more opportunity for a fairer selection, because on a national level there is a greater chance of bias towards a particular city.
Â Â  MrÂ President, along with eight other European cities, my home city of Krakow, in Poland, was the European Capital of Culture for 2000.
It was my pleasant duty to serve as Director of the European Capital of Culture programme at the time.
I should like to state that the European Capitals of Culture programme is the most notable of the programmes emphasising the cultural unity of our continent.
Furthermore, it is a programme that arose from the citizensâ initiative.
It did not come about on the initiative of any institution such as the Commission or Parliament.
Greece and MrsÂ Mercouri in particular deserve to be congratulated on the idea of finding a way to show what Europe is all about, and what the cultural unity of our continent actually means.
In fact, it would be right and proper for this award to be named after MrsÂ Mercouri, who was then the Greek Minister for Culture, since this is what Greece and MrsÂ Mercouri deserve.
How should the role of the European Commission be defined?
I am now addressing CommissionerÂ FigeÄŸ in particular.
The Commissionâs role should be to offer support and advice, to point out errors and counsel on appropriate measures to be taken.
It ought not to get involved in administrative issues, as it is so prone to do.
In particular, it should guard against such an approach in this instance, as the EURÂ 500Â 000 award is just 2% to 5% of the entire fund allocated for implementation of the European Capitals of Culture programme.
Commissioner, a way must therefore be found to disseminate relevant information and support Internet sites and other publications.
We need to learn the lessons of the successes and failures of former European Capitals of Culture.
They are all part of the Association of European Capitals of Culture.
Mr FigeÄŸ, you are responsible for financing 25Â networks, and the Association of European Capitals of Culture should be one of them, so as to ensure that services are available to the cities that are to play this important role in the near future.
Â Â  . I think that the Capital of Culture programme is as popular in the field of culture as Erasmus is in the area of education.
Both programmes are approximately 20 years old, and should we so wish, we could say much about the past and future of these programmes.
I am convinced that not only the Committee but also Parliament is keen to make sure that the Capital of Culture programme becomes even better and more popular, and I believe that we are heading in that direction.
I would only like to add that the fact that ten cities in Germany and eleven cities in Hungary are competing for the 2010 title reflects an interest, competitiveness and movement or dynamism in the field of culture and cultural heritage, which is good for the whole of Europe.
I would like to thank you all and to say that we are actually doing many of the things that MrÂ Sonik has mentioned in the field of information, consultancy and assistance.
We would also like to increase the value of the prize or financial aid to EUR 1.5Â million.
All this, however, depends on the outcome of tomorrowâs voting and on the discussions about the Financial Perspective.
Having said that, I am convinced that this activity, this component of cultural cooperation, deserves significant support.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday.
Â Â  I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report promoting the value of culture within the European Union.
As we work on new approaches it is important to bear in mind that the new Member States endured many kinds of pressure on their cultures during the Communist period.
In addition, the variety and identity of these cultures was negated.
Enabling such countries to become more involved in European Capital of Culture events is a unique opportunity to harness the unprecedented energy generated by societies in the so-called young democracies.
I cannot fail to mention an outstanding candidate amongst the cities hoping to be named European Capital of Culture for 2010.
I refer to the city of Goerlitz-Zgorzelec, where I had the good fortune to be brought up and educated.
This is a most remarkable city, because despite its chequered history of cruel divisions, the people of Goerlitz-Zgorzelec have contrived to keep human, economic and especially cultural links alive.
This city was marked by history and divided by the post-World War II border, but thanks to European Union activities it now has an opportunity to be reborn on the map of Europe.
It stands to become a place where reconciliation, understanding and supranational and cultural cooperation operate at all levels.
It is an example of how common interests and the will for dialogue can overcome divisions and resentment, which might have been deemed impossible.
I commend this approach to all undertakings at European level, not just to cultural ones.
Â Â  The European City of Culture projectâs important role and its mission are undeniable; it contributes to preserving the diversity and richness of European cultural heritage.
It helps a great deal as regards learning about each otherâs cultural traditions and values.
Transparency, clarity, monitoring and best practices present the fundamental requirements of all types of selection procedures of the European Community and this should be carried out in the selection of European Capitals of Culture as well.
I can only strongly support the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the programme, giving way to the interest expressed by the two potential new Member States to take part in this action; given the symbolic importance of making them already feel a part of Europe and in order to further enrich our cultural values and diversity.
The inclusion of the Cultural Month initiative in the project has the capacity to help people learn about other nationsâ cultural heritage and to extend the project to a wider international level.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
â the report (A6-0087/2006) by MrsÂ Doyle, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (PE-CONSÂ 3604/2006 â C6-0065/2006 â 2003/0189A(COD)) and
â the report (A6-0090/2006) by MrsÂ Doyle, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending council Directive 70/156/EEC (PE-CONS 3605/2006 â C6-0066/2006 â 2003/0189B(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission to take the floor first.
I believe it has a statement that it wishes to put on the record, to which I would like to be in a position to reply.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to pass on greetings from my colleague, MrÂ Dimas.
Please allow me to introduce the position of the European Commission on this matter.
First of all, I would like to express my appreciation to the delegation of Parliament that took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 31Â January.
In particular I would like to express my thanks to Vice-President Trakatellis and to the rapporteur, Mrs Doyle, and to congratulate them on the outcome.
The discussions in the Conciliation Committee were constructive and the final outcome on key issues â such as standards for containment, labelling, placing on the market, promotion of alternatives, as well as on a number of other important topics â is satisfactory.
The Commission can therefore support the conciliation text and I would encourage Parliament to endorse the very good result obtained by its negotiating team.
I believe that the regulation on F-gases, as well as the directive on mobile air conditioners in cars, will make a significant contribution to the EUâs fight against climate change and to our efforts to achieve our Kyoto emission reduction target.
The Commission estimates that the legislation that we are discussing today will, by 2012, cut emissions of fluorinated gases by some 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually.
That implies a reduction of 20% compared to 1995.
In the absence of measures, emissions of fluorinated gases would have risen by 50% in the same period.
From 2020, when all measures will be fully implemented, the effect will be a reduction of 40-50 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
EU climate policy builds on close cooperation between the Commission and Member States.
Only through common and combined action, at European and at national level, will the European Union be effective in reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases.
The Commission therefore welcomes measures taken by Member States to reduce national emissions in order to meet their burden-sharing target.
In that context, however, the Commissionâs responsibility is to preserve any right it might have to ensure that all actions carried out to reduce emissions of F-gases are compatible with the Treaty.
That is why the Commission should like issue the following declaration on the question of stricter national measures:
âThe Commission notes the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the insertion in the regulation of a provision allowing Member States to maintain, until 2012, more stringent national measures compared to those laid down in the regulation, should these measures be adopted before 31Â December 2005.
It results from the Treaty that if, after the adoption of a harmonised measure, a Member State considers it necessary to maintain national measures that are justified by important requirements specified in Article 30 of the EC Treaty, or relating to the protection of the environment or of the working environment, this Member State notifies them to the Commission, indicating the reasons for their maintenance.
Additionally, the Treaty specifies the rules for the acceptance or rejection of these measures by the Commission.
The Commission is therefore obliged to reserve its position on this issue, including any right it may have under the Treaty.â
Once again, I thank Parliament for its open and constructive approach on the F-gases package.
The outcome is strong and effective legislation, which, once again, demonstrates the European Unionâs capacity to match its words with concrete deeds in its climate policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for accepting my invitation for him to lead off in the debate tonight, because I have concerns about the declaration he has just put on the record and I will be reverting to it during the debate, as, I suspect, will other colleagues too.
This legislation is a fascinating case study for anyone interested in the institutional decision-making processes of the European Parliament.
Firstly, I wish to thank all my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times.
Fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs.
They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, in aerosols, in refrigeration and air conditioning systems; in fire protection equipment and switchgear and even in the soles of âair-techâ jogging shoes, as well as, of course, in double-glazed windows.
The list is very long.
As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential â GWP â came to be recognised as a major contributor â up to 5% and rising â to the greenhouse effect.
Not only do these gases have high GWPs, the most potent â sulphur hexafluoride or SF6 â has a GWP of almost 24Â 000 times that of CO2, the most common greenhouse gas. They also have very long half-lives.
If no measures are taken, the Commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50% above the 1995 levels by 2010.
Others would cite a much higher figure.
With the measures agreed in this package of legislation, they will be reduced by more than 20% from the 1995 levels by 2012.
Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three of them are fluorinated gases.
In all, the current legislation encourages a reduction in emissions of 25 fluorinated gases â hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride â through containment, responsible use, recovery, destruction and disposal.
The aim of the legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases.
Whereas the original Commission draft proposal was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base, namely ArticleÂ 95, the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on ArticleÂ 95 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of ArticlesÂ 175 and 95.
The rationale for the split of the Commissionâs original proposal into two different texts, suggested by the European Parliament at its first reading, was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to Framework Directive 70/156/EEC on the type-approval of motor vehicles.
The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining statutory applications.
So, having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases â the main thrust being environment, with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base â the Council handed the baton back to Parliament.
In the second reading in Parliament, there was no definitive resolution on the crucial vexed issue of the dual legal base of the regulation, which was retained.
My proposal, as rapporteur, to adopt a single environment-linked legal base as the only means of achieving legal certainty, did not obtain the required qualified majority.
Amendments were adopted, however, which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures, provided they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and not purely economic in nature.
Article 176 of the Treaty explains this mechanism relating to the environment or the ArticleÂ 175 laws.
This outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons.
Firstly, there was the matter of general principle that, in the interests of promoting better, simpler and clearer legislation, the introduction of an unevenly weighted, dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in European policy-making.
Secondly, there is the ECJâs consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation.
The centre of gravity of this regulation is indisputably environmental protection, which would warrant an environment base â an approach of minimum harmonisation.
Finally, there was the unresolved question as to whether the Member States that already have more ambitious legislation in force â notably Austria and Denmark â would be allowed to keep those measures, or whether the EU would force them to lower their environmental standards in an area of combating climate change at a time when there are already difficulties in meeting Kyoto targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
Given the implacable divisions within the Council on this final issue of stricter national measures for certain Member States, a third reading in conciliation was inevitable.
After many exhaustive weeks of informatory preparatory work and meetings, the Conciliation Committee reached agreement on a joint text for the regulation concerning certain fluorinated greenhouse gases â f-gases â on 31Â January 2006, which addressed the main points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council, which are namely: the possibility for the Member States to keep or introduce national measures stricter than those foreseen by the regulation; technical provisions regarding f-gas containment; reporting and review of the regulation; definition of placing on the market; cross-border transport or shipment of f-gases for recovery; labelling; notification of measures introducing further bans on f-gases; and the area of training and certification.
However, the key point that I want to refer to again is the issue of stricter national measures.
Important for encouraging an environmental race to the top was the agreement on the general principle that Member States can maintain or introduce stricter national measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty.
In the specific case of the existing national measures in Denmark and Austria, against which the Commission has been considering legal action, a safeguard clause was introduced which would allow the two Member States to keep their legislation until 31Â December 2012.
Both countries already have strict legislation on f-gases in place â since the 1970s in the case of Denmark â and they view it as a key measure in their policy mix to achieve their Kyoto climate change targets.
I believe the legislation now agreed and awaiting final sanction by our colleagues in this Parliament tomorrow strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns.
It reaffirms the European Communityâs commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies, thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda knowledge economy goals.
It will do so in a measured, sensible and proportionate way that recognises certain critical uses for these gases, which, we must not forget, can be useful in certain circumstances for the very reason that they are excellent insulators.
Electrical or electronic switch gear, amongst other vital uses, will continue to use f-gases in a contained environment.
There is no better or more suitable substitute in that case, and that must be the test.
The conciliation compromise was welcomed by the three institutions, by myself, by my European Parliament colleagues, by Minister PrÃ¶ll, on behalf of the European Council, and by the Environment Commissioner, Mr Dimas.
It was the only equitable and honourable outcome.
To quote directly, Commissioner Dimas welcomed the agreement as âa clear and positive political signalâ but alluded to the fact that the Commission would later decide whether to issue a declaration on the record when the legislation was finally adopted, as it is scheduled to be tomorrow.
I should like to lay down a marker in relation to the declaration we have just heard from Commissioner FigeÄŸ, speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dimas.
In the laborious process of negotiating this legislation, it was the clear intention of the legislators â Parliament and the Council â to provide for the widest possible interpretation of the powers for environmental measures to be taken on the basis of a single market legal base.
I strenuously reject any attempt by the Commission to construe the terms of that legal base so as to narrowly confine it to ArticleÂ 95(4), which outlines a prior notification procedure.
Such a declaration represents a misinterpretation of the outcome of conciliation, where there was a clear if implicit intention to allow stricter national measures on the basis of Article 95(10).
While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non-binding, it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject, if perchance this legislation, which has already spanned two legislatures, gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg, as was my concern from the start.
Tonight I want to make it clear that the principal aims of this regulation â to cut our emissions of fluorinated gases â should be respected and adhered to in the fullest sense.
I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government.
I would urge Commissioner FigeÄŸ to put on the record tonight the Commissionâs intention of doing so as soon as possible.
The directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles was the second arm of the package of the two proposals to emerge from the Councilâs first reading on the recommendation of my predecessor as rapporteur, Mr Goodwill.
I welcome the pioneering decision to introduce a phased ban on fluorinated gases with a global warming potential of more than 150 times the potency of carbon dioxide in motor vehicles.
This ban will apply to new vehicle types in 2011 and to all new vehicles in 2017.
Bringing the measure into line with the long-established vehicle type approval system will also maintain the competitiveness and ensure the compliance of European car manufacturers.
The risk threshold will eliminate the main air conditioning gas currently in use and it will allow less harmful gases to be used instead.
In practice, most vehicle producers are likely to introduce carbon-dioxide-based systems. But the important point is that we are allowing the development of these new systems without being technology prescriptive and without infringing our obligations under the WTO.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, MrsÂ Doyle.
Her statement showed how vigorously she has fought, both in committee and in plenary, for this issue, which is of particular importance for Austria and Denmark, because we are the two Member States with stricter regulations in this area.
Above all, we have shown that it is possible to have stricter regulations without causing economic damage.
I therefore have to ask the Commission why it has once again tried, in its declaration, to pull the plug on European unity.
Environmental policy and popular satisfaction are united, and we in Europe are united.
The Commission's attitude therefore greatly surprises me, because we successfully concluded a conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament.
The joint draft of the European Parliament and of the Council, which was approved by the Conciliation Committee on 31Â JanuaryÂ 2006, provides that Member States may retain national requirements stricter than those foreseen by the Regulation until the end of 2012.
The additional paragraph 3 in Article 9 gives the Member States, and in particular Austria and Denmark, the option of retaining their existing further-reaching bans on the placing on the market of fluorinated gases.
If such a safeguard clause was not introduced, the Member States would have to revoke the existing bans that go beyond those in Annex II to the regulation, or have them approved by the Commission.
Under Article 95(10) of the EC Treaty, harmonisation measures such as the regulation on these fluorinated greenhouse gases may include a safeguard clause temporarily authorising the Member States to take different measures.
This authorisation has to be granted pursuant to the process laid down in the regulation and in the form prescribed there.
Despite this, however, the Commission does not refer, in its declaration regarding Article 9(3), to the process laid down in the regulation, but repeats the wording of Article 95(4), according to which the stricter national provisions â which, moreover, are justified by recent scientific findings â must be notified to the Commission for approval.
I think that this clearly goes too far and does not correspond to what the Council and Parliament agreed.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Doyle, who has given the initial impetus in several important areas in order to keep the environmental quality of these proposals intact.
I look back with pleasure on her tenacity during the trialogues.
We have a result we can be proud of.
Tomorrow, we will have achieved two milestones permanently, or at least, that is what I thought before we heard the statement.
A first milestone has been achieved in the area of climate policy.
There is broad consensus here in this House that we must take climate change seriously.
Measures are needed urgently in order to reduce the level of greenhouse gases.
The curtailment of f-gases constitutes a major step.
F-gases are potent greenhouse gases that are used in all kinds of products, including air-conditioning and cooling systems, fire extinguishers, foam used in the construction industry and even in the soles of shoes.
It is good that Parliament and the Council have drawn a clear line.
Greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible.
Innovation is important, and that is how global warming is decelerated.
The second milestone is of major importance politically, namely the internal market.
We made our views clear at first reading.
Instead of the internal market legal base, we opted for the environment-linked legal base.
This was warmly supported by a majority in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
The reason is that a number of countries had taken further measures off their own bats.
With regard to the internal market legal base, Austria and Denmark were at risk of having to withdraw their more extensive measures, which is really unacceptable.
The internal market should maintain a high level of environmental protection.
If that is not the case, it should be possible for the Member States to take more extensive measures.
Europe is not there to impose changes for the worse on the Member States, or to deny the Member States the scope to adopt decent environmental policy.
We have managed to drive this message home at least.
It is Parliamentâs and the Councilâs wish for Member States to be able to take more extensive measures.
The Commission must, of course, closely monitor the situation and ensure that the restrictions of market access are proportionate.
Commissioner, in all honesty, I find your statement lamentably insubstantial.
I had at least expected you to have shown the political will to give Member States wishing to take those more extensive measures all the leg-room they need.
It was really unnecessary to read out Article 95, with which we are all familiar, and we actually expect the political will from you to grant Member States this leg-room.
This is what is desperately needed, because innovation is important for climate policy, but ultimately also for our economy and for the Lisbon agenda.
So in that respect, I would like to see you withdraw the statement you made a moment ago.
I think that we have not heard the last of this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I shall begin by thanking Parliamentâs rapporteur, MrsÂ Doyle, who has done a sterling piece of work on this matter.
It has been a genuine pleasure to be a member of the conciliation delegation.
On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I should like to offer my sincere thanks for the constructive cooperation.
The outcome achieved by the conciliation committee is a victory for the European environment and for the people of Europe.
Consideration has been given to countries such as Denmark and Austria, which have taken the ban on fluorinated gases further, and other countries can follow their lead.
This proves that the EU puts the environment before everything else.
When, tomorrow, the European Parliament adopts the conciliation committeeâs document by what I hope will be a very large majority, I assume that Environment Commissioner MrÂ Dimas will take the opportunity to withdraw the Commissionâs letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark.
That should be a natural consequence of this new statutory text.
Now that the Community legislation has been changed, there will be no basis for taking legal proceedings against Denmark at the European Court of Justice.
It was depressing to hear in the corridors that the Commissionâs legal service has refused to accept the outcome of the conciliation or has tried to misinterpret it.
Allow me to remind the Commission that it would be quite unprecedented and completely unacceptable if the new Community legislation were not administered by the Commission.
It would also be detrimental to cooperation with, and confidence in, the Commission.
The Council and the European Parliament have approved the agreement and the content of the conciliation document.
The Commission was a party to the agreement of 31Â January 2006 and is therefore partly responsible for it.
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to withdraw the letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark following tomorrowâs vote when a large majority of Parliament has voted in favour of the document.
Anything else would be unacceptable in terms of future cooperation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent collaboration and for being so willing to try to find compromises on which we could all agree.
But having said that, while my Group can live with the directive on mobile air-conditioning â although in our view it is still too weak â we cannot accept the results of the conciliation on the regulation on F-gases, in spite of Mrs Doyle's good offices to try to get a better deal, but which ultimately failed.
The European institutions like to pride themselves on their international leadership in terms of policy on climate change, the greatest threat we face, and yet this regulation is a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades.
We are talking about gases that have enormous global warming potential.
They include sulphur hexafluoride, which is over 23Â 000 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and yet will still be permitted in some applications.
Yet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them.
We have a regulation that fails to recognise the fact that alternatives already exist for most F-gas applications, that fails to promote substitution and that will set back the introduction of safe and innovative alternatives for years, not just in the European Union but in the developing world as well, where F-gas emissions are predicted to grow enormously over the next few decades.
We have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the F-gas industry.
So I repeat again the question that others have raised: Would the Commission clarify once and for all whether it will drop the proceedings against Austria and Denmark?
At the very beginning of February my colleagues and I wrote to CommissionerÂ Dimas to ask this question.
We have still not received a response.
This is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our group did not vote in favour of this compromise in the conciliation committee, and we shall not vote in favour of it in plenary tomorrow.
We are not satisfied with the content, and we are definitely not satisfied with the legal basis.
That is not a criticism of the rapporteur.
We believe that MrsÂ Doyle has done the best she possibly could in a difficult situation and has tried to go as far as humanly possible in claiming the right to retain and to introduce better environmental requirements.
Given, however, the very weak position in which she found herself following Parliamentâs second reading, she was unable to achieve the only reasonable objective, namely that of having environmental Article 175 adopted as the only legal basis.
For us, the only acceptable outcome is for environmental legislation to be allowed to be precisely that.
We see two problems with this compromise.
The first problem is that, in our view, larger steps could have been taken where various parts of it were concerned.
More rapid progress can be made in abolishing these very dangerous greenhouse gases.
The most serious consideration of all, however, is that there is now an active risk of putting obstacles in the way of countries that want to tighten up their national legislation in this area.
This situation violates the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol and could be an obstacle to countries that wish to combat climate change which, as we all know, is the most serious environmental threat we face.
Where Denmark and Austria are concerned, they are to be given a guarantee up until the year 2012, whereupon the guarantee will come to an end.
We shall then not know what is to happen, and there will again be a danger of these countries actively being forced to curb the legislation they already have.
Where other countries are concerned, there would in actual fact be an end to reform if the Commission does not take a different decision.
This situation is completely unacceptable.
It also means that countries within the EU will have difficulty producing new technology â which is precisely what this document says they should be doing â with a view to taking the lead by banning dangerous gases and forcing alternatives to be produced using just such new technology.
By their action, the Council and the Commission are preventing new technology from being produced.
In our debates, we usually agree on the seriousness of climate issues, and we usually agree with the researchersâ reports we see, saying that the situation is more serious than we believed a few years ago.
Then comes this statement from the Commission, showing that it has learned nothing about climate issues.
What you are saying is that the market remains more important than the environment.
Companiesâ right to sell dangerous gases is more important than political opportunities to combat the greenhouse effect and climate change.
It is remarkable that such a thing can be said in 2006.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have some really good news: the President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso, and the Vice-President, MrÂ Verheugen, have today promised to withdraw the three extant letters of formal notice concerning fluorinated gases.
The Commission will thus be a party to the compromise reached between the Council and Parliament in the conciliation procedure.
The undertaking is particularly gratifying because the Commission had adopted a declaration, reserving to itself the right to declare the Austrian and Danish bans on fluorinated gases unlawful.
The declaration was a provocation, which we can now put to one side.
I should like to thank MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Verheugen for their personal support in this matter, and I should also like to thank the President of the European Council, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, who has offered his personal support in relation to a matter that was initially dropped by the Council of Ministers when Austria took over the Presidency.
There are also, in fact, reasons for thanking ourselves here in this Chamber, because we voted in favour of the much discussed AmendmentÂ 45, which made the victory possible.
By means of amendments we shall turn the decision concerning fluorinated gases into a minimal rule in which countries are given permission to go further in protecting our common climate.
Three hundred and sixty-seven votes are needed if we elected representatives are to have real influence, and we obtained 370.
We therefore owe the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, MrÂ Florenz, and the rapporteur, MrsÂ Doyle a considerable debt of gratitude because they stood firm in their support for minimal rules, even though they were exposed to heavy pressure, including from their own group.
I also wish especially to congratulate those responsible for now creating a clear precedent for our being able to introduce minimal rules, even when the legal base is the internal marketâs provisions.
We are obtaining a greater number of possible ways of taking account of security, health, the environment, the working environment, consumer protection and animal welfare, and we are moving a step away from regimentation and from what is referred to as total harmonisation.
I hope that this will not be an isolated development but, on the contrary, will herald a new direction for European cooperation.
People will thank us if, by means of majority decisions, we secure a common level of protection and, at the same time, give countries permission to be pioneers.
In this way, everyone will sense that progress has been made.
Danes and Austrians will be quite uncomprehending if the Commission makes its efforts to combat climate change a political priority and, at the same time, punishes Denmark and Austria for making a special effort.
MrÂ Verheugen, MrÂ Dimas and MrÂ Barroso would be uncomprehending, too.
The Eurocrats in the departments of the Commission have now hopefully been put in their place.
We representatives of the people have made a difference, and we can be proud of our joint efforts.
The next task must, of course, be that of convincing all the countries that there are technical alternatives, so that we might obtain a common EU ban on fluorinated gases, preferably before 2012 when the Kyoto Agreement is to be renewed in a spirit of consideration for future generations.
I hope that MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Verheugen will firmly resist those who are trying to drag them down into the mud.
Â Â  Mr President, I must thank my colleague, MrsÂ Doyle, for her role as Parliamentâs conciliator in this demanding regulation and directive package.
The regulation and directive before us are both important steps in our objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
From experience I know that heading the conciliation process is an exacting task that makes great demands on the rapporteur.
Fluorinated greenhouse gases are one example of how difficult it is to solve environmental problems.
You solve one and new ones can easily come along to take its place.
When at one time we switched to using fluorinated hydrocarbons in cooling systems, aerosols and other applications, we succeeded in dramatically reducing the use of chlorofluoride hydrocarbons, which make the ozone layer thinner.
The Montreal Protocol was an attempt to phase out CFCs, as these gases are harmful to stratospheric ozone.
That was a good thing, but agents that make the ozone layer thinner were replaced by powerful greenhouse gases.
Their potential for global warming is 100 or even 1Â 000 times greater than carbon dioxide, and the time the gases take to disperse into the atmosphere can be very long indeed.
Fluorinated gases account for at least 5% of the greenhouse phenomenon.
This is why the threat of climate change means we need to cut down on the use of fluorinated hydrocarbons.
The text for a regulation now adopted by the Conciliation Committee will encourage the continued development of alternative technologies and the adoption of existing technologies, nevertheless making possible sustainable operational models to achieve the objective.
Hopefully, we are now wiser than we used to be and will continue to be better able to predict the possible dangers of alternative solutions.
One of the biggest problems with the regulation under discussion was its legal basis.
I hope that the two legal bases now chosen will prove, despite everything, to be a workable compromise and will not cause problems of overlap.
At the time, I voted for one legal basis, ArticleÂ 95, but with the highest standards.
I have always wondered why environmental grounds are always automatically thought to be more environmentally friendly, while those for the internal market are branded as being in the interests of industry.
It would be in the environmentâs best interests to combine a harmonised market with ambitious targets.
Only then would there be a proper incentive for our industry to compete on a level playing field in an environmentally friendly way.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the discussions prior to Austria's accession to the European Union, one of the main arguments put forward by those opposed to accession was the danger that environmental standards would fall.
We are now faced with a tragic example of this.
Greenhouse gases are currently on the agenda, and the effects of climate change can be seen in the news, in the form of the floods in Germany and Austria.
Climate protection really must be our absolute top priority, particularly now.
What do you imagine interested citizens think of you when you give free rein to greenhouse gases in the name of the internal market?
Austria and Denmark have acted consistently.
The economies of those countries were flexible enough to adapt and to deliver the goods.
Do you now want to protect the dinosaurs of the market, who do not want to move, from those who were lively enough to change?
I call on you to rectify this error.
Given the dangers now facing the global climate, penalising the pioneers of environmental protection is completely absurd.
Â Â  â Mr President, at the end of the debate you are now getting a hefty dose of Austrian contributions.
Austria may well, unfortunately, not always be a model pupil when it comes to environmental policy, but on the issue of fluorinated greenhouse gases we have stricter measures than were proposed in the package of harmonised legislation.
In my view, the European Union has two choices: either we harmonise at a high, ambitious level, or we continue to allow the Member States to retain their stricter, more ambitious targets and measures.
Austria and Denmark â as has frequently been mentioned, including, commendably, by the rapporteur, who has continually defended this position â have laid down general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases.
Experience in those countries has shown that there are alternatives to these gases.
The draft approved by the Conciliation Committee at the end of January provides that Member States may retain stricter national requirements until 2012.
This step is possible under Article 95(10) of the Treaty â the 'safeguard clause', which allows stricter measures to be retained temporarily.
The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on such a safeguard clause.
This ensures â at least for the time being â that Austria and Denmark can continue to apply their stricter regulations.
It also means that the scientific evidence referred to in Article 95(4) need not be provided.
I am pleased that MrÂ Bonde obviously has access to more recent information according to which there is a better declaration from the Commission.
The statement we got from the Commissioner at the start of this debate was not satisfactory. That, too, has been stressed in a number of contributions.
I also call on the Commission to take note of the attitude of Parliament and the Council and to give the Member States the necessary room for manoeuvre.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I had actually intended to make a different speech but, having heard the debate in this House, I must thank MrsÂ Doyle for her splendid contribution.
I cannot, however, in any way see how her efforts might bear fruit, as the Commission is expressly saying that only those countries that have more stringent rules now may be given permission to stick to those rules.
There is nothing about countries being able to go further and no assurance of Denmark being able to go further.
When I think of the zeal with which MrsÂ Doyleâs proposal at second reading was fought against, I do not understand from where MrÂ Bonde, MrÂ Busk and the others derive their optimism.
There are no reassuring signals.
We are faced here with a proposal that is an affront to all constructive forces working in favour of the environment.
There is, in fact, such a thing as substitution. Alternatives do exist.
We have efficient refrigerators in Denmark and Austria, yet the choice has been made to defer to the fluorinated gases industry instead of to the environment.
I cannot see anything in the Commissionâs pronouncement that goes any way at all towards pledging anything more constructive.
It is therefore exclusively MrsÂ Doyle whom I shall thank for her splendid but, it has to be said, entirely fruitless efforts.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to thank MrsÂ Doyle for taking such a heroic stance in this Assembly.
The Council and the Commission have defended old, outmoded technology in the internal market instead of defending the climate.
History will not be kind in judging such action.
For example, why are we not banning fluorinated greenhouse gases in the refrigerators sold to consumers? Ninety per cent of the market is already free from fluorinated greenhouse gases.
It is an extremely straightforward matter simply to decide to ban them.
Why do we allow sulphur hexachloride, which does 23Â 000 times more damage to the climate than carbon dioxide?
The only way of obtaining an alternative is, of course, to set a time limit, whereupon research would come up with the right alternatives.
Moreover, there are now already a number of alternatives.
There must be a typing error in the Commissionâs speech, because I would have thought you would very happily have looked forward to countriesâ introducing more stringent legislation in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives.
I can only assume that there is a typing error in the speech, for the Commission surely cannot be responsible for such an outmoded and old-fashioned policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, would it be in order for the Commissioner to respond now to some of the points that were made?
I know it is very late and we are testing your patience.
If not, it will come up tomorrow before the vote.
I would also like to make a request on the record now, so the message gets through, that we will be calling on the Austrian Presidency to comment tomorrow on this specifically.
Would the powers that be send the message, so there is no misunderstanding: tomorrow we would like them present.
Apart from having the Presidency, it is a particularly important case for Austria.
There were many important points put directly to Commissioner Figel'; I should be delighted if he would respond to them.
There is a lot of unhappiness here about the Commission declaration.
Â Â  The Council will be here tomorrow.
The Commissioner may respond today.
As far as I am aware, CommissionerÂ Dimas will be here tomorrow.
CommissionerÂ FigeÄŸ, would you like to add anything?
Â Â  . Mr President, I can give the assurance that we believe that sustainability is not only a Treaty principle but also the most important principle, individually and socially, in building economic progress with social and environmental responsibility.
I say that as a Member of the Commission and as a father and politician, not just because I am replacing my colleague MrÂ Dimas.
What is not environmentally friendly is not economically sound.
You can be confident that we mean it.
As to the question on the declaration, I am not in a position to withdraw the declaration, which I delivered on behalf of the European Commission, but I can assure you that the adoption of the new legal status â the vote on the conciliation text â will have an impact on the pending cases, which have been mentioned repeatedly.
We will revisit or re-examine these cases in the light of this new situation â the outcome of conciliation â especially as we will have new Community legislation in this area.
That is all I can say at the moment.
Â Â  . Mr President, there was a particular charge, that I think needs answering, that the Commissionâs Legal Service is working behind the scenes to undermine the conciliation decision.
Is that true?
Is there a difference between DGÂ Enterprise and DGÂ Environment on this issue, and has DGÂ Enterprise won the battle?
Â Â  . I know of no differences.
I only know the Commissionâs position, which I have defended or stated here.
We will continue in accordance with it.
It is important that you take the Commissionâs position into account, not corridors, messages or signals.
I do not know about them.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  I would like to begin todayâs sitting by welcoming Mr Alexander Milinkevich, democratic opposition leader and Belorussian presidential candidate, most warmly, on my own behalf and on behalf of all of the Members of the European Parliament.
Mr Milinkevich, as leader of the unified opposition, you had the courage to stand for the presidential elections held recently in Belarus, which were seen by our Parliament as in no way democratic.
The European Parliament admires your courage and the perseverance that you showed both during and after the election campaign, and would like to express its full solidarity with you, your fellow countrymen and your country.
Europe will not be fully democratic until Belarus is a free country.
You may rest assured that the European Parliament will continue to support human rights and democracy in your country.
You can see that certain Members of Parliament are wearing scarves bearing colours intended to express this support visually and I must tell you that, thanks to the reform that we promoted recently and which is now in force, the President can allow the presence of these external symbols.
Under the previous Rules of Procedure, the President would have had to demand that they be removed.
We should therefore be pleased with the reform of the Rules of Procedure and you will note that sometimes the Presidencyâs initiatives are positive.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the item on the state of progress of the negotiations of the financial perspective.
In relation to this issue, I would like briefly to inform the House that our negotiating team, chaired by Mr Lewandowski, reached an agreement with the representatives of the Commission and the Council.
As you know, Parliament had proposed quantitative and qualitative objectives for the financial perspective. On the one hand, an increase in global resources and, on the other, a better structure and better ways of executing the budget.
With regard to the position of the Council in December, the ceiling has been increased by EUR four billion in fresh money, which will be added to the resources of certain programmes which had been severely cut, in particular Erasmus, life-long learning programmes, innovation and assistance for small and medium-sized businesses.
An increase in the reserves of the European Investment Bank of EUR 2.5 billion is being added to those additional resources, in order to fund programmes to promote research and development, transport networks and aid to small companies.
The flexibility instrument maintains the sum for the current period, two hundred million per year, but with the possibility of unused resources being transferred to the next two financial years.
That is the summary of the agreement reached yesterday, but I am sure that our rapporteur, Mr BÃ¶ge, will be able to present that agreement more fully.
The political groups will have the opportunity to assess the agreement in our debate.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will admit it openly; I am not satisfied with the outcome.
If you look at the detailed analysis of the Financial Perspective for the enlarged EU that the temporary committee has worked to produce, you will realise that even this result leaves out some of the things we urgently need in order to add European value or means that others will have to be worked on over the next seven years.
Even so, let me say that, under the prevailing conditions under which we had to work, everyone involved went to the very limit of what could be expected of them in finding a long-term solution to the Financial Perspective and an inter-institutional agreement.
The President was quite right to point out that Parliamentâs concern has not been merely with figures; it has also been interested in the qualitative aspects and in making a start on the reform of European budgetary policy, in new financial instruments, in the de-bureaucratisation of the whole procedure, and in guaranteeing parliamentâs rights in the foreign policy instruments, as well as in the question of what part Parliament is to play in any potential review in 2008/2009.
We have, then, within the bounds set by the inter-institutional agreement, by means of joint and unilateral statements, worked through the whole of this package of qualitative elements and reform projects, and we believe that we have done so adequately; we have, at any rate, in every respect taken a line that adds up to progress towards a qualitatively improved European budget policy.
Bearing in mind our detailed knowledge of the programmes â for we have gone deeper in analysing them than the Council ever has â Parliament took the view that the figures we agreed on represented the absolute pain threshold, but if, for example, we have, in the sphere of lifelong learning or overall as regards competitiveness for growth and job creation, succeeded in getting an extra EURÂ 2.1 billion in order, for example, to send 40Â 000 more students on exchange within Europe, then our commitment to European added value has paid off.
I would like to express my thanks to the whole negotiating team under Janusz Lewandowskiâs chairmanship, to Mr Walter and Mr Mulder for their excellent cooperation and also to the group coordinators.
It was only because we worked very much across group boundaries and as a close-knit and single-minded negotiating team that we managed to achieve this result at all, and for that I am most warmly appreciative.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to share with you my satisfaction with the agreement reached by negotiators from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspectives.
I would like, in particular, to congratulate Mr BÃ¶ge, Mr Lewandowski, MrÂ Mulder and Mr Walter for their remarkable job, which I know was done under very difficult conditions.
I would also like to thank Chancellor SchÃŒssel and his Finance Minister, for their untiring efforts to reach an agreement.
I have followed the negotiations very closely, determined to ensure that we reached a good agreement.
I can tell you that I am proud of the role played by the Commission â namely by Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ â during the negotiations, which were very difficult.
I truly believe that the outcome of those negotiations is clearly better than the agreement reached at the European Council.
Knowing at first hand how hard it has been to get to this stage, I can honestly say that this is a success.
It is good news for Europe because it means we now have the funds to match our ambitions for the development of the Union over the next seven years.
We now have a clear financial framework to boost development of the ten new Member States that joined in 2004, and of the two new Member States still to come.
I am particularly pleased that we will have increased funding for programmes directly related to the new Lisbon Agenda, namely, research, lifelong learning, trans-European networks, competitiveness and innovation.
Almost EURÂ 50Â billion will be available over the next seven years to enhance the research effort at Union level.
Moreover, for the first time the agreement entails a joint effort with the European Investment Bank. European Investment Bank funds act as catalysts for public and private investors in research and technological development, as well as trans-European networks and small and medium-sized enterprises.
There will also be significant increases in funding in the important area of justice and home affairs.
Another of my priorities, as you will recall â it was the subject of my letters to the President-in-Office of the Council, and of some of my statements here in Parliament â was to secure additional funding for programmes that reach out to our citizens, such as culture, youth, health and consumer protection.
That has now been achieved.
That would not have been possible if we had not worked together to increase that funding after the agreement at the European Council.
I have also taken note of the comments made on this matter just now by MrÂ BÃ¶ge.
Our spending on external actions will also increase, enabling us to continue to promote European values in the wider world.
Thanks to that agreement, it will be possible to enhance substantially the Unionâs common foreign and security policy.
The agreement reached by the negotiators will now have to be endorsed by Parliament and the Council.
We hope this happens without further delay.
We have also worked hard to ensure that the future budget of the European Union will be based on principles of sound financial management.
I also take very good note of what MrÂ BÃ¶ge just said on that: it is not just about figures.
Figures have increased, yes, but it is not just about figures, it is about transparency, it is about accountability, it is about the quality of the expenditure and the quality of the way we work together â Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
It is fair to say that the role of Parliament in the process has been strengthened and it will also play an important role in the review of the financial perspectives, which will be one of the top priorities in the coming years.
I can confirm to you today something I have said on several occasions: as you know, we have been asked by the Council to come up with a proposal for a âreview clauseâ for the future of the financial perspectives and we want to work as closely as possible with Parliament on that matter.
I know it was difficult.
I know that not everybody is happy and nobody will be completely happy â let me say that the Commission is not completely happy â but it was once again a good demonstration of our commitment and our spirit of partnership, that is why I want warmly to congratulate all negotiators.
I think we should celebrate this achievement and then move swiftly to build on the momentum created by this agreement to accelerate and complete the legislative process necessary to get all programmes up and running as from next year.
We have no more time to lose.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the road here has been a long and difficult one, and without this Parliament we would not be where we are now.
I recommend that all of us consider not only the national interest â or what we believe to be the national interest, but should consider the interests of the community, the interests of the European Union, of the Europe in which we share.
Had that not been borne in mind, we would not have ended up with this result, to which our response is âyes, butâ.
As Mr BÃ¶ge rightly said, we are of course not 100% satisfied, but we do know that no more could have been achieved.
I would like to thank the Members of this House â MrÂ Lewandowski, who chaired the working party, Mr BÃ¶ge, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder â for their efforts at persuasion.
We can take pride in having had such a negotiating group to achieve this result.
We have a high responsibility for the European Union, and that responsibility is not in the least to do with money; on the contrary, it is all about democracy, parliamentarianism, transparency and openness.
It is about winning over the public to the cause of Europe, so that this Europe of ours may be convincing.
That is why, when European funds are spent at the national level, we want the national authorities to share responsibility for this money being spent properly.
Where there are deficits, they must not always be attributed to the European Union, for the national authorities must accept their share of responsibility for them.
We insist on the European Parliament being given a say in, and responsibility for, reviewing the European Unionâs outgoings in 2008/2009.
Let me say, with all the emphasis I can muster, that there must be no repetition of the haggling that we have seen going on over recent weeks and months.
This must be the last time that our negotiations should be so lacking in conviction.
I agree strongly with the President of the European Council when he says that we have to give thought to how we endow the European Union with its own revenues that, rather than constituting a burden on the public, will result in Europe having sufficient resources, so let us work together to that end.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is less than we wanted, more than what many of us expected, and a victory for reason.
There are a number of things laid down in the inter-institutional agreement to which I attach particular importance.
First among them is the revision clause.
In 2008-2009, we will be reviewing all the figures all over again.
Those who are currently dissatisfied â dissatisfied, that is, with everything â should note that the consequence of this is that part of the process that has been set in motion by the change in the EUâs budget is a first step.
The Commission has undertaken to submit proposals for the necessary next steps in respect of the revision clause to be taken in 2008/2009.
What has been agreed is better financial management, and that is a vitally important step.
It is quite essential that the resources at our disposal be actually spent and used effectively.
Actually putting into effect the undertakings we have given each other and the agreements we have made with one another will be a great step forward.
There is another great step forward that we have taken, and it has to do with the requirement that the Member States should now produce their own reports with evidence of what they have done with the resources, and â as Mr Poettering has just said â this represents the abandonment of the attitude that âsuccess is national, but failure is in Brusselsâ.
The Member States must now give an account of what use they and their authorities have actually made of the money.
It is quite vital that that should have been agreed to.
It has also proved possible to extract more money, and for that I want to take this opportunity to say: Thank you, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, thank you, MrÂ Mulder, thank you, MrÂ Lewandowski, but I would also, and on behalf of my group, like to thank our colleague MrÂ Walter, who â as other members can testify â drove a hard bargain for our group in the closing stages.
He is from the Moselle valley and is used to flooding; whenever the waters are at their height, Ralf is at his best, so warm thanks to him.

I want to close by doing something you will not often hear me doing, and thank the Commission for their constructive cooperation in this stage of the negotiations.
I would also like to thank Chancellor SchÃŒssel, the President of the Council, who â as we know â still has a pile of work to do, but, having been so constructive in negotiations, he can count on our support in bringing round those recalcitrants on the Council whom he has not yet won over.
All in all, I think yesterday was a good day.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of Liberals and Democrats I too would like to thank Mr BÃ¶ge and his team, MessrsÂ Mulder, Walter and Lewandowski, as well as the Austrian Presidency, for the agreement that they have reached.
I hope this agreement will commend itself for approval to my group, to the House and to the Council and Commission.
I would not pretend that my group is satisfied with the outcome.
We feel that we are not providing enough money for the research and development that our Union needs for the Galileo Programme, for the trans-European networks, for lifelong learning: all of the things we should be financing properly to convince our citizens of the added value of the Union.
We know that it is fashionable in the national capitals of some of our Member States to pour cold water on common endeavour.
It started with the letter to Mr Prodi from six Heads of State and Government two years ago, envisaging reducing the budget to 1% of GNIÂ â a deeply corrosive policy.
But if the centripetal force for our Union is no longer coming from visionary leadership within, it will certainly come from developments beyond our borders.
I hope that our Member States will use the review of EU financing that they have agreed on to look again at providing our Union with the resources it needs.
Our group hopes, too, that we can make progress â as suggested by the Council â towards a proper statement of assurance, so that the auditors can finally sign off the accounts for the Union.
That is, it seems to us, a minimum for regaining public confidence.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to hear that my group is not particularly satisfied with the agreement reached, nor particularly convinced that more could not have been obtained.
Unlike you, PresidentÂ Barroso, I do not believe that this agreement will be able to provide us with adequate funds for our ambitions, and I must admit to having been surprised by your statement.
I think that the basic problem remains the same, namely that the Member States are unwilling to finance the European Unionâs necessary programmes.
This strikes me as a political problem that we will need to address in the years to come.
I too would like to thank the negotiating team â composed entirely of men â and the team that participated in this difficult work â composed entirely of women from my group.
The financial perspective is still conservative in structure and is certainly not directed towards reform.
EURÂ 20Â billion has been cut from rural development, and ambitious projects like NaturaÂ 2000 are still today without funding.
The European Council has announced that there will be a revision clause, but has refused to include it in this agreement, with the result that we do not really know what will become of this clause.
What is more, I would like to know from the Commission â and I hope its members are listening to me â whether or not its intentions to improve the decision-making system relating to external programmes are genuine, because there are conflicting opinions on this that I would like it to clarify for me.
Finally, I would like to address a few words to MrÂ SchÃŒssel.
You have often spoken about issues that are important to us, like the European tax and the system of own resources.
It seems to me that these subjects must absolutely be kept on the agenda, because today, with this truly unsatisfactory agreement â which could have been a great deal better than it is, if only the Council had wanted it to be â I do not think that we will be able to achieve real progress for our citizens between now and 2013.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, MrÂ Barroso, my group has never advocated a thoughtless increase of the budget.
What is more, we do not believe that the budget is the only instrument available to the Union when it comes to facilitating healthy growth and balanced development.
Thus, it would undoubtedly be very helpful if the European Central Bank were to play a different role in this regard.
Nevertheless, the budget is always the expression of a political desire.
There is no point in us harbouring lofty ambitions if we reject the financial resources needed to fulfil them.
That is particularly true in the case of enlargement, which everyone knew, even before the start of the process, would entail legitimate costs, particularly in the context of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
That is why even Parliamentâs original demands and the BÃ¶ge report seemed to us to fall a long way short of the financial needs corresponding to the commitments made.
We therefore agreed with Parliamentâs decision to reject the European Councilâs cut-price compromise of last December.
You were right, MrÂ Barroso, to point out at the time the drastic cuts that a financial perspective such as this would entail and to call for resources for education, research, the trans-European networks, cooperation and so on. From the point of view of these objectives, the 1.5% increase demanded by our negotiators was in itself extremely modest: 1.5% of 1.04% of the Unionâs gross national income.
As far as the Council was concerned, however, that was still three times too much.
Under these circumstances, my group takes the view that our credibility depends on our rejecting this farce and that, consequently, we must shoulder our responsibilities.
Â Â  . Mr President, when I heard just before midnight yesterday that our negotiators had reached a compromise with the Council and the Commission concerning the new Financial Perspective, I experienced contradictory reactions.
On the one hand, I wished to recognise the efforts of our negotiators and all their good work.
I was also much relieved that 15Â months of uncertainty and dissent threatening the Unionâs finances had been brought to an end in this way.
There was a risk that lack of a new Financial Perspective would mean us debating all the budget parameters except for compulsory expenditure on an annual basis and running permanently behind with adoption of the budget.
That is the positive aspect of the situation.
On the other hand it must be pointed out that the new Financial Perspective certainly falls short of expectations, as it implies drastic restrictions to the redistribution of Union resources.
It is anticipated that the Unionâs GNI will increase by about 15% between 2007 and 2013, whilst its budget will only increase by around 2% in the same period.
The figures speak for themselves.
Against this background, the Councilâs resistance to adopting our negotiatorsâ very modest proposals amounts to pettiness.
It has often been said that certain political tendencies represented in this House demonstrate an incomprehensible Euroscepticism, and that this is especially the case of those originating from the new Member States.
I am actually interested in establishing which of the parties are Eurosceptic and perhaps even anti-European.
Might they perhaps turn out to be the governments of those states that are constantly cutting Union budget expenditure, and that believe it is possible to create more Europe for less money?
I shall urge colleagues in the UENÂ Group to support the compromise on the new Financial Perspective.
Nonetheless, if we continue to regularly fall below the thresholds set in the Perspective in the annual budgets, the Unionâs future will be bleak indeed.
I simply suggest not blaming the new Member States for such a situation.
The Unionâs financial problems are largely due to meanness of the old Member States.
Â Â  . Mr President, I feel, having listened to what has been said this morning, that the European Parliament is once again indulging in its favourite sport and pastime, that of navel gazing.
All we are really discussing are the minutiae of interinstitutional agreements â or perhaps at this stage one should say âdisagreementsâ â but are we addressing the real issues of the European Union budget?
Is anybody prepared to really talk about the fact that the auditors have refused to sign off the accounts for 11 years in a row?
Does anybody here want to have a bet with me that it will not be 12 years in a row, or perhaps 13 or 14?
The whole thing is fatally flawed, is it not?
We have a budget system that is overly complicated, but my question is: do we need a budget at all?
Well, Mr Blair, having collapsed in the negotiations, having been totally outwitted, outclassed and outplayed by President Chirac, has signed a really rather bad deal for the British taxpayer.
And now a majority of British people are asking: âwhy are we paying GBPÂ 39Â million a day into an organisation which cannot sign off its own accountsâ?
Why should British taxpayers be helping to build a new underground system in Warsaw and new sewers in Budapest?
Why are we paying all this money to a group of countries that sell us far more than we sell them?
Surely, to subsidise your economic competitors is the economics of the madhouse!
Nobody sensible would indulge in it.
So it will not be very long, Mr President, before the British are not going to be paying any money into the European Union.
I know that all of you have benefited for the last 30Â years, but I apologise in advance.
There will be no British cheque coming to any of you within a few years, but we have enjoyed ourselves whilst we have been here.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with regard to the finding, we all agreed that this sum of around EURÂ 1Â 000Â billion, which is meant to provide for seven years of the European budget, is a modest one, when the US budget, for one year alone, is USDÂ 2Â 500 billion.
Under these circumstances, the claim made in Lisbon that, in 2010, Europe will be the most competitive economy on the planet is akin to the behaviour of Nikita Khrushchev who, in 1960, at the United Nations, said, âIn ten yearsâ time, the Soviet Union will have caught up with the United Statesâ.
Thus, from this perspective, and notwithstanding our successful attempt to secure a fistful of some thousands of extra euros, the proposals that we make in this Chamber remain just as unsuitable in the face of the universally recognised need for investment in laboratories, hospitals, universities, retirement homes, high-speed train services and so on. This means that the Council and Parliament only differed over an extra ânought point somethingâ in relation to GDP, because they draw their inspiration from the same source, which can be summed up in two words: Malthusianism in terms of economic policy and fundamentalism in terms of budgetary policy.
Malthusianism is everywhere in the Union and in the CAP, regarding quotas, set-aside and the uprooting of vines.
The European Parliament, in this very Chamber, inflicts poverty on its catering staff and its drivers, who earn the shameful sum of EURÂ 1Â 000 per month!
This is an example of the sordid economic reality that is reflected in the fundamentalism of our budgetary policies and in the budgetary technique of the Unionâs Financial Regulation.
Everything is done to avoid spending!
The Unionâs Financial Regulation lays down the principle of budgetary balance.
MrÂ Barroso, you need to go back to the days of DrÂ Salazar in order to find that principle, when the United States, in 100Â years, has only had 38 balanced budgets.
In other words, if our plan was to revise our financial perspective, then we should have revised the ultraliberal ideology underpinning it, but to question the three scourges of Anglo-Saxon thinking â Malthus, Adam Smith and Ricardo â was quite another matter.
Â Â  Thank you very much to everybody who has spoken.
The Council and the Commission have been able to hear the political groups, who have expressed differing degrees of dissatisfaction, in some cases satisfactory dissatisfaction and in others dissatisfaction pure and simple.
They have also been able to hear an appeal for work to continue with a view to providing the Union with a system of own resources which in future budgetary negotiations will put an end to the haggling based on national self-interests to which several group chairmen have referred.
Mr SchÃŒssel, we would like to urge you to continue along this road which you have bravely outlined.
We are sure that that is where the Unionâs future lies, with better budgets so that the Union can achieve its objectives.
The political groups will discuss the agreement that our negotiators have reached on its behalf and Parliament will vote on it during its next part-session.
That concludes this item.
Â Â  â The agreement reached in the trialogue on the financial perspective is bad news because it is EURÂ 108 billion down from Parliamentâs original proposal.
The 1.05% of GNI proposed for commitment appropriations falls well short of the 1.21% proposed by the Commission and the 1.18% proposed by Parliament.
In response to the agreement reached at the December 2005 European Council, Parliament has put forward a proposal calling for a further EURÂ 12Â billion to compensate in full those areas such as the Algarve affected by the statistical effect.
The amount obtained only came to EURÂ 4Â billion â largely funded by redistributing money from other headings â earmarked for priorities, such as the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact, other than the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund,
The amounts agreed are woefully inadequate for the purpose of tackling the economic, social and environmental situation in the enlarged EU, where inequality has increased and where there is an even greater need for cohesion.
We voted against Parliamentâs proposal in June because it did not go far enough to guarantee economic and social cohesion, it penalised cohesion countries and it was guided by the priorities laid down in the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ.
For these reasons, we have no choice but to oppose this new agreement.
Â Â  We shall continue with the debate on the results of the European Council and the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be able, in my capacity as President of the Council, to again greet you, Mr President Borrell, you, honourable Members, and you, Members of the Commission.
I am now appearing before you for the second time, and you will perhaps recall the promise I made at the beginning of the Austrian Presidency, to the effect that we did not want this to be a presidency characterised by our own themes, aspirations and desires, but that we wanted to offer you a team presidency, one that would see us working very well together with you, the democratically-elected European Parliament, with the Commission, and â of course â with the Member States too.
Regaining the confidence of the people is a massive task, and it is one that we can accomplish only together, and it is together that we must address the great issues that Europe alone can resolve.
In so doing, we must make use of all the institutions.
There is no point in one institution pointing the finger at another or criticising it.
We are all in the same boat and must keep a firm hold of the oars and row together if we are to gain speed and be able to reach our destination.
I believe that you too can see that we have, from the very outset, tried to establish this collaborative approach within a team presidency.
Without making much fanfare about it, the past weeks and months have seen us, together with you and the Commission, able to achieve quite a few solutions.
I would like to start by giving you a brief report on the European Council.
A year ago, under Luxembourgâs Presidency, we set ourselves the task of giving the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment new impetus.
It is not enough to come up with rhetorical and woolly phrases; what we need instead is results and actions of the kind of which Robert Schuman spoke, when he said that Europe would not be built in a day, but by action, and probably by actions in the plural.
We have also, and for the first time, brought about institutional change, by involving the European social partners in the deliberations of the European Council, which was attended by the President of the European Trade Union Congress, MrÂ CÃ¡ndidoÂ MÃ©ndezÂ Rodriguez, with the President of UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employersâ Confederations of Europe, Mr Ernest-AntoineSeilliÃšre, taking part in the discussions, and with the President of the European Central Bank, MrÂ Jean-ClaudeÂ Trichet, present for the first time.
The President of this Parliament, MrÂ Borrell, did of course speak for it and thereby make a very important contribution to this discussion on business and job creation.
Our presidency has set itself very definite objectives.
You have yourselves been able to see from the media that many of them were highly contentious.
We have not allowed ourselves to be discouraged by this and have included several very precise formulations in the conclusions, particularly in those concerned with work and growth.
The most important thing for us is that the employment situation should be improved for the sake of Europeâs unemployed, who number some 18Â million.
In practical terms, we want to achieve a 1% growth in employment by means of the national reform programmes and improved framework conditions, which would amount to the creation of some 2 million jobs a year, or, by 2010, a net increase of an extra 10 million.
Secondly, it is our quite deliberate intention to concentrate on the training of the young, so that 85% of young people under the age of 22 should get higher education.
Our intention is that the number of school drop-outs should be reduced by 10%, and, quite specifically, that by as soon as next year, all young people should, within six months, be offered either a job, an apprenticeship or the chance of further training, with this period later being reduced to four months.
We have agreed a gender equality pact in the workplace, âflexicurityâ is being discussed in great detail at every level, and the globalisation fund proposed by the Commission provides us with the proper means of giving, through retraining or additional training, a new chance in the labour market to those workers adversely affected by structural change.
The next big issue is, of course, the question of how that is to be achieved, and we have taken the decision to prioritise the small and medium-sized businesses that were, formerly sometimes treated less than kindly.
We have considered the practicalities of how we can make life easier for small and medium-sized businesses â of which there are some 23 million â by reducing official procedures and abolishing administrative rules.
The Commission â in the persons of CommissionerÂ Verheugen and PresidentÂ Barroso â has put forward a highly intensive programme of âbetter regulationâ, following a Dutch model and providing quite crucial impetus towards a 25% reduction of administrative chores.
We want to make it easier for young entrepreneurs to start up businesses.
The intention is that they should be able to get one up and running within a week, with a single point of contact ensuring that small businesses do not have to deal with umpteen different administrative bodies, but can start operating as quickly as possible.
I am very much obliged to the Commission for raising the de minimis threshold, which, I know, was not an entirely simple matter within their own institution.
Doubling this threshold is a vitally important initiative and enables us to make life much easier for small and medium-sized businesses and also makes it easier for us to encourage and support them.
I would also ask you not to forget that we, through the European Investment Bank, have made available an additional EURÂ 30Â billion through subsidised loans, guarantees and sureties, enabling small businesses in particular to make real strides in creating jobs.
The third topic I would like to address is knowledge and research.
We are perfectly well aware that one consequence of Europeâs wage levels is that we can get the better of our competitors only if we do more for training, research and knowledge.
It was, of course, as long ago as 2000 that we set the 3% target.
The only thing is that we have not achieved it.
What is new about these conclusions is that we have got every single country, in the annex to the conclusions and which forms part of them, to commit itself to being able to actually achieve this 3% target in every year right up to 2010.
My comment on the previous debate is that, if we succeed in this â and it will of course call for considerable efforts â the consequence of it will be that EURÂ 100 billion more per annum, drawn from the national budgets and from private industry, will be invested in research.
That would be the most massive injection for growth that one can imagine in this area.
It is still true that the European Investment Bank will help us out with EUR 10 billion in additional risk capital, and, if the private contributions are added to that, that adds up to an additional injection of EURÂ 30Â billion.
It strikes me as particularly significant that the European Council has adopted Mr Barrosoâs idea of founding a European institute for technology, although it was at first highly controversial, for the understandable reason that there are those who fear the creation of huge parallel bureaucracies, while others fear that the existing centres of excellence could lose out.
I fully support the basic idea that the Commission is putting forward here, the idea of creating a link between institutions of higher education and industry, between research and development on the one hand and the end users on the other.
This would not be some sort of super-authority, but a perfectly developed network primarily intended to really cooperate with the institutions in the Member States.
I congratulate Mr Barroso and the Commission on their proposalâs adoption and acceptance, and we look forward to concrete proposals for legislation by June of this year.
Something else that is important while we are on the subject of the budget is the undertaking we have given to make substantially more funding available for studentsâ programmes and for exchange programmes for apprentices.
You have already heard about the additional EURÂ 800 million in the budget compromise right now.
That is a very interesting and important initiative towards giving young people new prospects.
What was interesting was that I recently read a number of studies that considered in a critical light the reasons why we have as yet not achieved the ambitious goals of our strategy â Lisbon, jobs, employment â and one of the reasons given by the Sapir report and also by the was that there was too little 'national ownership' â dreadful term! â which means, in as many words, that nobody in the Member States actually feels themselves to be responsible.
This is where I am setting a good example: at the last Council of Ministers in Austria, I decided that we would have a coordinator at ministerial level, so, with immediate effect, our Minister for the Economy and Labour will be the political coordinator for this whole process, and I will invite every Member State to do likewise, so that we will have policy coordinators who can then â perhaps in the Competition Council â monitor our achievement of the goals we have set ourselves.
That would be a vitally important move towards establishing the credibility of what we have, together, undertaken to do.
One thing that was of course completely new was energy policy, and here the prime mover was the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, although I also want to thank Tony Blair for having in fact set the whole thing off at Hampton Court.
It was of course the first day of January this year that gave us a real wake-up call and raised the alarm, for it was on 1Â January, while I was sitting alongside Angela Merkel at the New Yearâs concert, that the Russians cut the energy supply â by 30% in the first night, and by 50% in the second.
We managed â with the help of the Commission, of Commissioner Piebalgs and many others â to defuse the crisis within four days, but the problems have of course not gone away.
Almost all the producers are based in political crisis zones; nearly all global conflicts have something to do with energy.
Raw materials prices are fluctuating wildly; there is but little diversification.
Some of the time, and in some areas, Europe is at high risk of a black-out.
Climate change, with all its attendant phenomena, is an issue that we have to face; an answer has to be found to the issue of the worldwide increase in demand for energy, and we must not, of course, lose sight of the enormous security risks.
The whole situation positively cries out for a new joint effort on the part of Europe, and the Commission has done a first-class job of preparing the ground with its Green Paper, which the Council has taken on board, also defining as its three objectives security of supply, the competitiveness of our own industry and the improvement of environmental quality.
In practical terms, we agreed on a 20% reduction in energy use â something that I do not think goes without saying and is therefore all the more significant.
What that in fact means is that the EU is setting itself the long-term target of decoupling economic growth from energy consumption.
I regard this as one of the most important decisions that this Council has taken, and one which will demand enormous efforts if it is to be put into effect.
We want to increase the contribution of renewable energy from the present 7% to 15%; that, too, has been a cause of much controversy and is in no way an automatic process.
Both at the national level and together, there is much to be done.
The use of biofuels, which currently stands at 2%, is to be increased to 8%, and that will inevitably demand technology and research; it will involve consideration of second-generation biofuels, the implementation of CARS 21, and cooperation with the motor industry, and brings with it an enormous opportunity for growth, of which we want to make use.
Turning to the cross-border trade in electricity, we aim to achieve a 10% share between networks, which would substantially reduce the risk of a black-out for our consumers.
It must not be forgotten that the pipelines, the networks, the power stations and network security offer economic opportunity, with between EURÂ 800Â billion and EURÂ 1Â 000 billion invested in them, mainly from private sources.
If we make wise use of this by way of a common European economic policy, it will prove to be a powerful generator of jobs and will also make us more secure.
Connected with this â and this is something else we debated frankly, without public disagreement â there is the requirement that there should be no protectionism in a relatively small market like Europe.
Having been Minister for the Economy, and hence also for energy, for six years, I know what I am talking about here.
There may well have been a time when we could all, off our own bat, create national champions or believe ourselves capable of disregarding European regulations, but those days are gone.
What is needed is for the markets to be opened up, and it has been agreed that this is what will happen to the electricity and gas market by mid-2007.
The instruments to do this exist; the Commission is in possession of them, and so let it go ahead and use them without further ado, for one reason why it is the guardian of the Treaties is in order to guarantee security of supply to our consumers.
It has to be said, though, that the energy mix has lost none of its importance, and the decision as to what source of energy to use still has to be taken at national level; that is something I want to make perfectly clear.
Each country must make up its own mind whether or not it wants nuclear power stations; Austriaâs position is quite clear on this â and I know that other countries take a different one â and that must be respected.
I guarantee that it will be, and so, of course, does the European Parliament.
It is vitally important that we consider this not only in economic terms but also in the foreign policy context, and that is why it was agreed that the Commission, working jointly with the High Representative, MrÂ Solana, should produce a strategy paper on the foreign policy dimension of energy policy.
With hindsight, these discussions and these decisions will be regarded as a breakthrough in terms of a genuine common European energy policy.
Reviews to be carried out in every term of the coming presidency will ensure that this issue is not to be lost from sight.
It also, though, strikes me as very significant â and reaching consensus on this was not easy, for I had to spend a lot of time talking with all the Heads of Government in order to prepare the way for it â that I managed to get everyone to accept the decision on the services directive that your House took democratically and by a large majority.
I am also grateful to the Commission for having, as soon as today, produced a proposal that is â as far as I can see so far â in line with this consensus.
I really am keen that we should work together as closely as possible in a fast-track procedure at second reading in order to arrive at a joint resolution as quickly as possible.
I would also like to express my thanks to the social partners at the European level for having played their part in this.
The employers did not find this easy, but they did make a constructive contribution.
Following this breakthrough â for that is how I regard the services directive â I would, though, ask for a similarly committed approach to a second important matter, that being the Working Time Directive.
We all know how important it is that we make progress here, and how it will be if we do, but we will need to be sensitive in taking account of national peculiarities.
I regard this as an example of an area where the subsidiarity principle can come into its own.
A sensible compromise is preferable to having no solution at all.
I would be very happy if we were to be able, during the Austrian Presidency, to achieve together real progress at all three levels â services, the Working Time Directive and the budget.
That brings me to the budget.
I know as well as anyone that bringing it into being has been a problematic business.
Some of you, of course, may be permitting yourselves smiles of amusement in the knowledge that it has â contrary to what one might presume â demanded hard work on the part of three presidencies: Luxembourg, the UK, and now Austria.
This budget is for a period of seven years and is intended to provide not only legal certainty for the programmes but also, and primarily, to enable the new Member States to implement the things for which they hope.
I really am appreciative of the way in which â as everyone in this House has in fact pointed out â we have thought in terms of the whole and not of individual interests.
Believe me, I too have had to intrude on several internal security zones to arrive at this common consensus.
As you will be aware, this has also called for a very great deal of dedication on the part of the Austrian Presidencyâs negotiating team â our finance minister, our foreign minister and of course myself â in our dealings with MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Borrell, to whom we are very grateful.

You will also be aware that we had to stick closely to the December compromise; we were able to offer up to 3.5Â billion, although Parliament wanted 4Â billion, and it testifies to the presidencyâs teamwork that the Commission eventually helped us out by coming up with the missing half billion for administrative expenses, so that Parliament got the minimum of 4Â billion in the programmes that it wanted.
If one includes the European Investment Bank in the analysis, one comes up with some interesting results.
There will be a billion for strengthening the EUâs external aspects, and an extra billion will really stiffen the sinews of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
You can add to that EURÂ 5 billion for the Lisbon Strategy, half from the European budget and half from the European Investment Bank, cash.
The rest are loans, taking the figures up to 10 billion for research, 20 for the trans-European networks, 30 for small and medium-sized businesses â all in all, EURÂ 60 billion.
There have been some very considerable shifts, and I believe that this is a compromise that we can honestly recommend should be accepted.
I must now also go to COREPER and to the other Member States, but I do think we have already achieved something that really is credible in the eyes of the outside world.
Finally, there is foreign policy, where we have, quite apart from managing such crises as bird flu, the row about the cartoons, the gas crisis and the great foreign policy issues, to clarify a number of points, but that is not the main issue today.
There is only one issue I want to mention, because I have seen that Alexander Milinkevich is up in the gallery, and that issue is one that also featured at the European Council.
The situation in Belarus is, of course, a tragic one; I can tell you right now that that is how I personally see it.
I had, yesterday, the honour and pleasure of a long personal conversation with Mr Milinkevich.
He is a calm and reasonable man and deserves from us every conceivable political and economic support wherever it is required, especially through the various party families, for the opposition in Belarus is constituted by a platform composed of the most diverse groups.
The stateâs forces having been brutal in their treatment of demonstrators, hundreds are still in jail, and thousands of students have lost their places at university; workers have lost their jobs and families their incomes.
A number of Member States have formed a coalition, the Visegrad states â Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary â among them, and Austria is also playing its part by offering scholarships to Belarusian students, and this is what prompts me to ask the Commission for support, in order that we might give Belarus real help.
Above all, we must join together in raising our voices and demanding the prompt release of the internees, in particular of the presidential candidate Alexander Kosulin.
At the same time, we should also stress that the EU has no interest in isolating Belarus, and certainly not its people.
We should also support civil society in Belarus in establishing the democracy they want.
The regime there will be subject to the restrictive measures we adopted at the European Council for as long as it continues its authoritarian approach and systematically suppresses civil society.
We still have three months of our presidency ahead of us, and I know that there is a lot of work in store for us, but I am confident that we will â as we have done before â resolve the important issues through good contacts and good cooperation.
I am very confident that you will, as you have done before, have your own contributions to make, which may well be critical or exacting, if you have particular thoughts or ideas.
I can promise you my absolute cooperation, and I will also try to move as much as possible forward at Council level, without great fanfare and proclamation, but rather in such a way as to achieve real results.
That is my programme, and I believe I can point to its having achieved a certain amount even before our presidency has reached its halfway term.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the prevailing scepticism and contrary to a certain cynicism that is taking hold today, I believe that it can be said that, despite the difficult times it is experiencing, Europe is making progress, and the European Council of 23 and 24Â March demonstrated that an enlarged Europe can also make progress.
The momentum initiated last autumn has put Europe and our institutions back at the centre of the debate.
The message emerging from the European Council is clear.
Europe needs to tackle the main problems linked to economic growth and employment.
The week before the Spring European Council, I presented to you, in this Chamber, the issues at stake in that meeting, which was a crucial meeting because it represented the first occasion on which the revived Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment was to be implemented.
I can tell you today that the objectives set by the Commission have been attained.
I am thinking not only of the excellent reception given to our Green Paper on energy, but also of other practical proposals, including the one concerning the European Institute of Technology.
In saying that, I am not speaking merely on behalf of the Commission, I am also speaking on behalf of the general European interest: I believe that we can unreservedly congratulate ourselves on the outcome obtained by this Spring European Council.
Guided by the excellent work and the perseverance of the Austrian Presidency, the Heads of State or Government have accepted the principle of partnership for the new Lisbon Strategy.
They have declared themselves ready to move into top gear and they have also taken major decisions paving the way for the actual implementation of our commitments under the new Lisbon Strategy.
We now have monitoring mechanisms.
We have 25 national reform programmes.
From now on, the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the political forces, the social partners and public opinion in general can embark on a course whereby measures take the form of results: they can move on from the stage of rhetoric to the stage of practical measures in the form of results.
The key word in English was âdeliveryâ: the practical presentation of results.
