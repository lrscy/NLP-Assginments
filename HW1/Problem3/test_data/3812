Question No 8 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0377/03):
Subject: Report on freedom of faith and religion in the world
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, USCIRF, performs an advisory function for the US Government on issues of religious freedom.
In its annual report, USCIRF expresses concern at the fact that the Saudi Arabian regime is investing money abroad in order to disseminate its extreme interpretation of Wahhabi Islam - thereby increasing religious intolerance in other countries.
Examples of this are the training of Sharia officials in the northern states of Nigeria, Saudi funding of the construction of Wahhabi mosques, missionary activity and the fact that extreme Wahhabi Muslims chose to travel to Afghanistan, Bosnia, Chechnya and Kashmir in order to wage 'holy war'.
This has prompted USCIRF to recommend that Saudi Arabia be included on the list of 'countries of particular concern' drawn up each year by the US Secretary of State.
How does the Council view the information in the USCIRF report on Saudi Arabia and violence and terrorism motivated by Wahhabi Islam?
Is it prepared to step up the EU's efforts to defend freedom of religion and faith around the world by introducing a similar annual report and analysis dealing with religious freedom together with a list of countries like that of the US Government?
. (IT) The report which Mr SacrÃ©deus referred to has not been discussed by any groups associated with the Council.
The European Union Annual Report on Human Rights illustrates, inter alia, our clear position on freedom of religion and action taken on this basis.
The Union seizes, I believe, every opportunity to urge States to pursue laws and procedures which promote tolerance and mutual respect.
Concerns over the freedom of religion are regularly expressed to all the governments in question, both in bilateral and multilateral forums such as the annual meetings of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
At the most recent session of the Commission on Human Rights the Union expressed, moreover, its deep concern over the implementation of basic international human rights standards in Saudi Arabia, including the continual restrictions on the freedom of religion and expression and systematic discrimination against women.
At the 59th Session of the Commission on Human Rights, as in previous years, the Union supported the Resolution, tabled by the Irish Government to be precise, on the Elimination of all Forms of Religious Intolerance, where States are urged to adopt the necessary actions to combat hate, intolerance, violence and duress on grounds of religious or spiritual beliefs.
I wish firstly to welcome Italy as the country holding the Presidency and to thank you very much for your answer.
I am aware that the Italian Government, especially its minister, Mr Buttiglione, has a strong commitment to issues concerning religious freedom and tolerance around the world.
I still want nonetheless to repeat my question as to how the Council views USCIRF's report on Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabite Islamic - inspired violence and terrorism.
What can the EU do under Italy's leadership to strengthen the EU's positions on this issue?
I also wish to ask a follow-up question. Are you prepared to strengthen the EU's efforts in this area?
Could the EU prepare reports corresponding to the American annual reports on religious freedom?
. (IT) I have no problem confirming what I said at the start: today the Council is not expressing an opinion on that report because it has not yet been discussed by the Council's competent groups.
I acknowledge Mr SacrÃ©deus's request and would say to him that I will give the Council Secretariat the chance to have it considered in order, naturally, and where appropriate, to express our opinion.
I can say right now, Mr SacrÃ©deus, that it is important to strengthen the principle of protection which you referred to in your question.
Question No 9 by Bernd Posselt (H-0379/03):
Subject: Ban on cloning
What is the Council Presidency's view of the current stage reached in efforts to ban all forms of human cloning world-wide and in the European Union?
. (IT) The Council Presidency thanks Mr Posselt for calling our attention to such an important issue.
Human cloning and its prohibition does not fall within the competences of the European Union, as we all know.
Nevertheless, in this respect the Presidency would remind you of the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: Article 1 lays down that human dignity is inviolable and must be respected and protected; Article 3 lays down, moreover, that, in the fields of medicine and biology, the prohibition on, inter alia, eugenic practices must be respected, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons, the prohibition on making the human body and its parts a source of financial gain and the prohibition on the reproductive cloning of human beings.
I can answer that - apart from a deep-rooted value that I personally feel inside - the prohibition on the reproductive cloning of human beings is clearly laid down by Article 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Mr President, I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for that very good and clear reply.
I would like to put just two supplementary questions.
Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights refers merely to 'reproductive' rather than to 'therapeutic' cloning, although the two are one and the same thing.
Germany, France and other countries are trying to get the United Nations to ban all types of cloning throughout the world.
I just wanted to ask if the Presidency of the Council might also take some action along these lines.
Secondly, you are right, with regard to this issue, to invoke the subsidiarity principle, but is there not the danger that, in such areas as that of embryo research, the European Union might modify or undermine many Member States' more stringent provisions on the protection of embryos?
. (IT) The request you have made today will be considered closely by the Council Presidency precisely with the aim of evaluating the German and French initiatives which you referred to, Mr Posselt, and precisely to avoid those dangers which could somehow affect such an important principle for the human conscience, that is, even more important than for the rule of law.
Mr President, I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for that statement.
For the sake of precision, I would just like to put a supplementary question.
I think the Presidency will be aware - as Professor Sirchia, the Minister for Health, has taken a very active interest in this issue - that it is Parliament's firm opinion that the legal basis exists for a comprehensive ban on cloning - the prohibition of both what is termed reproductive cloning and of cloning for research purposes.
Parliament adopted this position in the course of the codecision procedure on the report on quality and safety standards for cells and tissues. At the Council meeting on 2 June, Professor Sirchia expressed the view that Parliament's position was well-founded.
I want to ask if the Presidency is aware of the importance Parliament attaches to this issue, and of Parliament's intention to resubmit this motion at second reading stage.
. (IT) I am certainly aware of this, within the confines I stated at the start; that is, it is not within the competences of the European Union to adopt normative actions directly affecting this area.
Clearly, I will - as I told you, Mr Liese - following thorough examination, put forward a strong, political action for consideration by the Council.
I would thank you very much for your answer.
Through the Italian Prime Minister, the Italian Presidency has today emphasised the importance of close cooperation with the United States, constituting a North Atlantic alliance on a variety of global issues.
In what way can the European Union use the good relationship between the Italian Prime Minister, that is to say the new President of the European Union, and the US President to promote joint action by the United States and the European Union to bring about a ban on cloning within the UN system?
. (IT) The Council is following the human rights situation in Indonesia, particularly in Aceh, very closely.
Since the breakdown in peace talks and the subsequent declaration of martial law in this province in May 2003, the Indonesian security forces have launched a significant joint operation against the Free Aceh Movement.
Military police operations are being carried out in this province on a vast scale which could effectively endanger the safety of personnel of international NGOs and UN agencies.
The European Union has urged the Indonesian Government on various occasions, both in public and in private, to protect civilians during the ongoing battles, to safeguard the human rights of the population of that province and to seek a peaceful, negotiated solution.
The Union would remind you of the recent Resolution on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by consensus at the 59th Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
This resolution calls on all the States to adopt the necessary measures to protect human rights defenders and in this regard, I can assure you that the European Union will urge the Indonesian Government to allow Hina Hilani, Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations on Human Rights Defenders, to visit that province.
Moreover, the Union will continue to closely follow developments there and to express its serious concerns, in an appropriate way, to the Indonesian Government.
Is the Council aware that only in the last few days there has been a further crackdown on the activities of human rights organisations in Aceh.
For example, they are now forbidden to talk to the press and to make statements.
If the Council is aware of this, what will it be doing about it?
Will the Council make contact with the Indonesian authorities?
Effectively it is becoming more and more difficult to find out what is happening and whether human rights are being abused as we sit here today in this Chamber.
. (IT) I can confirm, Mrs McAvan, that, not least in light of the events of recent days and weeks, our contact and position will remain steadfast, first and foremost to establish and then express what the European Parliament and the European Council are in agreement on regarding this issue.
Question No 11 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0308/03):
Subject: Victims of the war in Iraq
With reference to the war in Iraq and on the basis of the data held by the Council, how many of the victims were civilians?
How many were members of the military?
How many were women?
How many were children?
How many were reporters?
How many civilians were injured, and how many military personnel? How many reporters, woman and children were injured?
What other data of this type should be compiled?
. (IT) I am sorry that I cannot answer Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question because the Council clearly does not have the requested data.
With regard to what I said a few minutes ago - I believe with regard to Question No 5, again on Iraq - Europe has recently begun initiatives in order to participate in the humanitarian aid programme for the country, but we do not have this information, which can, of course, be discovered in other ways, for example by asking the organisations and the States present in Iraq which presumably have this data.
I am sorry, but all I can say is that the Council does not have this information.
Mr President, it is unacceptable that the President-in-Office of the Council is giving such emphatic, cautious, evasive, mean and insipid replies as this one.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there are silences that speak volumes, which make themselves heard, and the complicity of which is horrifying.
This is shameful for an institution such as the Council of Ministers.
The European Union keeps meticulous accounts of molluscs and fish, chicks, poultry, cattle or goats; it bureaucratically identifies animals and vegetables of every type of species, which it analyses exhaustively; it analyses the chassis of motors, industrial parts and tools, the remoulding of tyres ... it is unacceptable that it cannot count the victims of a war of hardly three weeks ago.
Bearing in mind that we are talking about a war which violated international law and did not enjoy the multilateral support of the United Nations, I would ask you - and please reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - do you condemn the violation of the right to life which has been suffered by the victims of this illegal war?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would ask Mrs Izquierdo Rojo to adhere to the formalities of this House.
We have to understand that the President of the Council's function is, of course, simply to perform the Council's duties, and that he does not bear responsibility for the individual Member States.
It is for that reason that I want to ask whether it is actually known whether it was possible to liberate from Iraqi prisons political detainees who would otherwise have faced the death penalty?
. (IT) I will certainly find out about what Mr RÃŒbig has just asked me, and if it is acceptable, I will provide a written answer.
Mr President, I agree with Mrs Izquierdo that the President-in-Office's answer was not the right answer.
He had the questions in good time and could have tried to inform himself so that he could also inform us.
Nonetheless, I wish to come back to a more basic problem.
Today I heard your Prime Minister, President-in-Office Berlusconi say, in so many words, that he was opposed to the attack on Iraq, that he is opposed to the disdain shown towards the UN and that, at all events, he did what he could to prevent this evil.
Today, however, we have an occupation.
And it is an illegal occupation, which is continuing despite the vigorous resistance being developed on a daily basis by the Iraqi people.
I wish to ask what this Presidency will do, given that it is supposed to be opposed to these developments, even though I have a different opinion about your government's stance, in order to stop this evil?
Especially now the pretext put forward about the existence of weapons of mass destruction has proven to be a lie.
The American leaders themselves are saying that there are no such weapons.
So there were other reasons.
What will the Italian Presidency do?
Will it act to stop this criminal occupation?
. (IT) I can answer the last question by confirming what I said earlier regarding the action of the preceding Greek Presidency, an action which will also be continued in the same way by the Italian Presidency.
We believe that we should look to the future, that we should, within the framework of the United Nations and Resolution 1483, attend to humanitarian needs and the reconstruction and stabilisation of Iraq. We should think, looking ahead, of a European Union commitment which is not restricted to humanitarian aid, which is currently the case.
Clearly looking to the future means looking ahead to the conditions which will enable the Iraqi people to again govern their own country following the fall of the dictatorship.
This is the path which we embarked on under the previous Presidency, and the Italian Presidency will continue in that direction.
Question No 12 by SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain (H-0384/03):
Subject: Objective 1 regions and the Structural and Cohesion Funds
Will the Italian Council Presidency indicate its current position on the future of the Structural and Cohesion Funds in Objective 1 regions?
. (IT) The Council does not plan to indicate its position on the future of the Funds and the Cohesion Fund in Objective 1 regions during the Italian Presidency.
In fact, the Council will be unable to initiate its work on the future of the cohesion policy until the Commission has tabled its proposals.
However, with a view to the tabling of the Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion, the Italian Presidency of the Council intends to keep alive, on the agenda of these six months, the debate on the reform of the Union's cohesion policy.
To this end, a certain number of both political and technical events will be organised, including in particular an informal meeting of Ministers for Regional Development focusing precisely on the relationship between cohesion and regional competitiveness and between cohesion and Cooperation.
The competent Minister intends to provide more detailed information about this during his intervention before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament, which will obviously take place in the next few days.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer, although I did not learn much from that answer.
I still believe that the subject of Structural and Cohesion Funds in Objective 1 regions is the competence of the European Union and as such deserves a more thorough answer.
Coming from an Objective 1 region in the west of Ireland, I believe that we should have the benefit of hearing what the President-in-Office has in mind regarding future plans for this very important area, particularly since a transition period is required for Objective 1 regions, which would utilise all the benefits that have come from the funds that have been received.
. (IT) Certainly more information in this regard could be provided by the Commission which, as I tried to explain, has not yet tabled its own report on this subject.
The Council Presidency will only be able to take action following the report.
I also said that, given the importance of the matter, the Italian Presidency will also address this issue and that the competent Italian minister will present the relevant information to Parliament's competent committee.
These are the conclusions which can be reached today, in the absence of the Commission's report.
Mr President, I have another question for Mr Frattini.
There has been a great deal of discussion about the unused monies in the Structural and Cohesion Funds, which are returned to the finance ministers every year.
There is now very intensive debate about whether this money would be better allocated to extending the trans-European networks.
Is this being discussed in the Council, and what timetable do you have in mind for these funds to be put to use, as soon as possible, for the benefit of the world's most competitive region?
. (IT) If I may, in relation to this question too, I would like to reserve the right to provide a written answer to Mr RÃŒbig, be it positive or negative.
As this is a highly sensitive issue, I would like to avoid saying things which are not absolutely clear and accurate.
As the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 13 to 29 will be replied to in writing
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on
the recommendation for second reading (?5-0219/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the framework for the creation of the Single European Sky (15851/3/2002 - C5-0138/2003 - 2001/0060(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Fava), and
the recommendation for second reading (?5-0225/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism,
1. on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on the provision of air navigation services in the Single European Sky ('the service provision Regulation') (15853/2/2002 - C5-0137/2003 - 2001/0235(COD)),
2. on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on the organisation and use of the airspace in the Single European Sky ('the airspace Regulation') (15852/3/2002 - C5-0139/2003 - 2001/0236(COD)),
3. on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network ('the interoperability Regulation') (15854/3/2002 - C5-0140/2003 - 2001/0237(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Sanders-ten Holte).
Mr President, we are on the home straight with a report, a Commission initiative which Parliament warmly welcomed and which we feel is one of the most important aspects of the work which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has carried out in recent years: a single European sky, with efficiency, safety and cost containment as its objectives.
It is clear that the single sky is a practical combination of conduct and rules, certainly not a literary metaphor: rules and synergies which must be defined, applied and respected.
Mr President, the Commission proposal had the merit - we pay tribute to the Commissioner, Mrs De Palacio, for this - of courageously raising this issue with force and with urgency, and within the deadlines.
A year ago, Parliament commendably took up the Commission's challenge at a difficult time, following 11 September, at a time when discussing safety in our skies required increased sensitivity, reasoning and attention.
Parliament met this challenge, and gave its support with a broad, firm consensus to this draft, which was adopted at first reading and which was subject to certain simple rules which we hope will be reconfirmed and applied.
The most basic rule is the necessary harmony, the necessary synergy between all the institutions, all the bodies, all the organisations which are involved in putting into practice the objectives of the single sky - efficiency, safety and keeping costs down - and, therefore, first and foremost, focus, punctuality and the definition of a clear relationship between Eurocontrol - the agency which has dealt with the technical expertise side of managing the European skies - and the Commission, the European Union.
In this regard we have managed to reach a very specific balance which confers on the Commission the task, the responsibility of the management, of the political regulation of our single European sky, and calls on Eurocontrol to make available its expertise, its experience and its technical know-how.
Another fundamental point is sanctions: a system of sanctions - which will, of course, be deferred until the various States have fully defined them - which can be used to punish the airlines and other parties concerned in the event that these rules are violated.
The word 'sanction' is always an unpleasant word, a word which should always be spoken with great restraint and great care, but it is a necessary word in this case.
It has been since the time of Cesare Beccaria: if we do not have a system of sanctions, it will be hard to be sure that rules will be respected.
This is a system of rules which does not allow exceptions, apart from in certain very special cases; it is a system of rules based on respect, for otherwise the concept of a single sky would not be fully realised.
The third point is cooperation between civil and military users.
Cooperation between civil and military authorities is the distinguishing point: to this end, a single sky committee is provided for, in which the military are also to participate; there is also a safeguard clause which gives Member States the possibility of deferring certain single sky regulations should special situations or special emergencies arise, and this naturally lies first of all within the role and function of the armed forces and the military.
Well, with regard to all these points, the common position may well have been affected by a climate which, following 11 September, is giving much greater consideration to national sovereignty and national security.
It is, in any case, a position which we consider to be quite conservative.
Cooperation between civil and military users is essentially pushed aside.
The single sky is losing one of its major distinguishing characteristics.
We feel that, in this respect, there may have been a certain naive short-sightedness.
Cooperation between civil and military authorities should be considered not as a restriction on Member States' sovereignty but as a great opportunity, an opportunity which, moreover, is guaranteed by an extended safeguard clause, which we have only prevented being extended to cover simple training too for otherwise the very concept of a single European sky would be undermined.
Mr President, I do not have anything else to add.
I have briefly summarised the basic developments of the political and institutional background to this report.
I hope that, in the coming weeks and months, in a balanced trialogue with the other institutions, Parliament will be able to contribute to the swift definition of a set of regulations which will be a credit to the work of the Commission, the Council and, of course, Parliament, so that we will, at last, be able to provide the European citizens with a single, safe sky.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I speak for the majority of my colleagues when I say that our main reaction to the Council common position on the Single Sky was a sense of disappointment.
In the field of safety, the Council fortunately sensed the feelings of the European Parliament accurately.
It also introduced greater clarity to the original Commission proposal.
Many of the European Parliament's fundamental wishes have been largely disregarded, however, and that is regrettable.
I will now go into more detail on the conditions that we consider necessary in order to bring about a successful Single European Sky.
Firstly, we should like to see a clear commitment - laid down by law - so that the Commission can find a solution regarding the certification and training of air-traffic controllers.
We also want the Member States to improve the recruitment of these professionals.
I also think that all providers of air-navigation services should be free of conflicts of interest, should be adequately staffed, and should ensure that access to their services is non-discriminatory with regard to all airspace users.
In addition, we want charging for these services to be transparent, and we want it to offer incentives to improve safety and efficiency.
Commissioner, we do not want a better-integrated airspace, we want a Single European Sky, and I hope that you put that across to the Council, too.
That means that we are calling for a clear, unambiguous commitment to a single European Flight Information Region, first in the higher and then in the lower airspace.
We are also striving for successful implementation of all the elements in the package, and also, therefore - perhaps most importantly - of the elements relating to interoperability.
I know that you also place a strong emphasis on this.
Thirdly, we consider it extremely important that the Member States give a clear, unambiguous signal that they are serious about wanting to rearrange European airspace into cross-border airspace blocks.
Without the commitment to do this, a single airspace would be a hollow shell, with no hope of success.
That is why Amendment No 26 in my report is so important.
In addition to the decisive priority of safety, airspace management is also an economic sector.
Without a stimulus from the EU, each Member State will tend to pursue its own interests in that sector. Were this not the case, the cross-border airspace blocks would have been established much earlier.
Fourthly, the desires of the Member States do not always represent the best interests of citizens.
Passengers have a right to fewer delays and to even greater flight safety.
Moreover, the people on the ground sometimes get overlooked, but they also have similar rights.
They have to be able to take it for granted that flying is as safe as possible, and that the adverse effects on the environment are minimal, by permitting the crew to fly to their destination via the most direct route.
That is exactly what the rearrangement of European airspace is to bring about.
We would ask that the Member States let go the reins of sovereignty over their airspace in order to achieve that aim.
Fifthly, I do of course understand the sensitivities of the Member States regarding cooperation between civil and military airspace management.
I also respect the legal constraints that the EC Treaty imposes on us in this area.
However, Commissioner, I do not believe that the Council has achieved the maximum possible in this field.
On top of what is known as the flexible use of airspace, there are certainly other possibilities for improving cooperation between civil and military airspace managers without contravening the EC Treaty or jeopardising Member States' defence competences.
No one wants to undermine the effectiveness of the European military air forces; we only want to ensure that the use of the airspace is optimised as far as possible by means of better communication and coordination.
Finally, I should like to thank my colleagues for their great cooperation throughout the process.
The successful coordination with my colleague Mr Fava improved and strengthened both of our proposals.
They still differ on one small point, and my group has therefore requested a separate vote for Amendment No 14.
We are afraid that the Commission is being kept on leading reins too much.
Apart from that, however, I think that we can really look forward to a quick, efficient trialogue enabling us to keep to the original timetable for the implementation of the Single Sky, and that is in the interests of all of us.
.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I firstly wish to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for the work they have done over all this time.
I would also like to thank them for their particular dedication to an issue which is very complex from a technical and institutional point of view.
I believe - and I say this as a preface to the issues I am going to explain later - that, on certain aspects, the honourable Members may possibly have wanted more and, in particular, much clearer definitions, but the consideration that I wish to communicate to you is that, in this particular case, we are opening up totally new fields.
In the air sector we are entering into fields which so far had been kept completely outside of any type of regulation or agreement at European Union level.
I would therefore like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the Members, who I know have participated very actively throughout the discussions in committee, and to remind them of something that we all know: until 2000 this sector has developed systematically, in the intergovernmental field, by means of Eurocontrol or the International Civil Aviation Authority.
As Mrs Sanders-ten Holte said a moment ago, however, we all know that the demands of the citizens go further, that they are asking us to resolve urgent problems and there is a possibility of significantly improving the capacity and safety of our airspace and the efficiency of its management, if we are capable, in this respect as well, of introducing an integration at European level.
The objective is therefore to make the organisation and the management of the air space coherent with mobility in the skies, to create a single sky before the end of 2004.
And the honourable Members know that this is one of the emblematic initiatives of this Prodi Commission.
I would also like to say that, in the meantime, events have taken place, which certain Members have referred to, such as the crisis in the aviation sector relating to certain factors, 11 September, the war in Iraq, the Uberlingen accident, which have undoubtedly affected our work, but that, in no case have they undermined either the importance of the initiative or the urgency of implementing it.
I would like to point out that, regrettably, it does not appear that your reactions to the Council's common position are going to allow an agreement to be reached at second reading.
The questions the honourable Members are asking appear to me to be legitimate and they deserve to be discussed in Council, but we must be aware, when dealing with this initiative, that - and I insist - we are entering new territory for the first time, and it involves several delicate aspects, and we must therefore make progress gradually and the work we are doing is very delicate, that the Council has to accept this step forward and that we must be pragmatic and realistic, and achieve operative texts which promote the immediate achievement of concrete results.
I am aware that you believe that the final proposal in the Council's common position is not sufficient and that you are calling for greater action at Community level.
I would like to say to the honourable Members that of course I share your concern, but that there are legal institutional obstacles which prevent us from accepting some of the amendments you have presented, such as, for example, in the case of the report by Mr Fava, Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 and, in the case of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Amendments Nos 13, 16, 25, 29 and 33.
With regard to the other amendments, either in principle, in part or with a modification to the wording, we will be able to incorporate them, when the time comes, partially, if not in their entirety.
I would like to point out that we still oppose certain amendments which could affect or prejudice the institutional operative reality.
The amendments which I have said are not acceptable include, specifically, Amendment No 14, on the consultation of the interested parties within Eurocontrol, as well as the amendments in the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Nos 13, 16, 25 and 29, the second part of Amendment No 15 and Amendment No 33, which has become obsolete as a result of technological progress.
I will raise two issues which will take centre stage in the coming discussions between the institutions within the framework of the conciliation and which the honourable Members have referred to: civil/military cooperation and the creation of functional blocks, the first of which is taken up in both reports and the second in Amendment No 26 by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte.
The civil/military issue is a key element for the success of the single sky, as the honourable Members rightly say, but you must also remember what the competences are at Community level, and this is the restriction we are faced with in relation to the whole of this issue.
The discussions in the Council have demonstrated that balancing the needs of the transport policy and the demands of defence policy require coordination mechanisms which go beyond the possibilities offered in the first pillar.
In order to support the creation of the single sky, despite this obstacle, the States of the Union have committed themselves, in a declaration, to developing military cooperation as a complement to the initiative in the context of the first pillar.
I believe we must take advantage of this opportunity and proceed pragmatically in this field.
Amendment No 29 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte establishes that transport policy has primacy in the use of the single sky, and this does not sufficiently reflect the legitimate needs and concerns of the Member States from the point of view of defence.
With regard to the second aspect, the functional blocks, Amendment No 26 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, the Commission shares Parliament's point of view, but believes that an acceptable solution would be to strengthen the role of the Commission in combination with the 'single sky committee' and with the technical support of Eurocontrol, with a view to coherently assessing all of these blocks, maintaining the Member States' right to initiative and decision-making.
The creation of these blocks affects the military aspects, which I referred to in the first part of my speech.
We therefore accept Amendment No 26 of the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte in principle, but we will have to change the wording.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that the proposals we are discussing today are the result of one year's work by a high-level group, made up of civilian and military representatives from the Member States of the Union, and of a social group consisting of the various agents in the civil aviation sector and also with participation at all levels of this field.
In September 2002 you issued your opinion at first reading and at that time I thanked you for your support and the effort you dedicated to this initiative.
We agree in many respects, but I would insist that what we need is a realistic position which allows us to move forward.
I thank you for your support, and in particular the work of the two rapporteurs, and I hope that in the conciliation stage we can rapidly achieve a positive result which allows us to create the famous Single European Sky before the end of 2004.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing thanks to the rapporteurs, who - not only at first reading stage but also at the second - had, in essence, to start their work all over again after the Council was so eccentric as to reformulate the Common Position in such a way that it was impossible to tell which of Parliament's amendments had been taken up and which had not.
One may well wonder whether this is just a haughtily offhand attitude, or whether there is a system at work here.
I believe it to be the latter, because the Member States are simply unwilling to accept these undoubtedly forward-looking rules, but I will also make it abundantly clear that Parliament champions the cause of the Single Sky, one that will guarantee greater safety and also greater efficiency.
I would like to list four points that I believe should be regarded as essentials.
Firstly, the military cannot be allowed to continue to dominate European airspace.
This is about bringing about proper coordination, in which civil and military air operators are partners with equal rights, and with the certainty that they are able to cooperate with each other.
Secondly, in the air, too, the European patchwork must be done away with once and for all.
Nobody, after all, can grasp how it is that we still have almost forty blocks of airspace in the skies above fifteen Member States long after land borders have been abolished.
The issue of whose decision this should be is of the utmost importance, as the Member States have had enough time over the past decades to take the decision to create cross-border airspace blocks.
They failed to do so, and so, I believe, the decision passes to the European level - to the Commission.
My third point is that we want air safety services to be cautiously opened up to the market.
My fourth is that we want mandatory harmonisation of both technology and of the training of air traffic controllers, as a means to making both technology and human resources mutually compatible.
Today marks the first anniversary of the terrible air disaster on Lake Constance.
Whilst that has no direct connection with this regulation, it does indicate the potential dangers inherent in a multiplicity of airspace blocks, in which the airlines constantly have to announce their entry and exit, with all the potential for misunderstanding that is involved.
What this means is that we have the responsibility of ensuring safety and efficiency.
If my judgment is correct, I can only say that my group will not be held responsible for regulations that do not end up giving real competence to the European level, along with the power to implement it.
I want to make an urgent appeal to the Commission.
Commissioner, I am somewhat surprised; you have narrowed the scope to some extent, and your staff were even more cautious, but, otherwise, on many aspects, you have demanded much more, and, if I may mention open skies, where you want all powers granted to you at once, you have suddenly started to hold back on this important issue.
I ask you to consider on which side you are fighting.
Join forces with Parliament, so that we may have a common European sky, in the interests of the people in the countries from which we come.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schmitt is indeed right to say that today marks the first anniversary of the calamity at Ãberlingen, when two aircraft collided, resulting in many deaths.
The public see the Single Sky project as the European response to the situation in the skies above Europe, which is, to say the least, unsatisfactory.
So how do matters stand?
We have three times as many control centres as an area of comparable size in the USA, with a patchwork carpet - a product of the Sixties - in the skies above us.
If you fly from Brussels to Rome, you have to pass through nine different control sectors; during a flight from Brussels to Geneva, the radio frequency has to be changed five times.
With the number of journeys by air continuing to mount over the coming years, the whole thing is more and more a safety hazard, and, at the same time, highly inefficient; one in every four flights is delayed, and 350 000 flying hours are wasted every year.
All that costs the airlines some two thousand million euros per annum.
The Commission, with its regulatory package, and Parliament, at first reading stage, faced up to this challenge, but the Member States' Common Position does not do it justice in terms of what is expected and required.
Why is this so?
The first reason for this is that, at the heart of the single sky, there are the functional airspace blocks.
How are these to become reality?
What is the added value of a regulation if its implementation is to continue to be dependent on the whims of the Member States?
They can already set up airspace blocks on a bilateral basis.
We take the view that nothing will change here unless we get a normative proposal from Eurocontrol and the Commission.
My second point is that, in the Common Position, we have made hardly any real progress away from the status quo in terms of civil/military cooperation either.
I know this is a highly sensitive issue, but we cannot wait a few decades more for people to be able to fly within Europe by a direct route from A to B.
Thirdly, it is a cause of anguish that there has been no European response to the desperate lack of air traffic controllers.
This must be included in the regulatory package and - not least for safety reasons - should be tackled as soon as possible.
My group endorses the reintroduction of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading stage.
No doubt we will have to have frank discussions with the Council in the Conciliation Committee.
Thanks are due not least to the rapporteurs for their good and cooperative approach to our work together.
Mr President, the legislative package being discussed to create a Single European Sky is a very challenging one.
I would like at this stage to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and in taking this matter forward.
The problem with European airspace is congestion.
There is an enormous volume of air traffic in Central Europe.
Ensuring that it flows well demands cooperation between the Member States, and this has already been achieved.
Nevertheless, in sparsely populated Member States, such as Finland, there are not very many problems of this sort.
The country's domestic air traffic, in particular, can be managed very flexibly alone.
The objectives in the report are ambitious.
It has a number of far-reaching proposals.
One of them concerns the division of airspace.
Dividing up the airspace into sectors could be brought about if necessary through qualified majority decisions.
One might wonder whether this is necessary to achieve the objectives or whether cooperation between the Member States would suffice.
It may well be that closer integration in the heart of the EU is essential, but there is probably no need for it in the peripheral regions, given their special circumstances.
A problem, too, is charges.
If air traffic control services were charged based on average values it might well mean that charges would clearly rise in some areas.
A more delicate problem is the integration of military aviation and air defence with the European system.
Traditionally, military matters and questions of defence do not fall within the scope of the codecision procedure, involving the Council and Parliament, in the EU, and there is no justification for that now either.
Consequently, in this regard too we should tread carefully and respect agreed principles.
Even taking these difficulties into consideration, however, the reports are extremely valuable and the objectives they have set their sights on are excellent.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the first reading in Parliament, the Council's common position is, in my opinion, an important stage in the construction of a Community policy for air navigation.
Although the approach that prevailed in the Council bears the stamp of realism in a number of areas, I regret that it did not attack certain provisions more.
I will come back to this.
The requirement for a separation of functions between service providers and the national monitoring authorities is, like the requirement for certification of service providers, a structuring measure.
If it is about affirming the desire to distinguish the role of the operator and that of the regulator and increase transparency, the requirement should take into account the real situations that show that different concepts can also work.
In any case, I think it is reasonable for each Member State to retain the choice of how things operate in their countries.
I regret that it has not been clearly recognised that the management of air navigation security was part of a chain of actions and services that needed an overall, rather than a divided approach.
I am even more convinced of this approach after spending two days last week at the annual conference of the 'air navigation' group of the ETF unions.
I am happy to talk about dividing up, but I think that we also need to talk about the human factor.
We can always reduce the staff in control centres, but it is not acceptable for one section of airspace to be managed by only one or two controllers: there are also human limits.
At the same time, in terms of airspace, progress has been made in that a single European flight information area in the upper airspace has been created and in that the Commission has produced a common publication on aeronautical information in that area; these are established facts.
Harmonisation would also be ensured for pricing of services.
Regarding the organisation of airspace and service provision, everyone agrees that safety requires anticipation, research and agreement between States and the service providers concerned.
The changes made to the initial text particularly concern recognising the sovereignty of the States over the airspace above them and pointing out the responsibilities of those States towards the ICAO.
The Council thus reached the conclusion that the functional blocks of airspace, which have been the subject of many debates, will be established by the States concerned.
Is this good or bad?
I think that it is a process.
It is also a question of recognising the fact that air control requires that prerogatives of the public powers be exercised and that it should not be of an economic nature justifying the application of the competition rules in the Treaty.
In this way, it is the States that decide whether or not to give financial incentives to their service providers or users through taxes; this is the approach that I, personally, prefer.
What matters, then, is that we recognise the central role that Eurocontrol must play in preparing measures delegated to the Commission, which are part of the responsibilities of that organisation; in my opinion, this is a step forward.
Finally there is the recognition of the exclusive competence of the States in determining their defence operations, including processing them, which, I agree with you Commissioner, is not desirable.
I would lean more towards putting civil before military in peacetime, which is undoubtedly the situation today.
Having said this, the common position incorporates a large proportion of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading.
I regret, nevertheless that the Council, like Parliament at first reading stage, was cautious about certain demands that I regard as sensible.
I thus find it regrettable that my group's proposal to double the control apparatus to ensure that operations continue if there is any failure, and the proposal to evaluate the correct implementation of the Directive, were not retained.
I have met with the operators and worked a great deal with the unions on this matter.
There are those employed in the sector who are already working in the European and world airspace and are determined to move Europe forward, and I think that we should listen to them.
Hearing them means really involving them and not only consulting them.
Europe will be made using people from different sectors and will require their active participation; I do not think that there is any future without them.
To conclude, I regret nevertheless that the approach remains focused, on the whole, on the ideological premise that liberalisation brings efficiency, including in terms of safety, something that remains to be seen.
Mr President, obviously the technical issues relating to this specific matter have been adequately analysed; consequently, I shall focus on the political aspect of the matter and say that the question of the Single European Sky is inspired by two different and somewhat contradictory philosophies.
The first philosophy considers that delayed flights, which are a very extensive phenomenon in Europe, are a serious blow to the airline companies, the passengers themselves, the environment and the economy as a whole.
One of the most basic reasons to which this situation is ascribed is the constant increase in air traffic and, more importantly, the lack of a common system for managing the airspace of the European countries.
The other philosophy reflects the concern of certain Member States who would like to secure their airspace rights, mainly in relation to their defence obligations and needs, and the corresponding facility to carry out military exercises in that space.
These concerns are more acute where there are problems connected with these issues, in countries such as my own.
The European Parliament has espoused the first philosophy.
As in numerous other sectors of European policy, the choice of a real Community policy and uniform regulation have been judged more efficient.
This was the philosophy at first reading.
The Council, unfortunately, relied solely on the second philosophy.
The concerns and doubts prevailed.
The Council set particular store by issues of public order, security and defence.
In this way, it essentially deadened the Commission's proposal and, of course, its position bears no relation to the position of the European Parliament at first reading.
If the Council agreed with the objective of the Single European Sky, it should have adopted a different strategy.
Otherwise, it should have said honestly that it disagreed with the endeavour.
It is obvious that we are being drawn into a conciliation procedure.
In this procedure, the Council must demonstrate flexibility.
I firmly believe that there are ways for us to take essential steps as far as the Single European Sky is concerned, without touching on national sensitivities and vital interests.
Where there is a will, there is always a way.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that the reason why we have before us today a Council common position differing considerably from the initial Commission proposal and from what Parliament worked out is because, as we all know, this matter has arisen from a misunderstanding between the desire, on the one hand, to substitute the Commission for Eurocontrol, and on the other hand, to give the air traffic controllers too much responsibility for delays, particularly in 1999, which was marked by exceptional military constraints.
I think that, since then, we have done a lot of work and we are not very far from reaching a balance point.
We have recognised that air navigation services are of general and security interest.
We have left it up to the Member States to appoint their services.
We have brought Eurocontrol into the picture, which I think was absolutely necessary.
At present, there are still some points to deal with.
Although I am aware of the legal constraints that they imply, I approve of and encourage the efforts that the Commission is making so that the military authorities at least agree to have a discussion.
We are aware that there is an obstacle there, and quite a considerable one, which concerns capacity and is undoubtedly much more significant than others that are too often pointed out.
Secondly, the question of arbitration on international airspace blocks has not yet been decided upon.
I think that it would be enough for all the parties present to agree to re-establish taking into account Eurocontrol's assessment; the Commission, as is normal practice, needs to give the final ruling on that assessment.
Finally, I am of the opinion that we need to implement Recital 16 and Article 7 of Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's report, which are aimed at involving staff as closely as possible, as they are an integral part of the safety chain.
The air navigation profession is not simply about the market - and I think that the Commission can take pride in having finally recognised it - it is first of all about 'policing' airspace, airspace which will become increasingly overloaded and in which we must at all costs preserve know-how and excellence, avoiding introducing too much competition into the sky 'policing' services.
Mr President, before I go any further, I would also like to reiterate my complete readiness to implement all proposals genuinely geared towards improving cooperation and ensuring the best possible use of our airspace, while guaranteeing higher safety levels.
As Mrs De Palacio in particular has already emphasised, however, this is a delicate matter in technical, institutional and political terms, and it demands a high degree of realism and common sense.
In the speech I delivered here last September, during the debate at first reading on the organisation of the Single European Sky, I had occasion to mention the aspects of the Commission proposals, and also those adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which concerned me most.
I can only emphasise that my concerns, especially those linked to the functional blocks, evaporated to a large extent when the Council adopted its fairly balanced common position.
For the same reason, I feel bound to distance myself once more from some of the amendments adopted for a second time by the Committee on Transport, since they are totally at odds with the consensus reached in the Council, and also with the Commission's newly reconsidered position, which, of course, I commend.
In fact, I find the insistence on the proposal to create functional blocks, to be imposed regardless of the wishes of the Member States, particularly hard to justify: it does not fall within the Community's competence to manage airspace, or any other aspect of the EU's territory.
It falls within the Community's competence least of all when military matters are involved, as in the present case.
Besides, no intractable conflicts over the definition of blocks of crossborder airspace are known to have arisen between Member States up to now, and none are predicted.
Such conflicts are even less likely now that the Member States have adopted a statement guaranteeing the degree of cooperation required between civilian and military organisations in order fully to implement the flexible use of airspace concept.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, if I disregard the opinions of certain individuals, such as certain French Members of this House, it appears to me that this House is of one mind where these two reports are concerned.
Our standpoint is still that which we took at first reading, and I do not therefore want to respond to the small minority of radicals that has just spoken, but I would like to address the Commissioner in the words of a great German poet: more courage, Commissioner, more courage!
I believe, Commissioner, we should remind ourselves of how, in the summer of 1999, when discussing your presentation of what you were going to do in office, we made the observation that the question of a unitary system of air traffic control was one example of an effective European policy that produced demonstrable added value.
It is because that was the position you took in 1999, and because your proposals were in line with that, that we, like Mr Schmitt, are rather sad that your final comment on the Common Position was that, if that was everything that the Council was going to concede to us, then you were satisfied.
So, more courage, Commissioner; we want the second reading to take us down the road your proposals indicated; we want functional airspace blocks!
To Mr Miranda, who spoke just now, and to a number of others who have spoken before me, I have to say that the Member States, and Eurocontrol too, have had forty years in which to carve out the airspace blocks in ways that make sound business sense, and they have never done anything about it.
It is for that reason that we - Parliament and the Commission together - must do it by means of well thought-out legislation.
So, Commissioner, as we come to the reports' second reading, let us, who are the majority in Parliament, and the Commission, be more courageous if we are to have a European added value in the skies above Europe!
Mr President, I should like to thank both the rapporteurs for producing quality reports.
I can support most of their amendments, but I have strong reservations about 10 out of the 51 amendments.
The United Kingdom is a strong supporter of the Single European Sky concept.
Personally, I wish to see it implemented as soon as possible to eliminate delays, reduce emissions and enhance safety.
My primary reservations stem from how to best secure the military's involvement in the Single European Sky.
That it why I support the Council's common position - its compromise on the flexible use of airspace where civil access is permitted to designated military airspace when it is not in use.
This compromise solution was arrived at after careful negotiations over many months.
I consider that it offers genuine and important benefits by ensuring that the greater effectiveness of the FUA concept is rolled out across the European Union.
Amendments that bring the military into the scope of the Single European Sky regulations will clearly be opposed by some Members and, I fear, by many in the Council.
Reopening the debate on this issue will clearly be counterproductive to the whole process of the Single European Sky.
In conclusion, there is a real danger that, by seeking to amend the common position in this regard, we might jeopardise the entire Single European Sky project, something I am sure that we all wish to avoid.
Mr President, the European Parliament rapporteurs would like to make us think that creating the Single European Sky would be a noble cause and a big step forward that Europeans should welcome.
The Council, however, has no need to embellish reality, which is why there are differences in formulation.
The differences in formulation, however, hide the reality more than highlighting it.
The European Union is an association dominated by rival States that hold on to their borders, even in the sky.
What they call their sovereignty is only the civil and military defence of their egotistical interests and those of their wealthy classes.
Although the sky is single by nature, it is not yet single for human society, and the European institutions are clearly not managing to put an end to this aberration.
The expression 'single sky', however, is being used to cover up an operation aimed at making further inroads into the public service of air traffic control for the benefit of operators, suppliers and private service providers.
That is what it is about.
The European authorities have already authorised the privatisation of the British body responsible for air traffic control.
Some of the Eurocontrol rules have also been modified to enable private companies to make profits in the air traffic control sector.
Air traffic control unions in Europe are rightly condemning this rampant privatisation and its consequences both for the safety of flights and for the staff's working conditions.
A year ago, at the time of the Lake Constance air disaster, we saw what tragedies could result from the introduction of the law of profit into this field, even if only to a limited extent.
Despite that, and while hypocritically defending themselves, the European authorities are persisting and signing.
They are pushing even further towards dismantling this public service, towards the race for profits and cutting the sky up into sectors that can be allocated to private operators.
The airlines will undoubtedly do well out of it, but the air traffic control staff and passenger safety will not.
We are therefore once again expressing our opposition to this increased privatisation of the sky, which is damaging both to users and to air transport employees in the broad sense, and to the people in the flight path.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are evaluating today, at second reading, a package of measures designed to create a Single European Sky.
Although I agree entirely with the aims of the proposals under discussion, I do have some concerns about their content, which I feel bound to share with this House.
They stem, firstly, from the lack of a legal basis in the common transport policy for legislating in certain areas, especially those involving the military. Furthermore, they are rooted in the excessive and unnecessary curtailing of Member States' sovereignty over their own airspace.
Allow me to mention three points which I believe are fundamental in this connection.
The first relates to what I view as the Commission's attempt to communitise the Member States' airspace through the immediate creation of a single European flight region, on the basis of which the so-called 'functional blocks' will be established.
I give my full support on this point to the Council's common position, according to which the delineation of the functional blocks falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States and cannot be changed by the European Union.
Secondly, moving on to military matters, the Commission proposals allow for the possibility of subjecting military activities to rules for airspace management and use.
Once again, I agree with the Council's common position, which seems much more suitable and balanced, since it recognises that more efficient use of our airspace does indeed depend on closer cooperation between civilian and military organisations. In other words, the concept known as the 'flexible use of airspace' should be uniformly applied throughout the Single European Sky.
This objective should always be pursued with due regard for national competences.
Finally, I would like to refer to the question of airspace management, and express my total disagreement with any approach seeking to make airspace management out to be just another economic service comparable to the liberalised telecommunications or transport markets supervised by a European regulatory body.
I would argue, therefore, that each Member State should be completely free to designate the service provider for its own airspace, under the supervision of national regulatory authorities and without being answerable to any other organisations whatsoever.
. (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank you very warmly for all your comments and speeches demonstrating the importance the honourable Members attach to this initiative, one of the most ambitious of the Prodi Commission.
I would like to remind you that in the field of aviation we have been taking giant steps over recent years in terms of creating common areas amongst the Member States of the Union, which until now were the exclusive competence of those States.
For example, in the field of air safety, through the European Air Safety Agency, which will allow us for the first time to provide a common certification of aircraft in Europe and which will allow us, amongst other things, to be able to certify the Airbus 380.
For example, when we propose new safety standards in the fight against terrorism and other types of attack, which are shared and common for all the States of the Union, with reviews and controls which guarantee that these common standards are applied by everybody.
And, for example, when we finally achieve a mandate for negotiation with the United States with regard to a common aviation zone between the United States and the European Union.
The latest great initiative is precisely the Single European Sky, which facilitates all the actions I referred to earlier, particularly the negotiation with the United States, and also in the field of safety and the European Air Safety Agency, but which furthermore is going to allow us to ensure in the future that this time Europe is not left behind on this issue; I am referring to the issue of the new definitions and new concepts for the management of air traffic for 2020, where clearly the possibility of having a single sky, within which we will have integrated, harmonised and common systems, means that Europe will have a critical mass with which to negotiate adequately with the United States, which by means of an equivalent initiative is carrying out work in this sector.
The STAR 21 initiative is a key initiative for the future.
It is key to European air safety and technology, technological development and European industry.
Ladies and gentlemen, reference has been made to Eurocontrol.
Eurocontrol is taken into account and is going to participate - we have said this since the outset.
It has participated in all the meetings we have held on the Single European Sky in the high-level groups and throughout all this time, as a source of knowledge, in its capacity as a group of experts.
The Commission does not intend to create an alternative system to Eurocontrol.
That is not our job.
But we cannot allow the Commission to legislate on the basis of decisions by a body like Eurocontrol, which is in no way a Community body, but which is an intergovernmental body which includes a series of countries which do not belong to the European Union.
The honourable Members must understand that there is a fundamental institutional problem which we cannot avoid when it comes to accepting certain types of amendment.
It is one thing to employ, contract and even reach agreements with Eurocontrol, so that it may act as an expert to which we refer and which provides us with certain types of information, documents and even proposals, but it is quite another to commit ourselves to legislate or act on the basis of what is said by an intergovernmental organisation containing third countries.
We simply cannot do that, ladies and gentlemen.
The next issue is Amendment No 4 by Mrs Sanders?ten Holte, with regard to licences for air traffic controllers; of course I have taken it up again.
We accept it - I have said this before - for the simple reason that it was in our initial proposal.
It was the Council that withdrew it from its common position and the Commission is pleased to reincorporate it because we believe we have to provide common training and qualifications for all air traffic controllers at European level, although there must then be specialisation in the specific area in which they have to operate and work.
With regard to liberalisation, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know how to say this, because I have said it so many times ...
We are not liberalising anything here.
Where do we say that this field is going to be dealt with like telecommunications?
If you can show me where we say it, I am prepared to correct it, for the simple reason that we have not said it anywhere.
If we had, I would be worried, just as the honourable Members are.
As one of the speakers said quite rightly a moment ago, there are competences here which belong to the public sector, to police activity, and there clearly cannot be more than two operators because that would create an undesirable situation.
There will therefore be neither liberalisation nor competition.
It is different when it comes to using certain services such as, for example, weather forecasts, when it will be possible to refer to the national meteorological centre of the country in question or the meteorological centre of another State or whoever provides the most suitable data.
That is another issue.
But when it comes to traffic and air control, none of this is being proposed: neither liberalisation, which makes no sense, nor privatisation.
By the way, it is true that one State has carried out privatisation unilaterally, in a very particular manner.
I will end by referring to the two problems which I believe will be the crux of the debate in conciliation.
Mr Jarzembowski asked me to be courageous and some people have said that in the end we in the Commission have been timid.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, you are well aware that this issue has been promoted from the outset with all the necessary courage, strength and rigour on the part of the Commission.
But we are talking about a question of possibilities, realities and urgent issues in a complicated area in relation to which we are all aware that the first pillar is one thing and that defence aspects are quite another, since we have no capacity to intervene in them.
I believe that the Council's compromise - and some of the honourable Members have said this - with regard to flexibility in terms of civil and military use, is a very acceptable compromise.
It is very possible that in the future this compromise and this formulation will evolve.
I am sure of this, ladies and gentlemen, but this is the first step.
Let us remember that we are moving forward, that this is the first step and that a change is taking place which I would go as far as to say is almost revolutionary.
I would therefore ask the honourable Members not to approve the amendments which mean changing the Council's compromise on the civil and military use of airspace.
It is a very delicate compromise and to break it would create serious problems, as Mr Watts said a moment ago.
With regard to the functional blocks, I understand what the honourable Members are saying.
I believe that the two problems can be combined here: the guarantee to the States that they will preserve their competences and capacities, with the concern for the coherence of the whole global concept.
I believe that if the Council shows itself to be flexible there is a margin within which we could work.
It is clearly the States which must reach agreement, but by means of the group which is working with the Commission, coherence will be given to the whole issue and all the blocks proposed.
In this regard, some of your amendments perhaps facilitate this approach and I hope that in this way we can move forward.
In any event, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders?ten Holte, once again for their work, and all the honourable Members for their speeches, and to ask you, in terms of flexibility, not to go further than the Council's compromise, because I know that there is no room for manoeuvre there.
That would endanger the whole agreement, which is very fragile, as the honourable Members are well aware, on an initiative which is absolutely necessary and urgent.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (?5-0213/2003) by Mr Caveri, on the transitional transit system applicable to heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for 2004.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur Mr Caveri, Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, cannot be here to expound on his recommendation in person.
Expectations are that he will shortly be leaving the European Parliament to take up a senior post in the administration of his region, Valle d'Aosta.
As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Transport, I shall therefore take over the explanation of his recommendation.
Under its accession treaty, Austria has a system of permits for heavy goods vehicles.
In six months' time, that system will come to an end.
The so-called ecopoints constitute a complex dossier in which many conflicting interests are at stake.
We are all agreed on the objective: a reduction in emissions from heavy goods vehicles in the Alpine region.
This is one of the aims of the Alpine Convention, to which all the countries concerned are signatories.
As regards the path towards that aim, however, there is a difference of opinion between the Council and Parliament.
We, the European Parliament, are not convinced by the common position, which does not have the support of the two Member States most affected: Italy and Austria.
It is true that the two countries have opposite reasons for this, but that just goes to show that further consultation is advisable.
In addition, exemptions were necessary in order to win some of the other Member States over.
The Committee on Transport wants to achieve a balance between attention to air quality on the one hand, and the free movement of goods on the other.
That is why we have sought a compromise for the areas of Austria which have the greatest problems: the Alps, and especially the three main passes.
This is expressly a transitional stage on the way towards a sustainable approach for the whole of the Alpine region.
Our proposal to keep the cleanest heavy goods vehicles, category Euro 4, outside the points system is compatible with the common position.
On the other hand, the most polluting vehicles, Euro 0, must be banned indiscriminately; which means no exemptions for Greek and Portuguese vehicles.
Finally, the legislative process regarding charging for the use of the infrastructure must be accelerated, in our opinion.
For these reasons, a majority on the Committee on Transport has decided to re-table all the amendments from first reading.
Starting from that position, we want to enter into dialogue with the Council in order to find a structural solution, as we are heading straight for a conciliation procedure.
I should like to emphasise that no time should be lost in this.
After the summer recess, there will only be a few months left before the current arrangement comes to an end.
It is in everyone's interest that a transitional system enters into force by Christmas.
This sensitive dossier calls for a firm stance on the part of the European Parliament.
I sincerely recommend the rapporteur's amendments to you all, therefore.
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached an important point in this complex discussion at which the European Parliament is going to give its opinion on the Council's common position.
You will probably support the recommendation to approve at second reading the amendments approved at first reading, with a view to quickly beginning the conciliation procedure, as pointed out by Mr van Dam, who is replacing Mr Caveri.
I would like to thank Mr Caveri and Mr van Dam, and the whole committee, for the work they have done on this difficult issue.
As you know, the objective of reaching conciliation quickly has the full support of the Commission, since the current system ends on 31 December 2003.
However, the different parties will have to make an effort to find a compromise solution and, furthermore, the Austrian authorities will have to display a degree of flexibility.
Otherwise, it will be impossible to find a solution before the end of the year, with all the consequences that could entail.
Let us remember, for example, the prohibitions imposed by the region of Tyrol at the moment and the procedures the Commission has initiated in that regard.
In this situation, the Commission must act in accordance with the commitment made on 31 December 2002, and confirmed on 28 March 2003, and must therefore reject the majority of the amendments presented by the European Parliament.
I would like to assure the honourable Members, however, that the Commission is prepared to adopt an open attitude towards amendments such as the geographical scope of the system, the methods for applying it to candidate countries and others and, in any event, we will show the flexibility necessary to achieve the agreement we all want to see within the context of the conciliation and we will work to try to achieve it, although this would appear to be very difficult, since the differences between Parliament and the Council are very significant.
Mr President, at first reading the European Parliament adopted a proposal regulating the matter in, I believe, a satisfactory manner, without ignoring legitimate Austrian sensitivities on the matter.
The paradox is that the Council proceeded to the common position as if Parliament did not exist.
With an attitude that is reminiscent of old times, it has proceeded to adopt a common position, despite the recommendations made by the Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, to the Council to take account of the first reading of Parliament, and it has ignored the European Parliament, which of course now, at second reading, is obliged, following this unacceptable Council position, to confirm its position at first reading.
Thus, of necessity, things are moving towards the conciliation procedure.
I hope that the Council has got Parliament's message and is prepared to enter into a substantive discussion during the conciliation procedure.
What do we want from the conciliation procedure?
Obviously, we do not want to isolate Austria because we have very good cooperation with our Austrian colleagues and because it is not good for us to isolate countries.
As I said in committee, and I repeat here too, if the bell tolls for someone today, we must not forget that it may be us that it tolls for tomorrow.
Consequently, we must be moderate in our position.
Nonetheless, we must not ignore the interests of the other countries.
There are countries which have particularly vital interests in this particular issue: Germany, Italy, my country, Greece.
Mainly, we must not ignore the fact that this Union is based on a certain specific philosophy and on a certain specific Treaty.
And this Treaty talks about the free movement of persons, capital and goods.
We have a single market, the principles of which must be respected.
And they must also be respected in this instance.
Of course, we are prepared to discuss a transitional arrangement. However, any transitional arrangement must be inspired by the spirit and tend towards this objective, the objective of serving the principles of the single market.
This is the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Mr President, we would like to highlight just a few points.
Firstly, on behalf of our group, I would like to say that we support the proposal which Mr Caveri has already put forward to the Commission and which he is laying before plenary, which picks up what Parliament had already specified at first reading.
There are just a few points to highlight: the first reminds us of the thorny question, the contradiction that we are considering today.
This is a derogation scheme - and is therefore exceptional and temporary - which we are being asked to extend for the second time.
This second extension demonstrates the flexibility and willingness, the good political sense of Parliament, of the entire Parliament.
As for my second point, Mr President, I would like to stress that there have been attempts in this debate to establish, often surreptitiously, a false distinction between those who defend nature and those who pollute.
This is a false distinction.
There is a large majority which is mindful of the interests and needs of each Member State, but it is a large majority which acknowledges the need to gradually dismantle, over the coming years, this derogation scheme, the ecopoints system, and try to meet this objective by encouraging the use of increasingly less polluting vehicles, but which also knows that we cannot expect all European hauliers to radically modify their motor vehicles in a few months.
Another important point is that we considered it necessary to prevent a further derogation for particularly tolerant treatment being offered to certain countries - Greece and Portugal - in this case on the proposal of the Council.
I will not add anything else, Mr President, apart from the fact that this lengthy debate, these lengthy discussions, where we have often been forced to repeat and go back over concepts, reasoning and even inflexible positions which were always the same, has been an important test, more for each of us than for Parliament: a difficult test because it involved - something which is not uncommon but, in this case, may have been more marked - casting off our civil clothing, that of the citizen of one Member State, which is a uniform but which, in Parliament, is often constricting, in order to put on the highly dignified and decorous attire of a Member of the European Parliament who must act, respond and intervene on behalf of the whole Parliament.
In this regard, the Caveri report is a perfect response to this request for dignity which Parliament made of its rapporteur, in that it is a report that serves, first and foremost, the interests of Europeans.
Mr President, I would like to start by contradicting what has just been said by Mr Fava, who was of the opinion that we are engaging in mock combat.
I do not believe that to be the case; this was meant to be a debate.
How are we to take the Alpine Convention as the basis for solving a problem that affects not only Austria?
For some time, now, we have been holding a debate between little Austria and the European Union, and, although I do not, right now, want to apportion blame, we have been playing this out for long enough.
Austrian governments have made mistakes, as has the European Union.
I will not be able to persuade or convince you - it seems to be too late for that - but I would, all the same, like to give you a few more facts to consider before we take a decision tomorrow, taking as I do the view that we MEPs should come to our decisions on the basis of verifiable facts.
In 1996, we observed that our air quality measurements showed no reduction in the elements indicating high levels of nitrous oxide pollution, even though the threshold values prescribed for vehicles had become more stringent, and the emissions models had led us to expect a reduction of some 45%.
These high levels of emissions, from heavy commercial vehicles in particular, aroused suspicions that this sector could be the source of the higher levels of emissions.
A study was therefore carried out by the Technical University at Graz, which, it might be mentioned, also does work for the Commission as part of the Artemis programme.
The results, which were markedly more exact than before, were published as part of an international study involving the best measurement laboratories in Europe.
Let me quote from the study's final report: 'It has been established that emissions from heavy commercial vehicles, especially of pollutants belonging to the NOx group, have hitherto been significantly underestimated.
This applies to vehicles fitted with engines in European categories Euro 2 and Euro 3.
When operating in actual traffic, these vehicles produce higher levels of emissions than the categories allocated to them would appear to indicate.
An explanation of this is to be sought in the way in which the vehicle's engine is deliberately programmed to function.
The vehicles are engineered in such a way that they demonstrate lower emission levels at the points measured in the course of the test cycles for their type prescribed by law.
At those operating points that are not tested in the test cycle for their type, but which are very definitely significant in actual driving, the vehicles produce the same emissions as, or even higher levels of them than, older engines'.
The reduction of NOx emissions is, of course, what the ecopoint systems' rules - which I have never claimed to be exactly brilliant - are intended to do.
What this study now shows us is that it can be established that there is no scientific basis for the reduction of the number of ecopoints logged per transit journey for Euro 2 and Euro 3 as against Euro 1.
When I asked Mr Caveri to include these facts, he referred me to his Amendment No 17, which simply says, 'shall ensure that it is done correctly', and, at the same time, explained that there was nothing he could do if the engines of HGVs were tweaked - and, if he is accusing Italian hauliers of doing that, now really has to be the time for him to explain himself.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the extension of the ecopoint system is not just about special treatment for Austria, it is not about continuing to make life difficult for Europe's hauliers, and nor is it about making a mockery of the free movement of goods.
Austria has no desire to set these rules in stone for the rest of recorded time.
What Europe needs is a sustainable solution to its transport problems.
For years, none has been found; the transit issue is a ten-year saga of omissions by one side and then by the other.
To this day, the transport infrastructure costs directive is not officially speaking on the table, and, to this day, the objective set out in the Transit Agreement, of a lasting and sustainable reduction in pollution, has not been fulfilled.
It is for this reason that Austria needs transitional arrangements to be enshrined in a treaty.
What the proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism mean, as does the free run for HGVs in European category 3 that it is looking to implement, is that Austria is going, in the fullest sense of the word, to be overrun.
There are parts of my country in which pollution as a result of transit traffic has reached levels that people and their environment cannot be expected to endure.
In the event of the committee's proposals coming to fruition, Austria's citizens will, quite literally, be driven on to the streets.
I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 19, which has been tabled by a number of Members of this House from different political groups, as it prevents the worst from coming to pass and will represent a workable compromise in negotiations with the Council.
Here and now, I appeal to the Council not to delay the conciliation procedure.
Europe needs a directive on transport infrastructure costs; European policy needs instruments for a sustainable transport policy; Austria, in the meantime, needs a transitional arrangement.
The majority in this House may well turn a deaf ear to these concerns, but their doing so will mean that Europe will be doing the people of Austria a disservice.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think Parliament has done its homework very well, in that it has done everything it can to get through second reading as quickly as possible.
One reason why this is important is that the Council has taken such a stubborn attitude, essentially concentrating on the compromises it agreed at New Year without responding to any of Parliament's suggestions.
This means that only a conciliation procedure can resolve the problem, so, in the committee, we prepared the second reading and presented it to plenary in what really was record time, so that we would have enough time to conduct the negotiations, on a serious basis, before the year is over.
I would not want to miss this opportunity to extend thanks to the Commission for now having commenced Treaty infringement proceedings against Austria in respect of the unilateral steps taken by the province of Tyrol, and I hope that this will yield results before 1 August, when these rules enter into force.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the Commission for having, at its meeting this week, decided not to have recourse to the 108% rule.
That, too, sends a clear signal that we are a community founded on the rule of law, where it is not open to all to do as they please, but in which all share in drafting and enacting the law, which must therefore also be obeyed by all.
Quite simply, then, my plea to all the Members of this House - and also to the Council - is that we should all make good use of the summer recess and consider how we can each move closer to the other's position.
Here there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the course of negotiations.
Let us take the autumn negotiations seriously and complete them with a third reading by the end of this year.
We will then be on the right track when it comes to bringing together, in the right way, the interests of the environment, the interests of the transport sector and the economic interests of the European Union as a whole.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the impression is constantly given that Austria is at odds with the rest of the European Union.
Thank God that is not the case, Mr Jarzembowski, for, after considering the facts, you too must concede - you who know what you are talking about and cannot plead ignorance - that these rules have played a substantial part, over past years, in improving the environmental situation across the length and breadth of Europe.
It was the transit arrangement with Austria that led to the HGV fleet being modernised and made more environmentally friendly and played a substantial part in this coming about.
Therefore, as has already been mentioned, this is not about standing up for pettifogging local interests.
Of course, the people of the Tyrol will defend their interests, and your opposition to them, Mr Ferber - your opposition to your Tyrolean neighbours - is something that you and they will just have to sort out together.
In the past, though, this rule really was used to ensure that improvements were made to the environment in our vulnerable regions - not just in the Tyrol, for there are enough vulnerable regions in Europe.
This is now about finding a temporary solution until the transport infrastructure costs directive comes into being, so that we can take another step towards making Europe's fleets of HGVs more environmentally friendly.
Mr Simpson and I have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists; it is identical with Amendment No 19, to which reference has already been made.
Our amendment makes provision for vehicles in category 3 to be included as well, as, if they are not, there will be the perverse consequence that someone trading in his category 2 vehicle - that is to say, a really bad HGV - for one in category 3 - and this is where the study already referred to is relevant - will in practice be no better off in a category 3 vehicle than he was in one classed as category 2, and, in certain cases, even worse off.
It would be a positive aspect of our decision if we, despite all the other points of criticism, could include category 3 as well.
Let me reiterate that this is about nothing more or less than the question of where our priorities lie - with the environment, health, and quality of life or with the unrestricted free movement of goods.
Both sides of this equation have to be considered.
I am not saying that the free movement of goods does not matter.
I simply think that what must surely count in the eyes of our electorate as a whole - and certainly in the eyes of those in Bavaria - is that priority should be given to health and to the environment.
Let me observe, by way of winding up my speech, that there will indeed be a conciliation procedure.
I am grateful to all those who have helped to make it possible for us to move swiftly on to the conciliation procedure.
What now really counts is that we act quickly and work out a compromise.
Although I do not want to revisit all the details of this morning's debate right now, everything we have seen and heard, and the Italian transport minister's almost daily statements, indicate that Italy is not at present ready to really work towards a compromise.
I believe that the Italian Presidency has to recognise that it must, in these six months, act on Europe's behalf and not just on Italy's, and so I hope that it too will realise the great value of the environment, including the environment in Italy, and that we need a sensible temporary compromise until such time as the transport infrastructure costs directive can enter into force.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a couple of short remarks about the proposals currently on the table.
I think that there is more than one aim; emissions are not the only factor.
Some facts have just been presented that show that the issue of emissions on the one hand, and the facts and the proposals to limit the European standards for heavy goods vehicles on the other, is somewhat problematic.
Noise, too, constitutes a nuisance.
For that reason, I do not think that it is a good idea, for example, to replace the clause relating to Austrian territory as a whole with the Austrian passes, as the Council is proposing.
An arrangement should be put in place that applies to all Alpine regions, not just a couple of passes.
In my opinion - and I hail from the Netherlands, one of the countries from which transit traffic originates - this will undoubtedly result in people looking for secret routes through the Alpine region, which may then be exempted.
That will not help matters at all.
Some people say that there is no place for the ecopoint system of exemptions within the framework of freedom of movement.
I would point out that we should like to see a different system, which would apply across the board: that is to say, pricing.
This was agreed on in the White Paper, but, having now participated in the debates in this House tens of times in my four years as a Member, I do not anticipate a conclusive approach just like that in the very short term or even the longer term, and, in that context, some caution is in order.
I think that, all things considered, Parliament is going a long way in the right direction.
It is very clear that we are anxious to find a solution.
Let us then proceed to conciliation: the positions of the Council and the countries concerned still differ, as everyone is aware, and that means that we have to find a satisfactory solution in conciliation by the end of this year.
Mr President, I must say that, listening to them, I increasingly admire our Austrian fellow Members of all political persuasions.
I admire their tenacity, and their rhetorical ability in presenting the unpresentable, alas. I refer to a battle - the reasons for which I understand - which is entirely national, and has nothing to do with Europe, which on the other hand, a battle for the protection of the environment, for the protection of Europe does.
Mr Swoboda, you asked what we should make a priority.
I think we should give priority to the credibility of the European Union, to the fact that, when we go to our countries and talk to our citizens, perhaps asking them for sacrifices in various sectors, we need to be able to say that we are asking for these sacrifices because there is a higher common good, called Europe, called a community of rights, called freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the whole series of common values that we are putting in place.
If, however, we cannot go with this peace of mind and must then tell our fellow citizens that in Europe some are in Division One, and some are in Division Two, then it all gets difficult and it is the credibility of the European institution which will collapse.
The problem of living in a healthy, compatible environment is shared by all the citizens of Europe, not just Austrian citizens.
I too regret that the level of emissions is unacceptable, but I do not understand why it should be excellent for Austrian citizens, when the problem appears to be completely irrelevant for other citizens.
So, my friends, Mrs De Palacio, I do not want there to be any misunderstandings over one point: we have been fast at second reading not just because we want to go to conciliation quickly - although this was one reason too, of course - but because Parliament and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are happy with the first reading: we have nothing to change; that is our proposal - which is already a compromise proposal - and the sooner the Council realises this, the sooner we will, perhaps, manage to reach a practicable result.
Nobody is labouring under the illusion that we can move a long way from that proposal: we cannot move away from it at all.
It must be clear that the scheme will end, that the derogations will end, that the rule of law will be restored, after which we will seek for the whole Alpine region, for both sides of the Alps, to establish the precautions which will take us to 2006 by cutting emissions, because this is what we all want, but no one must be under the illusion that we can make anything other than a very few changes.
I wanted to say this, not because the Commission, from this point of view, is not well aware of all this, but because it seems that at times the Council was not.
I therefore hope that conciliation will offer us deadlines for a rapid end to an affair which we all, I repeat, want to bring to a close, but in accordance with Community law.
Mr President, attitudes close to Mr Berlusconi's lurk all over the place, including - as these developments show - in HGV transport, which is such an important sector.
Moreover, leading Members of this House are intriguing and putting about false assertions, even attempting to prevent opinions that they find disagreeable from featuring in plenary debates, and the people who advance them from being heard from the floor.
Having been promised adequate speaking time, it is thus that I am left with just one minute.
That, though, is enough for me to appeal to the citizens of Europe, who are getting a really rough deal from the EU - this time as regards the damage transport is doing to the Alps.
Instead of decisively reducing the emission of pollutants, as had always been promised before, the issue is put right to the bottom of the list in terms of its priority and of the time available for it.
In none of the major parties is there any serious support for this, and the long-overdue truth about transport costs is now scarcely mentioned, even when people get up on their soapboxes.
As I see it, we can expect nothing more from the conciliation procedure that is about to get underway.
Now, then, is the time for non-violent demonstrations; roads belong to the public, and not to the hauliers who destroy the environment and to their lobbyists!
Mr President, the European Court of Justice is rightly seen as the guardian of Community law, but also, and especially, as safeguarding and furthering the four traditional fundamental freedoms - of goods, persons, services and capital - all of which are relevant to the matter under discussion.
It was not all that long ago that the European Court of Justice had to weigh in the balance the fundamental freedoms on the one hand and, on the other, the protests by people for whom the effects of the transit routes through Austria have all become too much.
They sat down in the road and said, 'it can not go on like this'.
Like many of those who have already spoken here today, the defenders of European freedoms talked up the supreme importance of their position.
The Court of Justice saw these things differently, adducing the remarkable argument that the freedoms, though important, are not everything.
Of equal value to them, it said, were the basic rights of citizens, in this specific case the freedom to express opinions and to demonstrate, and - as can be read in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we hope is shortly to be given added weight as Part II of the European Constitution - so was the requirement that the environment be protected in general and in what are termed vulnerable regions in particular.
This obligation is to be protected, being of equal importance to European freedoms and on a level with them.
It is unfortunate that Parliament, at first reading stage, did not see it as really important that the right to free transport should be balanced against the rights of people and of the environment on transit routes.
Nearly all the Members from the fourteen Member States that are not affected insisted on their rights, aiming to do away with the transit arrangement, and the law of the jungle prevailed.
I hope, indeed I ask, that at least some of you will, when you vote tomorrow, also listen to the other side and consider their rights too.
To these Members, we Austrians have made an offer in the form of Amendments Nos 18 and 19, to which reference has already been made, in the hope that they will vote for them.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I do not believe that Mr Rack, or other Austrian Members can claim the moral high ground.
That is simply false.
If you argue along those lines, we will one day organise demonstrations to blockade Austria, preventing you from getting out and infringing our rights.
The same laws must apply to all in the Community, and it is not acceptable that the Austrians should claim privileges.
Let me give you a simple example. If you travel through Austria - to Hungary via Linz and Vienna - in terms of the topography involved, that is exactly the same as when Swedes and Danes travel to Rotterdam via Hamburg.
Do those who live in the lower-lying parts of Austria have more of an entitlement to special rules than do those in other countries through which transit routes pass?
Never could you justify such a thing!
We are all in favour of vulnerable parts of the Alps being protected, but are you entitled to have the vulnerable parts of the Austrian Alps enjoy protection different to that enjoyed by those in France or Italy?
If we are to introduce special rules for vulnerable areas, they must apply to all of them.
There is, however, no privilege for Austria on the grounds of its citizens being of more value than the citizens of Italy or France.
In moral terms, Austrians have no greater entitlement.
Mr Swoboda was right to point out that we are trying to improve the environment for everyone.
That is why, with reference to the changed charges for road use, Parliament has demanded that the burdens be more widely spread, dependent on the emission level.
The Council has not gone along with our idea of this broader spread, so now we are going through the same rigmarole with them all over again.
In December, it came up with this wretched compromise - which I will call a sham solution rather than a compromise - and, after ignoring our arguments at first reading stage, re-adopted the nonsense from December.
So it is the Council that obstructs every sensible solution!
I hope, Madam Vice-President, that you will shortly put before us a revised version of the rules on the charges for road use and that we will make distinctions along ecological lines as well.
That, though, is how rules work; we have to set uniform standards for all parts of the European Union without laying down special rules for Austria.
I therefore ask our Austrian fellow-Members to be a little more reflective.
Austria cannot get on its moral high horse when no work has been done on building the Brenner tunnel since the 1996 decision on the trans-European networks was taken.
It is just not on!
The Dutch transport minister, Mrs Karla Peijs, has recently tried to achieve a consensus with the Council - and what have we heard?
The Austrians reject anything of the sort.
Whenever there have been discussions, the Austrian transport minister has waited two days before coming out with the same old nonsense.
Along with most of the Members of this House, my plea is that we should seek the sensible compromise for which we are all ready.
Mr President, we have been arguing over this subject for ten years, and I would not miss a round, even if I had to buy a ticket to enter the House, not least in order to be able to bear witness that we are still at the same point.
The positions are identical to those of ten years ago.
It was inevitable, therefore, that we should turn to conciliation as a solution; in the meantime, however, we again find ourselves having to say 'no' to a Council proposal, which is identical to the previous one, above all because, in this proposal, not the slightest account has been taken of what has happened in Parliament, that is of the broad consensus which, at first reading, rejected any possibility of extending the ecopoints system beyond the normal expiry date fixed for 31 December this year.
On that occasion, the European Parliament once again condemned the infringement of the basic principle of the free movement of goods, while specifying not unreasonable procedures for guaranteeing transit and providing adequate protection for the environment.
We are familiar with all the technical proposals.
However, while we are here trying to reach a difficult agreement on ecopoints, what is the Governor of North Tyrol planning?
He is inventing a rule on the basis of which he will ban the transit of lorries of over seven and a half tonnes for a vast range of goods, practically all those in the construction sector, with effect from 1 August on the section between the municipalities of Kundl and Ampass: almost a joke in the debate we are having.
Fortunately, the Commission, this time, at least - congratulations, Commissioner! - took timely action: it immediately instituted an infringement procedure on 24 June, and we are now waiting to see whether there will be a judgment by the Court of Justice or whether the Tyrol will reconsider and withdraw this measure, which is directly in conflict with Article 38 of the Treaty on the free movement of goods.
However, it is important to act quickly because it is necessary to avoid another type of damage in addition to environmental damage: economic loss, which is detrimental to the interests of all haulage contractors, many of which have actually gone bankrupt in the meantime.
I live in the region immediately on the other side of the Brenner Pass, and we always wonder how on earth the Austrians can presume to command this enormous respect.
Why is it, seeing as we suffer just as much damage, that it has never occurred to any of us to invent ecopoints or strange things of that nature?
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jarzembowski, we may not hold the higher moral ground, but we do have higher mountains.
We Austrians are not asking for a solution for the coming decades ...
... but we are, quite simply, asking for a very brief transitional period until such time as the Europe-wide solution is in place, one which will, once and for all, cover the Alps as a whole.
This is not about Austria; this is about the Alps.
As an Austrian, I can say that we are very proud of what we have achieved where the environment is concerned.
We have a high level of awareness where the protection of the environment is concerned, and, with the possible exception of Switzerland, no other country in Europe lives in and with mountains to such a degree.
To quote our national anthem, we are 'a land of mountains, a land of valleys'.
We live with mountains; they are part of our soul, and we cannot live without them.
Please do not make life hell for the people who have lived on their farms in the mountain valleys for centuries.
Do not rob these people of their homeland!
The Alps belong to us all, so stop thinking only of your own countries, and think, instead, in European terms.
Remember that the Alps are our common possession, and that we want to protect them for the benefit of all.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for thinking in pan-European terms, and I implore my fellow-Members of this House to do as the Council has done; only a short space of time is involved.
And, Mr Jarzembowski, all our mountains are topped by crosses, and, although I am seventy years old, I still keep going up them, and the next time I do I will say the Our Father for you, in the hope that the Holy Ghost will enlighten you.
(Vigorous applause)
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say to the Austrian Members that we all understand their problem.
It is a political problem, a real problem and the proof is that we are discussing this initiative, which is an initiative specifically designed for Austria.
It represents an Austrian exception.
Secondly, I regret that Mrs Echerer has left, since she was talking about objective data ...
I would like to give a figure so that there is no mistake: emissions due to lorries which are subject to the ecopoints restriction have been reduced by 60%.
It is not relevant that the measurements of the emissions, which do not just relate to these lorries, but also to lorries from third countries outside the European Union and private cars and Austrian cars and lorries circulating within Austria, give a different result.
In any case, emissions from lorries subject to the ecopoints restriction have been reduced by 60%.
This is the reality and we cannot allow a situation where European Union lorries are unable to travel because third-country lorries with very high emissions are travelling and they, nevertheless, travel through Austria.
The commitment in relation to European lorries has been fulfilled.
Thirdly, we have seen once again how difficult it is to reach a consensus.
In my opinion, we must achieve one whatever the cost.
The Commission is prepared to demonstrate all the necessary flexibility and will continue trying to reach a consensus in relation to the various elements on the table, which are the interservice discussion and the modification of the 'Eurovignette' Directive which will perhaps contribute to resolving this problem.
Mr President, I just wanted to clarify something for Mr Jarzembowski's information. The Austrian Government does not reject the proposals elaborated by Mrs Peijs; I can say that, even though I am not close to the Minister.
I just wanted to clarify that.
That is all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0221/2003) by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights (15855/1/2002 - C5-0136/2003 - 2001/0305(COD)) (Rapporteur: Giorgio Lisi).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to the House the recommendation for second reading on the regulation concerning assistance and compensation to air passengers in the event of denied boarding, long delays and cancellations.
I think it would be useful briefly to summarise the developments relating to this proposal since its presentation last year.
The first reading was adopted in this House last year and it had already highlighted the weaknesses of the initial proposal by the Commission.
The main objective of the 39 amendments adopted by Parliament was to bring the regulation into line with the real needs of passengers and to make it more practicable for airlines.
Subsequently, the Council's common position, although it significantly changed the initial form of the regulation, nevertheless incorporated a large number of concerns raised by Parliament: the Council has achieved a significant amount, but a few points remain unclear, particularly given the objective which we set ourselves, which is to draw up clear, transparent rules for passengers that are, at the same time, sustainable by airlines, which, as we all know, are passing through a very difficult period.
Considering that perhaps the most thorny issue - the total amount of compensation - has been, we may say at this point, resolved to the satisfaction of almost all the Members, I will merely point out the issues that remain open which are the subject of this second recommendation.
The first concerns tour operators and their right of redress.
The outcome of the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was not, in my view, completely satisfactory, and now we have a recommendation which is partly contradictory on the subject of tour operators.
In fact, in my opinion, minimal changes are needed with regard to the definition of tourist operators and reciprocity of the right of redress - Amendments Nos 5 and 16 - but, on the whole, the Council's position has, from this point of view, put the problem in the right perspective, since it has placed overall, general responsibility on the carrier operating the service.
It is for this reason, therefore, that I cannot support Amendments Nos 1 and 9, or the second part of Amendment No 17, for which a split vote has been requested.
The second issue concerns the distance bands.
At first reading Parliament opted for a single distance criterion, in other words division into three bands of distance expressed in kilometres for compensation, delay and the placing of passengers in a higher or lower class.
In its common position, however, the Council adopted three different criteria for division, and even introduced a new criterion (inside or outside the European Union) with no clear justification.
The disparity introduced does not serve to make the legislative text clearer and certainly does not help passengers to understand their exact rights.
That is why, in this case too, we propose to combine in a single criterion these three different proposals from the Council: a single criterion, that is three distance bands for all cases.
We then come to the subject of cancellations.
I feel that the Council's proposal, which is the result of a laborious compromise, does not offer us the necessary clarity in this case either and runs the risk of considerably complicating communication with passengers.
On this matter, I take the liberty of proposing a single compromise amendment to define clearly when passengers have the right to assistance, particularly with regard to cancellation, and to lay down a single time limit - five days before the expected departure - after which passengers may benefit from financial compensation.
I would ask the House to support this position, which, as I said, attempts to make what we are trying to say clearer and easier to communicate to passengers and airlines too.
As regards delays, it is necessary to guarantee immediate assistance in the event of long delays, namely information, assistance, refreshments and possibly accommodation, whereas we believe that re-routing and reimbursement of air fares - fully justified for cancellations and denied boarding - would represent an incredible complication in the case of delays and would set off a chain reaction of delays which would paralyse air traffic.
Lastly, an amendment has been presented concerning the entry into force, which I think ought to be accepted because it makes sense: we give airlines time to get ready, and what we propose is 12 months.
In conclusion, apart from a few other minor observations on amendments which are not significant, I believe that, at this point, if we succeed in adopting this proposal, the Council may adopt a rather more constructive attitude, and this makes me confident that it will be possible to bring this dossier to a close shortly, in the interests of passengers and of the air transport sector as well.

(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Lisi, the rapporteur, on his excellent work and, in particular, on the very constructive compromise amendments he has proposed on some of the most controversial issues, which I hope will allow us to achieve a positive result in the conciliation procedure.
I am delighted that Parliament largely accepts the Council's common position, since it is a balanced text which has the objective of protecting passengers without, as a result, forgetting the interests of the industry, an industry which we know is not experiencing the best of times.
The Commission therefore supported the common position, although we would have preferred higher compensation sums, as the honourable Members are well aware.
Fortunately, Parliament is not proposing a reduction of this compensation since we believe they are at the minimum level necessary to provide air companies with the incentive to seek volunteers rather than directly preventing passengers from boarding against their will.
I would like to inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 11, relating to cancellations and delays, which simplify the text and eliminate possible application problems while at the same time offering passengers a global level of protection similar to that contained in the common position.
Will also accept Amendments Nos 12 and 14, which contribute to increasing the clarity and coherence of the text by harmonising the kilometre bands, as well as No 13 in part, and Nos 16, 19 and 20.
We cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 1 to 7, 9, 15, 17, 18 and 21.
Specifically, I would like to say that Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 9 would mean excluding passengers on package tours from the scope of the regulation.
The directive on package tourism does not offer this level of protection and to exclude package tours would lead to two different levels of protection for passengers who are facing the same difficulties and who might well be sitting next to each other.
It would be difficult to explain this to the citizens and to consumers.
In summary, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that, apart from the issue of package tours, Parliament and the Council largely share the same points of view.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Lisi for the work he has done and for having achieved these compromise amendments, which I believe will mean that this conciliation can be completed quickly.
Mr President, first of all I wish to congratulate Mr Lisi on the wonderful work he has done.
Secondly, to say that passengers, thunderstruck to learn that they cannot travel even though they have a ticket or whose flight is cancelled at the last minute, obviously need adequate legal protection from the European Union and from our legal framework.
We are taking numerous steps in this direction.
At first reading, the European Parliament took an overall position, looking at this need but also not ignoring the individual interests of the airlines and tour operators, especially at this crucial stage for both air transport and tourism.
The Council then proceeded to adopt a common position which, to some degree, takes account of the position of the European Parliament, which is why, at second reading, as the rapporteur rightly said, we are concentrating on three essential issues: first, the right to claim compensation, not only by the operating air carrier towards the tour operators or other person, but also, similarly, by anyone who has incurred expenses or suffered losses towards the operating air carrier; secondly, the deadline for notifying passengers and, thirdly, the issue of frequent flyer programmes.
There is also, however, the issue, to which the rapporteur referred, of Amendments Nos 1 and, especially 9, relating to tour operators; in other words, as to whether they are included within the framework of the directive or are treated separately.
My position on this is that, at this stage, it is better for us not to accept these amendments as passed by the Commission, because we also need to take account of the feelings of consumers, of travellers.
We cannot ignore them and I do not think that it is easy for us to explain to them why, in this particular instance, people travelling by this means should be treated differently from, that is, worse than other passengers.
Consequently, I totally agree with the rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that overbookings, cancellations and delays are particularly frequent occurrences in the summer months that lie before us, and so the news we convey will be understood by all.
It is that, in future, passengers will have greater legal certainty.
When these things happen, they will get substantially better assistance and twice as much by way of compensation, not only on regular services but also on charter flights and in respect of various services offered by travel operators.
It is, unfortunately, only next summer that this good news for passengers will be for real.
While this is, on the one hand, attributable to the difficult situation in which airlines currently find themselves, it also represents an opportunity - an opportunity to supply all passengers, in good time, with comprehensive information, comparable, for example, to the charter of passengers' rights displayed at all airports.
Perhaps the airlines will get together and set up a desk at each airport, one that would be readily recognisable and at which passengers could make claims.
After all, the best laws are of no use if they are not known about and if they cannot be implemented in a consumer-friendly way.
We are grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done.
He has always sought compromise, and has worked well with all the political groups.
We nonetheless have two points of disagreement with him.
One has to do with package flights, where it is not quite clear what he really wants.
We are convinced that they do not belong in the regulation, as they are covered by their own directive.
The second has to do with how compensation for cancellations is to be handled, where we will endorse the Council's approach, which is more consumer-friendly than what the rapporteur has proposed.
The amount paid by way of compensation should depend on the time of notification and on the extent to which the alternative flights offered differ from the original travel contract.
What might the side-effects of the regulation be?
The best thing would of course be if the cases described were to be drastically reduced in future.
If they are caused by unforeseen circumstances, additional competition between airlines might help to make them more user-friendly.
This might also mean that, in addition to the areas already referred to, indicators could also show the reliability of baggage handling and the subjective perceptions of the quality of the service that the airlines provide.
For that reason, there is a need in Europe for a ranking of user-friendliness, such as exists in the USA.
As a number of Members have said, it is indeed the case that we could do with comparable rules for all carriers, but the fact that we have not yet been able to come up with rules for other carriers is not a reason for dispensing with them in air travel.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, better passenger protection is an issue particularly close to my heart.
Nevertheless, I have had considerable reservations about this proposal for a long time now.
I have endeavoured to translate these into amendments, both now and at first reading.
It does indeed signify a great improvement for the European air passenger, but this is not the whole story.
I do not think that it wins any prizes as a model for clear legislation.
The thing that causes me great concern is that the whole aviation sector is being lumped together.
No account is taken of the differences and the business practices of the various aviation niches in the European market.
Line carriers, regional airlines, tour operators and low-cost airlines are all boxed together.
In addition, I find it particularly regrettable that the European Commission has not carried out any serious feasibility study into the implications of the measures to be introduced.
This is very strange given that the administrative burden will be enormous.
As a Liberal, I am very much in favour of liberalisation of the internal market.
Most of the companies participating in this are low-cost carriers, and it is precisely these that this regime will probably hit the hardest.
Passengers do not deserve that - as it is they that will ultimately foot the bill.
The sum of compensation ought to be proportional to the final amount paid for the ticket.
Compensation must be paid where flights are cancelled.
The extent seems to me to be particularly limited: only 10% of cancelled fights are eligible for compensation in actual fact.
I hope that we will be able to give consumers crystal-clear information, so that they know who is responsible for which compensation.
In the event of flight cancellations, passengers have the right to know when they are entitled to compensation and when they are not.
That is my main objection at the moment.
Anyone who has been paying attention in the House this week will be aware that MEPs are gradually joining the ranks of those with expertise on flight cancellations, long delays, overbooking etc. on the basis of first-hand experience.
Many passengers find themselves in confrontation with the system, and that is what is making them fed up.
Each year, in Europe alone, 250 000 people are victims of overbooking.
That is no longer acceptable, however.
In future, the loss will be subject to compensation not only in the event of denied boarding, but also in the case of cancellation and long delays, and we think that this is a very good thing.
It is even more important, however, that passengers can feel assured of their flight, and the contributions must therefore be sufficiently high to act as an incentive for companies to opt for good service instead of compensation.
We want all of this to apply not only to scheduled flights, but also to 'non-scheduled' flights.
Compensation does not apply in the case of force majeure.
Unfortunately, we find this a very vague concept.
We would have liked to link it to a definition, for example by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, so as to give it more concrete substance.
Invoking force majeure must not, after all, be a convenient way of abandoning passengers to their fate without compensation.
Of course, passengers would often consider it more important that a solution be found than compensation be paid.
In fact, similar rules should apply to all providers of transport services, then we would see a great deal fewer dissatisfied passengers on public transport.
Mr President, I would like to address an issue that is of direct concern to my constituents.
The helicopter shuttle to the Isles of Scilly provides an essential public service and is the mainstay of the islands' economy.
There is no reasonable alternative, and at times it is the only link to the mainland for such essential needs as hospital appointments, education and business.
I am sure that there must be similar operations in Europe that might be termed 'social carriers'.
I am equally sure that these regulations cannot have been intended to apply to them with the same rigour as to fully-fledged airlines.
The problem lies with mechanical breakdown.
Being a shuttle service - for which it is not economically viable to keep spare aircraft - if a breakdown occurs early in the day, all subsequent flights are affected.
The cost of compensation and assistance is expected to be so excessive that it would prejudice the economic viability of the service, which might have to be discontinued.
If this happened, it would of course have a devastating effect on all Scillonians, whether or not they actually use the service.
In the event of mechanical breakdown, there appears to be some relief afforded by Article 5, in the exemption provided for extraordinary circumstances.
However, it is not clear whether an aircraft becoming unavailable for technical reasons qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance.
I would ask the Commissioner, therefore, to make it clear that technical reasons - that is, mechanical breakdowns - which affect operational safety, qualify as extraordinary circumstances where they affect what I have termed 'social carriers': shuttle services to islands and peripheral regions.
The proviso, of course, is that routine statutory maintenance should have been fully carried out.
To that effect, I ask that a suitable definition be inserted into or attached to the regulations so as to ensure that this lifeline, along with many others, is not forced out of business.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I would very much like to express thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Lisi, for the report that he has presented, there are two problem areas that I do not want to neglect to mention.
Firstly, I thank God that the passengers are not going to have to bear the brunt of the great disputes that I can foresee, on the basis of the current rules, when it comes to defining whether an airline should or should not bear responsibility for a delay.
Early this evening, we discussed the Single European Sky.
If there are problems with the infrastructure, we are going to have disputes between the airlines, the air traffic controllers and also the companies that manage airports.
I hope that we will come up with some workable solutions.
Thank God this is not the passengers' problem, but what I can see coming is that it will be a major problem for us.
Secondly, I would like to mention package tours and tour operators.
Ever since 1990, these have been covered by a relevant directive, which offers consumers comprehensive protection, and the question arises of whether or not somebody who has booked not merely a flight, but also, and at the same time, a holiday trip, overnight stays or rooms in a hotel, needs additional protection.
I take the view that they do not need it, and I am glad that there is support for this position in this House.
Having tidied up the rules thirteen years ago, we do not need to add to them now.
Let me urge you, Commissioner, to take our experience of this lawmaking process as the basis for getting to grips with the international agreement on delays on railways, which is a disaster in terms of its practical application and is also appallingly badly transposed in the Member States, and to propose European rules for compensation payments when trains are delayed.
This is where action is urgently needed!
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Lisi on behalf the millions of airline passengers who will benefit due to his work and that of the Parliament and the Commission.
The days of waiting helplessly while airlines cancelled, delayed and overbooked flights will soon be over.
After years of letting the airlines make the rules, passengers will finally have a legal right to the standard of customer service they deserve.
Regarding the amendments, I urge colleagues to vote against Amendment No 21 from the Liberals.
They seek to cut compensation, but compensation surely recognises the level of inconvenience, not the level of the fare.
I hope colleagues will support Amendment No 2.
This extends the provision to other modes.
I thank the Commissioner for her recent letter to me confirming that she will be taking similar action for high-speed international rail journeys.
But what about international ferry journeys and international coach journeys?
Will you, Commissioner, support Amendment No 2?
On Amendment No 18 - league tables - airlines should be named and shamed for poor performance.
Commissioner, will you support that Amendment?
Finally, I would like to join my southern colleague Mr Booth and speak up for the Isles of Scilly helicopter service.
It is an example of a vital link to a group of islands, of which, of course, there are many others throughout the Community.
Can we have an assurance, Commissioner, that they will not be penalised for the inevitable technical problems that they encounter from time to time?
Mr President, this new regulation is - as has been said - very important for passengers.
It is very much awaited too, as the fierce competition between companies means the quality of services is still, it has to be said, a cause for considerable criticism.
I understand that this is not about over-regulating, but providing a clear framework for dealing with claims and compensation, because passengers are generally ill-informed of their rights in relation to powerful and influential companies, and I support the many speakers who have expressed that point of view.
I also know that those same companies are going through a difficult period, particularly since 11 September 2001.
However, I would like to ask one or two questions on the problem of refusing boarding.
Overbooking is a more correct term, even if it is not very French, because it describes the actual cause, or even the strategy of the companies in some cases, and not just the consequence.
But that is a semantic aside.
During the plenary debate at first reading, the Commission stated that this overbooking was a marginal phenomenon compared with the general flow of air passengers.
I would like to know whether we are really certain of that.
The Commission says it has figures close to 250 000 passengers refused in 1999, that is, 1.1 per thousand.
I am simply wondering about the reliability of these statistics as they are, I suppose, provided by the companies themselves.
The reason I am asking these questions is that I had a problem less than a month ago on a Nice to Brussels flight with SN Brussels Airlines.
Without going into details, as this is not the place, there were six of us on the flight - a regular flight - who were overbooked, while my husband and my 7-year old son, who had the same tickets and booked at the same time with the same agency, boarded the plane.
One case among 250 000 others, I imagine.
That this is a company strategy - and, of course, it is not the only company to do this - was confirmed to me by the ground staff at the airport and by many consumer associations.
I am therefore not so certain that this phenomenon is as marginal as that and I can only welcome, like other speakers before me, the increase, in this new regulation, in the protection of passengers' rights.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The regulation under consideration aims to protect air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. The proposal we are debating, however, does not fully comply with that objective, and the amendments tabled weaken the Council common position, which was already, in some ways, a retrograde step in relation to the Commission's proposal.
We are aware of the transitory problems currently being experienced by air carriers, and for that reason we feel we must find a balanced solution.
We do not feel, however, that those problems justify excluding passengers on package tours from the scope of the protection provided by this regulation, or reducing the protection offered them in the event of cancellation of flights, or removing the opportunity for passengers to exercise their right to reimbursement or re-routing in the event of long delay of flights.
We realise that there are 'extraordinary circumstances' under which one may be led to conclude that air carriers are not always responsible for delayed or cancelled flights.
Such 'circumstances', however, should be specifically limited to meteorological or safety problems, so as to prevent passengers' interests being harmed for purely economic or commercial reasons.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0220/2003) by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system ('Marco Polo Programme') (5327/1/2003 - C5-0225/2003 - 2002/0038(COD)) (Rapporteur: Philip Charles Bradbourn).
Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising for Mr Bradbourn's absence from this debate.
Due to health reasons he cannot join us and, therefore, I am reading, on his behalf, the speech he prepared earlier.
I know he is extremely proud of being the rapporteur for the Marco Polo Programme and is looking forward to its passing through Parliament later this week.
As he reiterated in committee earlier this month, he felt that the three institutions were not far from agreement, and a close inspection of the common position proves this.
Indeed, from Parliament's perspective, the two outstanding points that he felt needed to be discussed were resolved in the informal trialogue.
Due to the success of the informal trialogue he felt that there was no need for a new, lengthy debate on the programme, which passed unopposed through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at its last meeting.
As Mr Bradbourn has reiterated on many occasions during the formulation of this programme, it must strike a balance, and he firmly believes this common position would do just that.
To bury business in yet more red tape would, in his eyes, be completely the wrong approach, notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how the money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be.
The common position will mean that the programme remains market-driven, thus providing an excellent opportunity to show that the European Union is prepared to help not hinder business, as is often the case.
As I am sure you are all aware, the threshold issue is something Mr Bradbourn has been fighting for vehemently, not just on behalf of the numerous small and medium-sized businesses in his own region of the West Midlands of England, but for SMEs in general, which, if it were not for these low thresholds would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme.
As rapporteur, his view was that by lowering the thresholds companies could work together in putting forward innovative projects that would benefit transport and, indeed, industry as a whole.
By keeping the original thresholds, small businesses would have once again been ignored by Europe which, it would seem, is merely interested in showcase schemes which, while looking good, do not benefit the people who paid for them - us or the taxpayers.
The immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme are improving the environmental performance of the freight transport system and also reducing road congestion in albeit a relatively small way.
Your rapporteur justifiably believes that this lowering of thresholds is extremely important in obtaining these goals.
His last point merely reinforces one of the main aims of this whole proposal: to reduce bottlenecks.
He agreed originally with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector.
He still feels it imperative that we concentrate on practical ways to defuse these bottlenecks, especially at ports.
Regarding the implementation of this programme, the last thing Mr Bradbourn wants is to unnecessarily hold up the legislative process.
As you will all agree, this programme is not only another piece of legislation; it is a significant signal to Europe's freight businesses that we can, and indeed we want, to help rather than hinder them.
The sooner the Marco Polo Programme becomes active, the better for Europe's transport sector.
Thus, given the outcome of this common position and its unopposed endorsement from members of the Committee on Transport, the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, believes we can progress towards the second reading of the Marco Polo Programme without the need for wholesale change.
As a final remark, he would, however, reiterate the necessity of our open approach: the carrot rather than the stick, designed to encourage both the participation of, and leadership by, the business community.
I apologise again for Mr Bradbourn's unavoidable absence.
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to express my gratitude for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, and for the speech by Mr Dover, who is replacing the rapporteur for this presentation to plenary.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like, in general, to thank Parliament for its constructive attitude, which, thanks to a tripartite and informal meeting which took place last November, has allowed us to reach an agreement which will mean that we can implement the Marco Polo programme quickly with a contribution of EUR 75 million in four years.
This project must facilitate the development of intermodality within the European Union.
Intermodality is absolutely essential if we want to make our transport systems more effective and efficient.
Intermodality consists of overcoming the unimodal approach to transport and taking account of all the different systems and modes in order to optimise the resources and possibilities we have within the European Union in order to achieve efficient transport.
Thanks to this programme we will be able to finance, amongst other things, the first sea motorway projects, which are already under way with agreements between Italy, France and Spain in the western Mediterranean area, and other projects of this nature in the Atlantic area, together with other projects relating to the combination of inland waterways and rail transport and, finally, also of sea and road transport of course.
I would like once again to express my thanks for the work done.
I believe it is a good text, that we have achieved a reasonable and balanced result and what we now need to do is to promote, through this and all the other measures, a competitive and efficient transport system which is at the service of economic efficiency and the development of growth.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for support under the Marco Polo instrument to be made available to European actors in the field of freight transport; the sense of urgency with which this is awaited is demonstrated by the large number of applications submitted in response to what was a small-scale announcement.
By precisely targeting specific objects of assistance, the support programme aims to bring about the transfer of goods from the roads to more environmentally friendly means of transport.
As part of this project to transfer traffic, for example, it was possible to give support to a barge service taking cargo to the Czech Republic from Magdeburg or from Hamburg.
The catalyst actions call for particularly creative responses to structural obstacles.
In my view, they should trigger huge demand, above all in rail transport, where - as is well known - the obstacles are numerous.
This means that Marco Polo is a good addition to the railway packages that we have introduced.
In view of the urgent need for cross-border consultation on common priorities for the removal of obstacles, I could well imagine the third area for support - common learning actions - including the corridor conferences that Parliament has been demanding for so long.
The fact that there is demand from so many quarters shows, of course, that the money will not be sufficient, and nor are we likely to achieve the objective of stabilising the 1998 modal split.
It is fortunate that our request, that projects from the future Member States be included already, has been complied with.
One does not have to be a prophet to be able to foresee the re-emergence of the issues of environmental compatibility and sustainability on the transport policy agenda at the time of the forthcoming elections.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, on behalf of my group, for drafting this report so excellently and with such resolve.
There is a vital need to reduce congestion and improve the freight transport system, especially from the point of view of the environment, as the volume of traffic grows.
EU enlargement will also bring new challenges, when transportation routes get longer.
Our group supports the Marco Polo programme and is satisfied with the Council's common position.
The EU can bring added value by supporting innovative and new technology projects.
The aim must be to switch from the forms of transport that cause the most pollution to the other most environmentally friendly forms.
No form of transport, however, should be excluded from the programme.
A diverse range of transport should also be involved, and that could include road transport too.
In my opinion, it is important that, along with the new actions, we are able to support the improvement of existing work.
Improvements may often be achieved here through a more efficient cost-benefit ratio rather than by embarking on an entirely new project.
By concentrating on just new projects the danger of competition distortions in relation to the old measures is an obvious one.
It has been agreed in the common position that minimum thresholds should be halved regarding all categories of action.
That would also enable the realisation of innovative projects jointly undertaken by smaller companies, such as SMEs.
The programme's budget is quite modest and the objective very ambitious.
I think it is important, however, that the regulation is now approved and that the first projects are got under way by the autumn.
In the longer term it is to be hoped that Marco Polo will prove worthwhile and acquire additional financing.
In addition we have to explore opportunities to increase financing for important projects that supplement the trans-European transport network.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing today with the Marco Polo programme, aimed at reducing traffic congestion and contributing to a more effective and sustainable transport system.
We are going to vote in favour of the text proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but we cannot say that we are completely satisfied with it.
Firstly, because the economic contribution we requested has been reduced by the Council of Ministers from EUR 115 million to EUR 75 million, a reduction which we believe is going to prevent us from achieving the objective of transferring the expected total annual increase in international goods transport by road to other alternative modes of transport, and this increase is expected to be in the order of 50% up until 2010.
To this end, and according to the data in the White Paper on transport, the railways and ships should absorb an extra 39% in terms of tonnes of goods per kilometre than it currently does, which when added to its own trend of increase, which is now 29%, would mean a 68% total increase in its capacity for traffic, which I do not believe can be financed with the reduced budget.
If, as the Commission points out, with one euro of subsidy 500 tonnes could be transferred, with the EUR 75 million allowed by the Council, 37 500 tonnes per kilometre could be transferred, rather than the 52 250 million tonnes per year by which road transport is expected to increase.
In other words, the objectives of the Marco Polo programme could not be achieved.
Neither are we pleased about the fact that the possibility of funding actions for the reduction and prevention of goods transport by road, without necessarily implying transfer to other modes, has not been included.
We believe it is possible to act during the stages prior to the loading of lorries, for example, by promoting a more compact form of packaging of goods so that they take up less space and require fewer lorries.
And finally, although this may be the subject of a different proposal, we believe that it is also necessary to consider reflecting on the current model of production and distribution of goods.
If we truly incorporate, without a single exception, all the external costs of transport, perhaps we will reach the conclusion that we should reconsider our theory of economy of scale in production and of the benefits of its concentration.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the report (A5-0223/2003) by Herman Vermeer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle and amending Directive 70/156/EEC (COM(2003) 67 - C5-0054/2003 - 2003/0033(COD)).
. (ES) Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Vermeer for his work, as well as the rapporteurs for the committees involved, Mr Staes and Mr Harbour, for their efforts to ensure that this proposal could be produced quickly.
A year ago, the European Parliament presented to Commissioner Liikanen its opinion on the Commission's Communication of July 2001.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur on that occasion, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, and all the Members of the European Parliament for the efforts they have put in to this issue.
In its resolution, the European Parliament essentially made two requests: firstly, with regard to form, Parliament called for framework legislation to be proposed in this field, including a clear and realistic timetable for the application of mid-term and final objectives, as well as the methods for monitoring its application; secondly, with regard to content, it requested, as a long term objective, the application as from 2010 of the four tests recommended by the European Enhanced Safety Vehicle Committee or other tests which would offer the same level of protection for pedestrians.
The Commission's proposal for a Directive of 19 February this year is intended to respond to Parliament's wishes.
The report by Mr Vermeer does not actually question the central elements of that Commission proposal.
The amendments he proposes clarify or improve the text.
Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 7 insist that the proposal is one element of a broader range of measures needed to guarantee a high level of protection for pedestrians, which includes active safety measures and changes to infrastructures.
The Commission agrees with and accepts these suggestions.
Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8 and 16 are intended to clarify that the problem of pedestrian protection can be dealt with through passive safety measures or combining active and passive safety measures, and we also accept these amendments because we share the rapporteur's approach.
I can say the same with regard to Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 11, which refer to the application of the directive, obliging the Commission to inform the legislator with regard to the monitoring of that directive within a specified time period and specifying the comitology procedure to be followed with a view to the modification of the directive if that modification is restricted to introducing passive safety measures.
Finally, we accept Amendment No 4, which requests that the Commission examine the viability of extending the scope of the Directive to vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes in the future.
In summary, the Commission accepts all the amendments presented by the Committee on Transport, as well as Amendment No 16.
However, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18.
Given the importance of this proposal to road safety and the timetable laid down for the application of the tests, as well as the consultation on the possible initiatives in the field of protecting pedestrians which preceded this proposal, the Commission hopes that it will be approved at first reading.
Mr President, I would once again like to thank Mr Vermeer and all the honourable Members for their work.
, rapporteur.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, personally, I am happy that the report was ready for presentation as soon as today, and therefore I must give particular thanks to everyone who dedicated themselves to this.
I shall try to be as concise as during the procedure.
The result builds on Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report from last year in Parliament, which called for the adoption of a regulation on voluntary agreements between the European Commission and the automobile industry as framework legislation.
The report emphasises that the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) test method should, above all, be a dynamic test method.
This is an important position: particularly if we are talking about enacting legislation whose aim is complete compliance with this test method, the method must also be kept flexible.
I think that, between us, we have succeeded in this.
The emphasis must continue to be on passive safety measures.
Active measures, and a combination of active and passive measures, however, must remain an option in this proposal, so that it offers even more guarantees of safety than the method currently laid down.
The outcome of the independent technical feasibility study next year, for which the European Commission recently issued an invitation to tender, will be important.
By July of next year it must be clear to what extent car manufacturers are obliged to implement the EEVC test method.
I do not wish to take on board the extra amendments now on the table, therefore, because they put under pressure the compromise adopted with an overwhelming majority by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
In my opinion, the speed of the process is particularly significant.
We were able to achieve today's result in a little over two months.
I should also like to endeavour to see to it that this first reading is the last.
The contact we have had with the European Commission, and also the informal contact with the Council, indicate that we could be in a position not only to run through the procedure quickly, but also to conclude it smoothly here, so that we can very quickly set about effecting real improvement in road safety.
Our responsibility extends to the models of cars.
In addition to this, we have fortunately been able to demand attention to the road infrastructure and also to the behaviour of the traffic users themselves.
That is not our responsibility, but it merits a proper mention.
I also welcome the Commissioner's statement, also on behalf of her fellow Commissioner, that she agrees to our joint request for the introduction of supplementary legislation for the category of motor vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes.
I think that it is particularly important that we do not come to a standstill, but that we also emphasise and improve that safety aspect.
It does not apply here, because the test method proposed has been tested on vehicles in the category up to 2 500 kg for 20 years.
That is why we on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have endeavoured to reach a compromise, as proposed by a number of colleagues, on precisely this kind of point, so as not to delay this process; whilst also looking ahead to safety in the future.
In short, we have seen a very successful process, especially as everyone was prepared to be generous in their cooperation.
I should like to express my thanks for this.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough piece of work, a reanalysis of a proposal that Mrs Hedkvist Petersen handled so capably some months ago and in which I was also involved.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report and also with Mr Vermeer, has given a lot of support to the approach the Commission has taken.
We did not feel it was necessary to table any substantive amendments to the framework directive because we felt that it covered the strategy that Parliament had laid down.
Mr Vermeer has made some worthwhile improvements, but without in any way altering the substance of it.
That is important and I agree with his analysis that we should not support the other amendments.
I am delighted that the Commission is accepting those so we can move ahead as quickly as possible.
I would like to make one or two comments on our two proposed amendments, one of which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was kind enough to accept, and also some broader points about the whole proposal.
First of all the recital that we proposed focuses very much on the importance of active safety measures, working with passive safety measures, in delivering the overall safety improvements that we want.
There have been enormous improvements in the technology over the past few months since we first looked at this.
I declare an interest in this in that I am an automotive engineer and I have driven some of the cars with that technology.
It is important to emphasise the practical nature of this.
If we have technologies that will reduce collision speeds by sensing impending impacts, or even alter the direction of the impact, it will make a very substantial improvement.
There are some people in this House who seem to think that the requirements are somehow a pushover.
I just want to conclude by relating a recent experience when I went to the Young Designers Exhibition at Coventry University to see what young designers were looking at in car designs for the future.
It will interest colleagues from this committee to know that many of those young designers were designing pedestrian-friendly cars but, in order to meet the EEVC Stage II tests, the only way they could meet those requirements was by putting the engine at the back of the car so as to leave enough crush space at the front.
Anybody who thinks that these Stage II tests are a pushover, or are easily attainable with current technology, needs to take a serious look at what is going on in the industry and not sit in this House drawing up unrealistic amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, not always does the Commission make use of its opportunities to comply with the demands of the overwhelming majority in the European Parliament to such an extent as it has done with this framework directive.
For this I wish to express my gratitude to the Commission, but also to the rapporteur, Mr Vermeer, for his report, which helps to clarify the substance of the matter.
If we who sit in this Parliament want people to carry on believing in us and trusting us, then we should stand by the demands we made with reference to the commitment made by the European, Japanese and Korean motor industries and not make new ones over and above them.
Now that we have the framework directive that we demanded at that time, we have the legal certainty that we called for, and we will continue to have an influence on any further significant development, while, at the same time giving the motor industry the time and technical resources that it needs to get things done.
We are, moreover, allowing it some leeway when it comes to researching innovative measures of active and passive safety that can be even more effective and efficient.
At the end of the day, this is about protecting people and not just reducing the consequences of accidents, but preventing them, and this is not just about using certain technologies and procedures - expensive and developed with the best of intentions though these may be.
We will thereby be being particularly responsive to the public interest.
Right up to the last moment, there was dispute about whether the EEVC's four test procedures should be prescribed by law as the sole solution.
There is no doubt that, even by today's standards, these tests appear to be the most effective and the most cost-efficient, as well as to be the only ones available, but this is where criticism has to start.
It would seem that a development has been missed out on, as these tests concern themselves more with the protection of vehicles' occupants than with that of road users put at risk by the vehicles.
Even consumers have a one-sided awareness of these things. They are increasing willing to pay for their safety as vehicle users, but demonstrably less willing to spend more on protecting pedestrians and the users of bicycles, wheelchairs and skateboards.
This has to be the starting-point for a rethink, and one might well be sparked off, and accompanied, by a European campaign.
We in this House must neither stand in the way of the EEVC tests being further developed on the basis of practice, nor fundamentally reject the development of alternative procedures that offer at least as much protection.
For example, in other, very sensitive, areas such as air and space travel, methods of virtual simulation came in a long time ago.
Why, in future, should not such testing methods, and others like them - for we are talking about the post-2010 period - not bring even more safety?
Let us, by an overwhelming majority, secure the speedy implementation of the directive and thereby save human lives!
Mr President, thank you, Mr Vermeer for your sound cooperation, as rapporteur, on this report.
I am extremely pleased that, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have been able to help bring about the compromises required to produce the amendments that are before us and that I now hear the Commission is prepared to accept, something that I am also extremely pleased about.
Road safety is important to the European Parliament, a fact that is clear from this report.
Our task is to look after road users' interests but also to make sure that we obtain laws that enable industry to produce safety products, a consideration now evident from this directive.
I am extremely pleased that the Third Road Safety Action Programme has come about.
I think there are a lot of interesting aspects to it, and I am looking forward to being able to continue debating it here in Parliament.
The programme has been very much influenced by the road safety debate we have had in Parliament in recent years.
There has been lengthy discussion of the protection of pedestrians.
In Parliament, we have spent a year and a half conducting a debate both in the committee and in the Chamber.
This has now resulted in the directive we requested last summer.
We really did try to enable all the parties to contribute to our obtaining cars that are as safe as possible for unprotected road users.
We established frameworks for the objectives and the implementation, and we emphasised the role of the European Parliament in following up this issue of road safety.
Now, we have obtained the directive, and we see that there is an opportunity to use both passive and active measures to promote the protection of pedestrians.
Independent investigations of the progress made are to be carried out, and the European Parliament is to have the right of codecision if there are major changes to the directive.
Then, there are also committee amendments concerning sports cars: the large cars that we know are extremely dangerous and to which the Commission has also drawn attention in its road safety programme.
I am extremely pleased with the compromises that have been tabled.
I think it good that we should open the way for active measures, but we must not abandon the passive ones.
