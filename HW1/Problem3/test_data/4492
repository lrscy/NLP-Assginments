And if we involve ourselves in removing the imperative to export military material then we may force the incoming Bush administration to reconsider its apparent blind commitment to national missile defence with the threat to world peace and stability that poses.
I would like to congratulate President Kim Dae-Jung of the Republic of Korea on his commitment to the sunshine policy which will allow the normalisation of inter-Korean relations and welcome Kim Jong Il's positive response.
Dialogue is the way forward.
Europe should pursue this not only because it is currently the policy of the Republic of Korea but because it is the right way to go.
Our advantage is that we are not Japan or the United States and we can act as honest brokers in this most dangerous area of the world.
Mr President, it would appear that the hopes raised by the June Summit between the two Kims from North and South Korea are not going to be fulfilled. The optimism is fading.
North Korea is finding it difficult to make good those few, largely symbolic commitments it made in the military field, it is delaying the reunification of families who were separated by the war and have remained so for 50 years and it is showing no sign of intending to make the return visit of Kim Jong Il to Seoul, planned for spring this year, a practical reality, and it is not yet known when or whether this will take place.
President Clinton's decision not to go to North Korea, even though he wanted to in order to finish his presidency with a historic visit, could now mean a long pause in Korea's process of opening up to the outside world.
In spite of this, I hear tones of optimism and I see European countries queuing up - Mr Brok touched on the issue just now - and falling over themselves in the rush to recognise the Stalinist Pyongyang regime, turning a blind eye to what goes on in the country, to the tragic violations of human rights.
Therefore, I say: yes, certainly, let us encourage rapprochement between the two Koreas; of course we must provide assistance for the North Koreans to save them from starving to death - Mr Ford mentioned this just now - but, at the same time, we must lay down stringent conditions to ensure that the aid reaches the places where it is genuinely needed and does not serve to support a paranoid, unpredictable regime which is wont to resort to the threat of missiles and nuclear arms to ensure its survival.
Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for the valuable interventions that have been made in this discussion on the important issue of the European Union' s relationship with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea.
Allow me just to make a few brief concluding remarks.
It is gratifying that an agreement has now been made within the European Union to make a better attempt to coordinate the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
A number of EU Member States, including my own country, have had diplomatic relations with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea the whole time. Others have recently decided to establish relations, while a further group is waiting to take a decision on establishing relations.
I personally believe that a diplomatic presence is of great importance.
Twenty years ago, I myself had the opportunity to serve in Pyongyang and know what it means to be confronted directly with the reality of that country.
I would also remind you of the statement made by South Korea' s President Kim Dae Young on his visit to Stockholm in connection with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
He made a public appeal at that time for a more important role for the European Union where the situation on the Korean peninsula is concerned.
I believe we must take his appeal seriously.
We should be prepared also to respond to this type of appeal when the time is right.
It is important for us to agree within the European Union about what we are to do when we adopt a position on such measures.
We ought to have an agreed view on to what extent there are reasonable opportunities of making progress in what we are doing, and it is obviously also important for conditions in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to be such that it makes sense to do something.
Thank you, Minister.
I must inform you that I have received a motion for a resolution under Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
I propose adjourning the sitting.
We shall resume at noon for the voting.
(The sitting was adjourned at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)
VOTE
Mr President, our group, as you know, did not vote for the SjÃ¶stedt report in committee.
We would support it here, however, if Amendments Nos 5 and 6 were adopted.
We have discussed this with the other groups.
In the case of Amendment No 5, I am informed that other groups would be able to support the amendment if two linguistic alterations were made.
The first is the replacement of the word 'review' by the word 'examination' as the English translation of the German ÃberprÃŒfung; this is only a linguistic adjustment.
The second, however, would be an oral amendment.
We ask that the word Rechtssicherheit in the German version of Amendment No 5 be replaced by the word Klarheit and that the English term 'legal certainty' be accordingly replaced by the word 'clarification'.
May I ask you to note this oral amendment and to put the adjusted version of Amendment No 5 to the vote.
Mr President, I am prepared to support those amendments that have just been proposed concerning Amendment No 5, because the proposal including these changes is significantly better than the original version.
I would therefore encourage MEPs to approve the oral amendments which Mr Liese tabled from the Group of the European People' s Party.

Before the vote
Mr President, I want to propose a technical oral amendment to Amendment No 28.
I apologise for not spotting the technicality in committee.
Amendment No 28 reads at present: "The Community shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation."
As Commissioner Patten pointed out during the debate, it is not the "Community" which sets the budgetary ceiling, it is the Budgetary Authority.
I should like to propose orally that we delete the word "Community" and insert instead the words "Budgetary Authority", so that the amendment would now read: "The Budgetary Authority shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation."

Report (A5-0338/2000) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of frontier workers [2000/2010(INI)]
After paragraph 2
Mr President, I would like to correct an apparent slip of the pen by means of an oral amendment.
I would point out that only 'the country of employment principle' is referred to in the paragraph, when it should read 'the country of residence or employment principle' because of course I cannot determine what choice the Commission has to make, it must do that for itself.
But I would like to add 'the country of residence or employment principle' , twice.
Before Amendment No 6
Mr President, it has been agreed with the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, that when it comes to Amendment No 2 of Paragraph 6, we should regard this amendment as an addition to the original paragraph.
This means, therefore, that if Amendment No 2 is approved, the original paragraph will also have to be put to the vote.
Mr President, I would suggest we vote on Amendment No 6 first, and then on the original paragraph two, because that would be a more logical way of proceeding.
After the vote on Amendment No 6
Mr President, I would now like us to vote on the paragraph all the same.
After the vote on paragraph 6
Mr President, you mentioned that I had signed that motion on behalf of the Liberal Group.
I want to make it absolutely clear that this is a mistake, or if it is not a mistake, it is some mischievous prank by the dirty tricks department of the Liberal Party.
I was born a Conservative and I trust that I will die a Conservative.
(Applause)
We would never have thought otherwise.
It was a mistake on the part of the services.
Mr President, I would like to make it just as clear that although my first name is Bertel, I have not become a Lord.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Motion for a resolution (B5-0037/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- SjÃ¶stedt report (A5-0387/2000)
.
(FR) We think the report presented by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the protection of natural habitats in Europe is particularly important, especially for France, as this is one of the countries where the implementation of the Habitats Directive, which is now over eight years old, and the Wild Birds Directive, which is now over 20 years old - as well as the establishment of the Natura 2000 Network - has suffered the greatest delays, to the point that it has been seriously compromised.
Yet, the more time that passes, the more the (semi-) natural habitats are destroyed, and the more difficult it becomes to preserve or to re-establish the ecosystems in all their diversity and richness.
Far from being "marginal" , the need to maintain and promote biodiversity (and hence the diversity of the ecosystems) stands out as a political issue of prime importance, with universal implications for our living conditions (including for climate change).
It is not a matter of setting up localised "reserves" where species would be protected as if they were in a museum, but of incorporating environmental concerns in all Community and Member State policy.
The implementation of the Habitats and Wild Birds Directives must henceforth be implemented speedily and effectively across the board.
.
(NL) The VU&ID (Flemish People' s Union) MEPs Nelly Maes and Bart Staes did not support the amendments tabled by the ELDR and PPE-DE Groups in relation to the habitat directive.
We regard these amendments as an attempt to undermine the existing habitat directive.
We would point out that the existing habitat directive affords the government sufficient opportunity to step in when the implementation of existing projects is hampered by the habitat provisions.
After all, Article 6 (4) of Directive 92/43/EC states: "If, in spite of a negative assessment of the implications for the site and in the absence of alternative solutions, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, the Member State shall take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected.
It shall inform the Commission of the compensatory measures adopted."
The VU&ID MEPs have since submitted a parliamentary question to the Commission, asking it to provide an overview of all the notifications it has received in this matter since the directive came into force.
I am in total agreement with the Habitats Directive and its objectives in terms of protecting the endangered outstanding natural heritage of the countries of the European Union.
This heritage and its biological and genetic diversity are the planet' s most precious assets and we must indeed ensure that they are protected, reproduced and handed down to future generations.
Even so, I voted against the SjÃ¶stedt report for two crucial reasons.
Firstly, it is unacceptable to blackmail European appropriations allocated to our countries by making them conditional, in article 11, upon compliance with the Habitats Directive as it stands.
If it were simply a matter of ensuring that European funds are not used to finance projects destroying these outstanding ecosystems, then I should have endorsed the resolution and voted in favour of it, but it is unacceptable and unprecedented to make a European Union policy conditional upon compliance with another and that social conditions should be subject, for example, to environmental conditions.
My second reason is that the resolution does not clarify the concept of "disturbance" and the legal discussion, which is so deliberately vague that legal battles could be revived, which might lead to bans on traditional hunts where these are authorised under the Birds Directive and the subsidiary law in the states.
It is precisely because the European Union deliberately maintains this ambiguity that some countries experience problems in issuing their "Nature 2000" lists and in implementing the Habitats Directive calmly, without resistance on the part of the farmers in those countries, even though everyone acknowledges the noble nature of the objectives of the directive.
Cunha report (A5-0367/2000)
Mr President, last summer I went on holiday to Guinea-Bissau, and, as is my wont, I exchanged a few words with one of the local elderly pensioners, or rather with a fisherman from Guinea-Bissau would have dearly loved to have become a pensioner.
Having been told that I am the representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party, he complained to me: "I go out to sea to fish, I work whenever it is possible and I would like to work many days so that I can have a pension as well.
However, unfortunately, because our sea is fished by European Union fishing boats, I cannot find enough work to contribute to a pension, and I do not see anything of the European Union financing allocated to the Government of Guinea-Bissau for the Government does not give me anything at all".
I therefore voted for the report, but on condition that things improve in future.
This report and its amendments deal with financial support to Guinea-Bissau in the fisheries sector.
Despite our many reservations, we voted in favour of them out of solidarity with the people of that country, especially its fishermen.
Firstly, because the objective of the fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries are, as is explicitly stated in some other reports, intended to spare European Union fisheries resources and, consequently, to increase catches from the waters of other countries.
Next, because we do not know exactly how this aid will be used and what its precise ultimate destination will be.
Unfortunately, however, too much of this aid is often nothing more than a de facto rebate granted to the European companies investing in these countries.
Moreover, such aid is often also misappropriated by the local administration.
Despite all that, at the end of the day, this money, which is supposed to assist the local people, will, even so, be better employed over there than the money given to major employers over here who are shedding jobs.
Van den Bos report (A5-0360/2000)
Mr President, after staying in Guinea-Bissau for a fortnight last summer, I went on to Bangladesh, where I did not stay very long for it is not a very wealthy State.
I approached an elderly man there as well, and he, aware that I am the representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party, asked me: "But what is a pension?"
Sadly, Mr President, the people of Bangladesh are so badly off that they do not even know the meaning of the word "pension".
So I said to myself: "When the Van den Bos document is put to the vote, remember to vote for the motion, Fatuzzo, but also remember that we ought to monitor the transaction and ensure that the aid given to the people of Bangladesh through this agreement also serves to provide a pensioner or two with a State pension".
The Committee on Development and Cooperation welcomes the fact that the rate of growth of Bangladesh' s export industry is thrice that of the country' s domestic production.
These exports, however, are almost exclusively the work of the major companies, mostly Western, which have set up factories in this country.
While there is no doubt that these firms are getting rich by exploiting the underpaid workers of this country, including children, this is not about to enable Bangladesh to emerge from its underdeveloped state or to enable its working population to escape poverty.
The report calls for an increase in "the efficiency and competitiveness of the private sector" on world markets.
This is a clear indication of who it hopes to benefit from the elimination of the "infrastructure bottlenecks" , especially "transport and energy infrastructure" , as well as making "the financial system efficient" , or ensuring "a transparent and accountable institutional environment" , a euphemism for taking action to penalise anyone who, in the widespread corruption, upsets the Western investors.
In these circumstances, the proposal to release European funds is chiefly targeted at supplementing the shortfalls of the Bangladeshi State and at having the European institutions bear the costs of the development of infrastructure that the large corporations need in order to enable them to derive most profit from one of the poorest peoples in the world.
.
I am pleased to join with our colleagues in the Development Committee in adding my full support for the Commission' s proposal for a new Cooperation Agreement with Bangladesh.
This new agreement is a further sign of our continuing wish to strengthen our relations with Bangladesh.
I hope it will leave the way open for the Bangladesh government to also intensify their efforts to develop the potential of SAARC as a further means of boosting the economy and creating jobs in the region.
The report by Mr Van den Bos and the Miranda resolution clearly set out the main characteristics of the Bangladesh economy and the many challenges facing the government, its institutions, its politicians and its people.
Bangladesh is one of the poorest developing countries.
Almost half of its population of 127 million people is living below the poverty line.
It has lived with and is constantly faced with the dangers of flooding and cyclones.
Despite this, it has managed to show some improvement in the standard of living over the past 25 years.
Economic reforms in the 1990s have recorded significant achievements with GDP, on average, rising to 4.8% during the 1994-1999 period.
Bangladesh is very dependent on foreign aid.
The EU is a major provider of aid-17% of all funds.
The EU is its biggest trading partner.
In 1998 we imported 45% of its exports.
Bangladesh has a trade surplus with the EU.
Almost a billion euros have been provided by the EU since 1976 for EU-financed projects: EUR 660 million were provided for food and humanitarian aid; EUR 185 million were provided for the alleviation of poverty and for agriculture.
I fully endorse the objectives of the EU-financed programmes to: Help raise the incomes and improve the food security of the poor; help to improve access of very poor women and children to quality health and public health services; improve the access of these children to education.
This is of fundamental importance to the future of Bangladesh.
I was particularly pleased that Bangladesh joined the ILO' s programme for the abolition of child labour in 1984 and that Â« significant progress Â» has been recorded since then.
I welcome these efforts and look forward to further progress in this regard.
I want to fully endorse the main objectives of the agreement, namely: support for sustainable economic development, especially as regards the poorest in society, women and children.
The Development Committee' s resolution stresses the importance of the up-coming general election in Bangladesh in November of this year.
The European Union should respond favourably to the invitations received from both the government and the opposition to send election monitors as was the case in the 1996 and 1991 general elections.
I hope that members of the European Parliament will form part of the team.
Newton Dunn report (A5-0392/2000)
Mr President, I certainly voted against Amendment No 9 about creating a European rapid reaction facility.
I nonetheless voted in favour of the report as a whole because I think it good that the European Parliament should once again make it clear that the EU ought to give priority to non-military crisis management measures.
That is an important observation that cannot be repeated often enough.
Against that background, I note that the justification, in any case, refers to the European Parliament' s unanimous recommendation to establish a civil peace corps.
I think it is good for that to be repeated.
That too cannot be repeated often enough.
Unfortunately, the countries holding the presidency - Finland, Portugal and France - chose not to pay any attention to the European Parliament' s unanimous recommendation.
Against that background, I think that the Swedish Presidency has a brilliant opportunity to take the initiative.
I have on a number of occasions had occasion to suggest this directly to Foreign Minister Lindh and Prime Minister Persson.
Unfortunately, however, it would appear that the Swedish Government has not properly understood what is meant by a civil peace corps but believes that other measures under way are the same as a civil peace corps.
It is unfortunate that it does not want to study the report properly and that it does not respect the European Parliament's point of view by at least doing something.
I hope that this is a misunderstanding between myself and the Swedish Government.
In spite of our having discussed this many times, misunderstandings may of course arise.
I therefore wish to take the opportunity to challenge the Swedish Government once again.
Now that Sweden has the Presidency of the Council, it should, if it is serious about the EU' s not becoming a military superpower but a factor for peace, immediately ensure that an initiative is taken in accordance with the European Parliament' s recommendation for a civil peace corps.
Mr President, what is the Rapid Reaction Mechanism?
I asked myself this question when, upon my arrival in hospital to have my foot put in plaster, I saw some doctors knocking a small hammer against the knee of a patient, which immediately jerked upwards.
But then, as I examined this morning's documents, I realised that the Rapid Reaction Mechanism is a major financial initiative which will make it possible for Europe to intervene swiftly and immediately in order to take peace to places where peace is under threat.
This is a commendable undertaking, and I therefore voted for the report, but I fear that it may be too ambitious for us to implement since we do not yet have a genuinely united Europe.
- (DA) We have voted in favour of the report because the intentions behind non-military crisis management are sound.
At the same time, however, we would emphasise that it is in practice impossible to separate desirable civil intervention from unacceptable military intervention.
Moreover, we call upon initiatives to be carried out through international organisations such as the UN, the Council of Europe or the OSCE.
.
(FR) Given that rapid police intervention is, like war, the continuation of politics by other means, and in view of the fact that we have no more confidence in European Union policy than we do in that of Member States, we are opposed to any form of military or police intervention by the European Union, wherever it may be.
The report gives the Balkans as an example, but an "independent" European police intervention force would be no better than that provided under the auspices of the United Nations, or the United States, in other words.
At the most, it would support the position in the region held by the major European industrial groups that are casting covetous glances at the market for the reconstruction of what the NATO bombers destroyed.
Indeed, the expressed wish that "the RRF will have no geographical limitation" foreshadows acts of piracy to benefit the former colonial powers in Africa or elsewhere, like those that France has committed in the past to protect dictators from the opposition of their peoples, or like those that Great Britain is committing at this very moment in Sierra Leone.
We therefore voted against the creation of the Rapid Reaction Facility, just as we shall vote against any budget allocations to support it.
We must welcome the fact that the Council proposal follows on directly from the conclusions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Feira European Councils which urged the Union to "improve and make more effective use of resources in civilian crisis management."
The European Union has vast experience and the resources necessary to set up, at very short notice, operations such as the monitoring of elections, border control, police force training and outfitting.
This potential must be exploited to the full, especially as the Union has not been capable of reacting quickly enough and the instruments for funding operations of this type were not flexible enough.
The European Commission does not provide for any "geographical limitation" to the Rapid Reaction Facility (RRF).
It does, however, stipulate that the interventions must have a "short life span" .
If events call for more long-term intervention, then the resources currently available, such as the thematic programmes, should be used.
Under the MEDA Programme, by way of example, the RRF will be used in particular for the training of immigration service officials and cooperation in combating terrorism.
.
(EL) The proposal for a regulation creating a rapid reaction facility is nothing more than the framework for what may well be non-military but which is equally imperialistic political and economic intervention What the sovereign masters of the European Union want is a rapid facility to mobilise human and financial resources which can intervene directly not just when there is a "crisis" (which the authors of the text would do well to define), but even when there is simply concern that so-called assistance and cooperation programmes with these countries might be at risk or even merely affected.
Of course, the brains behind the text do not conceal their intention to supplement the proposed measures with the European Public Security Force (armed obviously) which can be deployed in "law and order operations".
Typically enough, the Committee on Foreign Affairs outdoes the Commission with its amendments abolishing the EUR 12 million ceiling on each intervention, the Crisis Committee and the nine-month limit on each intervention.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will never cease to condemn this EU policy, which aims to make third countries politically and economically dependent and suppress the grass-roots movement.
Not only are we opposed to any form of imperialist rapid or even slow reaction facility, we shall do everything within our power to unite all the people in these countries against any imperialist plans to subjugate them and to claim the place which they deserve in a new, fair, international order.
In deciding to create the core of a European army, the Nice Summit has opened a new chapter in the history of the European Union.
For twenty years, it has been attempting to win popular backing by claiming to be building a social Europe.
Faced with failure, following the Balkan conflict, it has had a change of heart.
It now openly admits that its objective is the establishment of a European superpower that will defend European interests "all over the world" .
The imperialist nature of this is plain to see.
It will do so in conjunction with the United States within NATO.
In future, by coordinating its diplomatic and military forces, the EU will be trying to optimise what its Member States have done individually throughout the last century.
This is to be carried out in the name of "maintaining" or "imposing" peace, and "humanitarian operations" .
Both within and outside NATO, which is dominated by the United States, the EU is attempting to 'sell' us on its scheme in the name of Europe' s "independence" vis-Ã -vis the United States. We do not need this Euro-militarism.
We are just as radically opposed to this European army as we were to the NATO army, as the first effect will be a dramatic increase in the military budget, which will inevitably go hand in hand with heightened militaristic propaganda.
Scientific and technological research will be siphoned off into the military sector.
It will transfer an increased share of the state budget to businesses in that sector, with the goal of establishing a European military industry (EADS, Dassault, BAE) capable of getting the better of the United States.
The workers have nothing to gain and everything to lose in the EU' s "new" imperial designs.
.
(IT) There is clearly no doubt that it would be highly appropriate to create a Rapid Reaction Facility and, moreover, the three Community institutions have already expressed positive views.
However, over and above our common goal, we feel that certain elements of the Council's proposal deserve careful consideration.
The first is essentially theoretical: the objectives of the mechanism in question do not appear to be very clear, apart from the tasks of supranational policing.
The rapporteur goes so far as to propose explicitly the establishment of a European Police Force.
And if this were the case we could consider the proposal, but it would have to have a different legal basis and, most importantly, a different Community institutional system from that defined by the recent Intergovernmental Summit at Nice.
In actual fact, in our opinion, the ultimate purpose of the Rapid Reaction Mechanism is to make Community policies and programmes effective more quickly and to maintain that effectiveness more consistently.
Moreover, the original impression came from the description of the conditions for triggering the Facility, which, being very general, still does not give a practical idea of them, when it would have been enough, without prejudice to the normal intervention conditions laid down by Community regulations, to highlight those conditions which, on the basis of their urgency, trigger the Reaction Mechanism.
Then, it appears strange that the governments of the States within which the Mechanism may be triggered are not among the parties notified of the triggering of the Mechanism.
Moreover, it seems odd that they are not notified, since they have been targeted by policies and programmes which, in the case in point, need to be safeguarded.
Finally, objections could be raised to the increase in the volume of information sent to the European Parliament, even through the consultation procedure alone, but, since we hope that the list of topics subject to codecision will be extended, we feel that, in specific cases of geographical or political importance, the Commission must not hold back from informing Parliament.
In the light of these considerations, we support the changes proposed by the rapporteur and we have therefore voted for the motion.
. For the past eighteen months, British Conservatives have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement programmes, such as mine action, urgently in time of crisis or when lives are at stake.
They support proposals with these objectives in mind and therefore welcome the Commission initiative for a Rapid Reaction Facility (or Mechanism), in spite of its confusing title and some unnecessarily politically-correct elements.
Their fundamental objection is to the amendments which seek to use this proposal as a vehicle for establishing a "European Public Security Force".
This concept, for some sort of European gendarmerie, has far-reaching implications and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion.
We were prepared to support the Commission proposal if it did not contain these amendments (9 or 39) but abstain if they were included.
Oomen-Ruijten report (A5-0338/2000)
Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, how could I not speak on this document, which lays down how the pensions and health care of frontier and other workers, who work in different regions from those in which they live and work at other times of their lives, should be regulated.
A pensioner from the border between Italy and Switzerland, which is party to these agreements, asked me whether it was true that the pensions of people who work in other States of the European Union had been raised.
"If only they had!" I replied.
"I would be very happy, and so would you, for you would be able to find much more, much better work in the other European States.
In any case, I will raise the issue when I give my explanation of vote on the Oomen-Ruijten report, which deals with this subject".
- (DA) The Left party attaches importance to removing obstacles to the free movement of labour.
We have therefore supported this own-initiative report which proposes greater efforts to combat the problems created by differences in social and fiscal systems.
However, we are not in favour of producing a directive obliging the Member States to assess the impact of new legislation on frontier workers.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report on the situation of frontier workers in the European Union.
We have done so because this report highlights the many serious problems faced by frontier workers.
A large proportion of these problems can be solved if the Council demonstrates a capacity for action.
In spite of the failure to introduce qualified majority voting in this area at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we want to use our vote today to send a powerful signal to the Council and call upon them to complete a thoroughgoing review and simplification of Regulation No 1408.
We believe that the rules for coordination must be simple and easy to administer. We cannot therefore support a new directive which adds new procedures to Regulation No 1408.
In connection with the debate, we have emphasised that we cannot support the remarks in the report concerning the financing of social security arrangements through taxation.
In addition, we want to stress that we do not consider, either, that health benefits such as medical treatment can be compared with general services, and that responsibility for this area must continue solely to be the responsibility of the Member States.
For the most part, this report confines itself to general considerations without putting forward any practical decisions.
Even when it does put forward a positive measure such as "proposals to extend access by dependent family members of frontier workers, retired frontier workers and dependent members of their families to health care provisions and benefits" , the Council is asked only "with all possible expedition to adopt a position" .
While we support this request, we abstained from the vote on the report.
All the workers of the European Union ought to benefit from the same social protection, with each of the component areas (social security, retirement pensions, family benefits) standardised according to the practices of the country where they are most favourable to workers.
In the meantime, in order to improve the situation of frontier workers, they and their families should be able to choose, in each of these areas, between their country of residence and their country of employment, according to the situation most favourable to them.
. (DE) Finding practical solutions to the problems of the 420 000 cross-border commuters also means making people aware and appreciative of the single market and the freedom of movement it guarantees.
This is why I warmly welcome the fact that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report addresses a number of these problems and their origins as well as proposing measures which will mitigate the effects of these disparities between the systems of taxation and social welfare for those who are affected by them.
The discrepancies between national legal provisions and the principle of free movement are primarily due to the fact that Regulation 1408/71 is outdated and, because of the many changes that have occurred in the period since its adoption, can no longer offer employees the legal certainty they require.
The direct consequence of this inadequate coordination is that frontier workers are often at a disadvantage in terms of welfare benefits, unemployment, pension provision and health care.
In the last-named area, I particularly welcome the initiative of players in the health sector to offer 'exportable' services which take account of the specific circumstances of cross-border commuters.
Just as numerous legal uncertainties have arisen in the domains of health and social welfare, a similar situation has occurred in the realm of tax legislation, and the various bilateral taxation agreements have not succeeded in resolving these uncertainties.
This creates areas of inequality, both between cross-border commuters and between local authorities, and these can only be eliminated in the foreseeable future through coordination of all our tax systems on a European scale.
For this reason, we cannot but support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's proposal that a directive be adopted which commits the Member States to examine all legislative bills concerning tax and social welfare for their effects on cross-border commuters and to create compensatory mechanisms.
Despite numerous opinions that have been delivered by the European Parliament in favour of the harmonisation of social and fiscal legislation, and despite the presentation by the Commission of concrete proposals for the updating and simplification of Regulation 1408/71, the Ministers of the Member States have been blocking this necessary reform process in the Council, thereby preventing the single market from becoming a reality for people in Europe.
- (DE) The report on the situation of frontier workers with which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has presented us undoubtedly stems from the laudable intention of ensuring that frontier workers are not subject to discrimination in terms of pay, working conditions and social security and of resolving the problems that still persist in these areas.
That is what we all want.
However, it is an exaggeration to suggest, as the explanatory statement of this report suggests, that the internal market, of which the free movement of workers is a cornerstone, is an absolute farce in the daily lives of these people.
That is just as much divorced from reality as various assertions in the resolution; some of the demands it makes are tantamount to kicking at open doors, at least in relation to the circumstances of the 85,000 frontier workers in Luxembourg.
It is simply untrue that family members are excluded from provisions and benefits in the country of employment.
Of course there are differences between private schemes and the public welfare systems, but such differences apply equally to those who are not frontier workers.
Of course there are differing systems of provision for the elderly.
These not only differ from one Member State to another but even differ within Member States.
My pension entitlement would be greater if I had been employed in the public sector.
That, however, is not a problem that specifically concerns frontier workers.
Of course there are differences between Member States in terms of the structure of pension schemes, contributions and pensionable ages.
The frontier workers who are employed in Luxembourg rejoice in these differences, because our pensions are far more generous than those in Belgium, France and Germany, where our frontier workers live.
Although some elements of the social security system are tax-funded in Luxembourg, this does not result in inequalities, because frontier workers are also entitled to the relevant benefits, such as those under the care-insurance scheme, a right which even applies in Belgium and France.
The resolution bemoans the fact that there is no longer a clear distinction in Member States between social assistance and social security.
This is not true either.
Social assistance is not really a problem for frontier workers at all, because they are employees with no need of social assistance.
Nor do I understand what periods of secondment have to do with frontier workers.
There is, of course, a directive covering employees seconded by their employer, but that directive cannot be applied to frontier workers.
And as far as the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Kohl and Decker cases are concerned, it is clear that all citizens of the Union, and hence frontier workers too, can benefit from health services in other Member States.
Here too, the report is trying to force an open door.
I felt it was important to make this clear, because it is not the first time that Parliament has made such half-baked demands in one of its reports.
Back in 1998, when we discussed the Lancker report, I emphasised that it was absurd to claim that there was any inherent discrimination against frontier workers.
At that time the Belgian Socialists had made the ridiculous proposal that a compensatory fund be created for loss of income suffered by frontier workers.
It is important to frontier workers that there should be no tampering with the principle that income taxes and welfare contributions are payable in the country of employment.
This is the prerequisite if frontier workers are to enjoy all the social benefits that are granted in the country of employment to workers who reside there and to their dependants.
That is how it is in Luxembourg, and that is how it is supposed to be everywhere - no more and no less.
Motion for a resolution on environment directives (B5-0038/2001)
Although the directives on conservation of natural habitats, the elimination of PCBs and PCTs, and the protection of waters from nitrate pollution are only inadequately applied in the Member States, this does not mean by any means that these are poor directives which must be changed, as some people in this House would seek to have us believe.
These directives fully live up to the ambitions of the citizens of Europe, who are demanding that greater attention be paid to environmental matters and are seeking arbitration from the European authorities.
The great numbers of complaints and petitions received by the Committee on Petitions regarding environmental infractions and violations of these directives testify to these expectations.
The fact is, if the directives are only partially implemented, it is because the Member States had not weighed the consequences when adopting them.
They had not taken on board the implications of the financial costs or the amendments, which could be fundamental, that these directives would require in their policies.
This is true both of the Habitats Directive and the Nitrates Directive since they both require the review of agricultural and regional planning policies which may cause pollution or destruction of natural environments.
The implementation of the Habitats Directive is intended to provide long-term protection for a European network of biologically outstanding natural habitats and to exempt them from future redevelopment in order to prevent conflicts in land use or damage to those environments.
These objectives have, admittedly, been very badly presented in the Member States, causing occasionally very bitter conflicts between the owners and users of these areas.
Yet there was no shortage of positive results in those instances where proper coordination was achieved, since the Habitats Directive does indeed make it possible to support heritage-friendly management methods by making adequate compensation available.
This Habitats Directive is truly innovative in terms of regional planning and nature conservation in that it reconciles the management and the use of outstanding natural sites in order to make the best use of land.
To this end, the European Union must make every effort to support the implementation of this directive.
The European Union absolutely must not yield to the industrial interests which would negate the very spirit of the directive.
The Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, must firstly adopt a firm stance with regard to the Member States in order to ensure that they implement these directives and, secondly, to stand firm against attempts to amend these directives even before they have been able to demonstrate their full relevance, particularly in the areas of dealing with nitrate pollution in water and protecting and raising the profile of outstanding natural sites.
For the above reasons, the Group of the Greens supports all the reports presented, particularly the SjÃ¶stedt report, which will contribute to improving the implementation of the Habitats Directive.
The reason why we abstained, then, is that we do not feel that the last-minute attempts to change the nature of the report, seeking to weaken the Habitats Directive and to urge that it be amended, are in line with respecting the directives on which we are voting.
Parish report (A5-0357/2000)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, I would be most grateful if you would reserve just a snippet of your attention, which I am sure is in no short supply, for the explanation of my vote for the Parish report on young farmers.
I would stress the importance of milk produced by young farmers and of supporting the product at this difficult time for the farming world.
I remember a film from the 1960s, directed by the famous Federico Fellini with Anita Akberg in the leading roll.
There was a poster of her urging all the passers-by to drink milk.
She was extremely successful and the ideal actress to persuade the Italians to drink milk.
Well then, I would like similar appeals to be made to the European citizens now as well, so that farmers can sell their milk, which is, I regret to say, under threat from "mad milk".
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the Parish report is the future of young farmers in the European Union.
Once again we hear calls for new subsidies, for so-called installation aid.
I voted against the report.
The report presents the situation as if all were well with the farming world.
But nothing is well with it.
BSE has cast doubt on the entire agricultural system.
We spend almost DEM 100 billion of our petty cash on agriculture every year. That, indeed, represents half of the European budget.
We are starting to ask ourselves what we get in return for this money - swine fever, hormone-treated calves, dioxin-infested hens and now the BSE epidemic.
I believe we are slowly becoming disgusted by this food chain we produce and perhaps disgusted with ourselves too.
Instead of grasses and cereals, we are feeding cattle with corpses of domestic cats, caged rats and other animals, and I believe this is precisely the point that must now be included in this discussion.
The use of waste products and excrement in food production is the logical consequence of a senseless agricultural policy, which undoubtedly has to be brought to an end right here and now.
We must discuss first principles, so that these subsidisation payouts, the instruments of a command economy, can be consigned to the history books.
That is precisely what we have to tell the young farmers.
We must talk about that with young farmers, about the fact that they will have to be able to survive in the market without subsidisation.
This is certainly not the thrust of the report, which is why it must be rejected.
. (EL) The report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a move in the right direction.
More funds are needed to set young farmers up and reverse the exodus towards the towns.
Young farmers may be the key to reviving abandoned areas, small islands and traditional communities from which the life force is draining.
What we need is to use new technologies, such as the Internet, to create a new pleasant, cultural, technically advanced environment with a human dimension for them to work in.
One important point not contained in the Agricultural Committee report is that young farmers need to be given a basis on which to develop alternative, organic, family holdings, given that over-intensive farming leads nowhere except to mad cows.
- (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats welcome many of the measures proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to improve the situation for young farmers.
We nonetheless believe that the EU' s agricultural subsidy ought to be reduced considerably and are therefore opposed to the demands for an increase in the agricultural subsidy, presented in paragraphs 7, 11 and 14 of Mr Parish' s report.
We are in favour of assisting young farmers without financial resources to meet the considerable expenses involved in setting up business, purchasing farms and equipment.
We therefore voted in favour of this report in spite of our reservations, for there is no guarantee that the bulk, if not all of this aid will not go to the children of wealthy farm owners and that, once again, those least well off will be left by the wayside.
At this early stage, we would denounce the misappropriation of these funds to benefit the children of wealthy farm owners.
. I believe that the report from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is most balanced and should be welcomed.
As a representative of a rural constituency, I am acutely aware of the concerns expressed by farmers over the very future of farming in Ireland.
It seems incredible but it is true, that in Ireland, where agriculture has long been one of the economic bases of the country, farmers are now beginning to wonder whether their sons or daughters will be able to carry on the family tradition.
Mr Parish' s report is very timely, and the study on "The Future of Young Farmers in the European Union" by independent consultants which was commissioned at his request at the beginning of last year provides a much-needed focus on the whole issue.
Young farmers are an essential part of the farming future.
They perform a very important role in the social life of villages and rural communities, promoting a whole range of activities and participating in local associations.
Farmers help to promote a healthy and prosperous countryside by maintaining the landscape.
In Ireland the National Development Plan for 2000-2006 provides a wide range of measures which will assist young farmers embarking on their farming career.
These include a new enhanced Scheme of Installation Aid to encourage the taking-over of farms by younger farmers and assist young farmers as they first set up in farming.
Some Â£30 million has been provided for this scheme, which I hope will shortly be approved by the Commission.
In addition, a comprehensive range of tax incentives are in place, aimed at reducing the cost of ownership transfer.
These incentives include Stock Relief, Stamp Duty, Capital Acquisition and Probate Tax.
Coupled with the Early Retirement Scheme, it is clear that the supports available to young farmers setting out on a career in agriculture will be of considerable benefit, and these measures should assist in the earlier and more efficient transfer of land to younger farmers.
Many young farmers taking over a holding have to make necessary on-farm investments in order to optimise production efficiency and to ensure the economic sustainability of their holdings.
In this regard some GBP 230 million have been provided for on-farm investment under the National Development Plan.
Investment schemes will cover Farm Waste Management, Improvement in Dairy Hygiene Standards and Housing and Handling Facilities for Alternative Enterprises.
These Schemes will be open to an increased number of part-time and full-time farmers, including young trained farmers, and will contribute to securing the viability of many farmers.
They will focus in particular on young farmers.
It should also be noted that the nature of these schemes shows a clear commitment to the protection of the environment, an issue which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture.
To conclude, it is imperative that we, at European level, address ourselves towards ensuring a future for European agriculture.
The Common Agricultural Policy has been a European success story, and we want to keep it that way.
The future lies with our young farmers and with agricultural practices which are sustainable and protect the environment.
We must lend our full support to these objectives.
. (PT) The situation and the prospects of young farmers depend a great deal on the situation and prospects of Agriculture in the EU itself.
As we all know, agriculture and the rural world are in decline, a decline in which the common agricultural policy has played a large part, promoting, as it does, land concentration, intensification of production, the gradual verticalisation of agricultural produce, all of which contribute to desertification and rural depopulation, as proved by a fall in the number of those employed and in the number of farms of around 22% and 20%, respectively, since 1990.
Young farmers represent the new lifeblood of farms and are crucial to guaranteeing the future of agriculture in the various regions of the EU.
The fall of around 28%, in the last decade, in farms whose owners are under 35 years of age proves the current negative prospects.
Special measures for Community support for young farmers are therefore crucial, although the fundamental problem lies in the need for a sea change in the CAP.
The Parish report, with which I broadly agree, despite its lack of coherence, does not focus on the necessary changes to policy.
It toys with the existing framework.
Nevertheless, three amendments which I tabled and which I believe to be important have been adopted. These are:
the need to commit ourselves to high-quality, sustainable agricultural production, which yields products which are safe and have a high added value, through support for biological agriculture, support for natural breeds and the consolidation of designations of origin and the creation of support mechanisms for regional products of special quality;
improving appropriations for rural development and structural funds to support and create broad public service networks, create infrastructures and give a boost to local markets in the rural world;
the need to simplify and integrate legislation affecting young farmers.
The fact that we are discussing a report on the situation and prospects of young farmers in the European Union assumes very special significance in the light of the BSE crisis.
What has happened since the well and truly hysterical dramatisation of the crisis in most of our Member States will surely do nothing to motivate young people to remain in farming, let alone encourage them to see their future in rural areas, where, as the report so admirably states, they have a very important role to perform in the social life of villages and rural communities, promoting and maintaining the countryside and contributing to the economic, social and environmental needs of the community,
We have greater cause for concern about the future of farming in the European Union than ever before as a result of this mainly consumer-led crisis of confidence, given that the number of farmers under the age of 35 has been showing the sharpest decline for some time and now stands at 28% and that the percentage of farmers in the population of almost every Member State is falling.
Our report contains all the most important and correct diagnoses as well as all the demands which have to be fulfilled if sufficient numbers of young people are to continue to see their future in farming.
This is a list of demands to which not only the European Commission but also the Council and all the Member States must pledge themselves if they want to prevent the depopulation, desolation and decline of rural areas in the European Union and the accompanying exacerbation of our social and cultural problems.
In the EU we need sustainable, high-quality agricultural production.
We must defend and safeguard the designations of origin of our quality produce, such as our wines, in the wider world, including the World Trade Organisation, because our future in the European Union and that of our export trade depends on top-quality products, for which there is a prosperous and discerning consumer market within and beyond the frontiers of the Union.
There is a tendency to put the blame for the present problems, and especially for the BSE crisis, on the agricultural community, which is expected to produce increasingly cheap food.
Because I was a member of the Consumers' Consultative Council of the European Commission for many years, I should also like to refer here to the responsibility of consumer organisations, which, heedless of producers' incomes, have been pressing incessantly for lower consumer prices for food.
Again and again in the seventies and eighties, and more recently too, they spoke out against the payment of appropriate producer prices in the framework of the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products.
So they too are partly responsible for the industrialisation of farming, for the fact that cows have been turned into carnivores and that the right of farmers to receive proper reward for their efforts has been disregarded.
This has to be emphasised in the present debate.
I am an enthusiastic proponent of this report, because it contains and clearly enunciates all the things that are right and important for the preservation of family-owned farms in Europe, without which there can be no support for organic farming with its high-quality regional specialities, which consumers must learn to appreciate and for which they must be prepared to pay a fair price.
It has been noted that the situation of young farmers is a serious problem in the European Union and they do not have any real prospects despite the support provided by the Union and the Member States.
This is why I consider this report to be so important and why I am delighted that we have voted in favour of it.
The economic situation is unfavourable and sometimes extremely serious, particularly for young people.
There is a real lack of prospects for young farmers, as well as a significant decrease in the numbers of farmers in general, with an increase in the age of those remaining.
What can the European Union do?
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, having been asked to give its opinion on this subject, did not wish to focus on aspects which fell within the remits of other committees.
We therefore chose to highlight the issues associated with education, training and information policies and the social and cultural life of young farmers.
We note that young farmers experience problems resulting from education and training that is often poorly suited to their needs.
Even Agenda 2000 neglects these fundamentally important aspects.
The European Union must encourage, through its Socrates and Leonardo Programmes, measures to strengthen education and training facilities for young farmers in order to raise their skills to the required level.
IT training must be set up.
Internet access must become a reality, and young farmers must be able to become acquainted with integrated production and marketing management systems so as to manage their holdings effectively.
Depopulation may be combated, in particular by maintaining public services in rural areas (schools, post offices, transport services), and social facilities may be maintained by pooling the resources of several communes, for example, or by resorting to the use of mobile services.
If the right conditions for revitalising farming are fulfilled, then young urban dwellers enthusiastic about nature and keen to improve their quality of life will be able to settle in the country and rural youth will no longer abandon the farms passed on to them by their parents.
- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have voted against the draft report since we find it incompatible with the principle of subsidiarity, in spite of the fact that the subject as such - the situation of young farmers - is of pressing importance.
We especially object to paragraph 10 in which the unreasonable proposal is made that the 'EU should consider making it mandatory for the Member States to provide minimum levels of installation aid to young farmers' .
In our view, this is emphatically not a supranational issue.
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report (A5-0365/2000)
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I represent at the European Parliament, considers that the Commission, Parliament and the Council should change a major part of the fisheries policy and calls upon them to do so. The section in question is the part which refers to the now established practice of fishing the waters of other countries and then relieving our conscience by paying a sum of money to the governments whose waters we have fished.
I have always been told to give to those who have not.
However, I am afraid that we Europeans are not giving anybody anything but are going to fish the waters of others instead.
I am quite aware of the problems of fishermen, which we do have to resolve, but we must resolve them in some other way, not to the detriment of the peoples whose only livelihood is fishing.
Gallagher report (A5-0333/2000)
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying, on behalf of my group, that we are very strongly in favour of continuing a form of common fisheries policy within the European Union, because we understand that the management of resources is the best way forward for securing guarantees for the continuation of social and economic development in a lot of coastal regions of the European Union, which would have no other benefit and could not get employment or other developments except from their own natural resources, for example fishing and aquaculture.
However, that said and giving credit where credit is due, we must also recognise that there are a lot of deficiencies within the common fisheries policy.
In particular, the total objection to having a regionalised policy within the common fisheries policy is incorrect.
This House has rejected that proposal again today.
Regionalisation does not mean renationalisation or moving away from a Community model; it means giving communities which are bordering each other and are fishing similar species the opportunity to come together to manage those species.
On top of that, we must also put greater emphasis on a uniform inspection system across all European Union waters and give more powers to the Community inspectors to ensure that all regulations are being properly enforced.
Finally, I must say that there is a need for conservation.
We have seen a huge depletion in the fishing stocks within the European Union waters.
The way to resolve conservation questions is not by moving to different fish stocks and bringing them into a quota system, but by ensuring that we have certain no-go areas where we can allow fishing stocks to re-mature.
This example has already been proven in certain areas by voluntary agreements in Irish waters and by maintenance of these non-fishing areas - so-called set-aside areas, to give the analogy with the common agricultural policy - for a certain period of time.
That is the one way of guaranteeing that we can keep a food source going, provide employment and protect environmental considerations within our fishing waters.
That is why we supported the Gallagher report.
Mr President, I voted for this report on the common fisheries policy, but I call upon the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to monitor more effectively one of the factors referred to in paragraph 20 of the report, which is disregarded, namely how and whether the size of the pensions and situation of the pensioners in the fisheries sector and, in particular, in the small-scale fishing sector, are monitored.
We have a responsibility to pensioners to concern ourselves, as well as with all the other important aspects of fisheries, with how the national States protect retired fishermen, as they are the last to receive sufficient protection in the area of pensions.
. (EL) My group voted in favour of the resolution.
However, I must highlight one particular issue.
According to current Community legislation, Greek fishermen have exclusive fishing rights within a zone of 6 nautical miles, as opposed to the 12 nautical miles which apply to the other Member States of the EU, especially the Mediterranean countries.
This means that Greek fishermen are not being treated equally and are at a disadvantage compared with the other countries under the common fisheries policy.
Given that, according to the statement in Article 5, paragraph 1 of Annex IX to the International Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Community has sole responsibility for conserving and managing marine fish stocks and, by extension, the competence to adopt the relevant rules and regulations, the Commission should make use of these powers and give Greek fishermen exclusive fishing rights within a zone of 12 nautical miles.
Similarly, the European Parliament called in resolution Ã4-0018/99 (C-153/1-6-99) for the Commission to propose extending the exclusive fishing zone to 24 nautical miles in order to guarantee a suitable decentralisation policy and protection for the interests of coastal areas.
The Commission should adopt this resolution by the European Parliament.
The parliamentary reports on which we are required to deliver our opinion cover various aspects of the common fisheries policy, including the management and conservation of fisheries resources, structural policy, the European Union' s external relations on fishing, market organisation, monitoring and controls.
The Commission has expressed the following priorities: improving the coherence between the various objectives of the CFP, especially between the conservation of resources, economic effectiveness and employment in fishing-dependent regions; greater consideration of the economic side of fishing; improving the integration of environmental and fishing policy; improving administrative instruments, particularly integrating multiannual instruments; seeking a more transparent decision making process and maintaining the external aspects of the CFP.
We can, of course, support all these points in principle.
I think it necessary, however, to highlight the following points which the Commission does not seem to have emphasised sufficiently.
While it is true that the TACs must be determined chiefly on an objective scientific basis, dialogue with workers in the sector must certainly be established at institutional level and must be stepped up.
The representatives of fishermen must be involved at the earliest stages prior to the scientists' deliberations in order to increase confidence and to enable decisions to be taken which are well-founded and more readily acceptable.
Such consultation will be even more essential when the time comes to draw up multiannual guidelines.
Inspection and penalty systems must absolutely be harmonised between the various fishing areas, in order to prevent distortions between Member States.
The system of inspections carried out by Community countries on third country fleets operating in Community waters must be intensified.
Finally, while maintaining the TAC and quota system at the heart of the CFP, we wish to restate the value we attach to respecting the principle of relative stability and our opposition to the privatisation of quotas.
Poignant report (A5-0332/2000)
Mr President, I voted for this report for I - and the Pensioners' Party - consider that, before taking important decisions, the European Parliament - and not only Parliament but all the government bodies - should consult the groups, peoples and citizens concerned.
The document states that the Commission consulted a large number of bodies before taking a decision on the common fisheries policy: representatives of the fishermen, representatives of the companies which live off fishing and representatives of the fishing boat equipment companies. It has consulted them all, performing a sort of consultation regionalisation.
That is all well and good, but has it also consulted the fish, Mr President?
In 2003, Blue Europe, with its common fisheries policy, will be changed.
2001 already marks the end of one of the fisheries management instruments, the MAGP IV, or the Multiannual Guidance Programme.
We have two years before 31 December 2002 to consider and make a decision on a common policy which, according to the European Commission' s tally, raises 18 questions, ranging from free access to territorial waters, the control and management of the market in fishery and aquaculture products to international fisheries agreements, scientific research into fish stocks and the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean.
The CFP is being reviewed, and even overhauled, against a complex, multi-sided context.
Firstly, resources are finite.
Stocks such as hake, cod, sardine and tuna, are endangered or at risk.
There is wastage.
Every year, worldwide, over 15% of fish caught are thrown back into the sea, particularly in the EU, on the pretext of maintaining prices or in order to respect restrictions, whereas countries such as Norway make the most of fish that fall outside the permitted limits.
They make up 20 million tonnes of the total global catch of 122 million tonnes.
International and regional organisations are also concerned about fisheries management, from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean, to the North West Atlantic fisheries institutions, in which the EC participates.
Europe has also passed 25 bilateral agreements with countries including Angola, the Seychelles and Madagascar and is attempting to come to an agreement with Morocco, no mean process and one that is currently in difficulties.
More importantly, globalisation, and the associated problem of cheap imports, is now affecting the market.
Essentially, the CFP, which often contains too many excessively obscure regulations, must reconcile contradictory objectives, i.e. conserve fish stocks, according to the precautionary principle, while protecting coastal communities and economies which sometimes depend on the fishing industry for employment, as in the case of the Manche region.
Similarly, we need a clear CFP that is flexible enough to take into account specific regional characteristics, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and even, as the Italians hope, those of the Adriatic or other sub-regional "seas" .
In particular, we must reconcile the major opening up of the European market, importing 60% of consumption, with the need to protect our fishermen, who see the Japanese, American and Korean markets closing.
In order to handle such diverse problems, the European Commission has used an effective method that involves extensive consultation of fisheries and environmental organisations as well as producers.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
Joint motion for a resolution on depleted uranium
Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to welcome the compromise resolution which we have just passed.
A strong and united voice calling unequivocally for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons is a positive step forward, even if it does not go as far as we would have liked.
The Greens and EFA were calling for a complete ban on the production, export and use of depleted uranium weapons and we believe that we have a legal as well as a moral basis for doing so.
The UN Convention of October 1980 banned the use of certain indiscriminate weapons; the 1996 resolution of the Sub-Commission on Human Rights also explicitly condemned depleted uranium weapons because of their non-discriminatory character.
The use of these weapons has already, therefore, been condemned in international law.
We would also have been more reassured if the resolution had included our concerns about the methodology which is being used to assess the risks of depleted uranium.
A growing number of scientists are now challenging the conventional methodology, which is based on doses of external radioactive rays rather than internally ingested or inhaled particles.
Research shows that deaths from leukaemia resulting from the Chernobyl explosion have been one hundred times more than predicted by the relevant radiological protection boards, which have based their predictions on external rays.
The enormity of this error conceals the fact that even very low doses of radiation, like that from depleted uranium, can in fact have devastating health impacts.
It is therefore essential that we get this methodology right or else all the tests and screening in the world will be simply worthless.
Finally, I would like to refer to the report on the front page of last week's European Voice, which proclaims that the new EU rapid reaction force is apparently planning to use depleted uranium weapons.
Now remember this is a humanitarian force, which is planning to use a weapon that will leave an enormous legacy of cancers among the very civilians it is supposed to be there to protect.
This is nothing short of scandalous and must be overturned.
Mr President, I voted against this document because I feel that there has been too much hypocrisy at play in this issue.
I suspect, or rather, I fear, that this is what happened:
"Mr President, which weapons shall we use against Milosevic?"
"The ones we usually use!" replied the President.
"Which weapons do we usually use?" asked the general.
"Do you mean depleted uranium shells as well?"
"Yes, why not?" said the President.
"But," the general protested, "they can be extremely harmful to those who use them because they are dangerous in war - we have tested them."
"But, as you know, my dear general," replied the President, "war involves calculated risks and we must run these risks as well."
Mr President, in times of war we have to make do, as they say.
I do not think we can be surprised at these sad incidents, which could only have been prevented by having a united, independent Europe.
Mr President, I supported the joint resolution on depleted uranium and I welcome the fact that Parliament decided to retain the reference and the call for a moratorium on these weapons.
I would have preferred a stronger resolution but I know how difficult it is to achieve that.
What I do want to say, however, is that I deplore the attitude displayed by Mr Solana here this morning.
At the same time as declaring he was in favour of transparency and openness in relation to this issue, he admitted that he only began to take action on it when it became a public issue about a week ago, despite his role as Secretary-General of NATO during the Balkans War.
He also failed to mention or to give a view on the question whether there ought to be a moratorium on these weapons.
I deplore also his attempt to make this Parliament complicit in the decision by NATO to use these weapons.
The use of these weapons was disproportionate to the challenge that was being faced by NATO, particularly in the war against Serbia, and was therefore unnecessary and was a callous disregard of the effects on the population at large.
It was a callous disregard of the effect it would have on the NATO troops, and indeed it was a callous disregard of the after-effects on aid workers and peacekeeping forces, both military and police, in the aftermath of that war.
I would urge, as others have urged, that the new rapid reaction force should not have available to it these types of weapons.
Indeed I will be calling on my own government in Ireland to refuse to participate in this rapid reaction force unless there is a clear commitment that these weapons will not be used.
. (EL) Ãhe only purpose which the joint motion for a resolution on the "Balkan syndrome" serves is to cover up the criminal policy of NATO and the European Union which, on the pretext of defending human rights, invaded Yugoslavia, causing incalculable personal injury and material damage.
And to ensure that the bombings were even more destructive, they had no qualms about using weapons with depleted uranium shells, despite the fact that they were well aware of their deadly long-term impact from the war against Iraq.
Because the joint motion for a resolution refuses to acknowledge the correlation between cases of cancer and leukaemia in soldiers who served in the occupying forces in Bosnia and Kosovo and during the Gulf War and depleted uranium, it confines itself to a wish list of transparent discussions and working parties and merely calls for the Member States who are members of ÃÃÃÃ to propose that the use of depleted uranium weapons be stopped and for ÃÃÃÃ to study the possibility of using different types of weapons, in other words to continue killing, but with "clean" weapons.
Typically, the proposed amendment from the group of the left calling for a ban on the production, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium weapons was ostentatiously rejected by the conservative majority of the members of the European Parliament, attracting a mere 23% of the votes.
Of course, the European Parliament acted true to form, as the war criminal, the former Secretary-General of NATO and the current High Representative of the EU, Javier Solana, cynically pointed out in his intervention, because it was the European Parliament itself which insisted on military intervention in the Balkans, both in Bosnia and Kosovo.
We would, of course, be deluding ourselves if we expected war criminals to accuse themselves.
That job belongs to the people.
The Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly called both for a ban on the use of depleted uranium and for the occupying forces to leave the Balkans immediately and for NATO and the EU to bear the cost of treating and compensating victims and cleaning up the environment.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the joint motion for a resolution and call on the people to organise and develop their own united resistance to, and launch their own counter-attack on, the barbaric new order.
- (DA) The joint motion for a resolution contains many sensible ideas but does not do justice to the very difficult situation in which NATO has placed the civilian population in the Balkans, the soldiers who were stationed there and their dependents.
Approximately 20 Balkans veterans have died from leukaemia, and the figure is growing.
American soldiers in KFOR were warned against breathing in depleted uranium.
They were warned against touching anything which might be suspected of having been in contact with depleted uranium; they were called upon to leave areas suspected of having been polluted by dust from depleted uranium weapons; and they were urged to wash their uniforms often.
We do not think that the American army provides warnings of this kind without good reason.
There have also been a number of investigations showing that breathing in depleted uranium is extremely dangerous to health.
The consequences for the civil population in those areas exposed to military action by NATO have by no means been thoroughly investigated.
However, only the future will decide the matter.
We therefore believe it is quite inadequate merely to carry out another investigation into the consequences of using depleted uranium weapons.
We believe the matter has now been quite carefully examined.
In our view, the precautionary principle must, in any case, also cover those who report for international assignments, as well as the civil population in war zones.
These weapons should be covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention concerning chemical and nuclear weapons.
All production ought to be stopped, and all stockpiles destroyed.
We demand an end to the use of depleted uranium weapons now.
The fact that, for at least 10 years, the armies of the most powerful countries have known about the harmful effects of depleted uranium weapons, including the effects on those using them, proves that army leaders have as much contempt for their own soldiers as they have for the civilian population and the enemy forces.
We have good cause to be outraged at the effects that using such weapons has had upon NATO soldiers.
We have even more reason to be outraged at the effects on the civilian population, the people who were killed by depleted uranium weapons in just the same way as those killed by conventional bombs.
Yet, what should we make of the hypocritical surprise shown by the representatives of all these political parties that took part in the decision to bomb Serbia and Kosovo, the majority of whom did so after supporting the Gulf War?
They gave army leaders a free hand and, today, faced with the public' s reaction, they are pretending to be concerned about the consequences of their decision while trying to shirk their own responsibilities.
We voted in favour of the draft amendment from the Confederal Group of the European United Left which requested a "ban on the manufacture, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium munitions" , even though we accepted that this would not turn an unjust war into a "clean war" .
We voted against the compromise resolution to register our protest against the use of depleted uranium weapons, against warfare itself whenever it is used, but also against the hypocrisy of the parties supporting such wars.
The general public is particularly concerned about the link between the depleted uranium used in weapons and public health.
At the moment of impact, these weapons unleash chemical reactions, whose effects upon soldiers, civilians and the environment are still not known.
Moreover, uranium, even the depleted variety which is 20% less radioactive than natural uranium, is still a form of nuclear waste and dangerous to use.
There may be a link between the cases of leukaemia found in soldiers who have served in the Balkans and the use of such weapons by NATO.
Even though conclusive proof has not yet been brought forward, and even if there is no consensus among scientists, what we have today is more than mere suspicion, as is shown by the results of various enquiries.
This concern is therefore well grounded and should not be treated lightly.
Until we obtain conclusive proof, we should apply the precautionary principle and impose a moratorium on the use of such weapons.
This is the very least on which we can decide today, before a total ban is imposed, should the studies confirm the danger.
NATO should be totally open about the use of these weapons and about the conduct of its operations in general, and the European Commission should itself begin an independent scientific enquiry.
We owe it to all the people who are currently suffering or living under this threat to demand truth and transparency.
At a time when international law is tending towards the obligation to intervene legitimately on humanitarian grounds in defence of human rights, the civilian population cannot be put at risk by the armed forces supposed to protect it.
The explanatory statement sets out our justified concerns regarding this important issue, which affects the health of soldiers involved in operations in difficult areas.
The local populations involved naturally have a vested interest in this, especially in relation to the necessary criteria for the social, economic and environmental reconstruction of the affected areas.
In its entirety, therefore, the resolution is fair and I fully support it.
However, as it stands, paragraph 6 goes too far, as it stands, in calling upon NATO member states to propose a moratorium, as the precautionary principle is included in the draft which urges NATO to consider other types of weapons until the results of the enquiry on depleted uranium are published.
Since I am unable to support paragraph 6, I have therefore decided to abstain from voting on the whole text.
. (PT) We are voting against the joint motion for a resolution that has been tabled because we cannot accept that we are still trying to deny the obvious, i.e. the serious effects on the health of people in areas affected by the use of weapons containing depleted uranium.
Since the beginning of the nuclear age, which started at the time of the Second World War, we have been aware of the risks and the precautions when dealing with uranium and other radioactive substances because this is a highly toxic element (both chemically and radiologically), when inhaled or ingested and is also a threat in genetic terms.
The use of this type of ammunition by the US and other NATO countries during the Gulf war, in Bosnia and in Kosovo has already caused the death of thousands of soldiers, suffering and death for the inhabitants of areas that were bombed and the environmental pollution in affected areas, with medium- and long-term consequences, which will affect not only the present generation but also future generations, which is prohibited by the Geneva Convention. This makes it quite clear that there is no such thing as a "clean war" .
Therefore, given the scale of the crime that has been committed against whole civilian populations, it is crucial that we investigate, try and convict the leaders responsible for this crime against humanity, and immediately ban the manufacture, testing, use and sale of this type of weapon containing depleted uranium, not simply approve a moratorium.
. The British delegation of Labour MEPs welcomes the action taken by NATO member states to investigate the causes of deaths and illnesses suffered by troops who served in the Balkans.
We believe that consideration of the use of depleted uranium should be based on scientific fact.
We note that as yet there is no evidence to link depleted uranium and ill health suffered either by troops or civilians.
For that reason, we do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons.
Did the discovery of the dangerous nature of depleted uranium weapons really come as a surprise?
We all know that these weapons, used by NATO during the Gulf War (1991), and the conflicts in Bosnia (1994-5) and Kosovo (1999) had serious consequences, firstly, for the civilian population that was bombed, for their environment, and for the soldiers there, whether NATO, Iraqi, Bosnian, Serbian or Kosovan forces.
For a long time, the military and political authorities simply poured scorn on anyone who expressed concern about this matter.
American and then French soldiers had to get organised before the scandal was eventually unearthed, following the suspicious death of an Italian.
There is no such thing as a 'clean' war.
The unspoken confession of forces formerly involved in combat should allow us to get right to the bottom of the responsibilities of the government and army leaders, primarily Mr Solana, the former Secretary-General of NATO.
We must demand a ban on the manufacture, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium weapons.
We are in favour of signing an international treaty and, in the short term, we demand a programme for the medical examination of soldiers who have taken part in operations in the Balkans, members of humanitarian organisations who have worked in the field and the people living in the areas in question.
. I voted for the moritorium on weapons using depleted uranium.
Ideally I would have preferred a total ban in view of the very high probability that they cause indiscriminate damage to health.
I further deplore them on account of their unacceptable impact on the human and natural environment more widely.
I particularly wish to register profound concern about the environmental damage that is almost certainly being caused by test firing at the Dundrennan Range on the Solway Firth.
These waters already suffer unacceptable levels of radioactive pollution from Sellafield.
Mr President, after all the distressing incidents which occurred during the bombing of Yugoslavia and the disclosures about the use of depleted uranium ammunition, the top priority today is to ban this type of ammunition, which has dangerous consequences both the second it is fired and for a long time afterwards, and which is undiscriminating, i.e. which makes no distinction between those who are at risk of suffering its effects.
We also need, equally urgently, to formulate a large-scale assistance, prevention and reconstruction policy for the whole of Yugoslavia affected by the use of this ammunition, in order to protect public health and the environment, clean up the ground and the waters and safeguard the unimpeded development of the country and the region in general.
The joint motion for a resolution under discussion does not completely cover the first objective, but it does have the merit of calling for a moratorium on the use of these weapons.
As for the second objective, a few general, abstract references are made to existing assistance programmes which, however you look at it, are of limited scope, while there appears to be no sign of any intention to engage in new, efficient intervention at the level of real needs, as circumstances requires.
For the rest, the motion for a resolution extends - with a few brief references - to very serious matters, such as the analysis of and the need for research into depleted uranium, but makes no mention whatsoever of the constant efforts being made to confuse and conceal the facts, independent research which we all know about and even official texts issued by NATO countries on the danger of depleted uranium and the protective measures which they themselves impose on their forces.
It is for these reasons that I am unable to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution.
I shall return a blank ballot paper because the call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium may be a positive step in the right direction, not that this means that war, internationally illegal bombings and other similar, fruitless interventions will stop.
In all events, constant efforts must be made and a mass movement throughout Europe and the whole world must endeavour to bring about a definitive ban on all these weapons, thereby dealing a blow to the high-handedness and arrogance of the militaristic perception of politics and the world.
Finally, I wish to state that I am nonplussed by the political sleight of hand during our debate: just as we were accused in the past of serving NATO and the bombings by criticising Milosevic's policy, now Mr Solana accuses us, in our criticism of the use of depleted uranium, of forgetting the human rights of Milosevic's victims.
In both cases, anyone with a lack of arguments on the matter at issue will forget the principles of rationalism and flirt with the irrational, which is the precursor to any type of totalitarianism or Stalinism.
Resolution on Korea
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of the resolution on Communist Korea.
It goes without saying that we thoroughly deplore the deeds committed by the Communist dictatorship in North Korea since 1950.
The scorn for human dignity that has been displayed is nothing more than the result of the unbridled materialism on which Communism in particular and revolutionary ideology in general are based.
This group expresses the hope that North Korea will in the near future resume a policy of genuine freedom that is an indispensable condition for peace.
In this respect, we are delighted that both North and South Korea have been on better terms for some time now.
This drive to find peace is a source of great hope for thousands of families that have been separated for half a century.
We must do all we can to encourage this change.
Nevertheless, we can but condemn the willingness, indicated in the resolution, to entrust the task of managing relations with Communist Korea to the European Union rather than to Member States.
Need we remind you that diplomacy is one of the regal powers of every sovereign state?
Each state is free to conduct diplomatic relations with any other.
Each nation should be able to retain the freedom to conduct the foreign policy of its choice, the one most suited to its political and economic interests.
However, I sincerely doubt that the Community institutions, swollen as they are with fine-sounding but half-baked principles, are mature enough to deal with the reality.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Council priorities for the meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Council priorities for the meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the European Commission, I am very pleased that, at an early stage in the Swedish Presidency, the opportunity has already been provided to debate this important issue concerning the preparations for the forthcoming meeting with the UN Human Rights Commission.
In the course of the debate, I shall, of course, follow carefully the points of view put forward and interpret the mood of the Assembly before the continued discussion to establish the EU' s position.
The presidency' s objective in the run-up to this year' s session is to unite the EU behind agreed positions, to encourage the applicant countries to back the EU' s statements and resolutions and, as far as at all possible, to muster general support for the proposals - especially, this year, regarding the situations in Iran and Chechnya.
For understandable reasons, it is still unclear quite how the Human Rights Commission' s special session on the situation in the Middle East, held last autumn, is to be followed up.
What is, however, clear is that the issue may be expected to become one of the dominant issues during this year' s session and that the EU will be one of the central players.
In March of last year, the Council requested an assessment of the EU' s human rights dialogue with China.
The conclusions are expected to be adopted at the Council' s meeting at the end of January.
These will define the objectives of the dialogue and specify the forms to be taken both by the dialogue itself and by the regular assessments of the outcome of the dialogue.
It is still unclear whether a resolution on China is to be adopted in this year' s session.
The EU is in close contact with the United States, which was last year' s proposer.
The same applies to another issue that has attracted attention in the Human Rights Commission, namely the resolution regarding the human rights situation in Cuba, for which the Czech Republic and Poland took responsibility last year.
Among the resolutions on particular themes, the EU will, in the future too, take responsibility for the resolutions concerning the rights of the child and the death penalty.
Where women' s rights are concerned, the Human Rights Commission will be deciding upon a number of resolutions to which the EU is strongly committed, even though they are not EU initiatives.
It is as yet uncertain what initiatives will be required from the EU when it comes to the Human Rights Commission' s resolution concerning the World Conference Against Racism, while the EU's participation in the preparations for this World Conference will undoubtedly be one of the greatest challenges during this six-month period.
The so-called omnibus resolution on the rights of the child, prepared in cooperation with the Latin American group, has unfortunately become so extensive that it has become almost impossible to deal with.
It is therefore the EU' s ambition to reduce the size of the resolution to a minimum and, in the process, make the rights perspective central.
This ambition is reinforced by the desire to make a useful contribution to the preparations for the UN' s special session on children in September 2001.
Work in opposition to the death penalty is a priority issue for the EU' s common foreign policy within the area of human rights, as may partly be seen from the EU' s guidelines adopted in 1998.
An important feature of this work is the Human Rights Commission' s resolution concerning the death penalty.
The ambition, this year too, is to achieve as strong support as possible for this resolution.
An important prerequisite for the EU' s active involvement in issues affecting human rights is good access to relevant information.
In this area, the EU countries' and the Commission' s representatives around the world have an important role to play when it comes to gathering information.
Close cooperation with private organisations is a central factor, as is cooperation with regional organisations.
Last but not least, the EU will continue to give every support to the UN' s High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Patten, who had to leave to go to Moscow for a meeting, I should like to praise Parliament for holding this debate today, because it affords us a valuable opportunity for an exchange of views on the forthcoming Commission on Human Rights.
It is important that the views of Parliament are taken into account, as the European Union works towards establishing positions on the main issues which will be covered in Geneva.
New positions on the initiatives in Geneva will only be finally determined after lengthy negotiations, which are, of course, an integral part of the process.
NGOs and others are right to highlight the usefulness of discussion and scrutiny of the positions.
Representatives of the presidency, the Commission services and several Member States attended a meeting of the Human Rights Contact Group held in Brussels on 11 January.
A wide range of NGOs got an opportunity to set out their views with regard to key country and thematic concerns and this input will no doubt prove helpful to the deliberation process.
The 56th Commission on Human Rights of last year inevitably had its high and low points.
The adoption of the resolution tabled by the European Union on the death penalty was a welcome achievement.
The European Union may repeat this move this year, reflecting the fact that the issue remains of paramount concern.
The Swedish Presidency has signalled more generally that the efforts made by the European Union in connection with the death penalty will be continued and intensified.
There was disappointment at the adoption of a no-action motion on China.
Some members of the Human Rights Commission voted against, making clear that such motions can only serve to stifle discussion and undermine the very raison d'Ãªtre of the gathering.
As I have noted, decisions regarding EU resolutions for this year's 57th Commission in Geneva have not been finalised, as is usual for this stage of the process.
The presidency and Member States are examining the situation in several countries, taking into account, where appropriate, the information from the United Nations' special rapporteurs and other evidence available.
I will venture brief comments on some issues of interest which, whether or not they form part of an EU initiative, will doubtless be topics of discussion for those attending the 57th Commission.
Familiar concerns remain with respect to China, concerns which continue to be heard as part of the EU-China dialogue.
Positive developments in recent months include the signature of a memorandum of understanding on human rights with the United Nations High Commissioner last November.
It is nonetheless essential that dialogue leads to concrete change, a point reiterated by the European Union in Geneva last year.
With this in mind, the human rights dialogue with China is currently the object of an evaluation exercise which will lead to the adoption of conclusions by the January General Affairs Council.
They will form the basis for carrying forward the dialogue in a constructive and meaningful manner.
As regards Iran, the resolution adopted at the 55th session of the General Assembly in New York welcomed the positive changes in that country.
However, it also noted, with concern, continuing difficulties with regard to the restriction of freedoms, the use of executions and torture and discrimination directed against religious minorities and women.
The interim report submitted to the General Assembly last September by Mr Copithorne, the special representative, reflected the need to invigorate the progress towards improving human rights.
Access by the special representative remains, of course, a key preoccupation.
Finally, as a thematic concern, children's issues will deservedly receive much attention this year, not least at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly scheduled for September.
With this in mind, the European Union will continue to play an active role in the resolution on children's rights at Geneva and, as last year, will seek the useful cooperation of the Latin American and the Caribbean group.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for their remarks. In particular for what they have had to say about the death penalty and the situation in China and Iran.
I only regret that the word Russia was not mentioned by either gentleman because it occurs to me that the situation in Russia is worrying.
This needs to be considered by the Commission in particular if we are to look towards a satisfactory human rights situation in Europe as a whole.
With any luck the timing will be good and Mr Patten will be able to raise certain questions with the Russian President.
It is very timely that this matter should come up because it is nearly ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
At that time we had very high hopes that the whole of Europe would become a human rights-favourable zone but of course things never turn out exactly as one hopes.
The situation in particular in Byelorussia has deteriorated dramatically and there have been the most horrible civil wars and massacres on a massive scale in the Balkans.
We must congratulate ourselves in Europe on some progress but not enough has been achieved.
I am particularly happy to see what has occurred in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The human rights situation in those countries has improved dramatically and in the Baltic States with the build-up of the mixed economic system.
Some people do not consider that to be a human right, but I believe in fact that it is and represents another step forward that we should welcome.
It moves me very deeply every summer to see in the resorts of the Mediterranean and elsewhere large numbers of holidaymakers from eastern and central Europe including Russia holidaying in the way that we have done for many decades.
It is, as a British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, used to say, the main purpose of a foreign policy to allow citizens to be able to travel with a minimum of bureaucratic interference and annoyance.
I believe though that I should mention two or three of the particular problems of Russia.
One of them is one in which I have a registered interest, namely the question of Media-Most, and the alternative television system of Russia.
I hope that Mr Patten is well briefed on the question of the present detention of the chairman of Media-Most, Mr Vladimir Gusinsky.
He is rather surprisingly in his house near Malaga in Spain. I find it bizarre that the Spanish police are fulfilling a request made by the former KGB in this way.
The war on dissent continues on the part of Mr Putin.
He seems not to have a sense of humour.
He does not like to see himself portrayed on the television by a glove puppet with jokes being made at his expense.
It seems that it is not appropriate for the President of Russia to be lampooned in this way and so he will not tolerate it.
It is a most unpleasant feud made all the more unpleasant by the fact that one side is enjoying the support of the President of Russia.
This is not satisfactory and I hope it will be dealt with during Mr Patten's visit.
Very briefly, the other points I would mention in respect of Russia are the situation in the Russian army, in particular in Chechnya, but also internally because the Russian army is notorious these days for the cruelty which it exerts and in particular the treatment of its young conscript soldiers.
I have also watched with concern in the past year the tendency of the present leaders of Russia - many of whom are ex-KGB because they were appointed by a former colonel in the KGB - to be a little bit trigger-happy in the arrest of so-called British, American and Russian spies.
This is really something that is quite unnecessary I would have thought in the post cold-war environment.
So, with those reservations I congratulate the Commission and the President-in-Office and look forward to an improvement in human rights in the coming year.
Mr President, last year I attended the 56th UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and last week, I attended the Human Rights Contact Group: much more needs to be done and, if anything, the situation is worsening across the world.
The promotion and defence of human rights is a high priority for the European Union and remains one of the fundamental principles of the Union.
Indeed, I believe the concept of human rights should inform everything we do in the name of democracy because a negative human rights situation is often caused or exacerbated by the absence of democracy and inefficient and corrupt government structures.
Human rights do not exist in isolation, neither should they be considered in abstract.
They are the fundamental rights of all people regardless of who they are, where or to whom they are born.
Yet as we speak in this Chamber, the human rights of men, women and children are being violated.
This is why the Council and the Member States must work for the universal ratification of the main human rights instruments available to all countries, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, already mentioned, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and the extremely important Convention against Torture.
We also call for immediate measures to be taken to protect homosexual persons from degrading and inhuman treatment to which they are still subjected: because of their sexuality, they still face the death penalty in certain parts of the world.
We also call on the EU to support the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the other international organisations and NGOs in the fight against repression of the independent media already referred to by Lord Bethell and the repression of journalists and writers and to urge all states to end censorship, to protect the right of access to official information and to stop the restriction on access to modern information technology, often a saviour to people being repressed.
We also call upon the Council and the UN Commission on Human Rights to give full support to the drafting of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.
Once again, and I hope not in vain, we call for the abolition of the death penalty.
Countries can, will and should be named and shamed, but in this House and together with the Council and the UN Commission, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that men, women and children are born equal and can live as equals, enjoying the fundamental freedoms of human rights.
That is the message that this House must carry to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and I hope everyone in this House will support such an intention.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the European Union is an important community of values standing for democracy, humanitarianism and human rights.
This is the basis not only for our internal work but also for our foreign policy.
In many respects, the EU has a good policy on human rights. What, however, is missing is a coherent and consistent strategy for the way in which the work on promoting this is to be carried out.
The various institutions are not always coordinated and there is a lack of follow-up and analysis, and this, of course, reduces our influence.
Prior to the session in Geneva, I and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party hope for a strong and unified Europe which will vigorously pursue a number of issues.
It was good to hear of the ambitions of the Swedish Presidency here today.
It is good that the Council supports the resolution on the death penalty and on the rights of the child and of women.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would also call upon the Council to support the drawing up of protocols to the Convention Against Torture, as well as to support a new international convention concerning those who have disappeared.
The issue of refugees must also be raised.
Violations of human rights occur in many countries.
These must always be criticised, and when they occur in EU countries too.
In certain countries, the situation is alarming, however.
I really want to appeal to the Council to try to bring about a resolution on China, where outrages against Chinese citizens are becoming worse and worse, especially violence against Falun Gong members, which has been stepped up.
The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned Iran and Chechnya.
I should also like to add Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Indonesia and Afghanistan.
In these countries, too, the situation is very alarming.
Both the UN and the EU are important voices in the international debate.
Many countries listen and take note of signals from 'Brussels' .
We can make use of this position to fight actively for human rights.
It requires consistency, courage and a more thoroughly worked out strategy.
I hope that the Swedish Presidency can help formulate such a strategy, not only prior to Geneva but also for the future, which is a natural arena for the EU' s foreign policy.
Mr President, human rights are an inseparable part of the basis of human dignity and law in the Union.
They are also universal principles, despite certain differences in emphasis.
However, the EU will have no human rights strategy whilst the responsibility continues to remain primarily with the Member States.
As there is no strategy, tactics then become the strategy.
With human rights that means that political expediency might dictate where and when to intervene when violations are occurring.
To some extent that is inevitable.
A community based on respect for, and defence of, human rights, such as the EU, should, however, be able to achieve a more consistent, determined policy on human rights than is the case at present.
It would be desirable if the Union had a common voice in this important area.
For that reason the opportunity we now have well beforehand to discuss the Council' s priorities in the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission is a welcome one.
Human rights violations must be taken seriously at all times and not just when a political excuse is needed.
Human rights have intrinsic value, which becomes blurred when they are used as a tool to achieve other, perhaps quite legitimate objectives in themselves, in individual cases, or when gross violations are kept quiet about for politico-commercial, or other, reasons.
This is a tendency that can also be discerned in our approach to the questions on the Human Rights Commission' s agenda, regionally, nationally and with regard to the issues themselves.
For example, suppression of the freedom of speech or torture with the perpetrators going unpunished, which Amnesty International has recently campaigned against, deserve to be looked into more thoroughly.
Ad hoc action is not enough, then, but neither must human rights merely be a rhetorical sweetener present everywhere, like a political 'NutraSweet' , with no real practical effect.
For the EU' s voice to carry further and more audibly it must have a consistent policy, one that is genuinely its own, and must firm up its work in this area.
Interinstitutional cooperation should therefore become more vigorous in the future and the role of the European Parliament in particular should be made more prominent.
Above all, we here in Parliament should also activate and honour our rhetorical commitments.
That means long-term, systematic involvement in human rights work when it is not directly connected with benefits to be gained or current events covered by the media.
We have to make the reporting and monitoring process more effective, which will require not only good will but also adequate resources and diplomatic willingness.
Non-governmental organisations and civil societies are sources of indispensable help.
They can also bring a breath of fresh air to that vacuum in which we busy about far too much with matters of only rather narrow, topical interest.
Mr President, Mr Vitorino, President-in-Office of the Council, in preparing a resolution on a subject like human rights, there are in fact two possibilities: we can state principles and avoid naming specific areas; or we can do as we have in fact done, namely name a number of specific areas and so run the risk of forgetting some things.
That is partly what this speech is about.
However, I want first of all to say that I am very pleased indeed that something about the situation in China has been included, and I want heartily to support the amendments tabled.
Something ought perhaps also to have been included about the situation regarding religious freedom for the Falun Gong sect, but it was not.
There is nonetheless some quite sharp criticism, and I am very glad about that.
I am also pleased that Chechnya has been mentioned.
I think this is an area to which we do not pay enough attention.
It is an area which may yet become a powder keg for security policy in that area, and perhaps also in our own area.
There are some areas to which I think too little priority has been given.
The Swedish Presidency says that it will give high priority to the work done towards abolishing the death penalty.
I am extremely pleased about that, and I very much agree that this is an area to which high priority should be given.
In this connection, we need to keep our eyes on our so-called friends.
I think we have to be aware of the situation in the United States.
Following the American presidential election, the number of death sentences carried out in the United States will reach record levels.
We are in a situation in which there are people on death row in the United States who, we are quite convinced, have not been given fair trials, nor who will in fact be given fair trials unless outside powers help them, for the system will not of itself produce these.
I also think we have to remember another of our 'friends' , namely Turkey - an applicant country - which we do not mention at all in this resolution.
It is a problem that we still have a country so close to us which will not abolish the death penalty, which will not introduce general democratic rights for ethnic minorities and which has not acquired control over the methods its police use, either on the street or in its jails.
Turkey does not comply with the Convention Against Torture.
By establishing a Fortress Europe, we are not doing much to help those people who flee from countries of that type, and allow me, in conclusion, to say to the Swedish Presidency, 'Remember, we do not improve the situation of refugees by building a Fortress Europe around ourselves.'
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the views of our fellow members are clear.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mrs Frahm have just spoken on the subject of China.
Lord Bethell spoke about Chechnya.
However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you refer to the Union' s consensus position.
We know from experience that the Union' s consensus position is the method that you have come up with in order to avoid adopting any serious position in Geneva.
We already saw this last year, when the Union hid behind the United States and other countries until the last moment in order to avoid adopting any real initiative on Chechnya and on the People' s Republic of China.
Unfortunately, I fear that my own party, the radical party, will again this year be one of the only parties, along with Wei Jinsheng and a few others, to speak up for the issue of human rights in China and Tibet; who will bring the issue of Chechnya to the fore, while the Council, and the European Union which it represents, will again be absent from the United Nations.
You will be working on the matter of the death penalty, knowing full well that this issue today concerns the United Nations General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights and, thus, once again you will be hiding behind fine principles in, if I may say so, a rather hypocritical manner.
Mr President, in previous debates on the human rights situation I have advocated repeatedly that the European Union should take more preventive action and respond more rapidly to crises.
It therefore surprised me somewhat not to hear either the presidency or the Commission breathe a word about the human rights situation in Africa just now in the introduction.
That is why I shall make bold to start out by drawing attention to a highly topical situation, and one which is potentially very explosive on the human rights front, namely the situation in Congo following the assassination of President Kabila.
Despite confusing, and often conflicting information, it is gradually dawning on us that there is a risk of a power vacuum developing in Kinshasa.
That is why it is so important to quickly and effectively urge the new leaders to do all they possibly can to maintain calm and serenity in Kinshasa and to respect human rights.
At the same time, I believe all those countries that are involved in the conflict, be it directly or indirectly, must be urged in no uncertain terms not to interfere in the current internal crisis.
If the neighbouring countries do not lie low then the crisis could escalate further, with all the consequences this might entail.
It is important for the thread of the Lusaka peace process to be picked up quickly though, and for the inter-Congolese dialogue to be able to start, with the cooperation of all concerned.
I say that with the Rwandan genocide of 1994 in mind, when the international community had to witness the murder of hundreds of thousands of people, which prompts me to push for more assertiveness from the European Union, and greater alertness, also on the part of the UN, where Central Africa is concerned.
This brings me to the agenda of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
Notwithstanding the numerous treaties and conventions, the rights of women, children and other vulnerable groups are still being violated on a huge scale.
Throughout the world, one woman in three suffers physical abuse.
Fifty million children work in unacceptable conditions and two million girls below the age of fifteen are forced into prostitution every year.
I would like to ask that special attention be given to two forms of human rights violations that have taken on alarming proportions in Europe over the last few years.
Firstly, there is the phenomenon of paedophilia and child pornography.
Whilst we rightly criticise Asian countries because they allow child labour, or African countries because of their child soldiers, we are regularly shocked here in Western Europe by paedophilia and child porn scandals.
I would like to draw your attention to the excellent report by Mr Kirkhope on the subject.
Two new revelations show how serious the situation is.
A network of people offering photographs of sex and acts of cruelty with children via the Internet was rounded up in Italy recently.
Last week, the British police succeeded in shutting the Wonderland club down, seizing 750 000 degrading photographs of children in the process.
A second disturbing phenomenon is that of trafficking in human beings.
Every year, around 30 million or so people are smuggled into other countries, half a million of whom end up in the European Union.
Trafficking in human beings has become a very lucrative international industry, often risking the lives of the passengers.
So many corpses of drowned illegals get washed up on Spanish beaches that it has sparked off a macabre debate as to who should pay for the burials.
In both cases, the desperation of poor people is being exploited by unscrupulous money-grabbers.
In both cases there is a need for information to be provided in the countries of origin, and for coordination between international police forces, in a bid to tackle these abuses.
Sweden has a good reputation when it comes to defending human rights in the world.
I really hope that Sweden will do its reputation full justice over the next six months and put all its efforts into the recommendations that Parliament has formulated in these two important areas.
Mr President, the UN Commission on Human Rights is not just a discussion forum but also an exceptional instrument for the dissemination and defence of human rights.
Undeniably, the composition of the Commission and the dubious solidarity between member states who have little respect for human rights often prevent us adopting clear-cut, distinct conclusions, or even any conclusion at all.
However, the very fact that a serious breach of human rights in a United Nations member state should be mentioned at Geneva is really a political fact in itself.
The countries on the receiving end of the criticism decry "name calling" and are lobbying hard in advance to prevent any discussion, and this is exactly where the European Parliament, being so committed to the defence of human rights, can fully play its part.
In conjunction with the relevant NGOs, and particularly with Amnesty International and the human rights leagues, Parliament can address the Council and Member States in order to insist that, in Geneva, the Fifteen present well-founded common positions on priority issues.
For 2001, the priority issues that I believe should be discussed in Geneva are, first and foremost, the death penalty, torture, forms of discrimination against women, failure to respect children' s rights, freedom of the press and freedom of information.
Among recent forms of human rights violations, the instances of disappearance or extrajudicial execution, often preceded by torture, are particularly despicable.
The victims are undoubtedly always political opponents of the regimes in power.
These violations, against which there is no possible appeal, have been recorded in the Russian Federation (in relation to Chechnya), in Sierra Leone, Indonesia, Colombia, Iran and Iraq, in Palestinian territories occupied by Israel and in Turkey, amongst other places. I could go on and on.
This list is long but it is not comprehensive.
Parliament will do itself credit by demanding that the governments of Europe adopt a firm position on this issue.
We have just approved the new Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We must act in accordance with our principles.
The victims' families are awaiting our action.
Mr President, it is more than 50 years since we adopted the Declaration of Human Rights, but we probably need to ask ourselves whether the human rights situation has in actual fact improved.
That is not an easy question to answer, but we know more today than we once did, thanks partly to the many NGOs and journalists who constantly report on human rights violations around the world, and knowledge is a prerequisite for action.
But there is, in fact, an obligation to act upon information, so that not to do anything is to let down those whose rights are being violated, and in this area the EU has an independent responsibility.
As many speakers have mentioned, the EU has quite a high profile in the area of human rights, and that is both a good and a bad thing.
It is crucial that we are consistent and specific.
In relation to Central and Eastern European countries, we have had success with our policy, which can probably best be characterised as an iron fist in a velvet glove.
However, that is not enough, for human rights violations do not, of course, stop at Europe' s borders.
Therefore, it is also gratifying that we have focused on human rights in connection with the new ACP-EU partnership agreements.
However, we must be certain that we are in a position to follow through and take action if it proves that human rights are being violated.
If we have to introduce sanctions in Central and Eastern Europe, then everyone will be affected.
The situation of the developing countries is quite different in this respect.
If we are obliged to introduce sanctions, which more often than not will only affect the poor sector of the population, we therefore need, where developing countries are concerned, to establish a special strategy with regard to sanctions so that we do not only hit those we really wanted to help, as well as those who have suffered in the past.
This constitutes a very large task for the EU as a whole and also for the European Parliament.
We must be clear which sanctions are to be imposed.
However, it is of course crucial for us to work with human rights more generally so that we can obtain some comparable figures, for Parliament is inclined to intervene as soon as we hear that a human right is being violated somewhere or other.
When we go out into the world, we must try to be very specific and see what the human rights situation is like in the countries concerned. We can organise meetings with human rights activists and human rights organisations in the area and we can arrange for the final report to deal with human rights issues.
I should like, in conclusion, to say that those areas dealt with in the resolution are important, but that they are not, of course, the only areas demanding our attention.
That is why I have touched upon a number of other areas today.
Mr President, I would like to concentrate on three issues in this debate on the preparation of the annual human rights conference in Geneva, and the European Union' s role in this.
I would like to say a few things about the situation in Burma, and in Indonesia, and about the child soldier phenomenon.
It is already almost ten years since Aung San Suu Kyi was chosen as President of Burma and the Burmese Parliament received a majority of her party, the NLD.
Since then, Burma has been suffering under a military dictatorship, scores of MPs have been murdered or have fled, and there is talk of unprecedented acts of terror being committed against political opponents and minorities.
I have long been a member of Pidi-Burma, a group under the leadership of former Premier Bondevik of Norway, and I have visited the refugee camps of the Burmese in Thailand.
I have a rough idea of what is happening in the country.
I now hear that there is a possibility of talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the military command, and that next month, a delegation from the European Union under the leadership of Sweden is going to travel to Burma.
However, beware of being led up the garden path.
The military regime out there has made so-called concessions before, which later proved to be absolutely worthless, and this often happened just before an EU-ASEAN Summit, or just before the conference in Geneva.
Our advice is please keep a highly critical resolution about Burma to hand in Geneva and do not have any qualms about pushing for investment freezes or sanctions on that front.
I emphasise this point not because I am any particular fan of sanctions, but if there is one country that does deserve them, it is Burma.
Then there is Indonesia, a country in the midst of a democratisation process and where the government is having to deal with tough opposition.
The country is facing enormous problems in a number of regions such as Aceh, the Moluccas, Irian Jaya and Timor.
By all accounts, more than a million people have now fled and tens of thousands have been killed or wounded.
Disaffected soldiers and fundamentalist Muslim groups are mainly the ones to blame for serious violations of human rights.
The government is not doing enough about it and so a resolution in Geneva would be both beneficial and necessary.
The idea would not be to attack the Wahid government, but to urge it to deal with the human rights violations more effectively and bring the culprits to justice.
Lastly, I would like to draw attention to the growing problem, particularly in Africa, of the child soldiers, who are incited to commit the most terrible, drug-induced acts.
We see evidence of this in the Sudan, and Sierra Leone, and the phenomenon is also on the increase in a number of other countries.
What we are talking about here is a double human rights violation.
First, these children are abducted, and then they are brainwashed, using drugs and other techniques, into maiming and murdering people.
And when I look at the regime in Sudan, I feel this warrants additional criticism because it admits these groups to its territory in southern Sudan in order to carry on a reign of terror in Uganda.
These groups also abduct girls from schools in northern Uganda for special services.
What this in fact means is that these children suffer a triple injustice.
There is an urgent need for a robust statement on these practices in Geneva, as I see it, and I also call upon the European Union to table a resolution in this vein.
Mr President, naturally I support the criticism of China with regard to Tibet, of Russia with regard to Chechnya, and I endorse the criticism voiced in relation to the human rights violations in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, also when it comes to the repugnant public lynchings that are carried out.
I approve of the criticism levelled at Iran and its lack of religious freedom, freedom for women and press freedom, but do not forget Burma and Indonesia and the child soldiers.
That was the message I particularly wanted to get across.
Mr President, last year, only a few votes prevented the inclusion of the continuing human-rights abuses in China on the agenda in Geneva.
I hope we can be more successful in the coming months in winning over countries that will be represented on the Commission on Human Rights at its 57th session.
Last weekend, in my role as chairman of the Tibet Intergroup of the European Parliament, I attended a conference in Switzerland, where parliamentarians from the EU Member States, the applicant countries and the United States discussed ways of inducing their respective countries to raise the issue of China's gross violations of human rights.
These abuses not only affect the Tibetans but the Uighurs and Mongols too.
Free speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement are suppressed.
The Tibetans cannot practise their own religion or celebrate their own culture and certainly cannot engage in autonomous political activity.
Tens of thousands of them have been subjected to persecution, imprisonment and torture.
A sustained campaign is being conducted with a view to converting Buddhist believers into atheists.
We cannot close our eyes to this second cultural revolution.
I am not unaware, Commissioner Vitorino, of the dialogue between the European Union and China.
Nor am I unaware of the role played by China as a member of the WTO and a future global power.
Attempts are being made to deal more sensitively with major trading partners.
I trust that, some day, the old guard of blinkered centralist leaders will be replaced by new reformist elements.
But we cannot wait until that day finally dawns.
We cannot be passive onlookers and fail these masses of people who are being subjected to mental and physical cruelty.
Human rights are not a Western invention.
The new agreements between the European Union and third countries rightly stipulate that contractual obligations will be suspended in the event of either party's failure to respect human rights.
We therefore appeal to the Council and Member States of the EU to take the initiative in Geneva this time; as you said, Mr Danielsson, we are one of the key players.
Along with the United States, Canada and, as I have learned, Switzerland and the applicant countries for accession to the EU, we should try to convince the countries of Africa, Asia and South America that it is high time the subject of China was put on the agenda in Geneva.
Human rights are not of secondary importance. Human rights are universal fundamental rights.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to say thank you for the strong support which I understand that this Assembly and its honourable Members have given to positive action by the European Union in the course of the Commission' s forthcoming meeting in Geneva.
I would also thank you for the many practical points of view which have been presented in the debate.
Allow me to comment on a few of them.
First of all, Russia and, more specifically, Chechnya. Lord Bethell is right.
It was Chechnya and not Russia that I mentioned.
I just want to emphasise that it is the Council' s view that the situation in Chechnya is still serious.
It cannot perhaps be said to be as urgent as it has been in previous years, but it is our judgement that we ought to follow up the resolution presented and adopted last year because of the serious situation in Chechnya.
We have not therefore in any way forgotten this important issue.
A number of speakers discussed the situation in China.
I want definitely to repudiate notions to the effect that the European Union is trying to hide behind other countries when it comes to combating violations of human rights in China.
At the same time, it is important that, when we do something about the human rights situation in China, we can in actual fact bring together a sufficiently large group of countries in the UN Human Rights Commission in order to achieve some progress.
There are problems here, to which many of the Members referred in their speeches.
Right now, we are engaged in a dialogue with China.
There will be an opportunity here next month to have a discussion with the Chinese about how the European Union views the situation.
However, we also need to conduct further discussions with the incoming administration in the United States because the United States is traditionally the proposer and has been so where this resolution is concerned.
I can therefore promise the honourable Members that the European Union is continuing to pay attention to the situation in China.
Mrs Frahm discussed the issue of the death penalty, which is incredibly important.
Obviously, the European Union must distance itself from the death penalty wherever it is used - including, of course, in the United States.
I am particularly grateful that Mr Johan Van Hecke and others have discussed the human rights situation in Africa and am only sorry that I myself did not do so in my introductory speech. It is, of course, not only a question of concern about human rights.
Rather, we all know that, in many African countries, the problems are more deep-seated. It is not, therefore, only human rights that are the problem.
That must not, of course, prevent us from paying attention to the problems that exist.
I can promise Mr Johan Van Hecke that the European Union will take careful account of what has been said in this debate where Africa in particular is concerned.
In conclusion, a few words about the situation in Burma/Myanmar.
This year too, the European Union is preparing a proposal concerning the situation in Burma/Myanmar, to be presented at the meeting of the Human Rights Commission.
It can only be seen as one element in a general strategy for discussing the human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar.
For example, Sweden has for many years been responsible for a resolution in the UN' s General Assembly about the situation in Burma/Myanmar, and the European Union as a whole is actively engaged in the discussions in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) when it comes to the fact that forced labour still exists in Burma.
A range of measures have been mooted there, which the European Union strongly supports.
I would therefore express my thanks for all the practical points of view and promise to include them in the Council' s continued deliberations prior to the Human Rights Commission' s important meeting in Geneva later this year.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, let me very briefly say and reiterate that the Commission will fully take into account the opinions expressed by the parliamentarians and emphasise that in my presentation I did not touch upon all the subjects that could be taken into consideration.
That is why this debate today is extremely important, as is the parallel debate with the NGOs, so that we can gather as much information as possible and incorporate it in the position of the European Union in preparation for the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights.
A few concrete words on some of the remarks.
First of all, addressing Mr Thomas Mann, I emphasise once again that the Commission is looking forward to evaluating the dialogue on human rights with China and we hope to see concrete conclusions from that evaluation at the General Affairs Council this month, as the President-in-Office said.
In our concerns, of course, we did not forget Africa, or Russia, or Burma, or even some horizontal issues which are extremely important, like the protection of minorities, discrimination of all kinds or the abolition of torture - I think those are recurrent concerns as far as defending human rights is concerned.
I would conclude by emphasising that we place great emphasis on preparing the position of the European Union for the UN General Assembly on Children's Rights, and I welcome the willingness of the Swedish Presidency to take this position very seriously in September.
Let me also tell Mr Van Hecke that I fully share his concerns about the threat of trafficking in human beings.
May I remind you that the Commission has just adopted two proposals for framework decisions, one aiming to fight trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation and the other to fight against trafficking in human beings for economic exploitation.
These will be two important penal instruments to harmonise the legislation to combat criminal trans-national networks that exploit trafficking in human beings.
We are in the lead in raising awareness and giving the police and the judiciary of the fifteen Member States the necessary harmonised legal instruments to fight against those threats to human rights and to stability in the 15 Member States.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 4.10 p.m. and resumed at 4.30 p.m., pending the beginning of the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council)
Programme of the Swedish Presidency
It is my very great pleasure to welcome Mr Persson, the Swedish Prime Minister.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that it is an honour to welcome you to the Chamber for the first time, for the start of the Swedish Presidency, We wish you every success.
Without further ado, I shall give you the floor.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your speech.
I shall now give the floor to Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Persson.
This is the first time that Sweden has held the presidency of the Council and it has outlined its priorities, the famous 3 Es, which are in line with the manifesto of the European Socialists and Social Democrats, because I am able to say with pride that Mr Persson and his party belong to my own political family, and the statement which the Swedish Prime Minister has made here in favour of the European social model and its ability to adapt in this era of globalisation is a further source of pride.
On employment, I would like to tell him that he can count on our support at the Stockholm Summit for talks on employment, innovation and the term upon which he ended his speech, social cohesion.
On enlargement, I hope that Sweden' s enthusiasm for enlargement will help the European Union to find greater favour with the Swedish people.
On the environment, we support Sweden' s initiative to put sustainable development into practice.
Madam President, the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to an issue we consider fundamental and that is the image of Europe held by public opinion in Europe.
The barometer of European public opinion, published in recent days in various newspapers, illustrates the schizophrenia we face.
The people of Europe, even the British, are asking for more European solutions to problems, yet at the same time they still have very little confidence in European institutions.
This is an issue which affects us in the Commission and Parliament, but also the national governments.
We see evidence of this in the mad cow problem.
The Commission, by which I mean the Santer Commission, fulfilled its role, as did the Prodi Commission.
Parliament set up a committee of inquiry in 1997 and, this weekend, we have seen once again, in the case of Austria and Italy, how governments finally recognise the problem when they have no other option.
They are still burying their heads in the sand, when what we need are European solutions to European problems.
The next issue which is going to keep the Swedish Presidency busy, and indeed which is going to keep us all busy, from the year 2001, which is just beginning, until the year 2004 - a four-year period in which many elections are to take place, including European elections, is the 'post-Nice' scenario.
I would like to appeal to the Swedish Presidency.
You are admittedly no past masters at negotiating the institutional labyrinth of the Community.
You do, however, have recognised experience in the areas of democracy and transparency, and that is what we need at this moment in time.
You therefore have a special responsibility.
Indeed, I welcome the commitment you expressed to arriving at a clear agreement on such a sensitive issue as access to documents, but we have to go further than that.
You went through the five days of the European Council in Nice, and you will have been as exhausted by it as your colleagues.
I agree with President Prodi that it is not the Monnet method which is in question here, but the intergovernmental method because, and I would like to point this out to him, and this is an ongoing scandal, our ambassadors are still in the process of concluding negotiations.
You said that the Treaty would be signed within a month.
We shall have to wait and see what changes are introduced into the Treaty.
This is not acceptable.
We must see an end to this method.
(Applause)
Therefore, apart from what you said at the end, there is a positive element in Annex IV in that it does not refer to another Intergovernmental Conference. You mention a Conference of Member States.
Moreover, you have said specifically that Parliament has a unique role in taking the initiative, and as we are being innovative here, I am going to accept President Prodi' s proposal, a Commission initiative which I welcome.
We have four years to get to work.
He proposed a three-phase operation, with the first phase consisting of open deliberations.
I would urge the Council to become involved in this first phase, which you have to begin and end at Laeken, during which we have to determine the method we can use to make progress, and consider not just the future of the Union but the future of the enlarged Union because, post-Nice, those countries are already on side and they must learn how we operate, which is no mean feat.
Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would also ask you to put forward initiatives for the Laeken Summit at the end of the year.
Secondly, what method should we adopt?
For me and my group the method should be the democratic method employed in all our countries: open debate in Parliament, recorded in full.
These days it is available on the Internet.
That is a way of adapting and improving the Convention method, nothing more.
Naturally, thereafter, the debate should be redistributed through all forms of the media, but civil society should not be placed in opposition to Parliaments, because we live in representative democracies and we have to work out a complex system.
Lastly, Madam President, and this is my final point, I believe that the Conference of Member States must be the last act, when decisions on practical matters are made, and it should not be a tiresome and endless process.
That brings me, Madam President, to what really is my final point, to say that you could have added another E to the European process, and I say this as a Spaniard, and that would be the Spanish word for 'hope' - esperanza.
(Applause)
Madam President, Commission, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister here. The next six months will be an exciting period.
Important political tasks await us, and a successful presidency may hopefully also have a positive effect on public opinion.
It can show our fellow countrymen at home that good things can be accomplished together in the EU.
It can show our European colleagues here that Sweden is not in opposition to the European project but, rather, wishes to take a constructive part in it.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party fully supports Sweden' s decision to make enlargement a priority.
There is no task more important than creating a united Europe, and the negotiations really need to take a major leap forward this spring.
We would also like to have a date for when the first countries will be able to join us.
Another issue - in which the Prime Minister has the support of both the Liberals and of large sections of Parliament - concerns openness.
Public access to documents is an important democratic issue, which is central to citizens' confidence in the entire EU project.
During the autumn, the Council has been treading water on this issue - the work on Article 255 - and it is time that we saw some results.
We have great hopes of Sweden and of Sweden' s role in promoting and powerfully defending the model applied, for instance, in Sweden and the Netherlands.
As a case in point, why not begin by opening up the meetings of the Council of Ministers?
The issue of democracy is also closely related to the events which are now to take place post-Nice.
The treaties must be simplified.
The EU' s tasks and powers must be more clearly defined.
We Liberals also believe that Europeans need a common European constitution.
Citizens must be involved in the work which will follow on from the conclusions of the Nice summit.
It is up to Sweden to initiate the phase which President Prodi calls 'open reflection' .
It would be nice to be told in rather more concrete terms how the Prime Minister views this task, the method and these issues, which require further work before the Belgian Presidency begins.
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, I have chosen to speak Swedish today, since it is my country' s second native language.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I really believe that the expectations at the start of the Swedish Presidency are very high following our experiences with the French Presidency.
Personally, I am convinced that Sweden will once more confirm the rule that the smaller Member States are often more impartial, something which will favour the common European interest over narrower national interests.
This is your first presidency, and your Ambassador - if I may say this in public - has very nicely compared a first presidency with losing one' s virginity.
He certainly did not wish to lose it in a violent manner.
I can assure you that the European Parliament can make a presidency easier and that you will therefore lose your virginity in a very gentle and amicable way.
My Group wants to see progress particularly in the following areas. Sustainable development must become a reality now.
It is now or never.
The objectives and indicators must be confirmed in Gothenburg in accordance with what you have told us.
Civil crisis management is something which can be promoted under a Swedish Presidency.
Conflict prevention in all areas of foreign policy is very important to our Group.
We welcome your promise of a programme in this area.
Something which perhaps does not have as clear an emphasis on the Swedish agenda is a comprehensive reform of the EU' s agricultural policy, based on the fact that our food must be made safe again.
The environment must no longer be damaged and animals must no longer be mistreated.
I have been following the Swedish debate and learned that you suddenly discovered that you are really a vegetarian, or at least a part-time vegetarian.
May I welcome you to the club.
It may come as a surprise to yourself and to the citizens of Sweden, but this is one of a number of areas which require more, not less, of a European input.
Environmental taxes are an obvious example.
Everybody appreciates that the insistence on unanimity needs to be abandoned in this area.
As my colleagues have also pointed out, what we need here is a Community method, that is to say strong common institutions - namely the Commission and Parliament - instead of a method of intergovernmental cooperation.
To a large extent, the method of intergovernmental cooperation consists of meetings behind closed doors which are outside parliamentary control.
This will not lead to the openness you are striving for.
I should like to call this a 'Swedish paradox' .
You must realise that, in order to have openness, the method of intergovernmental cooperation needs to be abolished.
In the wake of the Nice Summit, it is important that we introduce a comprehensive reform of the EU in which the national parliaments and the European Parliament take an active part.
I hope you take up the challenge set out by the President of the Commission.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, there are several points in the programme of the Swedish Presidency which we in the United Left support.
In our opinion, the priorities - enlargement, the environment and employment - are important as well as justified.
There are also other positive features of the programme which deserve to be highlighted.
These include measures to combat trafficking in women and the efforts to attain lasting peace in Palestine.
Where the discussions on enlargement are concerned, we consider it to be of vital importance that the EU take into consideration the specific needs of the applicant countries and that these countries not be offered a second-class EU membership.
In relation to this objective, the outcome of the Nice Summit is a failure.
No reforms to the EU were actually made there which would facilitate enlargement.
Instead, the decision process became more complicated.
It is also totally unacceptable that applicant countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary should have been directly discriminated against in that they will receive fewer places in the European Parliament than EU countries with comparable populations.
This is an embarrassing mistake which must be rectified.
My first question to the Swedish Presidency is therefore the following: Are you prepared to deal with, and rectify, this mistake in the Accession Treaties which are now about to be negotiated?
Certain EU countries want to exclude citizens of the future EU countries from the Union' s labour market for a long period.
Such discrimination is not acceptable.
Instead, it is of vital importance that all those working in an EU country should be obliged to observe that country' s agreements and laws on the labour market, so that free movement does not result in dumping where social provisions are concerned.
Real left-wing politics must give top priority to employment even in matters of economic policy, instead of to the dogmatic monetarism which currently dominates the EU and economic and monetary union.
Such a policy would also require democratic control of the European Central Bank.
Irrespective of their political complexion, present-day EU governments have, however, made the adaptation to EMU their priority, rather than welfare and the fight against unemployment.
This policy must be reconsidered.
In various parts of the European Union, there are growing demands for the continuous deregulations and free speculation we are witnessing today to be replaced by a situation in which unbridled capitalism is controlled by political decisions.
One of the demands being made is for taxation on currency transactions, a so-called Tobin tax.
Several members of the Swedish Government have talked in positive terms about this idea.
Now - during this presidency - is your golden opportunity to take initiatives.
My second question to the presidency is therefore the following: What initiatives regarding a 'Tobin tax' are you planning during your presidency?
During the next six months, the most important question regarding environmental issues will be the negotiations in connection with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
It is extremely important to reach an agreement over this issue, but even more so to reach an agreement of substance.
