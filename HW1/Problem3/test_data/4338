The European Parliament is one of the first parliaments in the world seeking to clarify consumer Internet rights.
If the Charter is widely accessible and available in all official languages, consumers will begin to demand their rights and businesses will begin to uphold the Charter and not to risk having to spend money on resolving disputes.
I feel that the report will act as an inspiration for improving standards in the digital environment.
I should now like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their outstanding help: Mrs Herczog, Mrs RÃŒhle, Mr Schmidt and Mrs JÃ€Ã€tteenmÃ€ki and the assistants, in particular Mr Jirsa for his invaluable expert advice.
I also appreciate the support of the coordinators, the chairman and the secretariat of the committee and the services.
I was delighted with the constructive communication from consumer organisations, businesses and individual members of the Commission staff.
I should in particular like to commend Mrs Kuneva on her obliging and very open attitude.
She has embarked on her new post in the Commission in an outstanding fashion.
I believe that we will be able to overcome any difficulties that may arise when our proposals on increasing confidence in the European digital environment are put into practice.
Mr President, I am really very pleased to be here today to discuss with you this very important topic of how we can improve consumer confidence in the digital environment.
I would like to start my speech by thanking Mrs RoithovÃ¡ and all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent and very close cooperation - and this is not just a matter of courtesy, but a sincere recognition of very hard work.
I am glad that the Commission and the European Parliament agree on a common line in approaching this very important and challenging issue.
This is clearly an important and ambitious report, and I think we all broadly share the same objectives and analyses of the problems.
The digital economy - and more specifically e-commerce - has great potential to improve consumer welfare by making a greater range of products available, boosting price competition and developing new markets.
It is also central to completing the retail side of the internal market.
At present, retail markets are still fragmented along national lines into mini-markets, as Mrs RoithovÃ¡ indicated. This makes no sense in the age of e-commerce and the internet.
E-commerce is changing the face of retail, but only at national level.
The internet is borderless but consumers, businesses and regulators are not.
Fifty per cent of European consumers who have a computer at home have made an e-commerce purchase in the previous 12 months, but only 12% of those with a computer at home bought cross-border.
This indicates the need for action to increase consumer confidence on the retail side of the internal market and the necessity to solve the fragmentation of the market to achieve finally a citizens' market.
As you know, since the beginning of the year we have launched two major initiatives for consumers: the consumer policy strategy and the consultation on the review of existing consumer protection legislation.
Our objective as a Commission is to help the EU rise to the challenges of growth and jobs and reconnecting with its citizens.
This objective will be met if, by 2013, we can credibly demonstrate to all citizens that they can shop from anywhere in the EU - from corner shop to website - confident that they are equally and effectively protected.
The need to improve consumer confidence in the digital economy runs through every aspect of this strategy.
Mrs RoithovÃ¡'s report shows that the obstacles - including regulatory obstacles - are numerous.
My predecessors made progress in tackling some of them with the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation, which established the European Consumer Centre (ECC) network.
My priority now is to tackle the remaining obstacles, with the reform of existing consumer protection legislation related to consumer contracts.
As you know, we have initiated a broad consultation on the future of consumer protection, and we have started to analyse reactions from the stakeholders.
We are looking forward to Mrs Petre's report after the summer.
Your views and your support will be an important reference for our follow-up work and for specific proposals.
The Commission's follow-up to the review of the acquis is a basis on which build consumer trust.
The development of standardised consumer contracts may be something to investigate further once this solid base is established.
One of the aims of this exercise is to reduce the regulatory fragmentation of the internal market by targeted harmonisation of issues that cause particular problems for consumers and businesses.
We will, inter alia, consider whether standards and standardisation can play a role in this process.
Similarly for self-regulation.
The Commission has done some important work to establish a best practice model for self- and co-regulation, and we will continue to do so in the future.
I share your concerns about the interplay of different legislation governing online transactions or digital goods.
There are many precise laws, and consumers and businesses may not be sufficiently aware of their rights and duties in the digital environment.
I will examine how best to clarify these issues with my colleagues, Mrs Reding and Mr McCreevy.
Thanks to your input, we will explore the idea of a practical guide which would cover information society services and help citizens to understand their rights better.
I would also like to thank you for insisting on the importance of enforcement - I fully agree with you.
Quality legislation is not enough if it is not backed up by effective enforcement.
We have set up a network of national enforcers in the European Union and we will now gradually enlarge the network to third country partners in order to enhance its efficiency.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your commitment to helping European citizens to enjoy all the benefits of the internal market and the digital economy.
I look forward to working with you to fulfil our common goals and to achieve a citizens' internal market.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs RoithovÃ¡ for such a wonderful report.
Consumer confidence in the digital environment largely depends on our ability to provide consumers with protection and clarity within that environment.
We must bear in mind that SMEs are also consumers, and the European Union must promote the use of these new technologies and encourage SMEs to participate in on-line markets.
At the same time, we must promote consumer confidence on these platforms by ensuring that transactions are transparent and fair.
Consumers must be aware of their obligations and rights in the digital world.
For some products, such as MP3 players, DVD players and computer game consoles, the consumer is obliged to accept very strict conditions in the small print, and in some cases this verges on the illegal and violates the right to privacy.
At the same time, the producers of these devices are expanding the use of digital rights management systems in order to prevent unauthorised copies.
This creates fear, and that can undermine consumer confidence.
In order to resolve the problem of interoperability, open standards are required that create a safer, more open and more trustworthy environment.
Software patents are also a serious threat for software developers in SMEs, who cannot afford the legal costs.
Fear in this environment is not compatible with confidence either amongst SMEs or amongst consumers.
Digital platforms can only provide growth and development if they are based on open and interoperable standards.
Standards can contribute to less fragmentation of markets and the use of open-source software can also make a considerable contribution to promoting on-line security.
Improving the security and confidence of consumers depends upon certain key elements: legislation, mechanisms for strengthening and creating regulatory instruments such as codes of conduct and confidence marks.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome this report and to thank my colleague, Mrs RoithovÃ¡, for her outstanding work, and the shadow rapporteurs, who are here as well.
It has been a very good team effort.
I also want to thank Mrs Kuneva for her very positive response.
This report shows the value that a parliamentary committee can bring to a complex issue, particularly one that cuts across so many policy areas.
The special message I want to put to the Commissioner is that I hope she will take this forward and become the champion of consumers in the e-world and in e-commerce, because, as she said, it is not just her services that have a share in this - it is also those of Mrs Reding and of Mr McCreevy, and, indeed, of Mr Frattini and of Mr Verheugen, in his role as champion of enterprise, in particular small enterprise.
As far as Mr Frattini is concerned, I want to emphasise again the concern that many of us feel about the proposed reform of the Rome I Regulation in particular, which is in serious danger of undermining the provisions for small businesses to be active in the world of e-commerce.
There are also important data protection provisions that consumers feel concerned about in terms of giving up their data and going online, which also come under his area.
Therefore, I think it needs that coordinated approach.
I also want to pick up on what Mr Hammerstein-Mintz said, that small enterprises are the ones we need to look at in particular.
Large enterprises can build complex websites in different languages, based in different countries, but we want to allow small enterprises with an innovative and exciting product and service based in one EU country to be able to access that EU market freely and simply, to take real advantage of the powers that e-commerce offers them.
We have to be very careful that we design the regime in such a way as to ensure that we do not discourage them from doing that, because we want not only consumers to go online but also businesses to put their products online, and to make the two work together, because that is what we have the opportunity to do in our dynamic e-commerce market as it moves forward from here.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work over the last eighteen months, during which she has demonstrated considerable openness and willingness to compromise.
Not the least, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her openness as we have been working together in this area ever since she was elected to this position.
The result of this work is a report whose ambitious political messages have not, contrary to what usually happens, been diluted by the numerous compromises made.
If anything, they have been reinforced by them. This is exactly what we need; after all, it is how Europe's society and economy are gearing up for the digital age which is at stake.
What is required here is for increasingly wider sections of European society to have access to information technologies.
We must therefore emphasise, at any rate, as a footnote to this report the importance of e-inclusion, in other words, how important it is that the inhabitants of rural areas, those with disabilities, the older generations and those on the lowest incomes can be included in Europe's vibrant digital society.
There is no question that the future belongs to the information society and knowledge-based economy.
As we have already realised, we also have to accept that business, the goods and services market along with consumption itself are becoming knowledge-based and digital.
However, consumers are still consumers even on the Internet, with rights and obligations.
They need to know, above all, what exactly they are facing: brochures, free newspapers, products or even services.
Equipped with this knowledge, they need to behave just as discerningly as if they were in a conventional library, bank, travel agents or store.
They need to know what they can and cannot do.
In return for their compliance, they can then enjoy the protection afforded to law-abiding consumers in the traditional market too.
However, there are numerous aspects of the digital environment which are fuelling the lack of consumer confidence.
The easy, rapid flow of information, the frequent lack of information for consumers and the quick and extensive spread of illegal behaviour are just some of the many reasons why anyone using the Internet can cross the boundary of law-abiding consumer activity, even acting in good faith.
It is our political responsibility as politicians to devise those tools for Europe's digital environment, which will allow our Internet users to remain law-abiding consumers.
On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I can say that we will support the idea of a digital consumers charter in the longer term, which will provide every single consumer with clear, comprehensible information about what they should do in particular situations when using the Internet.
Parliament is also aware that the dynamic development of the digital environment and the ongoing monitoring of consumer protection legislation will have a major impact on the content of any future charter.
However, consumers also need information until then, which is why we are asking the Commission, even in current circumstances and based on current legislation, to provide some guidance as to what rights and protection e-consumers have.
With this in mind, we are proposing that a network of consumer protection centres should be set up, based on the model of the SOLVIT system and Dolceta website. In other words, a European e-consumer information and support portal, which can help Europe's online consumers by offering advice, answers and solutions.
Similarly, we support clarification of the legislation governing the use and protection of digital content.
After all, the interoperability between the tools and content, on the one hand, and online management of rights, on the other, are two important principles.
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of consumers and industry to the fact that this is something in their joint interest.
Based on the model of traditional markets, the digital market too depends on law-abiding behaviour.
There are currently a large number of committees involved in this area.
We would therefore like the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which is linked to consumers and is the most responsive, to coordinate within the Commission the further efforts in this area.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Commissioner, Mr President, few could have imagined how the Internet would fundamentally change the world, both politically and economically.
In spite of attempts by totalitarian regimes to limit the flow of information, the Internet is winning millions of new users.
The way in which we use the Internet is also rapidly being transformed from the passive acquisition of information to an interactive approach.
We buy and sell goods and services on it, and we chat and meet each other there.
We have even acquired another life on the Internet, a virtual reality that, for some people, becomes more important than reality itself.
There are statistics showing a 21% annual increase in Internet commerce, and even though cross-border shopping within the EU is not extensive, there is a lot to indicate that it will increase.
More than half of European households own a computer - an increase of approximately 4% in one year. Forty-two per cent of all households are on the Internet, and here too the increase is one of 4% in one year.
In my own country, a good 75% of the population have an Internet connection at home.
It is nonetheless gratifying that the biggest increase is taking place in the new Member States.
As many of my fellow Members have pointed out in this House, the number of frauds and other acts of deception is increasing concurrently with this development.
In the light of this, Mrs RoithovÃ¡'s report is an important step towards improving consumers' faith in the digital market.
We know that, in parallel with Parliament's work, the Commission reviews the whole of the EU's consumer legislation.
Paragraph 19 of the report proposes what it calls a European trust mark.
That is obviously a good idea, but I can see certain problems.
Firstly, the costs of keeping such a quality mark updated may prove to be considerable.
The Commission has itself calculated the costs at EUR 1 million per country per year, which is a considerable sum of money.
Secondly, there is a danger of the trust mark being stolen, misused or falsified.
Another important point is the setting up of an EU charter of users' rights and obligations in the information society.
This is not a new issue and is obviously an important area for the Commission, as the Commissioner also pointed out in connection with the ongoing review.
I believe that the wordings proposed in the amendments better take account of the complexity and speed of the changes in the digital environment.
It perhaps does not even need to be said, but the digital environment obviously needs an efficient framework in the form of rules and legislation.
All actors who make use of the Internet need to be aware of their rights and obligations.
We need informed and educated consumers.
We need not only vendors and entrepreneurs with a sense of responsibility but also bold innovators who envisage new possibilities and new jobs.
We of course also need laws that operate in a changing environment.
The Commission has to balance all these interests with a view to an EU that is better able to become more competitive and to comply with the requirements of the Lisbon Strategy.
Last of all, I should like to point out that we must never forget that it is freedom and free access to information that has formed the basis for the huge success of the Internet.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs RoithovÃ¡ for tackling such an important issue.
We should remember that work on developing the Internet began barely 40 years ago, yet we can now speak of an Internet revolution.
This extraordinary instrument opens up tremendous opportunities in many areas. It also presents us with many challenges.
It may be used for laudable purposes but may unfortunately also be exploited for criminal activities.
The same is true of many other instruments used by men and women as they develop civilisations.
The use of digital technology in electronic commerce for the purchase of goods and services ought to be seen in this context.
As stated in the report, the legal and technical solutions applied should comply with a range of criteria.
I would like to make a few remarks in this regard.
Firstly, access to the Internet retail market should be far more widespread.
This is linked to more generalised access to broadband Internet, a matter that has been repeatedly mentioned in the House.
At present only around 25% of households in the European Union have a broadband connection, and therefore enjoy a high quality connection.
Secondly, the purchaser needs to be certain that making purchases in this way is secure, both as regards the transaction itself and in terms of the relevant guarantee for the goods and services purchased, regardless of borders.
Thirdly, the fact that the transactions are often anonymous cannot be allowed to facilitate criminal activity in any way.
I have in mind piracy of films or musical works that are protected intellectual property.
It is therefore essential to clarify the expression 'for personal use only'.
Fourthly, other activities conducted through the Internet, such as the purchase of paedophile or pornographic material and the propagation of prostitution call for specific action by the police and prosecuting authorities.
This is weighing on our consciences.
Fifthly, payments over the Internet must be undertaken in a way that ensures full security for both parties.
Sixthly, advertisements for goods or services that can be purchased electronically must allow potential purchasers to verify the information put out.
My seventh remark is that the security of bank transactions undertaken by electronic means needs to be drastically improved.
My eighth remark is to point out the importance of using digital means to provide certain medical services, diagnosis, and monitoring at a distance, notably in more remote areas.
My penultimate point relates to the importance of distance education.
Finally, we would do well to remember that the disabled in particular benefit greatly from the opportunity to use digital platforms as consumers.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that high quality, honesty, transparency and flexibility must be essential features of the soundly based market in digital services open to competition that we wish to create.
on behalf of Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my special thanks go to the rapporteur. Through her efforts we have an excellent own-initiative report to approve today.
I hope and am confident that the Commission will take the report's recommendations and conclusions on board when reviewing European consumer rights.
Our group supports your report, Mrs RoithovÃ , and most of your compromise amendments.
However, we do regret your decision to water down your proposal on the subject of the European trustmark.
We will therefore not be voting for Amendment 4 and we will also be rejecting the Liberals' amendments.
Intellectual property rights cannot be allowed to erode consumer rights.
Consumers need clear information about their legal position when dealing with digital content and digital rights management.
They are entitled to interoperable solutions.
The report addresses important issues, calling for a European charter of user rights, the creation of a European early warning system and a database for combating Internet fraud, the inclusion of an external audit obligation for specific electronic services such as online banking, and standardising European provisions for cross-border electronic invoices.
It also calls for a coordinated global approach for the digital environment, including an analysis of external factors such as privacy protection, citizens' access to information technologies and Internet security.
The report also calls on the Commission to examine measures to deal with class actions in the case of cross-border digital environment disputes between businesses and consumers.
We will be supporting the report and hope that it will be adopted in the plenary.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, trade and the exchange of goods, services and capital are the very bases of economic prosperity.
Therefore, any technology that reduces the transaction costs for commerce is also fundamental to increased prosperity.
With the world becoming more interconnected with the help of modern communications, safe and quick methods of payment and the removal of a good deal of protectionism, ever more countries around the world are now being drawn into global trade. In the long run, this is to the advantage of everyone on earth.
It is therefore the EU's most important task to do everything it can to facilitate trade, firstly within the EU area and secondly between the EU area and the rest of the world.
The EU is very successful at facilitating trade within the EU area and has made a considerable contribution to the EU countries' economic development.
The big exception is agriculture, in which precisely no liberalisation has taken place and in which there are, then, major gains in prosperity still to be brought about.
When it comes to trade between the EU area and the rest of the world, matters look nothing like so good.
EU protectionism in respect of the surrounding world is extensive and embraces not only the agricultural sphere but also labour-intensive industrial products.
The economic costs for the poor countries of the world and for EU consumers are very great.
It is, therefore, above all in these areas that we wish to invest our political resources in order to design an EU policy for increased trade and increased prosperity.
EU trade is at present a phenomenon of limited scope, but I dare say we all believe that it is a form of trade with a great future.
Mrs RoithovÃ¡ is therefore discussing an area that will prove to be very important in the future, but the question is that of what the EU's role might be in this area at this stage in the development of e-commerce.
Mrs RoithovÃ¡ and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy maintain that consumers do not dare to make cross-border purchases via the Internet within the EU because of poor legal certainty.
Perhaps that is so, but do we know it for a fact?
Every new area and every new problem that is identified are presented in this House as evidence that the EU needs to intervene.
The tiresome phrase 'this shows that the EU is needed' is repeated like a mantra.
In any socio-economic analysis of such problems, however, the attempt is first made to establish what the market failures are, whether they can be corrected through political measures and, if so, what these measures might be, and at which political level they should be resorted to.
In this House, the very point of departure is, more often than not, that the failures can and should be remedied at EU level.
Every problem that is identified is taken as a pretext for advancing the EU's strategic positions at the expense of the Member States or of international bodies that are more global in scope.
Constantly, man merkt die Absicht ['the intention is noted'].
E-commerce is still in its infancy, and we do not know what is slowing down its growth, in which areas it will flourish and what forms it will then take.
I would therefore advise the House to oppose all these proposals concerning EU-directed and EU-sponsored grant programmes and education and information campaigns and to wait before calling for charters of rights, dispute resolution mechanisms and harmonisation of contract law at EU level, and I advise it to say no to a logo for a European trustmark in this area.
Those countries and regions that are creative and that are pioneers in various areas are those that offer entrepreneurs the freedom to feel their way towards solutions that politicians or officials cannot normally foresee.
Where e-commerce is concerned, we shall find that there are very strong incentives for companies to create security for consumers.
Such security will therefore be brought about by the financial market with the help of new insurance services and through the development of trademarks by producers themselves.
- (SK) Allow me to thank Mrs RoithovÃ¡ for this report. It is responding to a dynamically developing digital environment.
This is an area of everyday life for all of us, whether we are consumers or business people.
New technologies offer huge opportunities to make full use of the internal market.
Statistics, however, show that only 6% of European consumers participate in on-line transactions, and 33% experience problems, because their country of residence is different to that of the sellers of the goods.
According to the Eurobarometer survey, 48% of merchants in the European Union are ready to sell across borders, but only 29% of companies are actually involved in cross-border transactions with at least one other country of the European Union.
And yet 57% retailers in European Union sell via the Internet.
The largest barriers to cross-border transactions include the uncertainty of transactions, different accounting rules, difficulties in the resolution of complaints and disputes, differences in national legislation on consumer protection, problems in provision of after-sales services, extra costs arising due to cross-border delivery, and the cost of translations.
The use of the on-line environment is more complicated than the off-line environment due to its many barriers.
Because of this, I consider important the proposal to elaborate a strategy to build consumer confidence.
It should be an attempt to respond and to implement steps for making Internet transactions more attractive, thus bringing an end to the fragmentation of the internal market in the digital environment.
This should lead to improvements in access to goods and services offered on-line in other Member States.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs RoithovÃ¡, many thanks for your excellent report.
My thanks also go to the shadow rapporteur Mrs Herczog, who was responsible for working on the report within my group.
This is a subject of particular importance to our citizens.
It was very good to hear that Commissioner Kuneva will be taking action in this area.
That is essential, and we can only support her efforts.
We will be behind the Commissioner one hundred per cent.
Our citizens have a whole range of problems in the digital environment.
Goods do not arrive, or they arrive late.
They may want to order a product in another country, but find themselves unable to do so because the company says that they are resident in the wrong country.
Or they place an order and suddenly find themselves landed with a subscription.
These are the problems that our citizens encounter.
Of course, within the European Union there is already some very positive regulation within this area, but it is very disjointed.
It is vital that we create positive legislation for this area that meets the expectations of our citizens and, more importantly, of consumers.
We want the citizens to enjoy the benefits of the single market in this arena. However, they can only benefit if we provide them with legal certainty, if they understand the basis on which they can do business, if they know that when they have a problem with a company they will be able to seek redress - and not have to wait 12 or 15 years for a result.
They will also benefit from a more open market if they are able to compare prices and access more information.
As you can see, there is still a lot to do in this area.
The citizens are expecting not only that we regulate the internal market, not only that we establish constructive and simpler rules for businesses, thereby ensuring that companies are free to move within the European Union.
Our citizens also expect a Europe that works for them, in which policies are not just designed to encourage the economy, with the citizens merely expected to contribute to that economy.
Instead, consumer protection should also determine policy, particularly in the digital arena.
It must be clear that we are making policy for consumers, and that the economy serves the consumers.
If this happens, Commissioner Kuneva - and I know this is your intention - then we will achieve our objective, namely a Europe for the citizens; a Europe in which they are free to make online purchases in another country without problems or obstacles, and in which they have rights, including the possibility of redress.
You will certainly have the full backing of my group, Commissioner, and we will be very happy to work with you to achieve your aims.
(PL) Mr President, the role of the on-line transactions market in the provision of products, services or information on these is now invaluable.
Mrs RoithovÃ¡ rightly pointed out in her report, however, that the development and increased importance of that market is affected by its fragmentation across the various Member States of the European Union.
I agree that the aforementioned lack of harmonisation of provisions across the territory of the European Union and the lack of consumer confidence in transactions on the digital market may endanger the European Union's competitiveness on the world market especially as Europe is now lagging behind the United States and certain Asian countries.
Creating a European information system is certainly a good idea although it will require time and tremendous financial investment.
It does appear, however, that such a proposal may increase the security of on-line transactions between entities in different countries. This is because it is precisely the diversity of provisions across Member States and the lack of access to them that enterprises cite as the main cause of the uncertainty about entering into transactions of this kind.
I believe that the situation in the new Member States where there is a shortage of financial resources for information campaigns on access to electronic services and their quality is also an urgent matter.
The individual citizens of these countries often lack access to services of this nature, particularly in rural areas.
The report rightly refers to discrimination against consumers in this group of countries regarding e-commerce.
In my view, the Commission ought to deal with this situation as a matter of urgency, because all Union consumers are entitled to equal treatment.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea is present in the official gallery.
I warmly welcome the Korean delegation, which is here to take part in the tenth European Parliament-Korea Interparliamentary Meeting. Mr Lee Sang-Deuk is leading the Korean delegation, which is composed of six members of the National Assembly.
Our dialogue has developed greater depth and regularity in recent years.
It has now become entirely political, covering a vast range of subjects from regional and international security to our citizens' everyday concerns, alongside the increasingly active role of the European Union and South Korea in the international community.
We are delighted to have these fruitful, stable and ever-deepening cooperative relations with the Republic of Korea.

MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control (vote)
- Report: Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou
- Before the vote on paragraph 38
(PT) Mr President, I should like to table an amendment that has been agreed with our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou. This amendment is intended to replace the current Amendment 38 with the following text:
'Welcomes the Council decision of 18 June asking the EU to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately and to this end to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial assistance, including direct financial support to the new government, as well as to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza;'
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to thank all my honourable friends from the various political groups who cooperated with me on this report, which is so important for our Euro-Mediterranean partnership and which also contains important and sensitive points which have to do with the funding of the Palestinian Authority.
In the amendment referred to by Mr Casaca which, as he knows, we made together, there is a parenthesis at the end '(via, especially, the TIM)', which is part of the oral amendment.
I have no other amendments to table other than to mention that paragraph 38 referring to the Mecca agreement and to a national unity government is no longer topical and has been deleted and replaced by the paragraph which Mr Casaca has just read out, with the parenthesis '(via, especially, the TIM)' at the end.
That is all, other than to thank you for your cooperation and support.
To recap for everybody's benefit, Mr Casaca has tabled an oral amendment to paragraph 38, which in its original version and with the rapporteur's addition already has the words 'via, especially, the TIM' added at the end of the text that you will find attached to your voting list.
Are there any objections to the oral amendment in its entirety?
There are no objections.
Quite exceptionally, the rapporteur is asking for the floor again.
Recital N, which has to do with this matter.
The second oral amendment on suppression of recital N was tabled at the same time.
It will require a separate vote, but the two amendments are connected.
(The oral amendments were accepted)
2.
Review procedures concerning the award of public contracts (vote)
- Report: Fruteau
- After the vote
(DE) Mr President, I think we should congratulate Mr Fruteau on his election to the French Parliament.
It may not be good news for us, but I am sure he is very pleased with the result.
I too would like to congratulate Mr Fruteau, and we now go on to the next item.

Fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid (vote)
Motion for a resolution:
- Before the vote on paragraph 11
(IT) Mr President, I should like to point out that there is a mistake in the Italian translation, which for us is substantive and not trivial.
Where the English version has 'calls upon regional authorities to establish special administrative commissions', it says, 'invita le autoritÃ  regionali a istituire tribunali amministrativi speciali'.
That is a situation that we had at the time of fascism, which must not be brought back again.
I therefore suggest we put 'commissioni', in line with the English and French texts.
In addition, I should like to suggest that the 'powers of arbitration' associated with the commissions be reviewed and replaced with 'powers of decision'.
Thank you, Mrs Sbarbati; we shall of course ask the appropriate services to take action on the linguistic part of your comment.

Juvenile delinquency, the role of women, the family and society (vote)
- Report: Batzeli
- Before the vote on Amendment 7
Mr President, there has been a change in the word order; the proposed change is:
(the rapporteur continued in English)
'social inclusion of all young people and extrajudicial and judicial measures'
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
8.
External dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice (vote)
- Report: Klich
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to this report.
Special thanks are due to Mr Sakalas, the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who was involved in the difficult procedure of strengthened cooperation between two of our Parliamentary committees.
I am also bound to call on the House to support this report, for three reasons.
Firstly, because the report advocates better coordination between our foreign policy and our internal policy, to ensure that our foreign policy achieves the priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice.
Secondly, because we advocate the specific European method which balances between action to ensure the security of our citizens and action to protect their civic freedoms.
Thirdly, because we are calling for what remains of the third pillar, notably police and court cooperation on criminal matters, to become a Community issue.
- Before the vote on Amendment 3, first part
Mr President, in order to avoid confusion, I should just like to clarify our request for a split vote and an oral amendment to Amendment 3.
The oral amendment concerns the part of the text that the amendment by the PPE-DE Group seeks to delete.
Therefore, if you wish to retain the text, including the oral amendment, you should vote against the first part of Amendment 3.
Mr President, we propose to insert the words 'by the Council and the Commission', so that the text will read: 'to include a human rights compliance report by the Council and the Commission in all external policy initiatives or documents in the AFSJ...'.
I must point out to you that, if this House supports Amendment 3, the oral amendment will fall.
However, if Amendment 3 by the PPE-DE Group is rejected, then the oral amendment will be included.
(The oral amendment was accepted)

Decision-making in the common European asylum system (vote)
- Report: Pirker
Mr President, on 31 January 2007 I sent a letter to the President of this Parliament proposing the organisation of an annual lecture to honour the memory of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya.
This Politkovskaya lecture should be held by a journalist who distinguishes her or himself through an outstanding effort to defend democracy and respect for all human beings.
With this lecture we would honour all journalists for their essential role in keeping societies open.
This proposal was co-signed by Bart Staes, Jean-Marie Cavada, Ewa Klamt and Luisa Morgantini.
Rule 28 states that the Presidency has to answer within 30 days.
I received only a vague reply and nothing has happened in the mean time.
We would like to organise this event for October this year, one year after the assassination of our valued Anna Politkovskaya.
We need the cooperation of the Presidency and we hope we can count on it.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Berman.
I believe the aim of the brief reply was precisely to prevent the time period from lapsing.
Clearly, however, I shall refer this to the Bureau and the President and check with them what will be done to follow up your request.

Cuba
The next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on Cuba.
author. - Madam President, the Council has recently recognised that no tangible results have been achieved on human rights in Cuba, despite the goodwill shown by the Council in 2005.
The majority of us, if not all of us, are in agreement that it is necessary for Cuba to launch a process of political transition to multi-party democracy.
This is not the Eurocentric position our opponents like to use against us but is about the universality and indivisibility of human rights, including civil, political and economic rights, in which we believe.
Today we again urge the Council and Commission to continue to take whatever action is necessary to demand the release of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.
It is important to give our unconditional support and full encouragement to the launching of a peaceful process of transition to a multi-party democracy in Cuba.
We have examples to follow.
Twenty years ago the present EU Member States from Eastern and Central Europe were in many ways - including as regards their human rights situation - in a similar situation to that which Cuba is in now.
I hope that we will soon witness major changes in Cuba and I look forward to that very special day.
author. - (PL) Madam President, Cuba has been ruled by a dictator for almost half a century and human rights are constantly being violated there.
It is practically the last remaining bastion of Communism in the world.
North Korea is another such bastion, whilst the Chinese regime is somewhat different but often equally cruel.
After the collapse of Communism in 1989 we expected those Communist countries to review their situation and that Communism would collapse there too.
Unfortunately, that did not happen, notably in Cuba.
It is true that the intensity of persecution in Cuba varied.
There were times when it was particularly cruel and other periods when a degree of liberalisation was allowed and when concessions seemed to be made to the opposition.
A particularly worrying contemporary development is that Cuba has succeeded in gaining a number of allies.
The latter include left-wing governments in Europe.
The support often provided by governments of Member States of the European Union to the Cuban regime, albeit indirectly, is particularly worrying.
The current more tolerant attitude to such evil regimes adopted also by the UN is unacceptable.
For instance, it is being suggested that human rights are not being violated in Belarus or in Cuba.
I call on the House to adopt an unequivocal approach condemning the Cuban governments, and to follow this up with specific actions aimed at toppling Fidel Castro's cruel Communist regime.
author. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my concern at the fact that this item on relations between the European Union and the Cuban Government has replaced, in terms of urgency, another issue that I considered to be far more important and far more urgent: the situation of the refugee population in Iraq.
This is particularly worrying given that, in reality, the fundamental reason for this modification does not so much relate to issues involving that Caribbean Island, but rather to the customary tendency of certain Members from the People's Party to use the European Parliament to express their personal opposition to the Spanish Government.
It is not for me to defend the position of the Spanish Government; I am not a member of that government or of its party, but it does concern me that such an important opportunity as the Thursday afternoon sitting, which is dedicated to situations of violations of human rights in the world, should be called into question by this kind of initiative that goes against the very spirit of these debates.
Furthermore, I would also like to point out that on Monday the Council approved its conclusions on relations with the Cuban Government, in which it once again stated its intention to maintain the dialogue with civil society and offered to restore the dialogue with the Cuban Government on the basis of mutual, reciprocal and non-discriminatory interest.
Cuba must make a lot of progress on issues such as freedoms, rights, political rights in particular, and democratic openness, but I would insist that this is nothing new, it is not urgent.
What is more, I believe that the position adopted by the Council on Monday sets the parameters for moving in that direction, particularly insofar as it distances itself from the United States' strategy based on a sterile confrontation and an embargo that is both ineffective and irresponsible, amongst other things because it actually hinders certain reforms within the island which would allow for a more ordered transition.
Furthermore, as we stated in our resolution, that of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, cooperation must be an instrument for development, with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Objectives, and not a tool for imposing conditions with a view to achieving political ends.
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for once I do not agree with Mr Romeva i Rueda, because I believe that there is an urgent issue concerning Cuba, and one that actually concerns us as well as the European Union.
Otherwise, it would be pointless to treat questions of countries that have been dictatorships and not democratic for years and years, or even decades, as urgent topics.
In this case the urgency concerns us and our policy.
A decision has been taken in the Council to invite a Cuban delegation.
What can or what should initiating this dialogue mean?
In our view, it should mean that any change, reform or strengthening of relations with Cuba must depend on an equally tangible plan to reform the situation of human rights and democracy on the island.
It is true that our strategy as the European Union is not to impose an embargo - and I intend to clarify and emphasise that again in an oral amendment - but it is also true that it must not and cannot be a strategy of unconditional and unilateral openness, because that too would prove to be a disastrous strategy, as it has proved to be in the past.
We must, for instance, give practical support to those dissidents who have come together behind the 'Unity for Liberty' declaration - and this is much more urgent for the European Union than for Cuba.
One of the problems of Cuba's dissidents and opposition has always been their internal divisions, but this time there is a joint declaration and document that talks about non-violence and democracy.
It is our job to support these dissidents.
This has to be taken into account when the discussions and dialogue are initiated, otherwise they will be going against this Union's policies and principles on human rights and democracy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to start by saying to the Spanish rapporteur that I do not need a visit from Mr Moratino to get het up about what the Spanish Government is doing.
Within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we have enough colleagues from Central and Eastern Europe who work with the people in Cuba out of a sense of solidarity, and the issue is not limited to the Spaniards within the PPE-DE.
I do want to assure you of that.
The future for the people of Cuba should not be limited to two alternatives: either continuing with Communism or being taken over by the government in Miami.
In the light of the Common Position of 1996 we have a political responsibility to support the democratic and peaceful forces as they work for change.
That is why the European Parliament has awarded Sakharov prizes to the Ladies in White and to Oswaldo PayÃ¡.
I would have liked to have seen a clear statement in the Council Decision that the Common Position of 1996 still stands, that the Council Decision approved on Monday does not alter that Position, that the 2003 sanctions have merely been suspended, and that we will be reviewing the position again next June (the 17th evaluation of the Common Position).
The Council should have made that clear.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to reinforce what Mr Romeva just said.
The sole motivation for raising this subject is a Spanish domestic political issue that has nothing to do with the situation in the country under discussion.
The People's Party has preferred not to debate a truly urgent issue, which is that of Iraq.
There are currently two million Iraqi refugees within Iraq and a further two million who have been obliged to leave the country.
At the moment, rather then taking in these poor people who are fleeing the bombings and killings in Iraq, countries are returning them to their country of origin.
In other words, on the one hand, we are bombing the Iraqi population, and on the other we are not allowing them to leave and sending them back to that hell.
This is a case of total inhumanity and it is not appropriate at this point for us to forget the situation of these people.
We therefore believe that this urgency is entirely inappropriate and that we have squandered an opportunity to deal with a case of genuine humanitarian urgency at a time when measures needed to be adopted.
There has very recently been a conference on Iraq in which this issue has been debated, a series of resolutions have been approved, and this Parliament is incapable of following them up because it prefers to deal with domestic political issues rather than the genuine problems that are currently of concern to humanity.
Colleagues, I would remind you all that the subject matter of this debate is Cuba, and if anybody else tries to discuss something else, I will be very strict.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I shall definitely speak about Cuba!
This House has dealt with the situation in Cuba on several occasions.
Unfortunately, all our calls for full respect of fundamental freedoms of Cuban citizens have fallen on deaf ears.
The utterly anachronistic Castro regime is now so much out of date and out of touch with reality and modern democratic norms that it is highly unlikely, in my view, that any significant change for the better will occur while Castro is still in power.
However, he is now elderly, sick and physically incapable of running the country, so we must start thinking about what to do when he has finally gone from the power stage of Cuba.
In the mean time, we once again call for democratic reforms and, in particular, we call for the Cuban authorities to allow the two Cuban winners of the EP's Sakharov Prize to travel to Europe.
Let us hope that some remnants of common sense may have survived in the minds of those ruling Cuba and that we shall soon welcome these Sakharov Prize winners to Parliament.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for a few seconds the display for the sitting said 'Iraqi refugees'.
The slip-up has evidently also affected the technology in this Chamber.
Indeed, that is the subject that we ought to have been debating: the 4 million Iraqis who are trying to come to Europe but to whom we are not showing any hospitality.
Instead, we are debating Cuba, because an international campaign is under way that led this Parliament to vote against Venezuela in the last part-session and will probably lead it to vote against Cuba today.
We now expect that someone from the Spanish People's Party will put forward a resolution against Ecuador and Bolivia.
That is what we are expecting.
The real purpose, in fact, is to combat the economic policy that a large part of Latin America is implementing at the moment, in contrast to neoliberalism and the imperialistic philosophy of permanent war.
That is an objective fact in our debate.
Instead, I believe that we should call strongly for a review of the European Union's common position and for a review of the embargo.
What the Council did last Monday in inviting a delegation from the Cuban authorities to Brussels was a very significant step that we ought to welcome, so as to initiate a positive dialogue and to give due merit to the progress made by Cuba.
I believe, however, that the content of this resolution, right from its first clause, explicitly states the views of one side of this Parliament.
In other words, it is calling for a change to the social, economic and political system of an island and sovereign state.
I regard that as unacceptable.
Madam President, Castro's Cuba is the last polity in the western hemisphere in which there is no pretence of democracy: opposition movements are banned; dissidents are imprisoned; citizens are denied the right to travel abroad.
There are few sights so degrading as that of Western leftists arguing that all this is somehow justified because Cuba is good at producing doctors and ballerinas.
Two factors have maintained the Castroist dynasty in power: first, the misconceived American blockade, which has allowed him to sustain the siege mentality necessary to dictatorship, and second, the indulgence of those in Europe - and here I must especially mention the Zapatero Government, which indulges the Cuban Communists by according full diplomatic courtesies.
The way to bring freedom to Cuba would be through economic engagement but political isolation.
Instead, we are doing the opposite with calamitous consequences for that unhappy country.
'Sola mors tyrannicida est' wrote my countryman, Thomas More - death is the only way to get rid of tyrants.
That it should have proved so in the case of Castro says nothing good about the rest of us.
(PT) What ought to have been on Parliament's agenda was an expression from the EU of a genuine desire for dialogue on the basis of respect for Cuba.
In our view, the establishment of open dialogue covering all issues of mutual interest naturally entails bringing down the barriers that have been created to make that dialogue difficult or impossible.
This means calling for a definitive end to the sanctions imposed by the EU in 2003, which are temporarily suspended, and the permanent scrapping of the EU's common position on Cuba.
These measures would pave the way for the normalisation of relations between the EU and Cuba.
This, however, is not an option for those who pushed this debate onto Parliament's agenda and who have put their names to the motion for a resolution put to today's vote.
Its objective is to encourage Cuba's isolation, in line with the unacceptable embargo imposed on Cuba by the US Administration.
It is also aimed at the blatant, unreserved promotion of intervention in Cuba's internal affairs and at exerting pressure from outside in order to impose decisions that only the Cuban people have the sovereign right to take.
Reality demonstrates that the best response to such plans is the country's enormous prestige and importance, and millions of millions of human beings showing active solidarity with Cuba and its people.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I was in Cuba not long ago and the country has not made any progress in upholding human rights; quite the opposite, in fact - things have got worse.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to protest more strongly against flagrant human rights violations in Cuba; to support organisations that campaign for the very survival of political opponents and their families, or that help NGOs in Cuba to communicate with one another and express their opinions on how to resolve public issues; and to make the Internet available for Cubans in our embassies, because people do not have access to information in Cuba.
The Council must campaign for the release of political prisoners who are physically maltreated and do not receive the medicines they need.
Normal Cubans, too, live in destitution and suffer illness.
There is a lack of doctors and modern techniques.
Health was once Castro's pride and joy, yet today normal medicines are only for rich Communist leaders or foreign tourists.
Cubans want change and they want freedom.
We must not let the Council open dialogue with the Cuban regime without setting out clear conditions on the release of prisoners and on freedom of expression.
Madam President, we have good reason to follow closely the recent developments in Cuba, because after 47 years of ruling Cuba Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, RaÃºl, who has been running the island in a relatively calm and organised fashion.
It is too early to say whether Fidel will fully recuperate from his illness, but nearly all observers agree that he will never be able to assume day-to-day management again.
Cuba, for the first time since the revolution of 1959, has to face the prospect of a country no longer fully run by Fidel Castro.
This is definitely a new situation, which we must take into account.
The question is: how can, and how should, the European Union react to this new development?
The Council of the European Union gave its first answer three days ago.
In its conclusions on Cuba of 18 June, the EU renewed its offer of an open and comprehensive dialogue with the Cuban authorities and invited a Cuban delegation to Brussels to sound out the feasibility of such an exercise.
This open-door approach is consistent with the EU's overall policy of constructive engagement towards Cuba.
Since 1996, when the European Union adopted its position on Cuba, experience has proved that only a policy of engagement and cooperation, not one of sanctions, has the potential to promote peaceful change in Cuba towards democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living conditions of the Cuban people, as stipulated in the EU's common position of 1996.
Only the establishment of an open, comprehensive and result-orientated dialogue with the Cuban authorities will enable us to make the best use of the variety of instruments the EU and its Member States have at their disposal to further cooperation in the fields of political relations, human rights, investment and trade, development work, scientific research, educational exchanges and culture.
The European Union is a profoundly value-based entity that makes respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms a key policy priority in its external actions.
It is deeply convinced that this commitment towards open dialogue must also involve wider Cuban civil society.
Extending a hand to the Cuban Government to enter into a long-term partnership with the European Union only makes sense if, at the same time, the European Union does all it can to maintain and step up its dialogue with those involved in Cuban civil society, including human rights defenders and peaceful political activists.
As long as Cuba denies its citizens internationally-recognised basic civil political and economic rights, the European Union will not stop lobbying for democracy and respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms.
It should not stop expressing its full solidarity with and support to those peacefully committed to making these universal values a reality in Cuba.
This is the true meaning of the 'two-track approach': saying 'yes' to extending a hand to the Cuban authorities for dialogue and cooperation while explicitly expressing critical remarks and concerns, and 'yes' to defending the right of Cuban citizens to decide freely about their future.
It is the Commission's firm conviction that the Council conclusions of 18 June are a welcome and necessary first step in this direction.
That concludes the debate on Cuba.
The vote will take place shortly.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the proposal that the European Union should depart from the policy of freezing diplomatic contacts with Cuba is totally unacceptable.
We can agree to reopening a full and open political dialogue on all areas of common interest with the Cuban authorities with a view to improving relations between the EU and Cuba, but only on certain conditions.
To do so unconditionally would be to send quite the wrong signal to the Cuban regime.
It would imply that we condone the unacceptable behaviour of the authorities in that country.
By its very nature, dialogue is a two-sided process, not a one-sided one.
The Cuban authorities' agreement to include in the discussion issues related to the state of human rights in Cuba must be a sine qua non to reopening a full dialogue.
It is also difficult to conceive of an honest dialogue with Cuba as long as the Sakharov prize winners are not allowed to travel to Europe.
The current Spanish Government's approach is very ambiguous in this regard.
One would expect the Spanish Socialists to demonstrate greater solidarity with European policy towards Cuba.
It is our duty to demonstrate our consistent opposition to the flagrant violations of human rights by Castro's regime.
For dialogue between Cuba and the European Union to lead to positive changes it must be a genuine dialogue, not a propaganda stunt.
In the past, the Cuban side has taken advantage of the Union's openness to launch a propaganda offensive.

Human rights in Ethiopia
The next item is the debate on human rights in Ethiopia.
I have received six motions for a resolution.
author. - (SV) Ethiopia is in 170th place out of a total of 177 countries where human development is concerned.
Ethiopia has more important things to do than to oppress opposition figures and put them in prison and to treat people as a collective instead of prosecuting them for specific crimes.
As far back as in October 2005, we criticised the way in which Ethiopia treats its opposition, but in 2006 and during this year the situation has deteriorated.
I believe that we have to make more stringent demands of Ethiopia.
After all, the African Union's headquarters are in Ethiopia.
Ethiopia must set a good example, and we cannot accept that the country that is host to our cooperation partner, the African Union, should go in for extensive human rights violations throughout its judicial system.
Before we can get to grips with all the issues to do with poverty and poverty-related problems, we must be able to help Ethiopia combat these human rights violations.
Without a lively opposition, we cannot solve the problems.
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw the Commissioner's attention to a contradiction to which we risk falling victim.
In 2005, we, the European Union, encouraged everyone in Ethiopia, including the representatives of the Oromo people, to take part in the elections in order to help introduce a democratic system.
We also sent one of the largest delegations of observers to the country.
Today, our fellow parliamentarians who were elected to the Ethiopian federal parliament and the parliament of Oromia and who have had the courage to come out into the open are being forced to leave their country.
They have appealed to us, because some of their number have been killed for political reasons, while others are fleeing to neighbouring Somalia together with thousands of Oromo refugees and are being pursued by Ethiopian troops.
At this point it is my belief that, as we helped to encourage and initiate this process, we cannot now abandon these people.
We must accept our responsibility by immediately adopting a support strategy within the framework of the special measures provided for by the new democracy and human rights instrument.
author. - (PL) Madam President, respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and freedom are the foundations on which the structures of a just state must be built.
The Commission and the Council should develop a cohesive strategy of actions to support the democratic process in Ethiopia and introduce mechanisms to counter the deterioration of the human rights situation in that region.
In addition to the arrest and imprisonment of people for their views, I find the information on the suffering and exploitation of children particularly alarming.
We have to condemn the harming of defenceless and innocent children.
I believe this is the most serious crime possible and it must be unequivocally condemned.
Only by acting in unison and with the cooperation of the countries bordering on Ethiopia, and drawing on stronger support from the whole international community can we improve the worrying situation in Ethiopia and return it to normality so that individuals are treated as entities and not as instruments.
author. - Madam President, I headed the EU election observation mission in Ethiopia in 2005.
At that time, Opposition leaders warned the EU that the elections would be another scam by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to fool the international community and that they all would end up in jail or killed.
We, the EU, persuaded them not to boycott the elections, promising to watch and ensure accountability.
The Ethiopians believed us and voted massively and in an orderly manner.
However, when people protested peacefully against electoral fraud, government forces resorted to brutal repression.
In June and November, hundreds were killed in massacres and thousands were wounded and imprisoned, including the leaders who had warned the EU.
They are among the 38 political prisoners found guilty on 11 June of this year in a farcical trial in which they were not able to present their defences.
Sentences are due next July, possibly carrying the death penalty, against some of the most representative, articulate and courageous leaders of Ethiopia - elected Members of Parliament, human rights defenders, journalists, activists for development, teachers and other prisoners of conscience.
Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, aged 77, the respected founder of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, is one of them.
The EU is the main donor of aid in Ethiopia.
I have seen the difference it makes there.
It can do it again if the Commission, Council and Member States stop turning a blind eye.
They must act immediately, holding the Government of Ethiopia accountable to human rights commitments under the Cotonou Agreement, holding Prime Minister Meles Zenawi personally responsible and pressing for the release of the prisoners without delay and unconditionally.
They must follow the recommendations made by this Parliament in several resolutions, including the one we will approve today, not to further let down the Ethiopian people, not to further discredit Europe's commitment towards development in Africa and not to further betray our basic values of democracy and human rights.
author. - (DE) Madam President, back in the early Middle Ages, Ethiopia played a leading role in dialogue between the Christian and Muslim world.
It is the oldest independent state in Africa, an ancient civilisation which fought against fascism and colonialism, and as has already been mentioned, is also the country where the African Union currently has its headquarters.
Given all these factors, it is with horror that we contemplate what Communism has done in the country.
The free elections two years ago in Ethiopia were a time of hope.
Unfortunately, that hope was immediately dashed, as demonstrators were beaten and scores were arrested.
As my fellow Member Mrs Gomes quite rightly points out, it was the best and leading figures in the country from all parties and all walks of life who were the victims of the first wave of arrests, and who have also been affected by the most recent round of arrests, sentences and trials this year.
We now need to take a stronger line.
I call on the Council and Commission to provide the long-awaited inspection reports from those observers who attended these unjust mock trials, which were merely for show.
In line with the Resolution, I call for an independent fact-finding commission, since the members of Ethiopian Parliament's own investigation board have either been jailed or forced into exile for seeking to expose the truth about these events.
The situation is unacceptable and we now need an independent investigation.
We urgently need to use our strong position in the country to stand up for the rule of law and human rights.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, if more death penalties are handed down to opposition activists in Ethiopia in the near future, it will mean disaster not only for the people of Ethiopia but also for our own democracy.
I have followed the development of the situation in Ethiopia, and have concluded that the Ethiopian authorities consider that the elections held in 2005 represent the achievement of an aim, rather than the start of the process towards achieving that aim.
I wonder whether this is not due to the fact that despite the verified and documented abuses by the ruling party, the elections concerned have been recognised as the most democratic elections ever to have been held in the whole of Ethiopia's three thousand year history.
The resolution we are to vote on today in the European Parliament contains many references to cases that must be unequivocally condemned.
We note that the situation regarding respect for human rights in Ethiopia remains very grave.
The process of democratisation has ground to a complete halt in that country.
There can be no justification for the arrest of leading members of the opposition, who are in danger of receiving death sentences after trials that failed to meet internationally recognised standards for free and fair trials.
We simply cannot condone the infringement of fundamental rights, arguing that it is impossible to expect full compliance with the standards of European democracy in Africa.
Ethiopia is a country with a long and distinguished history.
I believe its people deserve much more, and that it is incumbent on us to assist them.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, on the 11 June, 38 leading opposition figures were found guilty of charges ranging from crimes against the constitution to high treason, all linked to the mass protests following the controversial elections two years ago, in which nearly 200 people were killed.
Before the members of the Ethiopian Parliament's investigation board were arrested or forced into exile, the board concluded that the security forces used unreasonable force and that marksmen targeted leading opposition politicians.
The sentences are expected in the coming months and there is a danger that most of the defendants will be condemned to death.
We call on the Ethiopian Government to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally.
The Ethiopian courts urgently need to review the rulings and the government must work to ensure an independent justice system and a free press.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Ethiopia, a country with a population of 75 million, is one of Africa's poorest states and almost two-thirds of its citizens are illiterate.
It has had a traumatic history, passing from colonialism to royal oligarchy to Marxist dictatorship and, recently, to a type of apparent parliamentary democracy, but with serious democratic deficits.
We do not expect Ethiopian democratic norms to be of a European standard.
That would be unrealistic on our part, bearing in mind the country's huge problems, but we expect the Ethiopian Government to show respect for at least basic human rights.
We are currently very concerned about the psychologically paranoid mentality of the regime in Addis Ababa, which is behind a large-scale crackdown on Opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists.
We are particularly worried about the government-controlled corrupt judicial and police systems which operate in the country, and call on the Ethiopian authorities to proceed immediately to drastic changes and corrective measures in order to remedy the currently abysmal situation and to show the outside world that they genuinely care about justice and democracy, instead of simply claiming to do so.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that we will agree with Mr Cappato this time.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to express my support and acknowledgement of the work that some of our fellow Members have been doing for a long time with regard to Ethiopia and in particular that of our friend and colleague Ana Gomes, not just because of the mission that took place, but because over all these years she has been condemning the situation in Ethiopia and taking it extremely seriously.
I believe that support for this resolution that we are going to approve today may be crucial in terms of changing the situation in Ethiopia.
In my view, it was significant to see both the chairman and the vice-chairman of the committee of inquiry on the events that took place two years ago, having to flee the country, forced out under pressure from the Meles Government in view of the results of their inquiry.
This is something about which we cannot remain silent, particularly in view of the fact that it was the European Union that promoted and legitimised the elections in that country two years ago.
The situation is therefore clearly a worry.
It is serious and requires an immediate response.
(MT) Europe views Ethiopia with ambivalence.
It was initially extremely confident that it could help this country progress towards democracy.
This is why we sent to Ethiopia one of the largest observation missions we have ever sent.
The West views Ethiopia almost as an ally, and by the West I also mean America.
The West also applauded Somalia when it offered aid to the Ethiopian Government.
What has happened internally, however?
Internally, we have seen that, because this country relies on international assistance, especially from the West, human rights are not respected; minorities are punished in one way or another, and there is corruption amongst the police and judicial authorities.
We have also observed that there are just under forty people in prison, who will probably be given the death penalty.
Therefore, I believe that Europe must try to re-open negotiations in a collaborative rather than authoritative manner with this country.
We must convey the message to Ethiopia that it cannot continue to operate in this manner.
Madam President, I want to assure you that the Commission fully shares Parliament's concerns with the lack of progress with respect to democratisation in Ethiopia and even the deterioration of the situation since the 2005 post-election crisis.
The Commission, in coordination with Member States and the international community, actively undertook efforts to defuse tensions and urge the Ethiopian Government to take practical steps towards the reconciliation and the democratisation of the country, to restore confidence and to release the imprisoned opposition leaders and representatives of the media and civil society.
In its relations with the Ethiopian authorities, the Commission is continuously stressing the importance of reforms, including the implementation of the recommendations of the EU Election Observation Mission in 2005.
As far as the political detainees are concerned, President Barroso and Commissioner Michel have reiterated their concerns on several occasions to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, requesting a short, fair and transparent trial, asking for the withdrawal of the more outrageous charges and pointing out that they did not consider the trial an appropriate response to the Ethiopian political problems.
The granting of an amnesty to the political detainees was also suggested to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia.
The presence of an EU lawyer observer at the prisoners' trial is intended to remind the Ethiopian authorities of the EU's attention in this regard.
Notwithstanding the recent release of 26 of the 131 initial defendants, for whom some of the initial accusations had been dismissed, the Commission is at present seriously concerned about the guilty verdict pronounced on 11 June against 38 political prisoners, which could lead even to the death penalty.
The Commission, the EU Member States and the international community are following the situation very closely, also taking into account the ongoing mediation efforts between the Ethiopian authorities and the prisoners.
The Commission supports the mediation, but expects this mediation to lead to the unconditional release of the political prisoners.
The Commission is aware that the political situation is due to the lack of democratic reforms and extensive human rights violations, like arrests and detentions without charge.
I want to assure you that we will never abandon those Ethiopians who are committed to democracy, many of whom have been imprisoned and forced to leave the country.
Notwithstanding some progress made in parliamentary rules, there is a lack of substantial progress in the Prime Minister's commitments entered into with the opposition after the elections, notably on electoral reforms, independence of the National Electoral Board, media reforms, independence of the judiciary and of the security and military forces.
The Commission remains convinced that we should continue to engage with the Ethiopian authorities in an intense political dialogue on such crucial issues at every possible opportunity.
Commissioner Michel, who is personally committed, has given priority to keeping an open and structured dialogue with them within the framework of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement on political dialogue, as the most appropriate way to encourage enhanced governance, reconciliation and democracy.
The Commission recognises that democratisation will take time and we must remain vigilant as well as ready to support the government's efforts in that direction.
As regards the death penalty, we made it explicitly clear to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia that the European Union is opposed to its use in all circumstances and considers its abolition a crucial step towards the advancement of human dignity.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed, and the vote will take place shortly.

Burma
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Burma.
author. - Madam President, Commissioner, Burma is a regular theme in our sessions on human rights breaches.
If we had a prize for the regime with the worst human rights record, Burma would certainly be a very strong contender.
Incidentally, Burma is also a world star with respect to another evil: drugs.
According to the International Narcotics Central Strategy Report for 2006, Burma is the world's second largest producer of illicit opium, accounting for more than 90% of South-East Asian heroin.
I do not know how well the breaches of human rights are connected to drug production in Burma, but I know they should both be dealt with firmly, quickly and effectively.
Unfortunately, it seems that the EU's stance - as well as that of the international community - against the Burmese regime has not been drastic enough to have any good effect.
A good example is the recent granting of permission by the Council to the Burmese Foreign Minister to attend the ASEM meeting, only days after the military junta in Burma had extended the deplorable house arrest of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
The Council ought to give an explanation for this action.
Another example is the fact that an arms embargo on Burma is largely ineffective, since countries like China and India are not taking part in it.
Surely pressure must be put on such countries to join in the arms embargo against Burma?
In conclusion, let me reiterate our call for the immediate release from house arrest of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
That remarkable lady has contributed enormously to peace and democracy, not only in Burma but internationally, and she has been awarded both the Nobel Peace Prize and our own Sakharov Prize.
It is truly outrageous and shameful that she has spent more than 11 of the last 17 years in detention in her own country.
International and EU calls for her release have had no effect.
Our patience has long run out.
We recommend that more drastic action, such as expansion of sanctions and enlargement of the list of those targeted, must now take place.
author. - (PL) Madam President, the European Union has adopted a firm stance regarding the abuses perpetrated by the military regime in Burma/Myanmar.
Europe is pressing for Burma/Myanmar to show more respect for human rights and get back on course towards democracy.
The authorities in Burma/Myanmar are continuing to imprison and persecute activists working for democracy.
I believe there are two ways in which the situation in that country could be improved.
One is for China and India to stop supplying it with arms and other strategic equipment.
The other is for foreign enterprises investing in Burma/Myanmar to respect human rights.
It is also important to develop programmes to assist civil society in Burma/Myanmar, notably organisations for women and ethnic minorities.
I represent the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
We support all actions aimed at protecting human rights and respect for the principles of the rule of law and democratic freedoms including freedom of association and freedom of speech.
We will continue to do so at all times.
We wish to draw attention to the financial situation of the Burmese people.
Over 15 million of them are living below the poverty line. This amounts to about 30% of the population.
Immediate assistance is needed to protect the life and health of these individuals.
author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have often spoken in this House about the situation in Burma, making frequent use of the terms 'repression', 'military junta in power' and 'flouted human rights'.
The resolution that we are going to vote on today is a call for Burma to bring an end to certain actions.
Along with my colleagues, I particularly and principally deplore the house arrest since 30 May 2003 of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition member who celebrated her 62nd birthday on Tuesday and has spent eleven out of the last seventeen years in detention, mainly under house arrest.
She has only been able to leave her home once, for health reasons requiring urgent attention, and she has little contact with the outside world.
Aung San Suu Kyi is the symbol of the Burmese opposition to the military dictatorship, and also received the Nobel prize in 1991.
It is absolutely unacceptable for her to be under house arrest.
This is why we are calling for her immediate, unconditional release.
Burma must entirely stop persecuting and imprisoning pro-democracy activists and must release those who are already in prison.
I am thinking in particular of U Win Tin, a journalist who, now aged 77, has been in prison for nearly 20 years for writing a letter to the United Nations reporting the poor conditions under which political prisoners were being held.
As Vice-Chairman of the ANASE delegation in Parliament, I see the growing role that this organisation can play in the region.
May it have a positive influence on the Burmese Government in the near future!
author. - Madam President, Burma has one of the world's worst human rights and lack of democracy track records, with people-trafficking for sexual exploitation, domestic service and forced commercial labour.
This is compounded by the military junta's severe economic mismanagement.
Burma also remains the world's second-largest producer of illicit opium.
Despite multi-party elections in 1990, which resulted in the NLD victory, the repressive military junta continues to refuse to hand over power.
NLD leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who marked her 62nd birthday this Tuesday, has been detained for more than 11 of the past 18 years.
In February 2006, the junta extended her detention for yet another year.
Her supporters, as well as those who promote democracy and improved human rights, are routinely harassed or jailed in a country with no independent judiciary and brutal law enforcement agencies.
Following the recent UN Security Council refusal to apply sanctions against Burma, disgracefully, the UN Human Rights Council has focused almost entirely and exclusively on one single country - Israel - totally ignoring Burma.
The EU, along with neighbouring ASEAN countries, and along with India and China as well, must now do much more to apply pressure to secure Aung San Suu Kyi's release.
author. - (ES) Madam President, as other Members have pointed out and as is pointed out time and time again in the reports by the United Nations Special Representative on Human Rights in Myanmar, Mr Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, and in the reports by the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative on Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani, the situation in Burma continues to be of concern and is deteriorating every day.
I would like to begin by recalling the appeals that have been made in this House on previous occasions and which we must make once again.
Extending the confinement of Aung San Suu Kyi by a year is entirely unacceptable, and we must therefore call upon the Burmese regime to suspend it as soon as possible.
It is also important to call once again for the release of all political prisoners and to guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration, which are currently being violated in that country.
On the other hand, however, I also believe that it is important to point out our responsibility as western countries in relation to that country, in terms of investments, and I say this because there are at least two crucial factors.
Firstly, let us not forget that Burma currently has, if not the most significant, then at least one of the most significant reserves of natural gas in South-East Asia.
That is a very attractive thing, naturally.
It is therefore essential that, before there is any foreign international investment, we guarantee that there is at least an analysis of the impact of those investments on human rights.
That is something that we forget too often.
Secondly, I believe that it is also important to stress that the sanctions currently being imposed by the United States, and the European Union's restrictions, are not proving to be effective.
The fact that many other Asian countries are clearly increasing their investments in that country obliges us also to take a regional approach to the problem in order to ensure that our actions, and those of our allies, are more effective.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I reiterate the condemnation of the Burmese regime, which is so clearly and effectively expressed in the resolution.
The 17-year-long plight of Aung San Suu Kyi is one which few human beings could withstand.
She has selflessly withstood indefinite imprisonment and ongoing separation from her loved ones, yet is still showing unshakeable courage and consistency in her cause, and for this she must be applauded.
She is, without doubt, a leader of our time, enduring the curtailment of her civil liberties which closely mirrors the suppression of her fellow citizens.
The human rights abuses in Burma span religious persecution, forced labour and detention without trial and are elements of political violence which the UN has recently justifiably condemned.
The signatories of this resolution wholeheartedly denounce the economic support given to the regime through investment in the arms trade and the energy industry from other Far Eastern countries, which only shows up this ruthless dictatorship.
All democracies should seriously reconsider financing a country with one of the lowest health expenditures in the world.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, six months have passed since the last European Parliament resolution that sent out a warning about the serious internal situation in Burma/Myanmar.
The military authorities in power in that country have failed to make any progress towards democracy, however.
Burma/Myanmar's economic situation is causing great concern.
Thirty per cent of its people live below the poverty line and human rights are openly violated.
In addition, forced labour and child conscription into the army are part of everyday life.
Opposition activists are persecuted and imprisoned for long periods, as has happened in the case of Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel and Sakharov prize winner who has been detained for 17 years.
Against this background, all the political groups in Burma/Myanmar should be urged to take part in the National Convention charged with drafting a new Constitution.
Representatives of the National League for Democracy should also participate.
Burma/Myanmar's membership of ASEAN is particularly important for its future, as ASEAN members are required to redouble their efforts towards democracy.
China and India should exert political and economic pressure on the Burmese regime by refusing to support the army of Burma/Myanmar.
For its part, the international community should implement economic sanctions and freeze the assets of members of the Government of Burma/Myanmar and those associated with them.
It is only by taking decisive action of this nature that we can hope to force the Burmese regime to introduce democratic changes.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, the subject of today's debate on human rights violations is once again the political and social situation in Burma/Myanmar.
Ever since 1962, Burma/Myanmar has been ruled by the military, who have kept an iron grip on the country.
For over 40 years, human rights have been violated in this Asian country, and thousands of individuals have been persecuted and punished for opposition activities.
Many have been imprisoned.
Forced labour is the order of the day, and children are conscripted into the army.
Most people in Burma/Myanmar do not have access to medical care.
Many of them die of tuberculosis, malaria, HIV or AIDS and almost half the children do not attend school.
Red Cross centres have been shut down and those in need deprived of protection and humanitarian aid.
The junta disregards the actions of the UN Human Rights Council and of the ILO.
It also fails to respond to European Parliament resolutions and to documents issued by the Council of the European Community.
On 15 May 2007 Aung San Suu Kyi's term of house arrest was extended for a further year.
This Nobel Prize winner and opposition activist has spent 11 of the last 17 years either in prison or under house arrest.
We appeal for her release and that of other political prisoners.
We also call for the National League for Democracy to be allowed to resume its activities, and for the resumption of humanitarian aid to prevent the extinction of the Burmese nation and ethnic minorities.
A particular problem concerning the continued existence of this regime and others of a totalitarian nature is the ineffective actions taken by international bodies.
Despite promises to the contrary, the sanctions imposed do not have an impact on the economic structures of the regimes and the embargoes applied hit ordinary people who are already persecuted and living in extreme poverty.
Our European Parliament resolutions and all other actions will remain superficial and ineffective until these issues are resolved.
Madam President, the Commission remains worried about the situation in Myanmar/Burma.
The biggest worries concern the deep social and ethnic fault lines which divide the country and which result in human insecurity, widespread poverty and lack of progress in economic and social development.
It is obvious, that in a climate of human insecurity and ongoing armed conflict in a few border areas, there is little space for respect for human rights.
The authorities of Myanmar/Burma are confronted with a number of challenges, like establishing national unity and political stability, and - most importantly - advancing the development level of their country which remains one of the poorest in the world.
For the international community, helping the transition of Myanmar/Burma towards a more open and more developed society - led by a legitimate and civilian government - should remain the paramount goal.
The military leadership's erratic governance continues, in economic terms and in the political sphere.
The military continues to employ practices of forced labour, while civil society faces repression, uncertainty and operational difficulties.
The '88 Students' - the then leaders of the 1988 uprising - continue to exploit the minimal space for civil society as much as they can, while the National League for Democracy is marginalised and while the unjustifiable detention of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi continues.
Transition is hard to imagine with more than one thousand political detainees, among whom Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi sticks out as the icon of peace and reconciliation.
Such transition is equally inconceivable without a genuine dialogue with the various ethnic groups, including those continuing their armed battle.
The Commission supports the work of Professor Paolo Sergio Pinheiro, the UN's Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar.
He said, in his last statement, that 'grave human rights violations are indulged not only with impunity but authorised by the sanction of laws'.
The Commission also welcomes the appointment by the UN Secretary-General of Professor Ibrahim Gambari as Special Envoy for Myanmar, and expects that the Government will extend its full cooperation to him, in order to allow the good offices of the UN Secretary General to continue.
Regarding the forthcoming session of the National Convention, we call on the Government to listen to the voices of ethnic groups and political stakeholders in opposition.
We note progress in the working conditions of the local International Labour Organisation office, which will hopefully improve the situation of victims of forced labour practices filing a complaint.
But we deplore the deteriorating working conditions for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and call on the Government to allow the ICRC to resume its humanitarian mission.
Among most observers, there is a growing consensus that more needs to be done about the political and socioeconomic situation.
The European Union, in its common position, has mandated the Commission to engage the Government in a dialogue over its responsibilities to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
The EU has, therefore, been looking for effective policies which may help the people of Myanmar/Burma and which may help to bring them back into the international community.
The Three Diseases Fund, supported by the EU and its partners, is an example of this policy.
Our approach focuses on the most basic and immediate human security needs of the population, and it clearly recognises the limits which exist for all external actors.
However, withholding aid and contributing to more isolation would only make the population pay the price, that is, the people of Myanmar/Burma who are already suffering.
We simply do not believe that through increased sanctions the suffering of the people can be relieved.
Moreover, such an approach would not help influence the military leaders.
The Commission is fully committed to stepping up its programmes in Myanmar/Burma, in quantitative and qualitative terms, with a view to contributing effectively to development and reconciliation.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place shortly.

Roaming on public mobile networks (signature of act)
It is my great pleasure, Madam Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Council, to sincerely welcome you today to this extraordinary plenary session of the European Parliament.
(Applause)
We eagerly await your report on the results of the European Council of 21/22 June and the activities and achievements of the German Council Presidency.
It is also a pleasure to greet the Commission President, Mr DurÃ£o Barroso.
Welcome, Mr Commission President.
Before we come to the discussion on the summit, however, it is a joyful experience, together with the President of the European Council, to sign an important new EU regulation.
With our signature under the Roaming Regulation, we are at the same time rounding off a successful collaboration on behalf of the citizens of the European Union.
(Audio problems)
Europe does not always succeed immediately.
If we are patient, however, it will succeed.
As far as technology is concerned, there is still more to do.
The Commission President is right about a technology institute.
Mr Commission President, we must move forward.
Today is a good day for 140 million mobile-telephone users in the European Union.
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have acted quickly, decisively and efficiently on behalf of our citizens.
In a record time of only eleven months after the tabling of the draft regulation through the Commission, the new Roaming Regulation comes into force at the end of this week, on 30 June.
At this point, I would specifically like to thank the Commission and especially Commissioner Reding for her initiative, her bold proposal and her active role in the course of negotiations.
(Applause)
My thanks also go to the Council Presidency, which recognised the importance of this ruling for Europe's citizens and therefore campaigned for a speedy solution at Council level with great dedication and successful negotiating skills.
Special thanks go to our rapporteur, Mr RÃŒbig, and the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler.
They steered this difficult dossier safely and decisively through the committee and were able to achieve an excellent and convincing result for consumers.
From this summer onwards, mobile-telephone customers will be able to take advantage of lasting lowered roaming tariffs.
Greater price transparency and quick, personalised price information provided immediately on crossing a border will lead to a more customer-friendly service and a lowering of prices.
Today, the European Union is removing a major barrier to further development of the freedom of movement of persons within the European Union.
This is a good example for a Europe of results, for a Union whose actions have a tangible value for its citizens.
Madam President, there is provision in the procedure for you to kindly make a few remarks on the Roaming Regulation before your main report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not every regulation can be explained simply, but this one can.
With this in place, it will be simpler and, above all, cheaper to telephone from one European country to another in future.
I am quite sure that Europe's citizens will greatly appreciate it and we should, therefore, quickly put our signatures to the regulation, Mr President.
(Applause)
European Council meeting of 21-22 June 2007 Activity report of the German Presidency (report and statements followed by debate)
Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the debate on the results of the European Council of 21/22 June.
Madam President of the European Council, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, you will today address for the fourth time the Members of the European Parliament.
This sets standards for each presidency to come.
I do not wish to anticipate the comments of the chairmen of the political groups and my other fellow Members.
I would, however, like to express our thanks for your good will, your patience, but most of all your decisiveness concerning Europe, without which the outcome of the Brussels summit would not have been possible.
My sincere thanks, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
(Applause)
We come now to the debate on the European Council report and the Commission's statement regarding the European Council meeting of 21/22 June 2007 as well as the Council statement on the six months of the German Presidency.
Madam President of the European Council, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, you will today address for the fourth time the Members of the European Parliament.
This sets standards for each presidency to come.
I do not wish to anticipate the comments of the chairmen of the political groups and my other fellow Members.
I would, however, like to express our thanks for your good will, your patience, but most of all your decisiveness concerning Europe, without which the outcome of the Brussels summit would not have been possible.
My sincere thanks, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
(Applause)
I should like to ask you to address us now, Madam President of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days after a memorable European Council, I would at this point first like to bring back into memory our celebration ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in Berlin in March.
On that occasion we reminded ourselves that 50 years of the Treaty of Rome, 50 years of peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law, are after all no more than the blink of an eye in terms of history.
Whether, some day, they are to be more than that ...
(Audio problems)
Ladies and gentlemen, I will try again.
Is the interpreting service sorted out now?
Madam President of the Council, could we try again please.
In Europe some patience is required.
I would ask for your forbearance.
Mr President, my fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days after a memorable European Council, I would at this point first like to bring back into memory our celebration ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in Berlin in March.
On that occasion we reminded ourselves that 50 years of the Treaty of Rome, 50 years of peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law, are after all no more than the blink of an eye in terms of history.
Whether, some day, they are to be more than that, we do not know.
At the ceremony in March, we made it clear that none of this, peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law, none of this can be taken for granted.
It must all be strengthened and defended again and again.
To stand still is to go backwards.
It takes decades to build up trust but it can be destroyed overnight. Yes, overnight.
Any rift would have Europe out of step faster than some might think.
In short, European integration must repeatedly be worked at and safeguarded.
I am therefore very grateful that we were able to achieve exactly this with the outcome of the last European Council.
We set the course for a renewed, common foundation of the European Union; we overcame the standstill.
In the end we did not destroy trust; we avoided a rift.
In short, with the outcome of Saturday evening, Europe will find a new, common energy.
Today, I do not wish to rake over the draining negotiations of recent weeks and months, as we all know only too well that even the starting point was difficult.
On one side we had the states that had ratified and fully supported the Constitutional Treaty and on the other side the states requiring extensive changes because of criticism from their people.
Let us not fool ourselves, there is always a danger present: the danger that the state of paralysis and the tendency for division continue.
Of course, had the European Council not achieved the desired outcome, it would not have signified the end of Europe, but it would undoubtedly have had almost indescribable repercussions.
It is therefore of great significance that we managed to avoid this situation.
The Brussels Agreement enables us to retain the substance of the Constitutional Treaty.
I think that ultimately we are all agreed that the outcome of the European Council is a success. A success for Europe and also a success for the European Parliament.
You have always defended the substance of the Constitutional Treaty and now the Reform Treaty can come into force in time for the European elections in 2009.
This is of extreme importance for all who will stand before the citizens of Europe.
(Applause)
With the Reform Treaty, we have taken into account the concerns of citizens about a would-be European superstate, about surrendering too much of the identity of the individual states.
I do not share these concerns, but I needed to respect them and respect them I did.
We decided, therefore, to refrain from mentioning any symbols or designations similar to those of the Member States in the Reform Treaty.
At the same time, the Reform Treaty achieves significant advances in the European Union's capacity to act.
We have gone further even than in the EU Constitutional Treaty in some areas.
The issues of climate protection and energy solidarity were raised; national parliaments are becoming even more heavily involved in the shaping of national policy on Europe; the lines between the authority of the EU and of the Member States will be even more clearly demarcated; it is now easier to meet the conditions for increased cooperation, particularly in the spheres of justice and home affairs.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Reform Treaty realises three elements essential for the future of the European Union.
Firstly, it strengthens the EU's capacity to act, both internally and externally.
The Union's single legal personality and the extension of qualified majority decision-making in the Council play a part here.
The revision to a double majority, giving the demographic factor greater weight, will, however, come into force only in 2014, that is, at the same time as the first slimmed-down Commission, and with a transition period until 2017, but it will become reality.
This is European progress that cannot be overestimated.
The Council's work will also achieve greater continuity through a European Council president and the team presidencies with the coming into force of the new treaty.
At the same time, the Reform Treaty brings policy progress, for example in the sphere of the European Union's external activities.
A coherent foreign policy, speaking with one voice, becomes ever more important for a Europe that wishes to assert itself in the world.
We will appoint the High Representative of the Union for Foreign and Security Policy, he will lead the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he will be supported by a European diplomatic service and he will be a member of the Commission, namely Vice-President of the Commission.
This is a political quantum leap for Europe.
(Applause)
In the spheres of justice and internal affairs, an area in which people are extremely interested, important progress is being made, for example in the common fight against cross-border crime.
Proceedings will also be significantly sped up by the new process of decision-making by qualified majority.
In addition to this, we will be able to make clearer that the transfer of authority is not a one-way street, through which the European Union just takes on more and more responsibilities. There can also be situations where authority can be handed back to the individual countries, where necessary.
It is a commonly expressed wish of the people that there should be more European participation in some important areas but also less participation in domains that the Member States can manage perfectly well on their own, and we are accommodating this desire.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Reform Treaty also makes a second thing unmistakably clear: there will be greater proximity between Europe and its citizens.
To this end, a European citizens' initiative will be introduced, as envisaged in the Constitutional Treaty.
Progress will be made in the social sphere and there will be well-defined regulations in the area of public services.
In addition, the Intergovernmental Conference will determine its own protocol, where services of general economic interest will be highly valued and it will be made clear that the Member States have substantial freedom of scope in the non-commercial domain.
I am very pleased, and I think the majority of us are in agreement on this, that we were also able to find a solution for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The Charter will strengthen the rights of citizens in relation to the institutions.
It preserves legal obligations, which, in my view, is fitting for a Europe with a sense of values.
(Applause)
We know that the United Kingdom, with its own legal tradition, has chosen its own path and we must respect that.
The alternative would have been to restrict the legally binding nature of the Charter for all, which would, however, have been unacceptable for the majority of the Member States.
It is good, therefore, that this was avoided and I believe that this is the majority opinion of Parliament.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, finally, the third element where progress will be seen through the Reform Treaty is that of more rights for parliaments.
With the reform of the Treaty, the European Parliament will, as a rule, be an equal co-legislator and in future the European Parliament will elect the president of the European Commission.
At the same time, many Member States thought it important to give more recognition to the role of national parliaments.
This will be put into effect in a new article.
We also agreed to strengthen the parliaments under the subsidiarity control mechanism; although in doing so we have respected the European Commission's right to make proposals.
In future, individual national parliaments will have no power of veto, which I also think is absolutely right.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Treaty was one of the goals of the German EU Council Presidency.
The other goal of the European Council Presidency was the reorientation of the European Union towards that which we can achieve only as a united Europe.
For I am wholly convinced that only if we act jointly and purposefully can we achieve tangible progress for our citizens.
Of course, there will always be exceptions, which we saw as recently as at the time of the EU Council rulings. There will always be new cases of individual Member States deciding that they do not wish to participate, or at least not initially, in particular policies, whilst others lead the way, although within the scope of the treaty.
This, however, is not a so-called 'two-speed' Europe.
Allow me to be quite clear on this: I do not think much of it.
(Applause)
This must not be the aim of our policies; otherwise we will open up new rifts in Europe and weaken the European Parliament.
It is worth all the trouble and effort to keep on searching for a common path for all the Member States of the European Union.
There is an African saying that if you want to travel fast, walk alone; if you want to travel far, walk together.
I think that in this African saying lies the wisdom underlying the concept of European integration.
Only if we act jointly and purposefully can we preserve the great, the unique idea that has shaped the concept of European integration for over 50 years: peace, freedom and legal certainty for the citizens of Europe.
Only if we act jointly and purposefully can we strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union, for example, by integrating the PrÃŒm Convention into the legal framework of the EU.
This facilitates increased police cooperation in the cross-border fight against terrorism, criminality and illegal migration in the EU.
Only if we act jointly and purposefully will we improve Europe's competitiveness as a place for business.
An example of this is the Roaming Regulation that we have signed here today.
Only if we act jointly and purposefully can we take on one of the major challenges for mankind, the danger caused by climate change.
The decisions taken at the Spring European Council for an integrated energy and climate protection policy are groundbreaking.
They were, incidentally, also the prerequisite for reaching an agreement at the G8 Summit that we need a follow-up undertaking within the scope of the Kyoto Protocol under the auspices of the United Nations, and that all G8 participants have declared their support for this.
This would not have been possible without the Spring European Council and the support of the European Parliament.
This is a great example of defending European interests.
(Applause)
It is only right, therefore, that climate protection will now be included among the goals of the European Union in the new draft treaty.
Only if we act jointly and purposefully do we Europeans stand any chance of bringing our concerns to bear in the world.
This was also demonstrated by the summits we held during our Presidency with our non-EU G8 partners: the US, Russia, Japan and Canada.
In addition to decisions on climate protection, further agreements of long-term importance were also reached at these summits: with the US and Canada we agreed to strengthen regulatory cooperation; with Russia we agreed to establish an early-warning system for energy crises and to open a dialogue on investment; with Japan we agreed to enforce the protection of intellectual property rights more effectively.
Ladies and gentlemen, all institutional progress and the reorientation of the European Union are ultimately possible only if we Europeans are conscious of our values, indeed, if we make these values the guiding principles for all our actions.
I believe that these guiding principles can also help to convince our citizens about Europe, namely by raising awareness of our common goals, by making it clear that we are acting together in the world on the basis of our values.
Europe does not mean doing as we please. Europe is an obligation to help ensure that our Earth remains a habitable planet, that fewer and fewer people are forced to leave their homes as a result of violence or war, that diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis can be fought successfully.
Thus, the German EU Council Presidency comes full circle.
The Reform Treaty is necessary so that Europe can hold its course.
The European Council hopes that the Intergovernmental Conference can be convened before the end of July, which is why I would like to ask you today to submit your statements as soon as possible.
As does the German Presidency, you want us to be able to say to people in the 2009 European election campaign: This is the only way for Europe to move forward.
This is why it is good that the European Parliament repeatedly gets involved in debate on these matters and seeks a dialogue with civil society, as it will demonstrate at an agora event in the autumn.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at the close of the German Council Presidency, to quote once again from the book 'Werte.
Von Plato bis Pop' (Values - From Plato to Pop) by the German author Peter Prange. You may remember that I quoted him in my speech here in January at the outset of my Council Presidency.
Prange writes that everything we Europeans have ever achieved, we owe to the contradictions within us, the eternal conflict within ourselves, the constant jostling between opinions and conflicting opinions, ideas and opposing ideas, theses and antitheses.
Allow me to add a few words of my own. We owe it all to our ability to withstand these inner contradictions and to our ability, after countless wars and untold suffering, to allow something as awesome as the work for peace in Europe to succeed.
We citizens of Europe have truly united for the better.
My wish is that in 50 years' time, in 2057, the citizens of Europe will say: back in 2007, after strength-sapping, nerve-racking discussions, the European Union at last set the right course; back then, in 2007, the European Union set off on the right path to a prosperous future.
That was, is and will remain our mission, our mission for the future, to which Germany will stay wholly committed even after its Presidency ends.
Thank you.
(The Members of the House stand up and there is prolonged applause)
Madam President of the Council, the reaction of the European Parliament expresses better than any words its great endorsement of your actions.
We would also like to sincerely thank your colleagues who have supported you.
I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Commission President Barroso and kindly ask him to address us.
President of the Commission. (DE) Allow me to congratulate Chancellor Angela Merkel on what she has achieved.
Out of an extremely difficult task a success for Europe has emerged.
I should particularly like to pay tribute to the political ambition that the Chancellor showed in insisting on a reform Treaty that gives the Union the instruments it needs to face up to the challenges of the 21st century.
We should salute Chancellor Merkel and the entire German Presidency team for battling with such determination to achieve their aims and for bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.
These congratulations apply not only to the result of the June Summit but also to the many successes that the German Presidency has achieved in the course of the last six months.
(Applause)
We can honestly say that Europe is fully on track.
I believe it is useful to remember where we were some time ago.
Let me step back from the events of last week and look back over the last two years.
Just over a year ago the Commission adopted an approach which I called 'the twin-track approach'.
The first track was for the European Union to use the existing Treaties more effectively to deliver results for Europe's citizens.
We have done this, for example through our package of measures on energy and climate change; through our focus on innovation; through our drive against red tape; through legislation which delivers practical benefits for consumers, such as the legislation we proposed on roaming, which was signed before us here today.
I want to thank this House for its support for those initiatives.
The second track was to return to the process of treaty reform.
That is why we suggested the idea of the Berlin Declaration.
That was a great moment to reaffirm our interests and our values in the 21st century.
I believe that the discussion on the Berlin Declaration was an important time to gather the necessary support which made it possible to achieve good results at the recent European Council.
We are therefore honoured to say that the path we have been suggesting over the different presidencies of the Council was followed.
How was that possible?
Because the twin-track approach was the right approach.
We cannot give our citizens the impression that we are just talking about institutions: we have to concentrate on practical results for our citizens, and governments and citizens will have the confidence to tackle sometimes very difficult institutional issues if they have the confidence that the institutions can deliver when it comes to the concerns of the European citizens - growth and employment, and Europe's new agenda: energy, climate change and security.
The recent Eurobarometer is encouraging: support for European Union membership and the perceived benefits of membership have improved considerably over the last two to three years.
In fact they are the best results in terms of support for the European Union since 1994.
That is why we have done - and we should do - everything we can not to miss the opportunity to reinforce the commitment to this great European project now that we are 27 states and almost 500 million citizens.
Let me be very frank about the results of the Council.
I think that when we consider the challenges ahead we can really say that the results are excellent.
Today in this House it is the time to stress this point.
Let us not forget that before this Council we started from a division between 18 Member States that had rectified the Constitutional Treaty and 9 Member States that had not ratified it, and 2 of them explicitly refused the Constitutional Treaty after a referendum.
Now all 27 Member States are united around a common mandate for a reform Treaty.
The fact that we managed an agreement is already an outstanding political result and we should be grateful for the willingness of all governments to compromise.
Now we should look forward to the ratification process as a great moment of solidarity and unity in Europe and as a historic opportunity to consolidate the enlarged European Union.
At the same time, the advances from the Nice Treaty will guarantee a Union with a greater capacity to act to deliver results.
Honestly, the reform Treaty will probably not be an example of the finest poetry, but I have no doubt that it will be a very good example of excellent prose if it is focused precisely on the capacity of the European institutions to act.
I said before the European Council that we really needed to reinforce the European Union's capacity to act.
I believe the reform Treaty will bring important advances to the Union and will reinforce its ability to act.
First of all, the Union will be fully consolidated by overcoming the pillar structure and by acquiring a single personality.
In this area of capacity to act, I would like to stress in particular three specific points.
First, the most substantial advances are in the area of justice and home affairs.
There are more than 40 new cases of qualified majority voting in the reform Treaty. They include external border control, asylum, migration, criminal law and police cooperation.
The Treaty will also fully integrate these areas into Community method of decision-making.
It is in fact the 'Communitarisation' of the third pillar.
This is a fundamental reform which will create a true space of freedom, security and justice in Europe and it will be a priority for the rest of the mandate of this Commission.
The Union needs the efficiency which more qualified majority voting brings.
It is no use having the right policies if they are agreed years too late.
Second, the reform Treaty will offer new possibilities and reinforce legal bases to deal with the challenges of energy policy and climate change.
In particular, the Commission is very pleased with the solidarity clause on energy security and agreement to add combating climate change to the Treaty.
Energy security and climate change are now core priorities for the Union.
It is right that this is reflected in the Treaties.
Third, the reform Treaty will enhance the Union's cohesion as regards external affairs.
In the 21st-century world, it is only by combining the forces of our Member States and of our institutions that we can compete with other leading powers.
Our prosperity, our freedom and our security depend on the capacity to compete at a global level, the capacity to promote our interests and our values.
Europe will increasingly speak with one voice in diplomatic, security and defence issues in trade, in monetary aid, in development, and as such will be better equipped to defend our values and interests in world politics.
We will have the conditions and the instruments to shape globalisation and we cannot miss such a historic opportunity.
But the reform Treaty also addressed other issues, namely in terms of accountability and democratic legitimacy.
With the reform Treaty, the Union will reinforce its accountability and democratic legitimacy.
Again let me emphasise three cases of clear improvement compared to the Nice Treaty.
First, the European Parliament will have greater participation in the legislative process of the Union by an increase in codecision procedures.
Under the new Treaty, the vast majority of European laws will be adopted jointly by the European Parliament and by the Council in full respect of the Commission's right of initiative.
Second, national parliaments will be more involved in the workings of the Union.
This is about subsidiarity and we are for subsidiarity.
The new Treaty will amend the protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality.
This Commission has always welcomed a greater role for national parliaments.
However, the Commission also made clear that involving national parliaments in scrutinising subsidiarity should not undermine the essentials of how the European Union works.
First, any new procedure on subsidiarity would have to respect the Community method and the Commission's right of initiative.
Second, the European Parliament and the Council should be on an equal footing.
Finally, the thresholds regarding majorities should rise to reflect the importance of the procedure.
We managed to secure all our demands and as such to preserve the institutional balance of the Union, while reinforcing the control of subsidiarity.
Third, and in my view this is one of the most important points, the reform Treaty will give legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The fact that the Charter is legally binding is a powerful symbol of the strong ties that exist between the Union and European citizens.
It is also a very good signal and symbol that we are committed to fundamental rights.
We cannot promote fundamental rights all over the world and not say that we consider them binding at home.
(Applause)
The Charter is not, and was never intended to be, a Charter of the rights of European institutions above the Member States.
The Charter is for European citizens and the rights of the citizens against any power that could limit those rights.
The Charter will be a safeguard, both for European citizens and for national institutions, and will be a central part of the system of checks and balances in our Union of law, because that is what makes us different from many other projects: we are a Union based on law.
I have always said that a step back from the existing acquis would be unacceptable.
This is particularly important in respect of the single market.
The results of the European Council were entirely positive from the Commission's point of view, specifically from the point of view of the Commission's competence.
The protocols on services of general interest and on the internal market and competition, both proposed by the Commission, guarantee a fair and undistorted functioning of the single market, while respecting legitimate concerns expressed by some Member States.
Before concluding, I should like to warn against the temptation of a perverse alliance between those who resist a political Europe and those who oppose the single market.
To those who support an open and global Europe, I say that they will only get this if they support political integration.
Without political power, Europe will never be able to shape globalisation and to defend its interests and values in the world.
Europe will never be able to defend its commitment to an open economy and to open societies.
(Applause)
To those who accept a strong political Europe, but are not as enthusiastic about economic integration, I say that they will only get that strong political Europe if they support the single market and economic integration.
(Applause)
We cannot defend the European project by attacking the single market and trying to fragment what has been one of the greatest achievements of our integration in Europe.
After the success of the European Council, there are now two crucial stages ahead.
First we must finalise the IGC and sign the reform Treaty.
The IGC will begin next month and the Portuguese Presidency aims to conclude it in October.
I fully support this.
Member States must then ratify the Treaty, and meanwhile, we must explain to the European public why this Treaty will be a necessary and positive step forward.
Such a narrative will be a central part of the Commission's opinion ahead of the IGC.
I also know that this House is already working hard on its opinion.
I certainly hope that the European Parliament and the Commission can continue to work closely together on spreading the message that this reform is indispensable for meeting the challenges of the 21st century and delivering better results to European citizens.
I believe that European citizens are the real beneficiaries of the reform Treaty.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Barroso, for your speech and your great commitment.
Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, for some months now, there has been a 'driving force' in Europe, and we owe that to the German Presidency of the Union.
I should like to pay special tribute in this House to the Chancellor, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Merkel, and to her government.
The track record of the German Presidency of the Union speaks for itself.
Its successes have changed the atmosphere prevailing in the European Union.
Moroseness and pessimism have been replaced by confidence, and the feeling of powerlessness in the face of the challenges of globalisation has lessened to make way for hope in the effects of ambitious, realistic and determined political action.
The package on energy and climate change was the first major positive signal.
You set the tone by convincing the EU Heads of State or Government to opt for ambitious objectives concerning renewable energy sources and CO2 by 2020 and to combat climate change.
During the G8 in Heiligendamm, Europe showed that it was united and began to make the United States budge.
Of course, much still remains to be done in this area.
However, we have shown the people of Europe and our partners that when Europe is united, it has a real ability to influence and to lead.
