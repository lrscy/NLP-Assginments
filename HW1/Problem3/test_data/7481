It is in this sense that the issue of teacher training is absolutely top priority, and the endeavours perceptible on some of the pages of the action plan are certainly to be increased and recompensed.
They are to be increased and recompensed because it is the responsibility of all of us to realise that the effect of the e-Learning action will not just be reform of parts of our education system but genuine reform of the way we think.
We will have to find a way to explain why this progression is necessary within the Union's education systems and how very necessary it is.
In order to do this, I feel that the endeavours we make, including in terms of the budget and of clarifying the aims of the budget, will certainly have to be considerable.
I would like to end by thanking our fellow Members once again and entrusting to them the heart of our message, in particular, which is that, as I have stressed, the new technologies are a tool, they are a means - not the end - but a means that is absolutely essential right now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am standing in today for Mr Gargani, who is staying in Italy for reasons you will understand.
In this major debate on education we have added a question to the Commission and the Council - unfortunately the Council is unable to be present - because we believe that now, when everyone is suddenly talking about a European educational area, the European Parliament that has always talked about it and fought for it, but which has always been blocked by the Council of Ministers, cannot simply look on while it, the elected representative of the citizens, is bypassed in matters which are very important and which we have been advocating for a long time.
I think it was indecent - perhaps that is too strong a word - improper to ask Parliament on 8 February for an opinion on the future objectives of general vocational training systems that was presented to the Council just four weeks later.
Things cannot be allowed to continue that way!
That is why we called for this debate and why we are asking to be properly included in the discussion in future.
We are all of the opinion that this report on general vocational training in the European Union is a major step forward after the Lisbon Council because it sets concrete objectives and defines the future role of general vocational training.
This is an issue that affects all Europe' s citizens.
I repeat once again, this is something we have said all along.
As Socrates rapporteur, I fought for this together with my colleagues, ultimately without success.
If success is coming at this late stage, I am grateful.
We must, however, always bear in mind that this is an area of policy that we cannot carry through without the support of the Member States.
It involves matters that can be tackled only in the context of subsidiarity.
We can give examples, we can make a synopsis of how things look in one country or another.
Perhaps the Member States can learn from each other. There is no need to keep reinventing the wheel.
We cannot, however, do very much more in these fields.
We should like to stress that the open method of coordination that the European Council called into being at its Lisbon meeting and in whose context this report was prepared must not be allowed to prevent the institutions provided for in the Treaties from fulfilling their roles.
In our opinion, the general consideration of the future role of general vocational training in the context of the open method of coordination must have regard not only for the contributions of the Member States, but also, and, above all, for the contributions of the European Parliament and the Commission, while safeguarding the principle of subsidiarity.
We reiterate that the conclusions drawn by the Stockholm European Council and the strategic objectives that were formulated can form the basis for a working programme for the coming decade.
These things cost money, however.
I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot always confine ourselves to fine words, making grand final communiques and calling on the Commission to act.
At the end of the day, we all stand there and say: I hear the words, but I have no faith in them because the money for all the things we want to do is not there.
So I hope that the Heads of Government, having realised that education is tremendously important in the European Union, far more important than many still think, will spend more money on it.
I should like to point out to the Commission and the Council that we insist that, in the spirit of inter-institutional cooperation between Council, Parliament and Commission, the European Parliament must be involved in producing the follow-up report and in all the measures arising out of it as part of the long-term working programme.
I am sure that the Commissioner will do that.
I only hope that this will be passed on to the Council and that it will likewise follow in Mrs Reding' s footsteps.
I also hope that we can work together on the things laid down in this working programme.
.
(NL) Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I expect I am stating the obvious when I say that education and training are becoming increasingly important in a modern knowledge economy, if we in Europe are to continue to compete with industrialised parts of the world.
I shall limit myself to the recommendations contained in my written opinion.
Firstly: in education more attention should undoubtedly be paid to training in information technology both for pupils and for teachers.
Students deprived of such a preparation run the risk of exclusion from the development of the new economy.
We still lag far behind the United States as regards the use of information potential in education and business.
Since no less than a quarter of newly created positions in the last decade are related to the information society, we must realise that students require thorough preparation.
We must therefore also aim for optimum use of government investment in the use of technology.
Secondly: attention has been repeatedly drawn to the need to bring students closer to business in order to train tomorrow' s entrepreneurs.
Thirdly: the setting up of many more second-chance schools has become necessary, as the current number is far too low.
Two pilot projects are planned for Spain, France and Germany - the large countries - but the Commission says nothing about the other countries.
In view of the size of the large countries, five projects would be desirable while for smaller countries, at least two projects should be planned.
By increasing the number of pilot projects, it might be possible to make the second-chance schools a more effective tool for strengthening economic and social cohesion and combating social exclusion more successfully.
Finally knowledge of languages, one of the principal European aims.
Our rapporteur, whom I thank for his report, believes that even knowledge of two languages would be a success.
In my opinion, I stated that I should like to go a step further.
In order to promote integration and the opportunities for students in the labour market, in my view knowledge of three languages should be regarded as a minimum.
Why?
Because quite a few Member States have more than one official language.
Belgium has three.
Learning the official languages of the countries of which the students are citizens is obviously essential for their integration into the work process but an extra language in addition to the official languages is highly desirable.
If we look at the most recent survey of knowledge of languages carried out by Eurostat, we see that less than half, only 45%, of citizens of the European Union can conduct a conversation in any but their native language.
So there is a great deal of work ahead of us, but that is equally true of the rest of the issues raised in this instructive debate.
Mr President, the importance of lifelong learning in creating a learning society is fundamental to meet the challenges of economic and social change and sustainable development that we face today.
In the light of recent job losses across Europe, retraining and education will be even more important in helping to adapt the skills of workers to enable them to find new jobs.
For this to be effective sufficient resources have to be made available.
Lifelong learning has a much wider significance than that: it is also important for personal fulfilment and as a means of developing responsible citizenship, encouraging people to play a full part in their community.
So it can help break the cycle of poverty and unemployment.
Through informal and non-credited learning it can also be a very effective way of involving both adults and young people in the most disadvantaged areas, who are those most threatened by social exclusion and poverty but who often have very negative attitudes towards formal education and so are least likely to benefit from it.
Unfortunately, the Commission's White Paper "Teaching and Learning - Towards the learning society" missed the opportunity to produce a comprehensive report, including examples of good practice, which would have been of great value to all those working in the field.
It does not contain enough information on how effective or cost-effective various actions were and there is little information on what was done to target specific groups such as women, elderly workers, immigrants, families in disadvantaged areas, the long-term unemployed and disabled people.
So whilst there are universities, colleges and community groups as well as regional and local governments across the EU carrying out excellent and pioneering work in this field, this report does not really reflect that.
Therefore I agree with the rapporteur that even as an interim report, on what was after all an ambitious White Paper, this is a disappointing summary of progress on this most important issue.
I hope future reports will be more positive and can be useful tools in themselves for those working in education.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgets has attached the greatest importance to this matter, the e-Learning initiative, because of the great contribution it can make to European citizens enjoying, through appropriate training, better living and working conditions in the new information society.
I would remind you that, under the broad economic guidelines for 2002, adopted on 3 April, which are an important political instrument in budgetary matters, specific consideration is given to the e-Learning initiative as an important stage in the process of achieving the strategic objective established by the Lisbon European Council. This objective was to create a knowledge-based economy capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
In this context, I would ask the Commission to look into the possibility of laying down a more suitable legal framework, which will genuinely complement the action of Member States in this field.
This is also the approach adopted in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, annexed to the Mauro report.
I would state once again that an initiative as important as this justifies the creation of a specific programme with its own legal basis.
It therefore seems insufficient to use existing programmes, such as Leonardo, Socrates, Culture 2000, research programmes and Structural Funds, as sources of funding for the new initiative, which should stand on its own in terms of funding too.
At the same time, we take the greatest interest in the way in which existing preparatory action is implemented in this field in this year' s budget, that is the budget for 2001.
Lastly, I wish to congratulate Mr Mauro on his excellent work.
draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities. (DE) Mr President, in the matter of e-Learning I think we must above all realise that we are entering an entirely new world, that we are exploring new things and should not therefore keep to well-trodden paths.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has once again found that women are still largely excluded from the Web.
Internet activities and everything that goes with the New Economy are still not the brave new world so far as women are concerned, as, incidentally, was also noted recently at a major international conference in Hamburg.
Eighteen countries contributed their experience.
There is a digital discrepancy.
The ratio of women to men on the Internet is in the region of one to four.
It is true that access is improving, but among people beginning their studies there are still only around 20% women compared to 80% men.
When it comes to the formation of Internet-related companies, the proportion of women is still vanishingly small.
We are therefore calling for new access to be created specifically for women, for special software to be developed for women, because they use the Internet differently and because women are still lagging a long way behind in qualifications.
If we want to act on the resolutions of the Lisbon Summit and create a knowledge-based society, we must pay particular attention to women.
We must, for example, abandon coeducation in some matters.
We must tread new paths here.
I think it is particularly important that we catch up with the Americans.
Here, too, we find that American women already have much greater access to the Internet.
In some fields they have actually overtaken men.
I think we still have a good chance of achieving something here with our action plan.
I therefore ask that, in formulating the action plan, particular attention be paid to developing a greater and more specific involvement of women.
Mr President, if I have understood you correctly, you are inviting me to reply to the oral question.
I shall reply later to the discussion on the reports.
I should like to thank Mr Gargani, who is represented today by Mrs Doris Pack, for his oral question concerning the specific future objectives of our education and training systems.
Above and beyond the question of who received what and when, or which report has been drawn up, Mrs Pack has said something of fundamental importance.
She said that the European Parliament was the originator of every campaign to ensure that education is something other than a regional and national element and to ensure not only that the European dimension of education should be a matter for discussion, but that its beneficial effects should be recognised.
We are almost there, Mrs Pack, because since Lisbon there has been a sort of silent revolution, an enormous step forward.
However, even though we have made this enormous step forward, we must not forget that many structures, especially national structures, have remained in the old world, which is not so old as that, since it dates from only a year or two ago. We still have difficulties, therefore, in achieving a balance between the old-fashioned concept of subsidiarity and the concept of a subsidiarity which is very well able to collaborate with European interests.
What I am doing, with your help, is performing a sort of balancing act, by trying to take a very big leap forward, while at the same time trying not to destroy the confidence of certain people who look askance, and with a critical eye, at any possible encroachments upon subsidiarity.
Having said that, I should like to give a clear reply to the question raised by Mr Gargani.
It is true that the European Council in Lisbon asked the Education Council, and not the Commission, to give general thought to the specific future objectives of our education systems and to submit a report to the European Council in spring 2001.
It is the Commission' s responsibility to ensure that the Council makes progress, even though the Commission itself was not specifically asked to do anything.
In the final analysis, however, it was the Commission which prepared the work of the Council.
Perhaps it was because of the initial difficulties that Parliament did not receive the documents in question in time to enable them to react.
It received the documents afterwards, immediately afterwards.
We have learned a lesson from this situation, which was not the fault of anyone in particular but is inherent in certain procedures.
This is why I think that in future we ought to operate slightly differently.
After all, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the time limits.
The Heads of State and Government took the decisions at the European Summit in Stockholm, on 23 and 24 March 2001, on the basis of the text adopted by the Education Council on 12 February.
It will simply be a question of continuing with the work. In other words, nothing new will be incorporated into the structure.
There will be new material in the texts, I hope, but not in the structure, because now there will be follow-up action.
Each time, the Education Council will prepare for the summits.
The next Education Council, due to take place on 29 November 2001, is already preparing for the Barcelona Summit.
Under the Spanish Presidency, and therefore in the very near future, before the Barcelona Summit, there will be another meeting of the Education Council.
This being the case, Mr President, I very much hope, with all my heart, that Parliament will undertake to prepare to meet these time limits.
You know very well that I have tried to inform and involve Parliament in our current thinking regarding the follow-up to this report, and I can honestly say that I shall pay attention to any thoughts which the European Parliament would like to share with me during the course of this year. This is why I always insist that Parliament should be asked for initiatives on this subject, and believe me, at every Council I repeat to ministers how important the elected representatives of the people are in this area.
I hope that the collaboration based on the continuation of the relationships that are about to be established will operate in such a way as to ensure that full consideration can be given to the contribution of the European Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make four points.
Firstly, I should like to say that the ambitious goal Socrates has pursued for years, the creation of a European educational area, is now almost reality - and I hope it will soon be embodied in the texts.
The Council, the Councils of Feira, Lisbon, Stockholm and now also of Nice, have stressed the importance and role of education and training in society and for the knowledge society.
I should like to underline that today education and training are, first of all, the European Union' s most important political priorities; secondly, they are a political challenge and an economic challenge, because we all know that without education and training we cannot offer young people training places.
Thirdly, they are an opportunity to further develop Europe' s linguistic and cultural heritage and give it European added value.
The second point I want to address is that the Commission and Council really seem to be both maximalists and minimalists.
Maximialists in the strategies and political ambitions they develop on paper.
On the other hand, however, the European Union and, above all, the Council, is a very great minimalist when it comes to actually giving these great projects financial resources.
Then it is always the Commission or Parliament or whoever that come in for criticism, but never the people who with great pomp and ceremony announce to the great councils how important training and education are.
If they would provide the money for it the next day, we would all, especially our citizens, be very grateful.
The European Union has, in fact, always been mean in the budgets for education.
I should like to remind you all of the dreadful Conciliation Committee marathon over the little bit extra we wanted for Socrates.
I hope that the revision of this Socrates programme that will probably take place within the next two years will also bring Socrates a little more money.
I am pleased, and Parliament can be pleased, that there is now an e-Learning initiative.
We have heard, as Mr Costa Neves has said, that Parliament, represented by the Committee on Budgets, is pressing for this not to be at the expense of any existing programme.
These programmes have their purpose!
They have the financial resources for that and nothing else!
I therefore believe that if we say that e-Learning is important, and we stress that it is, then there must also be a programme with the proper financial resources.
The third point is that I regret and deplore the fact that we were not sufficiently involved in the general matters; I said so earlier on Mr Gargani' s behalf.
We really must be responsible for the system' s specific objectives, we must help to bring this about and inter-institutional cooperation must be ensured.
I assume I am reflecting what you said, Commissioner, you understood it that way and you will include it in future.
My fourth point is this: In view of the debate on enlargement and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, we need our work in this European Union to be genuinely visible, we need a European educational area that is visible to the citizen.
This means it must be really accessible to the citizen himself, and the citizen needs to be permanently involved in these programmes through the representation of his MEPs.
We need the directives, we need ambitious objectives, we need measures, we need action programmes, with their own funding, of course, and if we do all that in education, then we shall not need so many Commission and Parliament information campaigns any more because we shall have reached the citizen where he is.
I hope we can go this way together.
Mr President, first of all I commend all the reports before us which go some way to defining our common aspirations for the future of educational systems in the Union.
They also make clear some of the issues which we now face in developing such systems.
The first issue is the European educational area which hovers above all the reports rather like a question mark, and we undoubtedly have a variety of views on this: there is no doubt whatsoever, and this is without prejudice to the concept of subsidiarity, that we need to coordinate our education policies in the Union in pursuit of the Lisbon goals.
If we do not do this, we cannot attain them: it is as simple as that.
We need to have a coherent understanding of what constitutes good and what constitutes bad practice.
We need to have an understanding about teaching and learning models, how we want to employ them, and what values we want to impart through them.
We need to understand that this will involve considerable change, because of the new styles of education systems that we need today.
We need to learn from best practice.
We need therefore to have up-to-date hard and soft statistics to ensure that we can provide the most valuable benchmarks so that our systems match the very best.
These reports also point to the development of educational content.
At the risk of courting controversy I would remind you that Cisco Systems and Microsoft are already in our schools providing content.
We need to make sure that they are providing the sort of content that we want to see in our schools.
We need mobility.
It is not just the key to a successful European single market, it is the key to a successful Union in its social and political content as well as its economic content.
The mobility report has made considerable progress on this, but, how long has Bologna been around and yet failed to gain widespread application?
How do we ensure equal access to mobility for all people when Member States do not have equal access to language skills?
I would argue that for universal access to mobility we need to have universal access to language teaching and learning.
Here, as elsewhere, new technology is one of the keys to unlock all of these solutions.
We can install all the hardware and all the infrastructure we like all over Europe, but unless we have the educational systems to teach people skills in schools and in life-long learning, we will not be able to make the most of them.
Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is to become, in the words of the Lisbon and Stockholm declarations, the most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy.
The fact that today we are holding here this combined debate on the new technologies and mobility in education, shows that the European Union is really willing to work seriously towards this and in so doing we underline that importance.
The three reports on e-Learning by Messrs Mauro, Perry and Alavanos are excellent.
I should therefore like to thank them warmly for the work that they have done.
My group, the ELDR, attaches great importance to the e-Learning project for both pupils and teachers.
Better equipping of all teaching and training institutions, high-quality content are all components that contribute to a higher participation in the labour market.
Obviously the exchange of best practices can play an important part in this and we at the European level can provide a stimulus.
It goes without saying that we must not limit ourselves to mainstream educational institutions.
Lifelong learning, even after one has withdrawn from the active employment circuit and training opportunities in the new technologies outside mainstream institutions, must both be encouraged.
I have made that observation on more than one occasion.
The socially and physically deprived must be involved and everyone must be given the guarantee that their efforts will be rewarded with qualifications that are recognised everywhere in Europe.
This is important for the internal market.
I shall follow the plan of action closely myself and I insist that we are given regular thorough reports and analyses.
One final point I should like to raise is: in the report on the future objectives of education and educational systems, there are extensive references to the use of ICT.
However, it is careless of the Commission and the Council to have omitted to submit the report to Parliament.
Although it was agreed in Stockholm that in education and other fields the method of open coordination would be used, it testifies to a great lack of democracy and transparency if that implies that the Council sends the reports to Member States without Parliament having any say.
Surely the European Parliament, with its directly elected membership, is the obvious body to involve in open coordination.
I understand, however, Commissioner, that you have meanwhile repented.
I should, however, like to state clearly that my group feels that the European Parliament should have an input in the follow-up report and we must be very closely involved.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteurs and thank them for the many ideas they have thrown up, on which we shall vote in concrete reports.
We live in a time of rapid change, but we cannot allow one half of mankind or perhaps a minority of human beings to keep up and others not.
So that the whole question of democratisation confronts us with great problems regarding the technology we are discussing.
The previous speaker spoke a little while ago about lifelong learning.
I read a plea for calling it instead 'learning as you live' .
In fact I prefer that.
Because lifelong learning seems to be a mammoth task, while 'learning as you live' stimulates our curiosity everyday anew.
For children it should be 'learning as you play' .
Also through the playful use of the materials available to ensure development, access to information, learning how to learn.
In that connection I was struck by a complaint by one of those odd teacher figures at a school in Flanders who objects that he has now equipped his school with 200 computers and ensured that all those classes are accessible, but that there is no regulation governing the status of staff.
There is no such thing as a statutory framework for ICT coordinators.
It seemed an excellent idea to put this to you.
Because if we simply go hammering on about infrastructure and not about the right way of using it, do not ensure the user-friendliness of teaching material in the educational environment and do not actually make it available and keep it up to date day by day, then it will all come to nothing.
I remember the time when language labs were introduced into schools ; it was a great, fashionable surge and all self-respecting schools had such a language lab.
You should go and see what a shambles they have become, and you are bound to wonder for how long they were actively in use.
I therefore feel that we should be given the facts: what is the position now?
It is said that in Flanders there is a computer for one pupil in every ten.
I wish that were true, I hope it is true, but what do we want to achieve, where do we want to be in five years' time and in ten years' time?
I hope there will not be a gulf between people who can keep up and those who cannot.
Mr President, teaching and learning for a knowledge-based society, a citizens' society, European added value and other similarly pompous expressions of dubious import are sprinkled liberally through the reports under discussion in a bid to conceal the real substance of the reactionary, anti-educational reforms of the education systems advocated in the White Paper.
Luckily, a wave of protest has risen up against this policy in numerous countries of the European Union.
In Greece, huge demonstrations by students, pupils and teachers against this reactionary policy to dumb down education have given rise to an explosive situation, rectors have resigned and universities have been occupied or even closed.
The trend towards mass education in the 60s, 70s and 80s has now been replaced by a new model in keeping with the latest demands of big business, which wants a constant supply of cheap, semi-skilled labour and a small, highly-qualified elite.
What is being advocated is a new type of vocational training dictated by the immediate demands of the capitalist market, while scientific knowledge and specialisms are being shifted into expensive post-graduate study which few can afford.
Knowledge is giving way to skills, i.e. reading, writing, arithmetic and elementary use of computers, together with skills which will allow young people to adapt easily to capitalist restructuring, while teaching them to be well-behaved workers and citizens.
Educational establishments are called on to become more responsive to fast changes on the job market.
Abandoning wider subjects and, in general terms, a wider education in favour of skills which will make them employable deprives children - especially children from working class homes - of the rudimentary knowledge they need in order to function as active, thinking citizens and, as factors of social progress.
Big business is trying to penetrate education, mainly in the aim of creating new profitable business activities, witness the reference to the famous link between schools and companies.
The reports under discussion, especially the Perry report, not only fail to oppose the guidelines in the White Paper, their sole criticism is of the delay in implementing them.
Mr President, the people of the European Union must fight and overturn this anti-educational policy, they must secure their basic right to a free, high-quality, universal state education which is sensitive both to the productive requirements of each country and to individual vocations and talents.
We, as members of the Communist Party of Greece, shall do whatever we can to foster this.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission, the College of Commissioners and, especially, Mrs Reding, for the work they are doing to break down the barriers caused by restriction and the principle of subsidiarity, with a view to creating joint programmes which move beyond this very concrete world in which the education system is developing.
I believe that one of the most complex aspects of the history of Europe - where the same phenomenon is being repeated - is the tendency towards convergence and fragmentation, the tendency to come together and then move apart, to divide up into a thousand pieces.
We are living in an era in which there is once again a process of inward-looking nationalism which is opposed to globalisation - clearly a misunderstood concept - and this process tends to divide States and regions.
Culture and education are the main victims, since they become confined within their own borders.
However, certain programmes can only be carried out from above.
Furthermore, the principle of subsidiarity is being wrongly interpreted and, in my judgment, is largely being distorted by States and many regions which use it to increase their own power and - it must be said - to enable the State apparatus to exercise control over thought and the education system.
Of course the State must provide free education for all, but it must not exercise absolute control.
Let us imagine that aeroplanes could only fly as far as the provincial, regional or national borders.
Well, in education we are endeavouring to prevent our cultural knowledge from travelling beyond the border and the result is clearly a broken and fragmented project.
I therefore praise, applaud and believe in the idea that we must support the Commission' s vision through ideas, articles and resources, since the Commission is the only supranational body able to act in this field.
I believe that one of our first debates should be on subsidiarity, because there is plenty of legal literature on subsidiarity and not just this current popular interpretation of it.
Furthermore, I believe that Europe is simply a common way of thinking or, at least, a capacity to communicate.
In this respect, I believe - and I would also like to praise the forum which has recently been initiated with companies - that we will not be able to implement this project without private initiative.
Since their powers are limited, the States cannot act beyond their own borders.
We are now witnessing exactly the same phenomenon in the regions: each region is creating its own intranet (and they are all very proud!), or rather their egonet.
The result is therefore a product which is the sum of many things, but the whole is never the sum of all the parts.
I therefore ask for a debate to be opened on the principle of subsidiarity, in order to analyse the extent to which this often limits the freedom of our citizens.
The companies are the only ones able, with the help of the Commission, to implement projects which fly like eagles above the mountain tops and have a global vision.
I believe that a European spirit of convergence, and not one of fragmentation, is our only hope of ensuring that this programme is completed and is not a source of endless frustration.
We must make sure that in two years' time we are not talking about what we wanted to do but were not allowed to.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that we are now having a joint debate here on a number of extremely important reports.
It is not coincidental at all, because it all concerns the question: are we going to take a new initiative or not.
What is the issue?
In Lisbon, we took a number of important decisions with a number of concrete objectives.
The question now whether or not we can realise those objectives?
That is what today' s debate is about.
Let me make two observations before I start, two things I find really regrettable.
Firstly, and that is understandable in a way, I note the absence of a debate on lifelong learning.
That will come later, Parliament will have its say on this, but I regret its absence because the concept of lifelong learning is, in fact, a very important concept that should be an overarching framework for the things we are discussing this evening.
I feel the lack of that debate.
I also often feel the lack of links to the concept of lifelong learning in a number of the reports.
This is understandable because of the timing.
The second point a great deal less understandable and I will return to it shortly.
Is it not strange that we should be debating education here and do not breathe a word about the Bologna Declaration on the eve of the Prague Summit.
We simply have nothing to say on the subject, have we?
Let me return to a number of reports before us, very briefly.
Mr Perry rightly said that his report tends to be about the past and to a much lesser extent about the future and the present.
Rightly, but we can nevertheless learn a great deal from it.
Mr Perry is absolutely right when he says that the Commission has not achieved its objectives.
The objectives were not concrete, they were not quantifiable, there were no indicators and where is the European value added of that White Paper?
Let us reflect on that for a moment.
Let us try to define what European value added is.
We are again on the eve of a debate on the future of Europe.
Certainly there is talk of the debate on 'demarcation of competence' .
Definitely very actively in Belgium on the eve of the Laken Conference.
However, what is 'demarcation of competence' ?
What is the debate when we are discussing education?
It is about subsidiarity.
But then let us define that properly and for goodness' sake don' t let us beat about the bush, we do that all too often.
In the report of the Council on the future of education and training systems, there are number of interesting points, and a number of objectives, which I can support, but once again they are vague objectives, no indicators, no methods of measurement and then we are occasionally in danger of becoming bogged down in endless palaver, and we must absolutely not do so with the debate that we are now conducting, following the lead of Lisbon.
If we do not succeed in moving towards open European coordination with the European employment guidelines as an obvious example, I do not think we will make any progress.
In my previous life, I worked for the Flemish Minister for Employment.
Well, in that Ministry, people toiled to implement the European employment guidelines.
I wish that the education ministries in all the Member States would toil over a number of concrete objectives in order to convert them into policy, then we would have a true European educational area.
To return to Bologna.
It is terribly embarrassing.
I am scarcely, if ever, addressed as an MEP on European educational policy, except in respect of Bologna.
I have received piles of letters and e-mails.
Am I supposed to say, I am sorry, it was an intergovernmental method, the European Parliament has nothing to say about it?
I would ask you urgently, Commissioner, to take joint responsibility with us for it, because the Bologna Declaration is not just about a number of concrete objectives, but also about the democratisation of education and lifelong learning.
If we are unable to make that link I believe we will be missing a chance.
Mr President, I welcome the paper on the e-Learning initiative and congratulate the rapporteur on its content.
E-Learning is becoming increasingly important.
Until now perhaps less weight has been given to it in relation to education.
It is, however, becoming increasingly apparent that our children's future is indeed a digital future.
Therefore preparing for the use of information and communication technologies is becoming increasingly important.
The training of teachers in this field is a top priority.
I fully support this.
But my concern is that once teachers return to their respective schools they return to find that very little ICT facilities are available for them.
More often than not they find that they cannot communicate the knowledge acquired through training courses back to the children and make use of ICT in their classes because of lack of resources.
Without the necessary tools to meet the aims of the e-Learning agenda, the goals of the Lisbon Summit will not be achieved.
Having no direct jurisdiction over education in the Member States, how will the Commission ensure that these goals are being met and that Member States' governments will provide schools with the necessary equipment to realise these aims?
Another problems is that technology is advancing at such a rate that it has become necessary to update computer equipment every few years.
This has been, and will be, an added problem for schools working within very tight budgets.
It is equally important to make training and education in the information society available to all individuals throughout their lives to realise job opportunities and for personal development as well.
This is important and reflects the trend and the decrease in heavy industries in favour of the service industries which rely heavily on digitally-literate personnel.
Let us reduce the gap between Europe and the United States.
Let us create an e-Europe which is accessible to all.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I am glad we are discussing so many reports together because it brings out so clearly how all the questions raised are interrelated as they impinge upon education policy and our lives.
The various aspects of education policy cannot be separated any more than the subjects can be divided into different curricula with each defending his own the strongest.
I think this debate shows that very well.
I find myself in a pleasant situation today because my country, Austria, leads the field in Europe for schools networking in connection with e-Learning and the new media.
Sixty-one percent of schools - that is 3 860 schools - in my country are connected to the Internet, including secondary schools, of which there are about 1 000.
One thousand and ninety already have their own Internet sites.
All universities are interconnected via the academic computer network and in that way also have access to the TEN 155 European high speed research network.
I am pleased about that, but at the same time it is not enough.
It is a correct and important trend that we have started, but more needs to be done and I am therefore very pleased that the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have started the European School Net, the e-scola initiative.
Only last week we saw how computers and the Internet are actually being used in teaching, to improve the quality of teaching and create new oportunities for learning with the objective of using the compiled teaching and learning materials and practical examples in the future and making them more widely available.
Commissioner, I thank you for your persistence in this matter.
We are on the right road together.
The destination is known, but we still have a long way to go.
This brings me to a number of points in the debate.
Firstly, the concept of subsidiarity.
I am an ardent champion of the subsidiarity principle and I come from a country with a very marked degree of federalism.
However, I also call on all Member States not to use the principle of subsidiarity as an excuse - as often happens - for failing to take necessary steps towards Europeanisation.
For me, subsidiarity in this context means being close to the citizen, serving their essential interests regionally and individually, fulfilling necessary common European tasks, so we can face global challenges and fulfill our responsibility towards the younger generation.
Secondly, education, as this example also shows, is not an end in itself, but education from school to lifelong learning to catering for the new stage in life that is old age is the prerequisite for achieving our goal of a knowledge-based economy that is number one in the world.
Education policy is therefore the key to the success of economic policy.
Education policy is the prerequisite for today' s young people holding their own on tomorrow' s labour market and for our fulfilling our role as Europe in worldwide competition.
I should therefore like to say to Mr Korakas, who thinks protests against these objectives are already beginning, that we as politicians must do all we can to tell people that this development is happening and we have to prepare ourselves for it.
Three points, therefore, to finish. First, as Mrs Martens wanted to say, it is not only about providing computers.
There is also the ethical question: How are we to use what computers make available to us?
The ethical question of their benefit is, like their handling, an important task for educational policy.
We must also see to it that no new social time bombs are created between those who know how to use them and those who do not.
If education fails to take the correct social action, that may become the new class war.
I therefore also call for industry to sponsor schools so that all can have the computers they need.
The next point is lifelong learning.
Let us do our best to see to it that senior citizens are not forgotten when it comes to training, because only by so doing can we attain the European objectives, keep pace with world competition, make enlargement a success and avoid setting off a new social time bomb.
Mr President, Commissioner, we want the EU in ten years' time to be the world' s most competitive economy, with nobody being excluded.
We want to develop Europe in such a way that all people feel they are involved.
For that reason it is natural that education should play a prominent role in the Union' s strategy.
Good social policy will not prevent exclusion if the issues of equality of education and its high quality are ignored.
Investing in education and its availability will mean that the human resources that exist will be made effective use of.
It will not then just be a matter of finding talented people and giving them the encouragement they require, necessary as that is: it is just as vital to ensure that everyone is provided with basic knowledge and skills.
At the same time, education should help young people and adults too to discover their strengths and to achieve success.
In February the EU Ministers for Education adopted a report on the concrete objectives of educational systems in the Member States.
The work is to continue.
A follow up report is to be presented at the European Council meeting in spring 2002.
We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are pleased with this development.
The Committee has been stressing the importance of a European debate on education for a long time now.
We are, however, sorry that Parliament has been passed over in the preparatory work until now.
This is not so much a matter of prestige as one of existing resources being underused.
I am convinced that Parliament' s involvement in setting targets for education will bring with it an important European angle on the issue.
Although education is covered by the principle of subsidiarity, not only does improved competitiveness need to be taken into greater consideration in the educational policy of different countries but also the point of view of individuals.
European educational policy must be developed in such a way that it supports the movement of Union citizens and their mutual interaction.
Mr President, it seems to me that we have overlooked the obvious in the procedures applied to the subject of the future objectives of education systems and to a previous subject, i.e. the quality of school education based on indicators.
What we have overlooked is the enormous interest of the Committee on Culture and Education in these matters, which will be crucial over the next decade and which are crucial to the future of Europe.
As you know, the European Parliament closely monitors and supports every single initiative and action on the part of the Commission, be it e-Learning, student mobility, language learning or the quality of education systems.
We feel that the open coordination method proposed in Lisbon will help to promote the numerous new ideas needed in Europe in order to improve education and flexibly promote best practices.
However, this method must go through the proper parliamentary channels if it is to secure greater agreement and transparency and avoid confirming the powerful objections of those who consider that the open coordination method breaks the rules.
Mr President, in Europe today, education has increased in importance beyond all recognition.
In particular, lifelong learning is becoming more important to people's everyday lives, whether as regards access to opportunities to employment, or in using ATM machines to get cash, or having to go on-line to get banking and other services because local public services are being closed down in an era of competition and liberalisation.
That is why it is important at this juncture in the European Parliament that when we speak about education we make sure that it is all-inclusive.
Of course, we must pay due attention to people who are at present within the formal education system, and improving the Erasmus and the Escola programmes and other similar programmes is vitally important.
However, we must not forget that we are now in danger of creating a new class of technologically illiterate people, who will be denied access to this new, wonderful information highway and society which we are creating.
So, over the next ten years - as my colleague has said - the area we should focus on is ensuring that people now in middle age are given the tools of knowledge, information and education in order to be able to live in the altered world which will be coming about.
I offer my support to the reports which have been submitted.
I know that the Commissioner will be most innovative in bringing forward new ideas for e-Learning and for education.
Mr President, much has been said, and indeed, much has been well said.
I should have preferred to see a number of ministers sitting here listening to what Parliament had to say on subjects such as the European surplus, or observing the principle of subsidiarity while creating a European policy.
I believe it is very important that ministers should hear with their own ears what the elected representatives of the people have to say.
First of all I should like to thank Mr Perry for his report on the White Paper.
The White Paper dates from 1995.
That is a long time ago.
The revolution, if there was one, Mr Perry, happened last year, over the past twelve to fifteen months, in other words, since Lisbon.
Since 1995, the ideas put forward, mainly by the European Parliament - and here I agree with Mrs Pack that the initiator of all this policy was undoubtedly the European Parliament - have been put into practice, at least in part.
On the recognition of educational qualifications, I am well aware that much remains to be done, but the system of credits within universities has started to work.
As far as mobility is concerned, I know that in practice we have not made much progress yet, but a decision on mobility was taken at the Nice Summit.
We now have something definite to go on, which is much better than simply the grand ideas that we could discuss five, six or seven years ago.
As for language proficiency, things are moving in the Member States, thanks, amongst other things, to the European Year of Languages 2001, as a result of which everyone is discussing the subject, local authorities, parents, and teachers themselves.
There is a change taking place beneath the surface.
We can therefore expect to see this change making itself felt in the everyday practice in our schools.
With regard to investment in education, this is an area in which I would let subsidiarity prevail, and I share the regrets of those Members who say that fine words should be followed up with budgetary resources.
Yet there is no doubt that either most of the ideas proposed in 1995 are now being put into practice, or else we now have the tools with which to push them forward.
So I am not as pessimistic as some Members of Parliament on this point, because I have seen, and I have felt, that the situation has been developing since the Lisbon Summit.
A fundamental change is taking place. Of course, it is too slow, but at least things are moving, and that in itself is a major step in the right direction.
On the subject of lifelong learning, 1996 certainly represented one of the first steps forward in this area.
I presented my memorandum on what Mrs Maes calls 'learning as you live' . It would be marvellous to be able to implement this idea, but it is not the Commission who will be putting lifelong learning into practice in the Member States and in the regions.
The Commission can encourage, it can push, it can come up with ideas, but when it comes to implementation on the ground, that is up to the Ministers for Education, not to mention the trades unions and the social partners.
A whole new system of informal training schemes will have to be created in most Member States.
Well, I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that in ten years' time we shall still be talking about lifelong learning, and we shall probably have taken a few small steps forward, but we shall not have succeeded in finding a definitive solution to the problem.
As for information technologies, I shall come back to this subject in detail later, but here too an enormous amount has happened, from the highlighting of the problem to the recognition that practical action was needed.
Look at the Netdays Europe initiative, look at the E-schools.
Of course, at the moment there are only a thousand of them.
There really ought to be five thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand.
I am well aware of this. These thousand schools, however, represent experience on the ground.
I should like to thank not only the European Parliament, which is pushing things forward, but also all those people who are working 'at the coalface' , with a great deal of idealism, often alone, with very meagre resources, putting their hearts into it because they believe in progress.
They are remarkable people, and I think we should say thank you to all those who, on the ground, are helping to put our ideas into practice.
The e-Learning action plan is also helping to change things.
Lastly, we are now in the middle of European Year of Languages 2001.
I have already said this, but I will repeat it. We must learn the languages of our neighbours as well as our own mother tongue.
Those who are doing nothing about it are beginning to have a guilty conscience.
That, at least, is a start.
We must continue to nurture that guilty conscience.
Some Members have mentioned subsidiarity.
As far as I am concerned, the interpretation of subsidiarity is very clear.
I respect it, but I want to create a European added value, networking, the exchange of information, and the dissemination of good practice.
I should like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the studies made of the quality of primary and secondary education.
This is a revolution!
Could you have imagined, in 1995, that ministers would ever have agreed to let strangers come and check up on their quality levels in education?
Never!
Yet this is now being done.
The system is still not perfect, but comparisons make it possible for ministers to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and they are making efforts to correct any shortcomings.
As regards financial provisions, the White Paper does not contain any.
In spite of this, we have drawn up an impressive number of pilot projects, which we have funded and which have often provided the basis for reforms on the ground.
In recent years the Commission has wanted to play, and has indeed played, the role of an incubator of ideas, a driving force.
In this respect I am thinking of the pilot projects on second-chance schools or the European Voluntary Service.
As far as second-chance schools are concerned, I had my doubts.
I went and had a look at them and I was most pleasantly surprised.
They are not intended to replace national education, but rather to solve social problems, and the results are excellent.
The staff is very committed, they believe in what they are doing, and what they are doing is rescuing young people.
It really is extraordinary.
The project was recently the subject of an assessment, Mr Perry, which will shortly be referred to Parliament.
This assessment confirms the great success of the pilot project and the thirteen schools.
For instance, the index measuring the failure rate is only 6%, whereas in institutions or similar projects the failure rate is between 30 and 50%.
So you can really see that progress has been made. In any case, I should like to see this system, which has proved its worth, being introduced in more Member States.
The objectives set out in the White Paper were incorporated into the Luxembourg Process, the Cardiff Process and the Social Agenda.
As you know, from now on education ministers will be taking part in debates on social issues, on the same footing as ministers for social affairs and ECOFIN.
This represents an enormous amount of progress. It has not had any noticeable effect yet, but the main thing is to be present and to make a contribution.
The views of the education ministers have been expressed in the demands they have addressed to the European Council.
So, ladies and gentlemen, it is up to us to define the new priorities, to launch multi-annual programmes, to open up new debates, and to issue new challenges.
I believe that we are on the right track, and we have every reason to be positive and optimistic.
However, this does not mean that we can assume that we have achieved everything already.
That is far from being the case.
Nevertheless, the machine is in motion and progress has been made.
In 1995, all we had were grand ideas, but no practical action on the ground.
Now, we are making progress.
I should just like to say a word or two about Bologna.
At the first Education Council, which I attended, I found that Bologna was only the subject of an intergovernmental procedure.
I made sure that it was incorporated into the Community context by associating the Commission with the process, on a joint basis with the ministerial troika.
Under the Swedish Presidency, I recognise that the time has come for fresh progress, and I am convinced that the ministerial conference in Prague will enable us to make that progress.
I have already been in contact with the Belgian Presidency, because here too there has been some follow-up action, with a view to continuing in this direction.
Now we are waiting for the Prague ministerial conference, and then the Belgian Presidency will take over again.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can well imagine that the European Parliament will be preparing an own-initiative report, for example after the Prague conference.
It is not always necessary to wait for the Commission to draw up a report before you act.
Parliament has the right to take its own initiatives.
Use that power, so that we can hear your voice.
With regard to the e-Learning reports by Mr Alavanos and Mr Mauro, I should like to thank Parliament, its rapporteurs and its committees, many of whom were involved, for the support that they have given me on this issue right from the beginning.
Mr Alavanos and Mr Mauro have done a remarkable job, Mr Alavanos earlier, and now Mr Mauro.
This is of vital importance, because here too this process helped us considerably at crucial moments, in defining the concept of e-Learning immediately after the Lisbon Summit, and in formulating the e-Learning action plan, immediately after the last European Council.
I should like to respond to the three fundamental messages not only expressed by the rapporteurs but also discussed by the Members of this House.
The first is the principle of access for everyone.
You know that immediately after the Lisbon Summit the e-Learning plan gave rise to various initiatives in some Member States, aimed at installing computers in the classroom.
However, a computer in the classroom is not an end in itself.
A computer is only a machine, a tool.
It has to be possible to use that computer, and the fact that it exists does not mean that it is being used.
In my opinion, therefore, we must never separate the tool from the person who is using it.
In short, yes we must equip schools, but we must do more than that. We must equip schools but we must also have electronic communication centres in our local authority areas, because it is not only those who go to school who have to participate in the information society.
There are also those who have left school.
Exchanging scientific information, enhancing the services provided by libraries, creating an accessible European educational network and specific services, these are all essential measures to combat social exclusion.
Yet social exclusion will continue to exist if, in order to lend more weight to the statistics, we merely install computers without providing teachers with appropriate training.
I have paid careful attention to the report on the position of women and the special training that they will need, in view of their quite different approach to the new technologies.
I believe that we need to take this into consideration.
We must also train our teachers.
We have discussed this issue a great deal in recent weeks.
Teachers are the key to the success of e-Learning.
Yet most of them are not equipped to use computers, and to ensure that those computers, and this software, this content, constitute an aid to learning.
It is essential to convince them that they can teach differently by using new technologies.
On this subject I should like to quote a phrase used by Mr Rocard, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, when he reiterated the argument that a radical reorganisation of education is called for in terms of physical space, time and substance.
We are faced with a new world, and there are not many of us who realise what that means.
I would like to say here and now that this new world will happen not only as a result of participation by the public services but also as a result of the world of industry becoming more responsible.
This is why, last week, I organised the first e-Learning summit in Brussels, in partnership with both the public and the private sectors.
That summit was wonderful, because it provided a platform for some amazing exchanges, and at the same time it demonstrated how the private sector is becoming more responsible, the businesses, and the know-how that exists in this area.
The ideal situation, of course, would be one in which there was symbiosis between the two.
Though policy decisions have to be taken by those who are responsible for policy-making, the implementation of those decisions could well be the result of interaction between the knowledge of the private sector and the educational knowledge of the public sector.
These two types of knowledge, working together, could be highly effective.
The idea has been suggested, and I hope that it will be followed by specific projects in this field.
This brings me to another subject.
Yes, Europe is showing the way, but these theories are not put into practice in some ivory tower in Brussels.
They are put into practice in our regions, our towns and our villages.
The method used should be the 'bottom-up' method. In other words, though policy decisions have to be taken somewhere, they have to be implemented, not from the top downwards, but rather at grass-roots level.
Any contribution towards getting specific local projects off the ground will be welcome.
So you see, ladies and gentlemen, we are standing on the threshold of a great adventure.
Things are moving on all sides, though admittedly not always in the right direction, but then we are learning lessons as well.
People sometimes ask me for something more specific, but there is already much that is specific at ground level, and this has been the case not only during the past year or so.
Specific projects implemented under our Socrates and Leonardo programmes have generated many of the features that we are now finding in our education systems.
Basically, these were programmes which you wanted, for which you, together with the Commission, sought and obtained serious funding, and which, despite all the administrative problems which you regularly bring to my attention, are positive elements.
So, dear colleagues, we have had the right idea for many years now.
We are travelling together in the right direction. We are taking giant steps forward, much more rapidly than anyone could have imagined two or three years ago.
There are a few small problems here and there.
Let us tackle them together, but tackle them in a spirit of optimism, because things really are improving.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The Presidency is pleased to note, Commissioner, that you repeatedly address MEPs as "dear colleagues" , which demonstrates the nostalgia you feel for your recent times as a Member of Parliament.
Although I was not here during the last legislature, I would like to point out that this nostalgia is reciprocated and that the MEPs also miss your magnificent contributions when you sat in this House.
Ladies and gentlemen, the joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at noon.
I am also pleased to inform you that, to conclude this debate, the Presidency has received a motion for a resolution B5-341/2001, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, on which the vote will be held on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 8.43 p.m.)
Madam President, you will be aware that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is currently meeting in our Brussels building.
You may not be aware that there are two representatives of the Burmese military junta taking part in that conference.
As you know, the European Union has a common position, supported by this House, not to grant visas to members of the Burmese military junta.
Yet here they are in our own building.
I understand that the Council has waived the ban for this conference, as it felt that this was necessary in view of its obligations to the United Nations.
If so, may I call on you, Madam President, to ask the Council or Mr Solana to issue a statement making it absolutely clear that this was an exception and that the visa ban and the common position are still in place.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
I will indeed discuss this matter with Mr Solana.
I also assume, of course, that Mrs Lindh has listened to you very carefully and that she has taken note of what you said.
I do not know whether she wishes to reply.
Not at this moment, it would seem.
But we heard what you said Mr Corbett, and I, for my part, will take the appropriate steps.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I wish to draw attention to some other rather unwelcome visitors on our premises.
Yesterday there was a disgraceful Communist demonstration in the courtyard of the Tower.
This is very intimidatory, as far as Members are concerned; it is an intrusion on our parliamentary premises.
Could you look into the circumstances of this: where are the limits of this Parliament and what rights do we have to exclude such people from our premises?
I will give the floor to Mrs Banotti at once because I think she wishes to reply to your question, for which I thank her.
Madam President, you will be aware that I raised the issue at the Bureau last week about a grossly intimidatory and intrusive demonstration in front of the Parliament in Brussels, so I was equally surprised yesterday to see exactly the same thing happening again.
Apparently, the courtyard of the Parliament is a public space.
It is under the control of the gendarmerie here in Strasbourg and apparently there has been some breakdown in communications.
They had not informed Parliament that this demonstration was going to take place yesterday.
I agree with Mr Van Orden.
Everybody is entitled to their democratic point of view, but certainly it was intimidatory to both Members and guests, hundreds of whom were trying to get into to Parliament at the same time.
So I very much hope that the administration in Strasbourg will ensure that we do not have to go through that again.
I make no comment on the issue that was being raised, but this is the second time that access to Parliament has been impeded by the same demonstrators.
Madam President, on Monday evening, after your statement about the Berlusconi business in Spain, I asked whether you could possibly let us have all the documents you had received from the Spanish political and judicial authorities.
You replied that yes, of course, you would see to it immediately.
It is now Wednesday morning and I have still not received these documents.
That is quite unacceptable, Mr Caudron.
I shall check what has happened at once.
I asked the departments concerned twice and they assured me that these documents had been transmitted to all the Members of this Parliament.
Believe me, I will look into this matter.
Madam President, I had the same observation as Mr Corbett.
We also received notification that a high-ranking Burmese delegation is in Brussels.
It is the official policy of the European Union not to admit any government representatives from Burma because of the shameful regime in that country.
No less a person than Aung San Suu Kyi, who received the Sakharov Prize here, is still in detention.
I consider it an absolute disgrace that these people are able to come here and speak in our very own parliament.
I should like to join wholeheartedly with Mr Corbett in asking for immediate action to be taken.
Madam President, some more points on the Berlusconi affair.
First a positive point.
I must tell you, and Mr Caudron, that the documentation you promised us was definitely sent by the secretarial services.
We received it yesterday - admittedly after 9 p.m. by e-mail in all languages.
This leads me to believe that a number of honourable Members have not yet checked their e-mail today.
But now a second matter, Madam President.
I have in front of me a telegram you sent to Mr Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia.
You congratulate Mr Berlusconi, admittedly on a personal basis. But I must say that I am amazed at the very warm way in which you express the wish that he will give Italy a new impetus with his election manifesto.
I must remind you, Madam President, and stress that Mr Berlusconi's election victory does not place him above suspicion in regard to the allegations of corruption and abuse of power.
I should like to state clearly here that the origin of his fortune is surrounded by a lack of clarity.
Moreover, his monopolistic hold on the media constitutes a danger for Italian democracy, Madam President.
As you know, Berlusconi controls a large part of the Italian press.
I find this unacceptable.
In fact, I would hope that the Commission will quickly institute an investigation into this violation of European competition law.
Madam President, I had hoped that despite the warm words you have sent to Mr Berlusconi, you would lead the way in this campaign to make it clear that what is currently happening in Italy is really not really kosher.
Mr Staes, thank you for informing me that you received the documents last night. I can only ask Mr Caudron to check his mail.
As for the telegram I sent Mr Berlusconi, I am sure you took note of the fact that I had made it quite clear that I was congratulating him on a personal basis.
Obviously I was not speaking on behalf of the European Parliament in this congratulatory telegram, but simply expressing myself on a personal basis.
Madam President, there is a limit to the patience even of calm, restrained people like myself.
We have witnessed a number of personal attacks on the leader of a political grouping, attacks based on information given in newspaper articles, none of which has been proved to be true.
We are an institution: well then, an institution demands that respect be shown for all its members, and I would argue that this has not been the case over the last two months.
The Italian people have made a clear, indisputable choice: we are in the presence of a Head of State.
Therefore, the Members are all free to have their own - quite legitimate - views, but in meetings of our institution would they kindly keep them to themselves!
Madam President, a few hours ago, a Basque journalist, Mr Landaburu, was the victim of an attack. Mr Landaburu is well known for his professional work, his commitment to democracy and his opposition to Francoism.
Fortunately, he escaped with his life.
Nonetheless, this is a disturbing incident, coming as it does just a few days after elections in the Basque country. Without going into the results, the 80% turnout alone is worth mentioning.
It represents a very positive development.
Parliament is debating a resolution on freedom of expression this very week. My group will table an amendment on the harassment to which the free and independent media are subjected in the Basque Country.
I am confident it will receive the support of the whole House.
Madam President, I hope you will agree to send a message of solidarity to Mr Landaburu on Parliament' s behalf.
Mr Galeote Quecedo, certainly I raised the matter of this new attack, here in the Chamber at 5 p.m. yesterday, deploring it in much the same terms as you did.
Naturally I immediately offered this journalist all our sympathy, on behalf of the European Parliament.
Madam President, on Monday I had the pleasure of reporting the release to the House of Mr Tsiakourmas, who was kidnapped by Turkish-Cypriot kidnappers and released following a resolution by Parliament calling for his release.
I said that I hoped that this might be the beginning of a change in Turkey's behaviour, with the representatives of the Turkish-Cypriot community abandoning violence and provocation so that we can move towards reconciliation.
Unfortunately, events have quickly proven me wrong because another kidnapping has taken place - it appears that a kidnapping is always needed so that when one person is released there is another to take his place. This time it was a 75-year-old man, who was cycling along the green line and who was taken for being drunk in charge of a bicycle.
It is the first time I have heard that drink driving is not just a crime but the sort of a crime which can only be punished by violating borders.
I ask you and I ask my fellow members to take note of this incident and to repeat the position expressed by Parliament to the Turkish authorities last time, because if this carries on, there will be no progress or peaceful settlement.
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour and the pleasure of welcoming to the public gallery a delegation from the Knesset, headed by its Chairperson, Mrs Dayan.
May I say that it is always with great pleasure that the European Parliament receives delegations from the Knesset, given our close and long-standing relations.
Since the joint visit in September 2000 by the Speaker of your Assembly, Mr Avraham Burg, and Mr Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, a visit which had raised so many hopes, we all know that the outlook has, alas, darkened tragically.
The European Parliament is following the situation very carefully, as the debate we are about to hold will show.
Let me welcome you very warmly and simply express the keen hope that your visit will contribute to a resumption of the dialogue.
Situation in the Middle East
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in the Middle East.
I give the floor to Mrs Lindh, President-in-Office of the Council.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East is deteriorating.
Distrust between the parties is growing.
Violence is claiming more victims every day.
A normal life has not been possible for the Palestinians for a long time and conditions are getting worse all the time.
The EU distances itself from the increasing amount of violence in Gaza and on the West Bank: Israeli encroachment and tank fire in Palestinian-controlled areas, firing on various roads, the killing of certain selected people.
Innocent civilians have lost their lives, including many children.
The economic situation is also difficult.
The Palestinian Authority is in deep financial crisis since the Israeli transfer payments were halted and normal economic activities ceased in the area.
In practice, the Authority is living on financial grants from Arab donors and the EU.
Israel is also suffering from the economic downturn as a result of the crisis, although to a lesser extent than Palestinian society.
The daily lives of Israelis are becoming more and more difficult.
Violence in the form of mortar fire, car bombs and suicide bombings is increasingly affecting Israel.
Israeli civilians and children are being killed.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was elected on the promise of increasing security.
Instead confrontation has been exacerbated, military interventions have increased and a readiness has been demonstrated both to enter Palestinian-controlled areas and to attack Syrian targets in Lebanon.
Quite simply, the security situation has got worse.
There is no long-term military solution.
The conflict will neither be won or lost.
The only solution to the conflict lies in negotiation.
Therefore the peace process must continue.
The Presidency and the EU are in close contact with the parties and we are encouraging them to continue the peace negotiations on the basis of the result of previous negotiations, seeking to reach a permanent status agreement on the basis of international law, including UN Resolutions 242 and 338.
A crucial difficulty is the basic lack of trust between the parties.
Both parties harbour the misconception that it is the other side which is solely responsible for the violence and the halting of the peace process.
No one dares to show an example of reconciliation or flexibility as it is feared that this will be seen as weakness.
A diplomatic initiative is required to break the deadlock.
The European Council in Stockholm commissioned High Representative Javier Solana together with the Commission to also report to the Gothenburg Summit in June on how the EU can promote the peace effort.
Javier Solana reported the progress of this work at the Gymnich meeting in NykÃ¶ping on 5 May.
The EU welcomes and supports the Mitchell Commission' s report and proposals, as it does the Egyptian-Jordanian peace initiative, which is based on agreements in which Israel took part.
Both proposals encourage the parties to immediately enter into cease-fire agreements, to confirm their willingness to respect agreements entered into and seek to reopen negotiations.
Measures to build trust are required if negotiations are to succeed.
One of the most critical issues for the peace process is the Israeli settlement policy.
Both the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative and the Mitchell Report demand a freeze on all settlements.
The Mitchell Report also suggests that the Israelis should consider withdrawing from controversial and vulnerable settlements.
The EU considers that these requirements are justified.
We consider that the settlement policy is in breach of international law and constitutes a serious obstacle to peace.
The EU has encouraged Israel to start to withdraw from its settlements.
We also support the Mitchell Report' s proposal that Israel should cease using live ammunition against demonstrators.
Measures to build trust also include Israel repaying the taxes due to the Palestinian Authority.
A negotiated solution, or a step on the way towards one, must include the goal of establishing a democratic, sustainable and peaceful Palestinian state.
The EU has defined its positions on the issue in the Berlin Declaration of March 1999 and in the New York Declaration of 12 September 2000.
It will remain the task of the EU in cooperation with other interested countries and players to help the Palestinians in developing such a democratic and peaceful Palestinian state.
Lasting peace in the region is impossible without peace agreements also between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon.
Considerable progress has been achieved in negotiations between Israel and Syria.
These now have to be concluded and a solution found based on the principles of international law as stated earlier.
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May last year was an important precondition for a future peace agreement.
Until such a peace agreement is concluded, it is important for all parties to avoid incidents and other action which may lead to continued violence.
The EU will actively contribute to the continued peace process in cooperation with other states affected and through High Representative Javier Solana, special envoy Miguel Moratinos and the Commission.
The Middle East is the original home of human civilisation. It is an area of rare cultural riches and religious importance which is now increasingly associated with the long conflict into which the region is sinking deeper and deeper.
One condition for positive development in the region is the cessation of the current conflict.
The Swedish Presidency wishes to do all it can to contribute to this together with other EU partners to the best of our ability.
Thank you, Mr Patten.
Madam President, as Mr Patten has just said, debates on the critical situation in the Middle East are becoming a regular feature of Parliament' s sittings.
This is all the more distressing if we think back to the discussions we held a few short months ago. Then, as you have just reminded us, we were considering the content of various draft proposals which seemed to be bringing the prospect of permanent peace in the region closer.
Nowadays the agenda seems to be set by the most extremist elements on both sides. A permanent vicious circle of violence has been created.
I certainly do not wish to name names or apportion blame, but the fact is that rightly or wrongly, the feeling of insecurity in Israel is stronger than ever. At the same time the belief is gaining ground that the Palestinian National Authority does not wish to act in a serious and determined manner to bring an end to the conflict, or is simply not in a position to do so.
In the meantime, the rapid deterioration in living conditions in the Palestinian Territories is a cause for great concern. It creates fertile ground for the growth of the most radical sectors.
Faced with this turn of events, the Palestinian National Authority appears to be losing its grip on the situation. At the same time, the population' s support for the Intifada and indeed for terrorist action against Israel is growing.
This should be categorically condemned and decisive action taken against it. President Arafat neglected to do so as recently as yesterday evening in his televised address.
In general, the Arab countries are becoming ever more demoralised and positions are hardening.
Consequently, appeals have been made from the area to the international community and in particular to the European Union, requesting greater involvement in the peace process. However, we need to establish whether the parties to the conflict are genuinely interested in returning to the negotiating table or whether anyone still believes in a military solution to the problem.
We have been pleased to welcome a delegation from the Israeli Parliament to the House today. I should like to assure them that the institutions of the European Union are more committed than ever to offering even-handed support, if both parties wish it, in order to rebuild the necessary confidence to allow peace negotiations to resume.
I am sure members of that delegation have felt this for themselves.
Unquestionably, the European Union has already made a significant effort to offer economic support, in line with its global political vision for the region.
Our political involvement is increasing as we hone the Union' s foreign policy instruments. However, we still have a long way to go.
Nonetheless, neither the Community nor anyone else can replace the will of the parties concerned to negotiate.
We firmly believe that if the aim is to achieve genuine security and well being in the area, peaceful and negotiated settlements must be reconsidered. Confrontation has to cease, and all parties must work together again, striving for peaceful coexistence and cooperation.
It is my heartfelt desire that this should come about at the earliest opportunity.
Madam President, with a death toll of nearly 500 since the resumption of hostilities in the occupied territories, the material situation of the Palestinian people is worse than it was before the Oslo Accords.
Unemployment has reached 50%, the investments in peace are lost, the population is sealed off, i.e., living under surveillance in its towns and villages, and the hopes of an entire generation have vanished into thin air.
In face of this disastrous situation, the European Union must raise its voice and call for respect for the law; in other words, we must focus on essentials again, and I thank Mr Patten for having done that so clearly.
That means ending the illegal occupation, handing back the territories acquired by force, calling a halt to the settlement of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and respecting the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.
If the escalation of violence is to stop, if the problem is to be resolved once and for all and the just and lasting settlement everybody is longing for is to be achieved, surely the first step must be to respect the United Nations resolutions?
That is precisely what the Pope said in his speech in Damas and I hope that this time the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats will not disavow it.
(Applause)In any case, we welcome the fact that recital D and point 13 of the joint motion for a resolution recall that fundamental point.
Israel, like any other country, has the right to live in peace within secure and recognised frontiers.
But Israel, like any other country, must recognise its international frontiers.
That, however, is not the case.
During a recent interview, Mr Sharon spelled out his strategic thinking by stating that the war of independence was not over, and I quote "so long as we are not in possession of the entire territory of Israel".
The entire territory of Israel?
What territory?
Faced with fait accompli after fait accompli, the international community stands by and does nothing.
Last Saturday, Israeli shells once again fell on a Palestinian refugee camp.
On Sunday, the army killed five Palestinian policemen whom it regarded as suspects.
And so the list goes on.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now time to say, loudly and firmly, 'basta ya!'
Enough is enough, Mr Sharon.
(Applause from the left)
Madam President, we must not allow anyone criticising Israel to be immediately placed in the pro-Palestinian camp or vice versa.
If Europe wants to make a credible contribution to this debate, we must not choose one side or the other, but always the side of peace, democracy and human rights.
That means that whenever these values are in jeopardy we must raise our voice, irrespective of who is responsible at that moment.
Europe is often vociferous about the possible influence that it might have in the Middle East.
From our perspective these are empty words, if we look at the lack of new initiatives from Europe and particularly the lack of coherence between the Member States.
That is why we call expressly on the Commission, the presidency and on Mr Solana, whose absence today I find a little odd, to do their utmost to bring the Union into line.
With regard to the possible violation by Israel of the rules of origin in the Association Agreement, I should like to express my appreciation for the unambiguous words of Commissioner Patten, and ask him, and at the same time the Council, to give an immediate answer to four clear questions: for how many products have Member States asked for verification from the Israeli authorities, what answers have they received, what steps are they considering and within what timescale?
Let me make the position of my group on this matter quite clear.
If it turns out to be true that there are doubts about the certificates issued by Israel and the Member States and the Commission do not act immediately and firmly, Europe will be complicit in the policy of settlement that we all abhor.
In conclusion I am gratified that our text on the need throughout the whole region for education geared to tolerance and mutual respect, has found support in other groups.
Madam President, the European approach to the problems of the Middle East should be, and fortunately often is, a balanced one based on the analytical conclusion that there is no one guilty party responsible for the present escalation.
Having said that, it is crystal clear to my group that overwhelming responsibility for the present escalation lies with the Sharon government in Israel.
Two examples: my group considers the heightened strategy of the execution of Palestinians by Israeli security services a disgrace, unworthy of a democratic state and moreover a strategy with no hope of success, since it will only increase the fury and frustration among the Palestinians.
The rejection of the Mitchell Report is a lost opportunity for the Israeli government.
Bringing an end to further expansion of the settlements, not even to the settlements themselves, should have been a first gesture towards the Palestinians as a sign that the Israelis also want a compromise, but sadly the Israeli government was unwilling to make that gesture.
All this is a good reason for stepping up the pressure from the European Union on the Israeli government.
Consequently I should like very specifically to ask the Commission and the Council, with all appreciation for the words spoken on the products from the settlements: what exactly is the Commission going to say to the Israeli delegation on 21 May about trade with Israel itself?
Will it be business as usual for products from Israel itself?
Not in the view of my group.
The issue of products from the settlements must be addressed, but we also feel that normal trade should be scrutinised carefully and that the Commission should take initiatives in that direction on 21 May.
Having said that, I do not wish to suggest that Palestinians are acting correctly.
The Palestinians are waging a war that they cannot win.
I also believe that the Commission must take responsibility and spell out to the Palestinian Authority that it - however difficult that may be - must try to prevent attacks on civilians and must opt for a different course, because the Palestinian Authority has its own responsibility.
Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Lindh, for their speeches.
Suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights in Palestine if Israel and the wider international community do not take action to restore international and human rights.
Yesterday was another day of tragedy: more than 200 people, including a French journalist, were wounded at the check points, although the Palestinians had not opened fire; the evening claimed another victim, an Israeli settlement; over 500 Palestinians were killed, 23 000 wounded and hundreds maimed for life; bombings, the houses of the poor demolished by bombs, thousands of trees - the livelihood of the peasant farmers - uprooted, roads blocked, despairing men and women, prisoners in their own villages, going hungry and Palestinian leaders considered to be military targets executed.
Pacifists from the Israeli movement, Peace Now, and I myself wept at the murder of Dr Tabet Tabet, an old friend; schools closed, land confiscated to make room for fresh settlements and further suffering: 80 Israelis, including children and adolescents, killed.
We must stop the cycle of violence, for every death, whether Palestinian or Israeli, reduces our humanity.
I understand the despair, the rage, the humiliation, the collective punishments, the retaliation, the need of the Palestinians forced to live under military occupation for 30 years for freedom; I understand the historical fear of the Israeli people, the persecutions they have suffered, the unique experience of the Shoah, for which we Europeans are responsible; I understand the fear that a bomb might explode under a bus or a shell hit a school, but these fears do not give anyone the right to occupy another people's territory or to violate international human rights.
It is our responsibility not to allow any expression of anti-Semitism in Europe, guaranteeing to the Israelis that the safety of Israel is very important to us, just as the safety of the Palestinian people is very important to us.
We have been saying for too long that we must stop the cycle of violence.
What, then, is our policy?
To urge the Israeli government to resume talks without delay and to put an end to the closing-off of the territories and the bombings.
International protection for the Palestinians must be guaranteed - this request has been made by over 400 Israeli citizens as well as by the Palestinians - but, above all, the expansion of settlements and roads must stop. The Mitchell Commission also says this.
Yesterday, in an article in the newspaper, Ha'aretz, Daniel Bensimon condemned Mr Sharon's false motives in respect of the natural population expansion of the settlements.
He cites sources of American intelligence which state that 20 000 houses have been emptied and that many settlers, even those who are most fanatical, are leaving.
He writes that, if the government genuinely had the interests of the country at heart, it would put a freeze on new settlements.
This would be a positive message to the Palestinians, the Arabs and the international community.
Stopping the escalation of violence: the Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to prevent extremism from prevailing.
There are no military solutions.
The European Union - as Parliament has stressed - must play a political role: international law must be applied in real life and not just proclaimed in declarations.
In this sense, respect for the agreements signed by Israel must be ensured, including the agreement concluded with the European Union which lays down a ban on the exporting of goods produced in the settlements to Europe.
Commissioner Patten has made this very clear, as has Mrs van der Laan.
The resolution upon which Parliament is about to vote calls upon the Council and the Commission to consider whether collective punishments and the disproportionate use of force are not in conflict with the principles of the Association Agreement and to take the necessary action: our aim is not to punish, just to obtain respect for the rule of law.
There is no time to lose in the struggle for peace: it is necessary for Palestinians and Israelis, for the region, but also for us.
Madam President, I am deeply appalled by the latest, dangerous escalation of violence in the Middle East which must be ended.
The question that really has to be answered is: who is going to broker an end to the violence in the Middle East?
I certainly welcome the active role the High Representative of the EU for the common foreign and security policy is playing in the Middle East.
I believe that the European Union can play a constructive role firstly in ending the violence in the Middle East and then putting in place structures whereby peace talks can recommence between the various factions.
I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter.
It is not only a question of seeking to prevent violence by different factions in the Middle East, it is primarily a question of guaranteeing that conditions can be improved in the hope that the violence ends and that negotiations can be reopened.
A peaceful solution in the Middle East can be achieved.
It was only last summer that the Israeli government and the Palestinian people were negotiating on what were bottom-line issues.
While I am disappointed that the peace talks in America last year did not culminate in a final peace settlement, they were not a complete failure either.
Issues, including the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian State, the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees, were all being discussed between the two sides last year.
If violence can be ended in the Middle East and the conditions for the reopening of negotiations can be secured, we can once again come to a situation whereby bottom-line issues can be discussed.
The European Union has affirmed on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people, both collectively and individually, is always protected.
In the overall context, securing peace in the Middle East is going to take time.
The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the peace treaty at Camp David in 1979.
It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way at the Madrid Conference in October 1999, which enshrined the principle of exchanging land for peace.
The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999.
I would appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to end the violence in the Middle East and to put in place a negotiated settlement, based on the principles of existing agreements.
Madam President, when I was in Washington on an EP mission last week, I was greatly shocked by the exceptionally cruel and vile murder of two Israeli schoolboys.
How can this spiral of violence in the Middle East be averted?
What exact contribution can the Member States of the European Union make?
With the noble intention of addressing these questions the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Van Aartsen, travelled to the region at the beginning of this month.
The written account of his in-depth findings leads me to put a number of follow-up questions to the members of the Council and Commission present here.
For example, during his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Mr Sharon, the Dutch minister encountered clear criticism of the Middle East policy of the EU.
Mr Sharon characterised it as 'unbalanced' .
This judgement, though, did not apply to the Netherlands, the premier added.
I should like to hear the rebuttal by the Council and Commission of Mr Sharon' s statements on the matter, since they imply divergent approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by Member States.
In addition Mr Van Aartsen points to the dangerous radicalisation of the Palestinian camp.
Do the Council and Commission share this analysis and what opportunities do they see for combating this tendency from the European side?
Thirdly, the Dutch minister argues for "a more effective international effort to promote a healthy institutional and democratic development of the Palestinian administration" .
For at this moment, says Mr Van Aartsen, the administrative weakness of the Palestinian Authority threatens to undermine its authority on two sides, with its own population and no less with the state of Israel.
And in that case what political prospects will there be for peaceful relations between Israel and Palestine?
Are the Council and Commission, as donors of the Palestinian Authority, as aware of this lacuna and how do they propose to fill it in concrete terms?
At any rate they can count on the support of the Israeli vice-premier Nathan Sharansky.
In last Monday' s Wall Street Journal he argues for a direct link between concessions to the Palestinians and making Palestinian society more open and transparent.
Mr Sharansky hopes that such a society will give the Palestinians the rights they deserve, without threatening Israel.
Surely that Jewish dream demands a European effort too?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few months ago, in this Chamber, in the presence of Israeli and Palestinian representatives, we discussed the possibility of Middle East peace process, at last, approaching its goal.
However, the TV news bulletins showing the Middle East are still full of bloodshed and despair this morning.
And yet the UN and Parliament resolutions have been reiterated for decades now to no avail, as have the calls for action from the whole world.
In this morning's debate in this Chamber, we are repeating all the same things all over again.
I no longer have faith in resolutions which are treated like waste paper, often lying in some dusty corner of the archives of the Parliamentary committees.
Ladies and gentlemen, what we must do here is not dismiss the Palestinians, who are defending the right of a people to a homeland, as extremists.
What we must actually do here is ask ourselves why, despite the resolutions, the autonomous activities of a community are still subject to Israeli approval, why a recently-built airport cannot operate, why the extermination of a community of 4 million people which, since the beginning of the Yom Kippur war, has been reduced by almost 10% by a subtle, insidious, treacherous, poisonous, cynical, cruel war which shows no mercy to women or children, is not considered to be genocide.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder how a people which has known such pain can inflict it on others so relentlessly.
I regret to say that it is since a certain right-wing party, the party of Mr Sharon, took control of Israel that, as a result of that appalling right-wing policy, the world has lost control of the overall situation.
Let us therefore set about introducing an initiative which will go beyond the paper-pushing games that have been played by the world's parliaments for too long now and lead us to resolute, tangible, decisive action to save the innocent lives of women, children and the elderly with peace.
It is no coincidence that Jesus Christ was born in Palestine.
Madam President, unfortunately the names of European politicians have not been recorded in the annals of peace brokering in the Middle East over recent years.
The Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky was one of the first to urge Israeli politicians to start direct talks with Arafat.
What was then a Utopian ideal is now political reality.
But where are today' s European Kreiskys?
Where are the visions, the ideas, the creativity and the courage to go beyond standard, purely bureaucratic duties?
Europe has endeavoured over recent years, besides financial and political activities in the Middle East, to leave political brokering to the USA and to focus on purely economic issues in this region.
Perhaps this was a reaction to Europe' s chaotic, uncoordinated political stance in relation to the warring factions.
One of the biggest obstacles preventing EU representatives from assuming an active role in the peace process is what are, at times, incomprehensible and intolerable unilateral accusations and intrepid judgements.
For example, why on earth did the Swedish foreign minister issue such an aggressive, unilateral judgment of Israel' s show of power after visiting Israel and the settlements during the Swedish Presidency, thereby scuppering any chance of brokering by the EU during the Swedish Presidency.
No one can seriously ignore Israel' s desire for peace.
No Israeli politician has ever ventured as far as the last prime minister, Ehud Barak, did in his proposals.
The present catastrophic situation is the result.
Blaming new Sharon government for it, as has been done here, merely hampers the efforts of the EU representatives to broker an agreement.
Europe should understand, once and for all, that none of us looks on the Middle East merely in terms of friends or foes.
If Europe is to have any chance of being taken seriously as a broker, we need a consistent language in our foreign policy, a neutral attitude towards the warring factions and to work out and broker feasible peace proposals.
Simply stating ones support for the claims of one side or the other is several principles short of a peace policy.
Issues such as the Palestinians' right to return, the division of Jerusalem and the Holy Mount, the problem of the settlement policy and Palestinian statehood and the Israeli people' s justifiable demand for security must be discussed directly by the parties to the conflict.
Our opinions must take second place if we want to be taken seriously as peace brokers.
To do all this, we need high-profile, persuasive people to represent Europe, who will be taken seriously by all parties in the Middle East.
I arrived back in Strasbourg last night directly from visiting Israel.
My statements are perhaps coloured somewhat by my private connections.
But you can rest assured that this nation wants peace on both sides.
It is part of our job to engage in talks with both sides.
It does not always have to be the politicians currently in office.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six motions for resolution.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Madam President, as the Council and the Commission have recognised, we are witnessing an escalation of blind violence and indiscriminate hatred in the Middle East. It has reached its climax in the stoning of human beings and in the killing and murdering of children and innocent victims.
The international community' s appeals for dialogue and peace have been ignored or sidelined.
It is therefore urgent to press ahead with the initiatives currently under way. I have in mind the joint Jordano-Egyptian plan and the Mitchell Committee' s conclusions calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the resumption of dialogue aimed at a peaceful solution to this conflict.
If there is no response to these appeals, the international community must not remain unmoved by this display of violence, deep-rooted hatred and the 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' culture. Nor can we remain blind deaf and dumb to it.
In my view, Madam President, if the two initiatives now on the table fail to bear fruit, we shall have to come up with a formula to allow us to break the current deadlock.
The President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers - I refer to the Defence Ministers, who met informally on Monday prior to meeting with the Foreign Ministers - has stated that by the end of the year the European Union will be in a position to become involved in crisis management situations on a case by case basis. It should be borne in mind, however, that a large proportion of our resources is currently committed in the Balkans.
I believe we cannot afford to wait until the end of the year. If the initiatives now under way fail to bear fruit, we should consider other alternatives, such as a United Nations' buffer force.
Alternatively, as Mr Patten rightly suggested, we could use the instruments available to the European Union, namely the association agreements.
We should not overlook other possibilities such as the International Court in The Hague, or the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It would be best not to have to resort to them, however, because the parties do really wish to return to the negotiating table and seek a peace which must be based on justice.
Madam President, a great deal has already been said, and so I will attempt to make good use of the three minutes assigned to me and concentrate a little more on what needs to be done rather than going over the details of the situation. In any case, the President-in-Office, Mrs Lindh, and many other Members have stressed the severity and scale of the situation in the occupied territories and throughout the Middle East in their speeches.
There has been quite enough description.
I feel that Parliament's role is coming into its own in this case as well.
There have been many debates but few resolutions, and Parliament is realising that resolutions and declarations have to have value and meaning.
As you pointed out, in this case we have a resolution which, I hope, will be adopted by a very wide majority, in which practically all the political groups undertake initiatives in respect of the Commission and the Council.
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for the clarity and determination with which he has re-established international law and responsibilities in economic relations with Israel as well.
If we do not get back to international law, it will be very difficult to get away from the maze of violence and retaliation which have erupted in that situation.
However, I would like to stress to the Council that it may not be sufficient for Mr Solana to bring the matter up in Gothenburg.
The Treaty of Amsterdam has provided us with tools which have not yet been used in this field.
It is rather strange that the European Union should not have equipped itself with a common strategy on the Middle East, and it is rather strange that the 15 should have gone to the United Nations Security Council and the meetings of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva with different positions.
This makes no sense. It is appalling.
In my opinion, it is the duty of the European Union to strengthen the role of the High Representative and of Mr Moratinos through a common strategy laying down the direction to be followed.
We call for this to be done in Gothenburg.
What Mr Salafranca said makes sense.
The Mitchell Commission has made recommendations. The first step could be to send observers, but this could be lead to the sending of a peacekeeping force.
If the violence does not cease, we will have to do something to assist the process from outside.
I feel that this debate has been useful and, above all, I call upon the Council to take the resolution into due consideration.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the latest wave of violence and terror in the Middle East must be roundly condemned.
It is high time that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escaped from the impasse in which it is currently stuck.
I believe that both parties will have to make great efforts to achieve this.
To begin with both sides must immediately refrain from any unilateral act that may cause the conflict to escalate further.
In addition, we must insist on mutual respect and good will.
In this connection, I should like to point to the, in my view, very important statement made by the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Shimon Peres, on Sunday 13 May that there will be no more new settlements.
As far as the European Union is concerned, it is our duty to strengthen our position in the peace talks, in view of all our humanitarian and geostrategic interests in this region as well as our important trading relations.
The Commission and the Member States must also be encouraged to support projects that can help in the building of understanding and partnership.
Of course, many unsolved problems and unanswered questions will remain.
Everyone knows that the peace process will be long and arduous, but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance we can achieve our common goal, of a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.
Madam President, the most surprising thing about our debate is our surprise, for Israel's expansionist policy is the inevitable and predictable result of the growing imbalance in the region, the stability for which we bear much of the responsibility.
Firstly that is because since 1967 most of our states, with the notable exception of France, have continued to give the State of Israel - a state that is growing increasingly self-assured and domineering - the impression that it can violate international law and UN resolutions with impunity.
In reality, here as elsewhere we have followed Washington and persist in closing our eyes to the theocratic excesses of this religious state whose governments are under the thumb of fanatical parties and minorities that are just as bad as the other groups of religious fanatics in the region.
That is why we should envisage imposing sanctions on Israel.
There is, however, another serious imbalance for which we are in part responsible, namely the imbalance of forces.
I have no hesitation in saying that we must consider giving the Arab side a large enough force, including a large enough nuclear force, to persuade Israel that it cannot simply do whatever it wants.
That is the policy my country pursued in the 1970s when it gave Iraq a nuclear force.
We have now destroyed it.
So we will carry on with our policy of imbalance and what is happening today is merely the annoying but inevitable result of our collective blindness and cowardice.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked or would like to see many Members, as also the Commission and the Council, show the same determination in relation to Chechnya, where 100 000 people have been killed in less than two years, or to occupied Tibet, where there have been 1.2 million deaths in forty years.
Unfortunately, some people, both in the Council and the Commission and in our Parliament, seem to have short memories when it comes to these issues.
In reaction to this morning's debate let me begin by observing that Mrs Lindh is taking rather a selective approach when she speaks of Israel's retreat from Lebanon, while forgetting that Lebanon is still occupied by Syria.
I am surprised at such forgetfulness.
The policy proposed by Mrs Lindh, MEPs and the Commission is a formulaic policy.
It forgets that Mr Barak made proposals that no Israeli before him had ever made and that the Palestinians rejected his proposals.
I doubt whether putting the Israelis' backs against the wall will persuade them to subscribe to a peace plan that even Mr Arafat does not seem prepared to accept.
We should take a more objective view.
We should also remember our own history of the past hundred years, perhaps show a little more generosity towards Israel and perhaps also begin to seriously consider the possibility of Israel joining the European Union. That would respond to the Israeli people's deep-seated anxieties, while certainly not denying the frustrations and extremely harsh living conditions of the Palestinians, and would also respond to the fundamental issue of the profound anxiety of the Palestinian people.
I think Europe should give proof of its generosity by offering Israel membership of the European Union.
That is a prospect that would allow the European Union to make greater concessions, even in territorial terms, and allow Palestine to develop and Israel to live in security in this part of the world.
This proposal has already been signed by thirty Members of the European Parliament and a number of members of the Knesset.
I invite Members to sign it as soon as possible so that we can hold a major debate on this proposal.
Madam President, the European Union is expected to do something in the Middle East.
It is already present there, far more so than in the past, thanks to the commitment of its High Representative.
Now it must play an even more active part.
The time has passed when it could confine itself to watching the drama unfold from its Mediterranean balcony seat.
It must play an active part because as history has demonstrated, in politics and in war, merely to play a passive role is ignominious.
If we are to have any prospect of being useful, we must act with absolute impartiality. That is the first difficulty in this exercise, since each of the camps expects first of all that we side with it against its enemy, following the old adage that my enemy's enemy is my friend, but my enemy's friend is my enemy.
If we are to help break this vicious circle of bloodshed and revenge, here as elsewhere we do not have the right to be anyone's enemy.
So what can we do?
I sincerely believe that nobody will make peace in the Middle East unless the two parties are resolved to do so and unless the various proposals put forward in this Chamber just now, by Members as also by the Council and by the Commission, are taken into consideration.
If, as we must continue to hope, the wish for peace exists, and only if it exists, then we must also support the idea of deploying an international observers' force, in which Europe could and should take part.
Like my friend Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez Neyra and like Mrs Napoletano, I want to stress that point to our counterparts from the Knesset who are here today, because I know that at present Israel is profoundly opposed to the idea. The way to cool down a conflict as acute and heated as the one that continues to bathe the Holy Land in blood is to have impartial observers on the ground.
Through their actions and their testimony they could prevent a new general conflagration from being sparked off by the growing number of incidents that are bound to occur when a real armistice is signed. Like my fellow Members, I continue to hope that we will finally see such an armistice one day.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, friend of Israel, today I am preparing to vote for a resolution that in fact takes Israel severely to task.
Indeed, while I regret the fact that the Europeans all too often underestimate the tragedy of the repeated terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in the Israeli villages, while I reproach Yasser Arafat with not having had the courage to take the hand Mr Ehud Barak courageously extended to him within a few days of the elections - it would have been enough to say 'yes, but ...' or 'yes, if ...' . but he chose to say 'no' - nonetheless Israel is a democratic, powerful, well-armed and well-equipped state. That is why it is up to Israel not only to stop the pressure mounting, but also to take peace initiatives that are acceptable to the Palestinian people.
Let me add that although I understand the Israeli people' s concern for their security, I cannot accept statements or acts by Mr Ariel Sharon that I personally would condemn on the part of anyone else.
Precisely in the name of my friendship towards Israel, let me say to the Israelis that they will not achieve the security they deserve by the use of force and that the settlements are a serious mistake.
Let me also say that the Palestinians have the right to a state.
Lastly, let me say that the Israelis and the Palestinians need us to make serious proposals for a solution. We know that a peaceful settlement will require sacrifices on both sides.
Europe can and must make its contribution and set out a balanced and active position to that end.
I have found such a position set out in the statements by the Council and the Commission.
I also hope that our resolution will be a contribution and I am sure the Mitchell Commission' s report could form the basis for new negotiations.
Madam President, Israel and Palestine are two independent nations but they are not yet two independent states.
They are two peoples who must coexist as neighbours or offer their grandchildren the prospect of eternal feuding.
Sadly, there is provocation by people who should be showing leadership.
Provocation leads to violence, which is met by violence, which leads to revenge and a slippery slope away from a just and peaceful modus vivendi.
Much of the solution is in Israel's hands, but Palestine and the neighbouring states must respond.
Of course I understand Israel's nervousness about taking the first steps.
Lebanon, for example, has been in an impossible situation for years: it has been shelled by Israel and infiltrated by Syria, and both must help it now to provide stability in its own lands.
Israeli withdrawal was met responsibly by the Lebanese.
However, Israel still holds pockets of Lebanese territory in the south and has not yet provided maps of where the landmines are so that they can be cleared and, as a result, nine shepherds have been killed since the withdrawal.
Prisoners on both sides still have to be returned and the Shebaa farms on the Golan border belonging to Lebanon are still held, controlled and occupied by Israel.
The key area of provocation has been covered by the minister and by the Commissioner, including the issue of the sale in the EU of goods labelled as Israeli but coming from the settlements.
There are 145 settlements in the West Bank, 16 in Gaza, 9 in East Jerusalem; 400,000 people live in them.
Only 42% of West Bank territory is controlled by the Palestinians, 58% is either in military camps or settlements and too often the military camps lead to the settlements.
Peace will not come from resolutions adopted here - although we can help.
Peace will come if, and only when, Israel, Palestine and the neighbouring states realise they want peace so much that they are prepared to live it.
Madam President, I would like to thank you all for an excellent debate.
It has consistently been shown here that it is important that the European Union has influence and plays an active role.
If we are to have any influence, there must also be unanimity within the European Union on the way in which we wish to influence the current process.
It is good to see that the Council is considerably more unanimous today than we ever have been before.
I also think this unanimity can be seen in this context too.
Although different resolutions have been proposed and although there are many different opinions, there are still fewer differences between us than previously.
I also think this is one reason why we have never before been able to see the EU being as greatly involved in the Middle East conflict.
However, unfortunately this is not sufficient, and on the contrary, as Mr Poos said initially, it is also about the willingness of the parties to negotiate and not least about the Israeli government currently bearing the main responsibility.
I can agree with very much of what Mr Poos said regarding the description of the current situation: the catastrophic economic situation, and the illegal occupation.
The problem is that this leads to Mr Galeote Quecedo' s view that there is a risk of extremists setting the agenda.
The risk is that hate propaganda on both sides and Palestinian poverty will lead to violence increasing further.
Mr Lagendijk said that it is unacceptable for resistance fighters on the Palestinian side to be executed by Israelis.
I can only agree; I brought this up in my initial speech.
This is completely in breach of both international law and international standards and of what most of us consider to be basic human rights.
We have brought this up several times with the Israeli government.
We have also received guarantees that this is to cease, but unfortunately this has not hitherto been the case.
Regarding the meeting of 21 May, addressed by several of the speakers, the Council is providing every support to the Commission for the course of action which Commissioner Patten has described and which means that we must now follow the rules and clearly show that the EU cannot accept Israel continuing to break them.
Several speakers have addressed the allocation of the burden of guilt, where we lay the blame and how much of an intermediary the EU can be.
I would like to say to Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, and many others who have brought up this issue, that even if the EU clearly is to make requirements of both parties, today it is natural for us to make more stringent demands of the Israeli government and Ariel Sharon.
Ariel Sharon actually bears the main responsibility today for reversing the trend.
As many of you have pointed out, the current policy increases the risk of benefiting extremist groups.
Mr Sharon must acknowledge his political responsibility.
For its part, the Council will naturally also make demands of the Palestinian side: that the Palestinians are to have a more open budget, that they should work more on the basis of democratic, open principles, that they should do everything in their power to stop terrorism.
So what can the EU do further?
Just as Mr Napolitano said, it is important that we also act.
So I can guarantee that we will not passively sit waiting for the report from Javier Solana to the European Council meeting in Gothenburg.
We will address the Israeli government and demand that it stop the violence, cease to close off Palestinian areas and immediately halt its settlement policy which is illegal and constitutes illegal occupation.
As I said, we have also demanded that the Palestinian side do all it can to prevent terrorism and to reduce violence.
We support the proposals of the Mitchell Report and it was good to see support for the report here in Parliament too.
We also support the Jordanian-Egyptian initiative.
In particular, and the Commission has also played a part in developing this, we assume a major financial responsibility today for the Palestinian areas and for ensuring that the situation does not become even worse in these areas.
Precisely as General Morillon said, the EU is currently more active than ever before.
However, I believe that we all feel the need not only to take on more responsibility than we have done hitherto - the major financial responsibility which has been taken so far - but also the need to take even greater political responsibility which also actually corresponds to the financial responsibility we are taking on the region.
By commissioning Javier Solana to draw up a roadmap for the Gothenburg Summit, we anticipate that the EU will be able to provide a further substantial contribution to the peace process and achieve a better, more long-term strategy for the EU' s involvement in the Middle East.
Finally, it is still the parties themselves who must come to their senses, who must break the spiral of violence, who have to refrain from the ever increasing conflicts and return to the only possible road to peace; cease-fire, a freeze on settlements, a return to the negotiating table.
I would like to say both to the Israeli side and the Palestinian side that this is not a question which concerns only you.
It is of major international interest.
It is crucial to the future of us all and therefore we demand that the parties also take their responsibility.
As Mr Caudron said, in this situation it is not about being a friend to Israel or a friend to Palestine. Instead it is about all of us in the EU having to do all we can to contribute to the peace process.
I just want to try to answer three questions that were put during the debate by honourable Members and I hope I can do so in a way which is moderately satisfactory.
First of all, Mrs van der Laan asked about the rules of origin, and if there are points which I do not cover in what I am going to say, I will take them up in correspondence with the honourable Member.
What I would like to do is rehearse exactly what has happened so far.
The issue of rules of origin was raised in the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament to which I referred earlier.
The General Affairs Council at the end of June 1998 took note of our communication and asked the Commission to resolve these issues on a technical level.
A great deal has happened since then.
Technical contacts at different levels with Israel took place immediately after the communication.
On 16 December 1999 the Commission informed COREPER on the outcome of these meetings.
In early 2000 concrete information on specific imports from Israeli settlements was supplied to the Commission.
On the basis of this information, at the Customs Code Committee meeting on 6 April last year, the Commission reminded Member States of their obligation in this respect, namely to apply the provisions of Article 32 of the Protocol on Customs of the Association Agreement to consignments for which information had been received that they originated in the settlements.
After this meeting Member States returned around 2000 EUR1 certificates to Israel for verification.
In some cases, goods were only released for free circulation in the European Union subject to the payment of a guarantee against liability for customs duties.
Replies to the letters of verification are coming in as the ten month deadline for Israel's reply is expiring.
All along there has been a notice to importers which was first published in the Community Official Journal of 8 November 1997 warning exporters of doubts regarding EUR1 certificates from Israel.
The notice is still in force, although of course references to the orange juice case, which honourable Members will recall, no longer apply.
That is all the information that I have at hand on the history of rules of origin.
I am determined, as I said earlier, to conduct this issue by the Agreement and entirely according to the law.
Mr Lagendijk asked what we would be saying to the Israeli side next week at our meeting on 21 May and he said that what we sought, or should seek, in the Middle East was a balanced approach.
I do not think, and I do not think he thinks either, that means we should search for some point on the political agenda where neither side will disagree with us.
That is not what is meant by a balanced approach.
I happen to think that the Mitchell Commission report was an extremely balanced and sensible document.
The Mitchell Commission - and I hope we will do much the same - in my judgment supports those who are still committed to working for peace on both sides of the argument.
That is a sensible, balanced approach.
As for what we will say on 21 May, we can discuss human rights under the essential elements clause of our Agreement, we will certainly discuss for the first time this summer rules of origin - that is already on the agenda - but I want to be scrupulous in sticking to the letter and the spirit of our Agreement.
To go beyond that would risk putting us on a very slippery slope indeed.
So as far as I am concerned we stick to the letter of the Agreement and do not go beyond it with any other political gestures.
Mr Belder asked about the remarks of our colleague and friend the Dutch Foreign Minister about the Palestinian Authority in particular and the importance of ensuring that it operates in a more transparent and democratic way. I have to say that what our colleague Mr van Aartsen said during his visit to the Middle East was not just wholly in line with our views on the development of democracy in the Palestinian territories, but an extremely eloquent and effective exposition of our view, as one would expect from him.
Even in these less than perfect circumstances we need to press the Palestinian Authority to be more open, to be more transparent, to be more pluralistic, to protect people's civil liberties and human rights and to become increasingly democratic.
That is, I think, what the Minister was saying and he has our total support.
I thank Mr Patten for his replies to Members.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
State of the transatlantic dialogue
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on the state of the Transatlantic dialogue.
Mr President, relations between the EU and the US are of vital importance both for Europe and the US and for the rest of the world.
Transatlantic relations are good.
Today, we are working closely together within a number of areas, and our dialogue by and large comprises all the important issues.
We have a shared responsibility to meet global challenges and contribute to a more peaceful and more democratic world as well as to work for a dynamic multilateral trade system.
We also have differences of opinion in various areas but conduct a close dialogue on these.
Since our dialogue was formalised in 1990 with the adoption of the Transatlantic Declaration, it has been constantly deepened and broadened.
In 1995, we also adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda.
At its meeting on Monday, the General Affairs Council welcomed the Commission' s report on how we can further strengthen the transatlantic dialogue and charged the Presidency and the Commission to ensure, together with the US, that the dialogue becomes more efficient and action oriented.
The Council would like to see the dialogue, which comprises regular summits, focusing on a number of strategic themes and prioritising the issues which are important for promoting continuity.
The Council has particularly demanded that "the environment" and "climate" constitute one of these strategic themes.
At the Gothenburg Summit on 14 June, the EU and the US will jointly stake out a clear structure and focus for continued cooperation.
At the Summit, all the issues which have been prioritised during the Swedish Presidency will be raised in one way or another.
The EU and the US have coordinated the initiatives designed to help Russia implement disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, particularly regarding the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme and the destruction of chemical weapons.
We have also worked together within the framework of the EU' s Northern Dimension initiative.
In close consultation with the forthcoming Belgian and Spanish Presidencies, we have begun multiannual cooperation on justice and home affairs, focusing on combating drugs, combating child pornography on the Internet and supporting Russia' s fight against organised crime and its consolidation of a society based on the rule of law.
We have worked together on issues related to the new economy.
We have worked together on the fight against HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases in Africa.
In the field of trade policy, the Swedish Presidency has given high priority to seeking unanimity between the EU and the US on a platform which will make it possible to launch new WTO negotiations in the autumn.
In addition, we have emphasised the importance of concrete progress being made to solve the bilateral trade disputes which constitute a serious cause of irritation in our relationship.
The theoretical solution to the banana dispute that was recently achieved is one example of this.
However, as I said, there are also differences of opinion.
The new administration' s stated opposition to the Kyoto Protocol is a source of great disappointment to us.
It is highly worrying that the US, which is responsible for 25% of the world' s carbon dioxide emissions, is choosing to stand aside from an international agreement negotiated over a decade.
The new administration has justified its opposition to the Kyoto Protocol by the fact that it does not require the same undertakings of developing countries and is also damaging to the American economy.
We do not accept these reasons, and above all we do not accept the US thereby distancing itself from the agreement.
The EU' s reaction to the actions of the US has been swift and powerful.
Prime Minister Persson and Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, have criticised the decision in a letter.
At the informal meeting of the environment ministers in Sweden, the Swedish chairman, Mr Larsson, stated that no individual country has the right officially to declare a multilateral agreement dead, and he expressed his hopes that the US would return and take part in the ongoing Kyoto Process.
The EU Troika, headed by the Swedish Minister for the Environment Mr Larsson, travelled to Washington in April to continue nevertheless to attempt to maintain the dialogue with the US on the global problem of climate change.
In these talks, it emerged that the US does not question the problem of climate change.
The US admits the importance of finding global solutions to the problem.
The EU considers that the solution is to be found within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, while the US insists on the need to find alternative solutions.
The EU' s goal is to make the Protocol ratifiable within the next year with or without the US.
However, without the participation of the US, the Protocol will be considerably weaker.
We therefore welcome the US attending the environment meeting in Bonn in July and hope to see a constructive dialogue with a fruitful exchange of views.
I would like to emphasise that both the EU and the US bear a heavy responsibility for global problems and challenges such as the threat posed by climate change.
We will never get the countries of the Third World and developing countries to take action if no joint responsibility is taken by the EU and the US.
To conclude, a few words on the areas in which the EU and the US are taking, and have succeeded in taking, joint responsibility.
In this context, I would particularly like to highlight our joint efforts to promote peace and stability in the Balkans, as well as our consultations on the situation in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East peace process.
Links between the EU and the US are vitally important in today' s world.
It is only through cooperation and dialogue that we can meet global challenges and create the preconditions for a world of peace, democracy and economic development.
I therefore see with great satisfaction that the European Parliament is taking action to develop and strengthen the dialogue with the American Congress.
I would also like to point out that a meaningful dialogue must also address issues on which the EU and the US disagree.
Constructive dialogue is based on sincerity, and sincerity means not hesitating to voice criticism.
This means that, in the future too, the EU will direct criticism at, for example, the US' s use of the death penalty.
Mr President, I now look forward to hearing the opinions of the Members of the European Parliament.
Mr President, this is an important debate to hold at this juncture, after the first few months of the US administration, with the visit of President George Bush to GÃ¶teburg in June and the Commission's initial thoughts on the common foreign and security policy.
So where are we today?
We have a timely communication before us, which points to the breadth and growth of the transatlantic relationship from the declaration in 1990 to the new transatlantic agenda in 1995.
The number of subjects it covers will continue to grow and we will probably see a consolidation of ideas on the monetary dialogue and other aspects.
Secondly, the communication contains ideas on how to make the process more effective.
Thirdly, it underlines the importance of engaging civil society and building parliamentary links.
But I think it is wise for us to ask whether these perspectives are really sufficient for the next five years.
Common economic interests and concerns are increasingly global and not bilateral, while regionalisation is increasingly seen as an alternative to the WTO and multilateralism.
US security interests are shifting towards the Pacific, even if NATO and EU enlargements will demand transatlantic political management in the months ahead.
It is difficult to focus together on defining common strategic interests like, for example, the Ukraine.
In view of these aspects, my group considers this communication a disappointing one.
It is more a stocktaking exercise than one that will encourage a broader transatlantic partnership.
In other words, it does not match up to the requirements of the developing transatlantic partnership in the future.
Why, for example, have fewer summits if there are going to be more rather than fewer issues to discuss?
How do you prioritise the agenda if you have already set eight strategic themes?
How do you include the US Congress and the European Parliament in the framework without setting out any ideas for its inclusion?
The communication refers to an Interparliamentary Assembly.
That is not what it is.
