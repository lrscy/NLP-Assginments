However, there are rules that need to be changed; there are procedures that we need to adapt and we can only work with our eyes on that goal.
I certainly agree with all the honourable Members who have spoken that we need to get closer to the public and help them understand better what is going on in the European Union and in all its institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, in answer to Mrs AndrikienÃ©âs question, I can only say at this stage that the Councilâs position on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 is of course the position agreed at the European Council meeting of 15-16Â December 2005.
The European Council has stressed that the objective of economic and social cohesion must continue to be at the centre of the European Unionâs policy for the duration of the next Financial Perspective.
This is also reflected in the fact that the European Council has agreed to devote more than 35% of total budget resources for the period 2007-2013 to this area of policy.
Â Â  The truth is that time is running out, and both budgetary authorities of the European Union â the Council and Parliament â are aware that in order to achieve an agreement in time they have to enter into constructive negotiations without delay.
When will the Council be ready to enter into constructive negotiations with Parliament?
When will the Council have a mandate?
What are the priorities of the Presidency in the negotiations on the new financial perspective?
Â Â  . Let me assure the honourable Member that we are engaged in constructive negotiations.
It is in our interests; it is in the interests of the Council as much as it is in the interests of the European Parliament that these negotiations are brought to a fruitful conclusion.
In order to be credible, the European Union as a whole must act swiftly and constructively.
The Council is prepared to act as swiftly and as constructively as possible.
I can assure you that already, at the traditional meeting of the Commission with the members of the Austrian Government on 19Â January, it was agreed between the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr SchÃŒssel, that the Commission proposals should be submitted as soon as possible and that the Council would negotiate as swiftly as possible and in good faith.
According to the agreement between the three institutions, we are hoping for and working towards a conclusion of the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement in April.
I cannot be more precise.
However, that is a credible goal which we hope to achieve.
I can assure the honourable Member that we are working very hard to achieve that.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the question of course still remains.
Has the Austrian Presidency already received a specific mandate from the Council to enter into these negotiations?
If not, at what level and with what end in view can the talks at the level of the Permanent Representatives Committee II take place in the time until a mandate is given?
Â Â  Mr President, I can answer Mr Rackâs question by pointing out that according to the Presidencyâs work plan the trialogue meetings will be prepared by the Permanent Representatives Committee II.
All that is already under way.
I can assure you â because I know from my own experience â that they are working hard on it.
You will understand, however, that I cannot at this present time comment on the precise state of the necessary clarifications between Council and Commission, wherever the dossier is at this stage.
That would be to prejudice the negotiations.
I would like to repeat once again, and emphatically so, that we will of course do all that we can, in the Councilâs own interests and also in the European Parliamentâs interests, to see that these negotiations are begun, continued and brought to a good conclusion as quickly as possible.
We owe that to Europeâs citizens.
The European Unionâs credibility will also depend on how quickly and how well we come to an agreement on this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, Minister, we all know what great efforts the Austrian Presidency is making to bring the new Financial Perspective to a conclusion.
My question is therefore: Is the Council still convinced that the common agricultural policy and the policy for rural areas are making an essential contribution to achieving the Gothenburg and Lisbon objectives, and does the Council still consider ensuring the necessary resources are available, in the Financial Perspective in particular, to be a priority?
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Member, I have already mentioned, and I repeat, because this is the Councilâs position: we stand on the ground of the agreement that was reached in December.
That is the framework in which we are moving, and the priorities that follow from that will now have to be set in the negotiations.
Of course we are committed to the objectives you have mentioned and will continue to be so.
Â Â  As they deal with the same issue, the following questions will be taken together and the answer will be given by Mr Martin Bartenstein, representing the Council.
How does the Council view the EUâs chronic dependence on energy from Russia and the Gulf countries, and what, in its opinion, is the potential for reducing this dependence via the systematic promotion of renewable raw materials and alternative energy sources?
To what extent is the Council concerned about Europe's fuel security?
Â Â  Mr President, in answer to both these questions I can say that security of energy supplies, together with competitiveness and sustainability â they are, after all, the three relevant pillars â has for years been one of the main concerns of European energy policy.
This is also true of the new energy policy for Europe that is now being developed.
The gas dispute in particular, the price dispute of the last few weeks and months, has made clear that consideration must also be given to the concerns of our neighbours and international partners.
The European Union maintains close ties both with energy producers like Russia and OPEC and with important users like China and India.
In this connection, I would also like to remind you of international arrangements like the Energy Charter Treaty and the South East Europe Energy Community.
Diversification of energy sources, the promotion of domestic energy sources, renewables in particular, and energy efficiency are important aspects of the security of energy supply.
The great importance of investment in both infrastructure and exploration should also be stressed.
Transeuropean energy networks are also part of both these aspects.
A host of instruments have therefore been adopted in the European Union in different fields.
On security of supply, particular mention should be made of EC Council Directive 2004/67 of 26 April 2004 concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, on diversification of energy sources the directive from 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, which aims to see 22% of the Communityâs electricity generated from renewable sources by 2010, and the 2003 directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.
I should also mention the December 2005 proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, which is expected to be adopted in the next few months.
Neither should we forget the Sixth Research and Development Framework Programme and in particular the âIntelligent Energy for Europeâ Programme, which seeks, among other things, to promote new and renewable energy sources at local and regional level and in developing countries.
The Council is also showing the importance it attaches to renewable energy sources in the non-legislative domain.
In their contribution to the Spring European Council in March 2005, the energy ministers support giving priority to a strategy for renewable energy sources beyond the year 2010.
Energy policy and the security of energy supplies in particular will also appear on the agenda â no doubt prominently â for the Councilâs next meeting in the spring.
Two further areas on which the Presidency will be focusing are the Biomass Action Plan and the proposed Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
In its contribution to the international action plan of the June 2004 International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn, the Council noted that EU energy policy should aim to increase the use of renewable energy sources significantly and that increased use of renewable energy, improved energy efficiency and sustainable energy use will also contribute to security of supply as complementary areas of policy.
At its meeting on 29 November 2004, the Council adopted conclusions on renewable energies which highlighted the importance of making renewable energies more competitive by reducing production costs, among other things.
All these instruments and measures are a solid basis for the short, medium and long-term security of energy supplies in the European Union, which have also proved their worth in actions of solidarity in connection with the consequences of the disastrous weather events of last year.
Â Â  Mr President, as a Munich Member with a Styrian mother, I am pleased to observe the progressive policy Austria is pursuing in the area of biomass.
My question relates to that.
What are you doing to introduce this very progressive policy increasingly into the Council of the European Union, and how in particular do you rate the importance of biomass, not only for motor fuel but also in particular for heating?
Â Â  Mr President, as an Austrian and a Styrian, but the son of a German mother, honourable Member, I am pleased to hear this agreement in your supplementary question.
I am sure that renewable energy sources â biomass in particular, of course, but not only biomass â will have greater market opportunities in the months and years ahead, because the price of oil is not going to fall to 10 or 20 dollars a barrel again; that will be a good thing, because it will be an opportunity to increase Europeâs independence.
We should not deceive ourselves, however: it may make it possible to reduce the rate of increase in dependence on fossil fuels, but only the rate of increase, not the rate of dependence.
At the same time, that will mean additional sources of income for many rural areas and for many people, farmers in particular, not only from producing food, but also from producing energy plants.
In the long term, biomass and renewable resources could in fact be the source not only of carbon but also, indirectly, of hydrocarbons, which could then be used to run private cars.
I believe the way forward for power stations and the like may lie in a different direction in the long term, but that fossil fuels in particular, which are used almost exclusively in transport today, can gradually be replaced by renewables and hydrocarbons from that source.
I repeat, the chances for that are better, it is easier to make renewable resources, renewable energy sources, a marketable proposition if the market price of a barrel of crude oil is around 60 dollars or a kilowatt of electricity costs two and a half times as much today as even two years ago.
One megawatt-hour costs 50 euros today; I can still remember when it was 20 euros.
Â Â  The President-in-Office said that a host of instruments are available, but despite that, the EU-25 import dependency for energy, which was 48% in 2002, is projected to rise to 71% by 2030.
The EU-15 is dependent on Middle East countries for 31% of oil imports, on Russia for 30% of gas imports and 28% of oil imports, and on Algeria for 22% of gas imports.
Given the steps taken by Russia recently and the vulnerability of some Member States to Russian petulance, would the President-in-Office not agree that the essential element of maintaining security of supply lies in the complete liberalisation of the energy market in the European Union, and will he take steps to bring that about?
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Member, what Europe needs is a coherent energy policy, an energy policy that is geared more to our common interests.
We must learn the lessons, on the one hand those from the realm of climate protection, on the other those from the marked rise in the prices of fossil fuels â due not only but mainly to a shortage of refinery capacity, plus hurricanes, plus geopolitical difficulties â and also the lessons from 1 and 2 January this year when, for whatever reasons, the quantity of Russian natural gas flowing to Europe through Ukrainian pipelines was greatly reduced.
Those are three reasons why we should rethink our position.
Once again: we must expect Europeâs dependence on imports, especially of fossil fuels, to increase over the next few years, probably decades.
However, that should and must not stop us looking increasingly to renewable energy sources of our own and in the end also tightening the screw of energy efficiency.
That is where I agree with the Commission when it says it is already hard enough to get the Member States to commit to 1% a year; we shall see whether a 2% a year commitment is possible in future.
There are still things we can all do in energy efficiency and we can improve things there; the new Member States normally have greater potential in this area.
Their efficiency in terms of gross domestic product per unit of energy consumed is much lower than in the countries of the EU 15, where they began to break the link between energy consumption, gross domestic product and growth back in the 1970s as a result of the 1973 and 1974 oil shocks.
We need a coherent energy policy that does not overlook any of the possibilities already mentioned: renewable energy sources, increased energy efficiency, but at the same time also diversification in fossil fuels, that is in gas, and of course also diversification in pipelines.
The basic problem was not the shortage of gas, the basic problem on 1 and 2 January was that there is only one pipeline through Ukraine supplying a lot of European countries and that 80% of all the gas coming from Russia to Europe flows through that pipeline.
It is certainly sensible for contracts to be concluded between the companies in Germany and Russia.
It is certainly very important that the European Parliament and the European Commission should also support the Nabucco gas pipeline project that could bring some 12 billion cubic metres of gas a year to Central Europe from the Caspian Sea via Turkey from 2011 and around 30 billion cubic metres of gas a year from 2020.
In the matter of gas, however, we should not forget liquefied natural gas, either; apart from a few southern Member States, Europe has not set much store by it up until now.
We need that as well if we are to reduce our dependence.
I also very much welcome the announcements made by Russia and its finance minister at a recent G8 summit in Moscow that they are going to reconsider or abolish Gazpromâs export monopoly.
Unfortunately, they did not say when that would happen, but there was the announcement at least.
Cooperation with Gazprom has stood the test of time, it is true, but this means that we will also be able to speak, negotiate and work with other Russian partners some time in the future.
As I see it, the route Europe has taken so far in liberalising and deregulating the energy sector has been important and correct.
It, too, has helped to stabilise prices in particular, but in the next few years we shall have to walk a tightrope between greater security of supply â and ultimately also giving investors the security of recovering their investments through long-term contracts â and nevertheless creating more of a European internal market in energy, also integrating South East Europe, Ukraine too, and perhaps even Russia.
If we cannot do that through the Energy Charter, then perhaps it will be possible through the Energy Community, and that is a concrete proposal that the Commission will probably be presenting in the next few weeks.
We must take all these approaches.
Energy policy is top priority, and the last few months have shown us just how important it is.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Bartenstein, energy dependence is priority number one.
The security of the energy supply will be keeping us very busy in future.
Will the Energy Council give its attention to the Kyoto Protocol and with the period post-2012, and to the impact that joint implementation will have in this domain?
Will it be a focus for investment in Europe, and what is the most efficient way of achieving the overall CO2 reduction target?
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ RÃŒbig, with regard to the Kyoto Protocol and climate protection, I can inform Parliament that, when asked at the World Economic Forum in Davos what he saw as the world's priorities over the coming years, the former US President Bill Clinton said that the top priority was climate protection.
That might now sound rather audacious coming from an American, but it was the former US President who said it, and he did sign the Kyoto Protocol. As we know, though, Congress then did not ratify it.
I fully agree with you and with many others that climate protection is a top priority.
It is a necessity, because the global climate is under threat.
However, we in Europe need to bear in mind that we are currently responsible for around 14% of global CO2 emissions, and by 2050 the figure will be about 10%.
In other words, currently around 86% and in future 90% of CO2 emissions come from elsewhere.
It makes a big difference whether we in the European Union are going it pretty much alone or whether we at least have our partners in the USA â who are of course our competitors as well â on board.
That is not foreseeable at the moment, though.
Another question, of course, is how we should deal with countries such as China and India, which have no obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.
I expect that these countries will say â and this is quite understandable: 'you Europeans generate around 10 tonnes of CO2 per capita, the Americans around 20 tonnes, and we produce between one and two tonnes.
First let us bring our industrial and other development up to your level, then we will contribute to climate protection'.
Getting China, India and other developing and emerging economies on board as soon as possible and convincing them of our arguments is a very sensitive issue.
We in Europe should go a step further, but at the same time we need to bear our competitiveness in mind and protect the climate as cost-effectively as possible.
Joint implementation is very valuable in that connection.
If we can invest in European countries, for example in the new Member States, and thus reduce CO2 emissions for less investment than would be possible in, for example, the EU-15 Member States, then we should go down that route, and this is laid down in the Kyoto Protocol.
That in turn means that climate protection is of the utmost significance.
At the same time, however, we are also aware that energy prices have an effect on competitiveness and thus on employment.
We are going in the right direction, and in the next few months we will find out how the second post-Kyoto phase will be implemented in the EU Member States and what the national allocation plans will look like.
Trading in CO2 certificates has made a good start, and the prices are considerably higher than we expected â at one point there was talk of EURÂ 10 per tonne, and the most recent listing, as far as I know, was EURÂ 28, which is almost three times as much.
If we are now going to tell European industry that it will be allocated less than in the past, then we will have to find some good arguments.
In the interests of employment in good old Europe, I would quite clearly advocate that we tread very, very carefully and softly when it comes to our energy-intensive economy and industry.
With respect to the future of Kyoto, I am very much in favour of making progress and of an offensive approach, but this approach must not put any jobs at risk of being relocated from Europe to countries that still pay no attention at all to climate protection.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Bartenstein, in the very first days of your term as President-in-Office of the Council you had to deal with the difficult problem with Russia and Ukraine.
Initially, the problem was not that the gas was being cut off, but simply that Russia was demanding a much higher price for its natural gas.
Does the Austrian Presidency now plan to tackle this vulnerability to energy prices, which affects not only Ukraine but also, of course, the European economy?
We all know that a massive increase in energy prices would trigger high inflation and could considerably slow economic growth or even result in recession.
What do you intend to do with regard to the vulnerability of the European economy to energy prices?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, thankfully our economy and our gross domestic product are much less sensitive to fluctuations in energy prices than they were in 1973/74.
The OECD and the European Commission both estimate that this vulnerability, this sensitivity has reduced by about half, precisely because our management and production are now much more energy-efficient.
However, that does not of course mean that, even today, we can easily cope with an increase in the oil price from USDÂ 30 to USDÂ 60 just like that; and there are voices â which I hope will never be proved right â predicting three-figure prices in the near future.
With respect to gas, it must be said, to be fair to our Russian friends, that their intention was to get Ukraine to pay the world market price, although the world market price is a relative term, so it would be better to say the standard price in Europe, of about USDÂ 220 per thousand cubic metres.
This was ultimately agreed in the night from 3 to 4Â January in the negotiations between Gazprom and Ukraine.
The compromise provides â and the contracts have now been drawn up and signed â that a mixture will be produced of Russian gas at about USDÂ 220 and much cheaper gas from Central Asia, and Ukraine will pay about USDÂ 95 for that mixture.
With regard to world market prices and European gas prices, you should be aware that the US buys its gas at a much higher price than we do in Europe.
We obviously do not yet have a standard world market price â the differences for gas are considerably greater than they are for oil.
That, in turn, is an argument in favour of a more long-term approach to energy policy and in favour of increased partnership.
This dialogue between the European Union and Russia on one side, and OPEC on the other, must be continued and strengthened.
A greater degree of transparency is desirable in this connection, to build trust in both groups of partners.
I would also very much recommend that we pay greater attention not only to working with the energy producers, but also to establishing dialogue with consumers.
It is important for us in Europe to reach agreements with Japan, the US, and similarly with other consumers, to achieve a goal for which the oil-producing countries are also aiming: stable long-term prices.
It is quite incorrect to believe that it is in the primary interest of the OPEC countries to reach a price of USDÂ 100 as soon as possible.
They are well aware, firstly, that it would not last long and that market mechanisms could then reduce the price to a relatively low level. They are also well aware that the functioning of our economy, and continual growth, are ultimately important for their oil and gas sales, too.
There is therefore a common interest in creating stable, reliable energy markets and guaranteeing secure supplies and stable prices.
We will be able to make good progress in this over the coming months.
The Green Paper that the Commission is currently discussing is not yet officially referred to as such, but in practice it is one.
It will in future be a guiding principle for us.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question no 8 lapses.
Does the Austrian Presidency intend to revert to the Commission proposal for a directive on the portability of additional occupation pensions?
What would its approach be?
Â Â  MrÂ President, as this is the first time I have taken questions from the European Parliament, I am still rooted in the traditions of my own parliament, where questions are always repeated.
I am sure I will learn the ropes by the end of the Presidency: after all, we still have another four and a half months to go.
Supplementary occupational pensions are an important subject, including in connection with our concept of 'flexicurity' â flexibility through security.
The Council has already started examining the proposal submitted by the Commission at the end of October 2005 for a directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights.
By the end of February, the preparatory body responsible for examining the matter, in other words the Council Working Party on Social Questions, will have discussed the proposal in six meetings.
The Austrian Presidency has included the proposal in its draft agendas for the Council's meeting.
In view of the fact that the matter is very technically complex, however, we still need to examine how far this work will have got by the time the Council meets in June.
I will not hide the fact that, quite apart from the general complexity, there are still some key questions that need to be answered, but in principle I believe that it will make, and must make, a very important contribution to improving the mobility of employees in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ Bartenstein, I can reassure you that you have nothing to learn, because you are already much better than many of your predecessors straight out of the starting blocks.
I would like to expand on what you have said by saying that the point is that, when it comes to occupational pensions, we obviously also have to deal with the differences in competences and in tax systems.
The differences in competences in the Member States have led to major barriers to mobility.
Do you think that we need European minimum standards in this field, a common cost base for European products and a more comprehensive European pensions debate, whilst safeguarding national competences?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Karas, this proposal for a directive certainly is a step in the direction we want and have to take.
Anybody who wants employees to have mobility across European borders must make it possible for them to take their supplementary pension rights with them without too much difficulty.
On the other hand, it is quite clear to see that, when it comes to social security, each country has its own traditions and therefore that any attempt at harmonisation would be doomed to failure.
We do not want that; where social security is concerned, one size certainly does not fit all.
This is therefore certainly an issue in areas where it is sensible and appropriate to establish minimum standards.
In the field of pension rights, we should not forget that most European countries use a contributory system as the basis for state support.
At the same time, we know that it would be appropriate to supplement this contribution-based system in part by one based on capital, including in the state sector.
In addition, as part of this opportunity â we must of course also take account of the incomes of European employees and savers â we should of course also encourage private and occupational pension provision.
I am working on the assumption that the Member States will, and should, retain their decision-making authority and competence over the relatively long term, but that we should also establish â in particular through this directive â ways to make it easier for European employees with pension funds to transfer their pension rights throughout Europe, which the introduction of minimum standards would of course make considerably easier.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Bartenstein, I share your view that the possibility of transferring supplementary occupational pensions undoubtedly increases mobility.
Any measure that increases mobility at the same time increases job security.
I am quite sure that, as part of your Presidency, you are planning further measures to increase mobility and thus job security.
Which of these mobility-increasing measures will you be proposing to the other Member States in the course of your Presidency?
Â Â  MrÂ President, we know that the citizens of Europe have less mobility than citizens elsewhere.
Many of the available statistics show that mobility is twice as high in the USA as in Europe.
Of course, we cannot remove Europe's linguistic barriers overnight â and perhaps we do not want to do so â nor can we institute the federal principles applied in the USA just like that.
Nevertheless, in general it gives our young people an opportunity to increase their mobility and opens up to them a European market in interesting jobs and career opportunities.
With these qualifications, as we certainly do not want to adopt the American situation here overnight, more mobility for employees and young people is a goal of ours.
Improving workers' mobility involves taking measures, step by step.
With regard to this specific directive, I can tell you that the Commission has declared 2006 to be the European Year of Workers' Mobility, that there will be a job portal, EURES, an improved version of which is going to be presented at a meeting in the next few days, namely on 20/21 February in Brussels, where the starting pistol will officially be fired.
I myself will have the honour of taking part, and Commission President MrÂ Barroso, Commissioner Å pidla and the President of the European Parliament have also agreed to be there.
This meeting will include discussion of the topic of 'mobility, a tool for more and better jobs', and this discussion will continue in workshops.
We do not just want the directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights â what we want is a general mainstream.
It is also important that a best practice process should be initiated between the authorities, trade unions and the private sector, and we also want to broaden the knowledge base.
This therefore forms an important part of the Lisbon Strategy.
The European Year of Workers' Mobility is just starting; the final conference will take place in November under the Finnish Presidency.
However, I think it is a good thing that there are already plans to follow up on this first European Year of Mobility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Bartenstein, I am sure we are all aware that mobility is particularly high among academics and young people who have enjoyed a university education, but what specific plans does the Presidency now have for apprentices and people with lower levels of education?
What can we do to increase their mobility?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I think that all people in Europe, of whatever educational level â and in the German-speaking countries this includes a large number of apprentices undergoing vocational training â should have the same opportunities that perhaps used to be restricted to people with tertiary, academic educations.
I know that there are best practice examples in Austria of apprentices in training having the opportunity to spend time abroad.
I think it is absolutely essential â with the greatest respect for all the language regimes we operate in Europe â that we primarily give our young people knowledge of English as the language of mobility.
I hope I will not now be deluged with protests from Paris or elsewhere.
If we want to give Europe's young people career opportunities throughout Europe, we must naturally also be prepared to set up programmes during training and to grant subsidies, so that young people can have a first taste of this mobility in the context of such programmes, leading to them being able to get jobs in other European countries later in their careers.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  We shall now resume the debate on the report by MrsÂ EvelyneÂ Gebhardt on services in the internal market.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, as a new Member of the European Parliament, I should like to say that, having attended these debates for 18 months now, I have discovered the richness and the quality of the work done in this Chamber.
I should like to pay tribute to our Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to its late chairman, MrÂ Whitehead, to its rapporteur, MrsÂ Gebhardt and to the draftsman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, MrsÂ Van Lancker.
I should like to thank those at the helm of our group, to whose work we owe the draft we are debating today: MrÂ Harbour, the shadow rapporteur and coordinator of our group; MrsÂ Thyssen, our vice-chairman; and our indefatigable secretariat.
I should also like to pay tribute to the work of MrsÂ Descamps and of MrsÂ Bachelot, who are both members of the French delegation.
Thanks to all these men and women, we have made a significant breakthrough: the compromise is a new text.
First and foremost, it establishes the internal market in services.
This draft takes away from the Court of Justice the de facto monopoly it has been exercising for the past 50 years with regard to implementing the principles of the Treaties.
The internal market in services is based on mutual confidence and entails administrative cooperation, the simplification of administrative procedures and the abolition of protectionist obstacles, in terms both of the setting up of service companies and of the temporary provision of services.
The draft applies to services of general economic interest only where the freedom of establishment is concerned, while it excludes many essential services such as audiovisual services and the cinema, gambling activities, health care and the legal professions.
The compromise therefore proposes that Parliament vote in favour of a framework act geared towards economic growth, innovation and employment. That is what the nations of Europe want.
Yet the compromise also respects our model and our national collective preferences.
Will the directive lead to the dismantling of our social standards?
Will it cause a levelling down effect?
With the Commissionâs first proposal, the risk was plain to see.
That is why we rejected it.
The compromise proposed to you, however, constitutes a barrier to social dumping, is based on subsidiarity and adopts a sensible and restrictive approach to implementing the freedom to provide services.
It is made absolutely clear that the compromise excludes social standards and labour law.
Competition in the social sphere is prohibited.
Many national rules are respected where freedom of establishment is concerned, and the freedom to provide services is accompanied by the guarantee that Member States can apply their national rules when doing so is justified by the public interest.
This is a true compromise: it is the subject of criticism from both sides, which clearly shows that we have found a happy medium.
On behalf of my French colleagues, I therefore hope that you will support the compromise by voting in favour of it by a very large majority.
Doing so would be a victory for the European Parliament and it would be a victory for the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Winkler, it is one thing to complete the internal market, which is an objective that we share.
Yet, it is quite another thing to dismantle the European social model, which is a move that we strongly oppose.
We strongly oppose it because it runs counter to the interests of the citizens and to the interests of workers and of European consumers, but also because it jeopardises citizensâ support for the European project.
The initial draft Bolkestein Directive was overwhelmingly rejected because it was seemingly designed to make the completion of the internal market dependent on the reduction of social rights and on the reduction of environmental standards and of the protection of those consumers who had attained a higher level of protection in some Member States than in others.
By seeking to base the internal market no longer on competition between businesses, but on competition between the social systems of the various Member States, the Bolkestein proposal has made it seem as though it is playing the Member Statesâ interests off against one other.
It has created a suspicious atmosphere between old and new Member States, running counter to the European Commissionâs task, which is to unite all Europeans around a common project.
By including many social services and some services of general economic interest in the scope of the directive, the Commission has tried to subject activities that are crucial in terms of social cohesion to nothing other than the logic of competition and of the market.
With the country of origin principle, the Commission has turned its back on the Community method, which is aimed at sector-specific harmonisation. It is a method that has always consisted of bringing together the provisions in force in the Member States and is therefore strictly designed to promote mutual recognition and economic integration without jeopardising the European social model and â I repeat â the higher level of protection attained at times in certain countries.
It was a question of upwards harmonisation.
With this draft, the European Commission has, for the first time ever, proposed a law that, unlike the Community method, encourages the disparity in national laws and rewards the least demanding Member States.
Admittedly, the present Commission was not responsible for the initial proposal.
Nevertheless, it does have a responsibility: once you recognised that this text was badly thought out and badly put together â as you pointed out, MrÂ McCreevy â it was your responsibility to withdraw it and to propose another text that was more in keeping with European social principles and liable to restore peopleâs confidence.
That is why the French members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will vote in favour of an amendment to reject the text.
MrÂ Barroso, you stated that the Commission was willing to include the amendments that would help us make progress with the internal market in services, but you did not state what you would do with the amendments aimed at safeguarding social rights, environmental standards and consumer law.
Nor did you state what you had in store for the amendments that would exclude social services and certain services of general economic interest from the scope of the directive.
On the contrary, MrÂ McCreevy even stated this afternoon that he wanted to retain some services of general economic interest in the scope of the directive.
You therefore give the impression of not listening to Parliament or of only listening to it when it comes out in favour of liberalisation.
MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, I will conclude by saying that this afternoonâs demonstration witnessed to the expectation of a Europe that is more protective of the social sphere than is the Commission.
Our vote in favour of the compromise will be subject to the exclusion of all public services from the scope of the directive, to the removal of the country of origin principle and to the stipulation of clear legal rules with regard to the applicable law.
The compromise currently proposed sadly does not include these changes, and we have therefore tabled amendments along these lines.
Â Â  â I am the shadow rapporteur for the report by Anne Van Lancker of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I will talk about the regulation of the movement of workers in the Directive.
Mr President, I travelled abroad for the first time in 1990, when Lithuania declared independence.
Prior to this, the Communists would not let me leave, as my father was an opponent of their regime.
Lithuania has now rid itself of Communists and we are in the European Union.
We joined the Community wanting to be useful.
We believed that we would be equal partners and citizens of the Union. Sadly, this is not so.
Most of Europe's old-timers are more afraid of us than bird flu.
2006 has been declared the year of free movement for workers in the Community, but its members do not want to open the doors at all.
The Directive proposes new restrictions.
The Commission's figures show that there is a clear advantage for countries, which have liberalised their labour markets.
Politicians, meanwhile, threaten people with an invasion from the east and ignore the facts.
Why are illegal immigrants from the former Yugoslavia tolerated in Austria, Moroccans in France and Turks in Germany?
But Slovaks, Poles and Lithuanians there are seen as the greatest threat.
The old members of the Community have long benefited from the markets of the new countries.
We say that this is fine, because we believe in mutual benefits.
Our business communities are also looking for new markets and are ready to compete honestly.
They know that competition equals progress and growth.
They also know that only an integrated and united Europe will endure the challenges posed by globalisation.
But do we know this?
Unfortunately, for the Lithuanian the proposed Directive means that little has changed since the days of the iron curtain.
Mr President, Europe may remain split if its peoples are played off against one another.
A united Europe is one where all citizens have equal rights. Above all, freedom of movement and freedom to provide services.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I request that, during Thursdayâs vote, we schedule an interruption of the sitting just before the final vote.
Parliament and the Commission ought to erect a statue of MrÂ Bolkestein, the most famous European in 2005 and 2006, so that everyone remembers that we no longer want a proposal of this kind, based on an initiative of the European Commission.
Admittedly, we have moved on today from the stage we were at with the initial Bolkestein Directive: our parliamentary committees have worked, and they have worked hard.
Is that a good enough reason, however, to accept this compromise?
I â indeed, we - genuinely do not think so.
There are still too many grey areas in this text, not least where the opportunities for monitoring labour law, environmental law and consumer law are concerned.
We cannot accept services of general economic interest, social services or social housing being affected by this directive.
If the aim is to restore confidence among all of our fellow citizens, who increasingly doubt the part played by European integration in improving their everyday lives, then we must quickly switch to a real form of upwards social harmonisation, not least by making it our priority to draft a directive that defines the notions of European public service.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the proposal for a Services Directive is reactionary.
It threatens employeesâ rights and it is in danger of leading to social dumping.
We therefore want the proposal to be rejected in its entirety.
If it is not, we shall vote in favour of each proposal that limits the harmful effects of the directive, for example proposals to do away with the country of origin principle and to exempt certain sectors from the directive.
The proposed compromise between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats removes important defects from the proposal, but major ambiguities remain, which are supposedly to be resolved by the European Court of Justice.
We, for our part, do not want employeesâ rights to be determined by the Court.
We cannot accept a situation in which employeesâ rights, together with legislation designed to protect our citizens, are sacrificed on the altar of the free market.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the many demonstrators who, in a dignified manner, today showed their opposition to the Bolkestein Directive.
Like the demonstrators, the June Movement wishes to reject the Bolkestein Directive.
The compromise between the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not alter the crux of the matter.
The country of origin principle is being removed but is not being replaced by a clear host country principle.
The Posting Directive continues to give low-wage countries the right to undermine our own wages and the Danish model of collective bargaining.
Sensitive areas are being removed from the directive, so that it is left to judges to liberalise public services and make them subject to the market.
This has already happened within the areas of education, health and social affairs.
The European Court of Justice is directly invited to legislate by means of AmendmentÂ 5, which confirms the Courtâs principles of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality.
These principles sound good, but the three words reflect the fact that it is the judges in Luxembourg who will decide whether national legislation can be regarded as unlawful if foreign companies are not in practice equally entitled under it to tender for work and to provide services.
The June Movement welcomes Polish plumbers and all other foreign workers, but they should be paid non-discriminatory wages, not dumping wages.
We wish to see free competition, but it must also be fair, and we therefore propose services regulated by the open coordination method so that our democracies are not turned into unlawful trade barriers by the judges in Luxembourg.
Â Â  â Everyone agrees that the Services Directive would legalise the movement of services within the territory of the European Union.
And if it was adopted without major amendments, it would not discriminate against the new countries.
I mean, above all, the preservation of the country of origin principle.
On the other hand, particularly when one takes into account the dangers posed by most of the amendments, this directive could drift far from the original draft and become an insurmountable obstacle to the further development of the European Union.
Another question is the range of services.
I agree that in reality education, according to both the Community Treaty and the Directive, is, above all, a matter of national responsibility, and the European Union only funds general education programmes.
However, if there is a lack of national responsibility and the funding of general European education programmes does not increase, then the Services Directive, by only confirming the responsibility of the national authorities, while neglecting education services, does not help to solve the problems surrounding the expansion of education in Europe, it simply perpetuates them.
This, by the way, is confirmed by the decrease in funding of general education and culture programmes for 2007-2013, which was the subject of a persuasive letter by the Committee on Culture and Education to all the group leaders of the European Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is a very strange debate that we are witnessing today.
To listen to the representatives of the major parties, you would think that we really had found a solution â but what sort of solution?
The mountain has laboured and brought forth a bureaucratic chimera.
Just take a look at it, those of you here who call yourselves social democrats.
How exactly are you planning to implement what you think you have negotiated?
And we find the same desperate situation on the other side.
Those who really think they can create a more open market have also failed.
What do you do in such a situation in real life, where there is no room for wastefulness or mutual admiration?
You go back to square one.
You start again from the beginning.
It is a tragedy for Europe that you have not done that here.
It is a tragedy that you have not listened to MrsÂ RÃŒhle.
It is those who actually want to stand up for the idea of Europe who will have to bear the consequences of all the problems that have now been built in, and also of the complaints that will be coming our way.
Â Â  Mr President, the prosperity and well-being of the EUâs citizens are based on recognised freedoms: the free movement of goods, persons, capital and services.
While the promotion of the free movement of services fits within the framework of the Lisbon process, being necessary to achieve growth and jobs, the proposal that was before us, turned out to be a quick-fire solution, one which, whilst it may be lethal, can also have positive effects.
It turned out to be beneficial for the new Member States, but I warn you that the social unrest it may cause may mean that we will go from bad to worse, and the directive would not only lead to social unrest, it would also undo the good work.
There are a number of other problems.
The posting of workers is one that I would mention.
What does the Commission intend to do in practice now?
Being from a border region myself, I am aware that we must prevent administrative obstacles from hampering the posting of workers, or preventing it altogether.
We must pull out all the stops, not least with a view to putting the temporary employment dossier back on track in the Council.
Once everything runs along smoothly in the temporary employment sector, I for one will be in favour of bringing this sector within the scope of the Services Directive, but that point has still not yet been reached, what matters now is that this Temporary Employment Directive be put back on track.
Everything hinges on the monitoring procedures that will be put in place: monitoring the posting of workers, monitoring self-employed sole traders âŠ As for the former, we are not only examining social security and taxes, we could also stipulate that minimum wages be specified on the forms used.
This is what makes the process of the Services Directive so effective and I am pleased with the compromises that have been reached.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the compromise that we have before us and on which we are to vote on Thursday is a services directive quite different from the Bolkestein Directive.
I can therefore say to MrÂ Bonde that the thousands of honourable trade unionists demonstrating outside Parliament today support the compromise arrived at in this Chamber.
MrÂ Bonde needs only to read the press statement by John Monks, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, to know that this is so.
I have to say, too, that I am in no doubt as to why they support it.
I have myself been involved in moving things in that direction.
Agreements and labour legislation will be decided on by individual countries and individual trade union movements.
This arrangement will provide more jobs.
The public sector will be safeguarded, and we shall have avoided a split between the new and the old Member States.
On Thursday, we shall be voting on a balanced opening-up of the internal market.
I have said for a long time that the European Union must not develop into a form of competition between states.
That is something we have avoided by means of the compromise now before us.
We shall now obtain competition on fair and transparent conditions, and we shall obtain protection of those interests that serve the public and the individual citizen in the public sector as variously manifested in our societies.
I think that what we have here is an important compromise, and I also think that it represents a crucial developmental trend on which we must build further, irrespective of whether we are talking about the Working Time Directive or the many other matters we have to tackle.
In my capacity, too, as President of the Party of European Socialists, I can therefore recommend the compromise now before us.
It will definitely move us in the right direction.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have been discussing this Services Directive all around Europe for almost two years.
It is, of course, excellent that there is finally something for people to take an active interest in among the subjects we tackle in this Assembly.
Sometimes, a lot of misunderstandings arise and, sometimes, these misunderstandings are exploited in a quite distasteful way.
The Services Directive is designed to remove all the thousands of bureaucratic obstacles that make things difficult for European companies, especially small companies.
We must not forget that it is companies that create jobs.
Without companies, there would be no employees at all.
The services sector is a growing part of our economies, offering major opportunities for jobs and growth.
We must open up and reform the European economies as a matter of some urgency.
The country of origin principle is clever inasmuch as it creates a genuine internal market without discrimination.
That constitutes significant progress for people and companies.
The principle was clarified and specified in the IMCOâs compromise, which states that it is the host countryâs rules governing labour law, public health and safety that apply.
The compromise now circulating among the big groups has introduced an extremely woolly concept, namely that of social policy.
That is deeply unfortunate because it opens the door to protectionism and to a great many different legal interpretations.
It can, indeed, be heard how representatives from the various groups are already interpreting the compromise.
It now seems, however, as if that compromise is on the way out, in which case that is a state of affairs we cannot but welcome.
The Services Directive is about how Europe is to hold its own in a globalised world.
It is about growth, the economy, employment and freedom of choice.
Since the Treaty of Rome, our aim has been to establish freedom of movement for services too.
Now is the time to do just that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Parliament is capitulating today and renouncing its political role.
The compromise means that the concept of the country of origin principle is being removed and replaced by a political vacuum.
This vacuum will then be filled by the European Court of Justice which, in turn, will reintroduce the country of origin principle, because the Court consistently puts internal market considerations before everything else.
The Court cannot be dismissed, and nor can it be held accountable.
Is that democracy?
Only large companies with armies of lawyers will be able to use the Services Directive to uphold their interests.
The only unemployment to which the directive will put an end is that of the lawyers.
The losers will be the municipalities, public employees, consumers and small businesses.
Let us vote down this directive.
Instead of enforcing the liberalisation of everything, we should respect democratically taken decisions to preserve sectors from short-term thinking focused on the market.
The EU cannot live on economic efficiency alone.
We also need democratic efficiency in which people are not constantly ridden roughshod over by bad directives.
Â Â  â Mr President, the directive on the free provision of services and freedom of establishment forms part of the more general anti-grass policy of the European Union and is based on the Maastricht Treaty and on the ratified objective of the Lisbon Strategy to create a single market, with the primary objective of strengthening competition, maximising the profitability of the monopolies, by privatising public and public utility services, and striking at the fundamental employment and social rights of the working classes.
The vows to remain true to the principle of the full unaccountability of the monopolies were repeated in an arrogant manner today by the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso.
The political agreement between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the package of amendments, does not change the reactionary nature of the directive, the basic principle of which is the country of origin, in other words full unaccountability for capital and the destruction of thousands of small- and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed people.
The recommendations on alleged respect for workers' rights constitute an attempt to gild the pill and deflate the workers' reactions.
The argument that liberalisation will mean cheaper services for the peoples does not stand up, given that, with the directive, services will be concentrated in fewer hands and the monopolies will determine quality and prices in keeping with increased profits, which is why we shall vote against the directive.
You are sowing winds and you are sure to reap hurricanes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Swedish June List defends an efficient internal market and is therefore well disposed towards the Services Directive.
At the same time, we value national self-determination.
There must be good reasons for the Member States to transfer power and competences to the EU.
If we accept the country of origin principle, we give up national sovereignty.
We believe that the benefits of this principle are too limited for us to be prepared to do that.
This principle mainly affects services such as construction, cleaning and consultancy.
These are important sectors, but they do not have a decisive influence on Swedish prosperity and GDP.
It is also a good thing that national monopolies on services should not be included in the directive.
If these are to be reorganised, they should be so in a democratic spirit, that is to say by means of a broad debate in those countries that believe that such a change is desirable.
We shall support the compromise.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the common European market was supposed to be based on three freedoms. I refer to the free movement of goods and services, the free movement of capital and the free movement of people.
Over recent decades, the implementation of the first of these freedoms enabled the old Member States to achieve surpluses of tens of billions of euro in their balance of trade with countries such as Poland. This helped secure hundreds of thousands of jobs in the old Member States.
The second freedom allowed entrepreneurs from the old Member States to be involved in the privatisation of the Polish State Treasuryâs assets on exceptionally favourable terms, notably in the baking and insurance sector.
Unfortunately, when it comes to free movement of persons, the very freedom that would be most beneficial to the new Member States, we face significant restrictions.
The so-called Services Directive might have helped to improve matters.
Regrettably, the current draft contained in MrsÂ Gebhardtâs report is a far cry from the version tabled by the European Commission and has very little to do with the idea of the free movement of services.
This is particularly surprising as services account for almost 70% of the European Unionâs GDP, and the free movement of services would undoubtedly accelerate the rate of GDP growth in the old Member States as well as in the new ones.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine the follow-up to our work.
It is time we reminded ourselves that we are in a codecision procedure here.
Cleverly, our colleague, MrÂ Harbour, was able to abandon the idea of a parliamentary victory, which was the likely outcome but which led straight to the slow agony of drafting a crucial text on services.
His tour of the European capital cities confirmed to him what we already know.
The compromise drafted with MrsÂ Gebhardt â to whom I should like to pay tribute - is the only one possible within the Council and between Parliament and the Council. There is no qualified majority vote within the Council for the kind of internal market that some people want.
To persist in wanting this kind of market would be a Pyrrhic victory.
What, moreover, is chiefly apparent is that the difference between us has become a difference between the East and the West.
On the basis of this observation, it is the logic of enlargement that is today called into question.
Let us not forget that the failure of the Services Directive would be added to a list that includes the collapse of the Constitution, the concerns about the financial perspective and the doubts about the Lisbon Agenda.
We must now participate in a reconciliation strategy in order to keep the Community ambition alive.
I identified a real problem in the discrimination felt by the new Member States when faced with the restrictions imposed on the free movement of workers.
I want helpfully to say to those countries that it is not by rejecting the compromise and thus, in the long run, the Services Directive or by bringing into question the Posting of Workers Directive that they will overcome this discrimination â quite the opposite.
That was the thinking behind the work that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, carried out under the aegis of MrsÂ Van Lancker when we deleted Articles 24 and 25 from the initial text.
From now on, we must solemnly call for the moratorium to be abandoned and for all the restrictions on the free movement of workers from the new Member States to be lifted.
It would also be worthwhile linking these issues during the Council debate on the Services Directive.
However, a study of the text has also demonstrated the many shortcomings in the Communityâs legal arsenal.
Some Members have voiced legitimate fears, and these fears must be dealt with.
Let us take stock of the undeniable progress constituted by this text, because our job as legislator has only just begun.
Â Â  In the year I was born, President Kennedy said, âIch bin ein Berlinerâ.
At the time, everybody understood this and agreed with him that the division of East and West was a historical transgression.
If I said today, âIch bin ein Polish plumberâ, I wonder whether all of us would realise that the issue is still the unity of Europe, and whether we would all agree.
The Services Directive extends beyond interests and it addresses values.
It addresses the four fundamental freedoms laid down in the Treaty of Rome, and equal opportunities.
In 21st century Europe it is unacceptable to discriminate against a service provider on the basis of origin, nationality or mother tongue.
An important goal is to reduce the number and vulnerability of those who are forced into the black or grey economy.
We want a better Europe!
We want a Europe where service providers enjoy legal certainty in the Member States.
We want a better Europe, where service providers can create European jobs and meet consumer needs legally.
We must create a certain, stable and clear legal background.
This is particularly important for small and medium enterprises.
The Socialist MEPs of the new Member States have always made a point of supporting this common interest of Europe.
We have been constructive, we accepted the total removal of labour law from the Directive.
We acknowledged that instead of the country of origin, we must regulate the freedom of the provision of services.
We acknowledged that the Directive may not come into conflict with other, existing European legal standards, and it cannot overwrite the Treaty.
We cannot loosen the certain, stable and clear framework that is being established.
We cannot accept any undefined exceptions, because these would leave room for the arbitrary decisions of Member States.
We do not support the total removal of public services of an economic nature, but we are ready to examine sectoral exceptions individually.
We recognise and indeed welcome the protection that European consumers are entitled to everywhere and at all times, but we do not accept that consumer protection should restrict the freedom of service provision.
And last but not least: in the challenge of global competition, Europe cannot afford to spend the jointly produced GDP on administrative supervision.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is a fateful time for Europe.
On Thursday we have two choices.
Either we can demonstrate, in particular, the long sought-after solidarity with our new Member States and show that we take the citizens of Europe seriously, together with consumersâ desire for more and cheaper alternatives and the demand for more jobs, or we can dupe Europeans by adopting a Services Directive at any price, involving the lowest common denominator, and by adopting a document that changes none of the current protectionist conditions in the services area â a document that does not even preserve the status quo but that, to top it all, is a retrograde step inasmuch as it creates still more obstacles for our businesses.
The Commission, has, unfortunately, already made its choice, MrÂ McCreevy, and contributed unhelpfully to the compromise between the two big groups.
I had fully expected the Commission to have been the standard-bearer for a genuine internal market for services which is, of course, the very cornerstone of the Commissionâs high-profile Lisbon process.
The big groupsâ compromise will under no circumstances bring the EU closer to its citizens, which is of course what we normally strive to do.
Only a genuine internal market for services can create the jobs we need so much in Europe.
Anything else is marketing gone wrong.
We must repudiate in no uncertain terms the scare campaigns, misinformation and manipulation in which certain circles â some of them in this Chamber â have engaged on the subjects of social dumping, mass unemployment and other outrages.
Their action is scandalous.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as many Members have pointed out, the European Commissionâs initial proposal is socially dangerous, badly drafted and legally complicated. In short, it is exactly the opposite of a sound piece of legislation, that is to say of one that is beneficial to the European project and to Europeans.
We, in this Chamber, represent the citizens.
There were many tens of thousands of them this afternoon in the streets of Strasbourg.
I believe that the demonstration was a healthy exercise in democracy in which the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs took part with the aim of rejecting the directive as it stands and of proposing some substantial changes to its content.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance obviously wants a European market in services, but is categorically opposed to its being governed by competition between national laws, which is what the country of origin principle implies and which, in fact, would result in downwards harmonisation.
That is why we will vote in favour of the proposal.
We have, moreover, tabled some amendments that break with the country of origin principle and that exclude services of general economic interest from the scope of the directive.
I urge you to reject the services directive.
The recent Irish ferries dispute illustrated what the future could hold for workers and workersâ rights under the services directive and similarly many of Commissioner McCreevyâs public comments in recent times have highlighted dangers to workersâ rights and collective bargaining.
The directive commercialises almost all services within the EU. It will deprive millions of quality public services.
It disproportionately affects women, both as the majority of workers in the service sector and as users of those services, and I agree with points made this evening about decisions ending up with the Court of Justice.
People marched in their tens of thousands today to oppose this, but we put governments on notice: the struggle will be at its most intense at national level.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Unionâs growth rate has been falling for years, and recently it has dropped below 2% a year.
The world is leaving us behind because when it comes to competing at global level, it is those who contrive to lower costs and prices and create new products that take the upper hand.
The European Union is falling behind as it has a costly agricultural sector and an erroneous, economically costly and ineffective policy of subsidising that sector.
The Union also has a costly industrial sector.
It is burdened by excessive social privileges, the common customs policy, and expensive bureaucratic regulations.
Most importantly of all, the Union has expensive services.
The services sector creates the most jobs, but cheaper service providers are prevented from accessing the market.
The attempt to hold up the liberalisation of services is reminiscent of the attempt to hold up the flow of cheap consumer goods from Asia.
It is expensive and ineffective.
It is expensive because it requires a sprawling administrative system, and it is ineffective because it contributes to the boom in illegal services that is detrimental to workers.
Those who defend the existing European Union provisions on services argue that they are fighting for their citizensâ jobs and fighting against a rise in unemployment.
My counter argument is as follows.
Consider what happened in Ireland and in Great Britain.
Both countries opened up their markets.
Did the employment rate increase or decrease?
Is unemployment rising or falling?
There can be only one conclusion. The state of the services market contributed to accelerating economic development.
I believe that cheaper services are the key to speeding up the Unionâs development.
Cheaper services would reduce the cost of production and consumption.
The market must also be extended and new technologies introduced.
Cheap services are the only way to resolve, or at least alleviate, the problem of finding resources for âŠ
Â Â  MrÂ President, the issue of the challenges facing the European Union in the contemporary world of global competition arises in nearly all the debates held in this Parliament.
We would like Europe to develop in a dynamic fashion and become the most competitive economy in the world in a few yearsâ time.
The citizens of Europe would like this too, and they are confident that the decisions we take in the House are driving the Union towards that goal.
We shall fail to live up to these expectations, however, if we do not find the courage to create a genuinely common market that would allow all European firms a chance to grow, regardless of where their headquarters are located.
The right conditions for development will never be created if we agree to protectionist practices.
These practices are also a form of discrimination, and not just along the East-West divide, though that is where they are most evident.
They also tend to be particularly painful for the citizens of the new Member States.
The European economy is crying out for development and the citizens of the Member States are crying out for jobs.
The draft directive we are debating today, prepared under the previous Commission, was an appropriate and rational response to these demands.
Given that services amount to 70% of the income generated within the Union and provide jobs for the majority of Europeans, we ought to be doing everything in our power to ensure that this sector can develop without unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles.
Unfortunately, this is the sector in which the most obstacles to freedom of movement exist.
This runs counter to common sense and also to the provisions of the Treaties.
Emotions on the draft directive ran high from the outset.
A number of amendments were introduced, and latterly a compromise version was agreed in the course of the work undertaken by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
This really is a far-reaching compromise.
It significantly alters the meaning of this text.
Further changes to the text, however, will mean shying away from the challenges facing Europe.
The Union will be unable to compete successfully on the global market if it is paralysed by fear of internal competition.
Â Â  Mr President, my predecessor, Mr Philip Whitehead MEP, would have been proud to have spoken on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
He would have been proud of the work done by our rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, and all the Members who have worked so hard to improve and amend the Commission proposal.
He would have wanted to have been here to witness the mature and responsible way in which this Parliament is building a consensus on behalf of our citizens for the opening of the market on services.
If we get it right, we can open up the market, boost jobs and growth across the EU and help Europe compete globally with the booming services market in India and China.
The Bolkestein proposal was flawed because it failed to recognise that if you want the public to support the opening-up of the market you have to convince them of the benefits and reassure them that it will not undermine working or consumer rights.
If you want to encourage citizens to support change and reform, you have to explain to them what is in it for them, for their own life prospects.
It is Parliament which is speaking for the citizen and taking up the issues of all our citizens, businesses, consumers, workers and the unemployed.
So let us make it simple.
We need to end the ludicrous discriminatory practices that are stopping our businesses from getting a foothold in the European market.
Why should a business have to apply to join a local chamber of commerce, only to be told there is a five-year waiting list?
Why should a business have to set up four offices and pay a EURÂ 500Â 000 deposit?
The black economy is thriving in Europe in the services sector because these complex and costly barriers are encouraging businesses to engage in undeclared and illegal work.
Let us make them legal with these rules.
Let us get rid of protectionism, but protect consumers and working rights.
I believe consumers can see the benefit of choice and competition if they can be sure that if something goes wrong they can have a speedy remedy in a local court and they do not have to chase down a bad provider to Lisbon, Paris, Warsaw or London to have their rights recognised.
This is what we are trying to achieve in these compromises.
Those working in the service sector need the guarantee that their employment rights are protected.
This is not about old or new Europe. This is not about left or right.
Citizens are looking to us to make the right choice: to get rid of crippling protectionism in the single market in services and protect working and consumer rights.
I believe that if we get it right it will be a victory for parliamentary democracy and a boost to jobs and growth for future generations of Europeans.
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to look at ensuring that these single points of delivery, these one-stop-shops that are so vital to delivering, monitoring and supervising the kind of services we want.
It should look at setting up an EU trust mark or an EU quality assurance scheme to give the consumer the trust and the confidence to use these services which respect consumersâ rights and working rights.
Â Â  MrÂ President, every now and then one of the dozens of decisions taken by the European Parliament stands out as vital to the future of the European Union.
This is true of the Services Directive.
It was intended as a way of implementing the principles of the four European freedoms.
It is supposed to ensure that there will be no discrimination regarding the provision of services anywhere in the European Union.
National origin is to be irrelevant, and the citizens of the old and new Member States are to be treated according to the same principles.
Implementation of the directive will promote economic growth and make the European social model more widespread.
Implementing economic freedom strengthens the social dimension of Europe rather than weakening it.
Compromise solutions are clearly an essential aspect of Parliamentâs work.
That is also true in this case, and we should strive for compromise despite our differences of opinion.
Nonetheless, there are limits beyond which the Services Directive would become meaningless.
I believe it is rational not to surrender to mercantilism the areas where market logic does not operate.
I also believe the statement that the directive does not affect labour law is justified.
I do not, however, see any reason to include exemptions from the scope of the directive when they are unjustified and have no clear legal basis.
It seems to me that clear legislation is essential in matters of such strategic importance.
What is required is a rational decision with a bearing on the future.
The spectres of Frankenstein and the Polish plumber should disappear from European consciousness and be replaced by trust, freedom and solidarity.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is calling for the withdrawal of the proposed Bolkestein directive and, in all events, we are seeking the abolition of the principle of the country of origin which is being maintained under the new name of the 'principle of the free provision of services'.
The deliberate obscurity of the new wording throws wide open the doors to the negative interpretations by the Court of Justice of the European Communities about which Commissioner McGreevy spoke to us.
We are also calling for services of general economic interest to be expressly exempted from the scope of the directive.
We are calling for uniform European specifications and for the prevention of social dumping and unfair competition levered by companies with flexible social and environmental legislation.
The fragile compromise between the European right and the socialists, under pressure from reactions and demonstrations by trades union, moderates but does not remove the neo-liberal philosophy and negative charge of the proposal.
The European Left rejects the disguised Bolkestein directive and calls for amendments limiting its adverse repercussions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the fear generated in the countries of Western Europe by the phenomenon of the âPolish plumberâ has manifested itself in successive attempts to weaken the draft Services Directive on liberalisation of the services market.
The many compromise amendments agreed mainly in the largest political groups indicate that some of the countries of the old Fifteen do not wish to abide by the principle of the free movement of goods within the Union enshrined in the Treaty.
If we take Great Britain and Ireland as examples, however, it can be seen that opening up labour markets to Poland and to the other new Member States is beneficial to national economies.
One can therefore conclude that such strong resistance to the adoption of the directive in its initial form stems from irrational fears verging on xenophobia.
Â Â  Mr President, next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, when the European Economic Community called for the abolition of the obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital as the main objectives towards achieving a common or internal market.
In relation to services, however, we have had over 50Â years of Member State protectionism and restrictive practices, from complicated bureaucratic hurdles and time delays to financial penalties to obscure qualification requirements.
In Austria, foreign ski instructors cannot provide services for more than 14Â days.
In Belgium and France, emergency repairs can only be done after an eight-day prior notification, which is a contradiction in itself.
In order to place temporary pilots and aircraft engineers with an airline in Italy, a EURÂ 400Â 000 deposit and the establishment of four offices are required.
And each one of those barriers is invariably justified by invoking the specious but emotive defence of preventing a ârace to the bottomâ.
Protectionist Member States pose as champions of the workers against social dumping. In practice, they are encouraging a rampant black economy.
In fact, those countries that have embraced the enlarged EU market have grown from strength to strength.
Since 1993 the free movement of goods, capital and persons has yielded enormous economic and social gains.
Nearly 70% of the working population in Europe is involved in the services sector, which represents 55% of the EUâs GDP, but, at present, services account for only 20% of trade between Member States.
The incomplete market has created nearly EURÂ 1Â 000Â billion of prosperity and 2.5Â million additional jobs in Europe.
The Services Directive could deliver 600Â 000 jobs more.
There are a limited number of services â especially health services â that should have sector-specific measures.
I welcome Commissioner McCreevyâs undertaking to propose a separate directive on patient mobility and the whole issue of cross-border health service provision.
However, I support the remaining provisions of what is already an emaciated directive.
It is particularly important that the temporary workersâ agencies are not excluded from the scope, given the extent to which staffing and recruitment agencies are used in a modern, flexible labour market.
And why are transport workers and childcare workers excluded?
I support the provisions of Article 16 wholeheartedly ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, right now, everyoneâs attention is on the European Parliament.
We have every opportunity to set the political agenda.
We must make use of that opportunity and make an impression on this incredibly important directive.
This is not the Bolkestein Directive, but a compromise in the making, which is something quite different.
I shall give a few examples from the area covered by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Labour law, collective agreements and the right to take strike action are not affected by the directive.
In the future, it will be possible for Member States to require services companies to have representatives able to conclude collective agreements and be responsible for inspections of the working environment etc. Services for the benefit of everyone, such as health care and medical services, education and social services are exempt from the directive.
Nor are temporary agencies affected, and this in anticipation of a separate directive specifically concerned with such agencies.
When it comes to services of general economic interest, it is up to the Member States to decide whether or not they wish to open up such services to competition.
If they are, however, opened up in that way, so too should the whole of the internal market be.
This is a constructive compromise which combines the merits of the internal market with security in the labour market and, moreover, protects the public services to which people in our Member States and regions currently have access.
Some people believe that this is an unclear compromise.
How do matters stand at present, however?
What happens if we reject the directive?
How many cases are languishing in anticipation of decisions by the European Court of Justice instead of being resolved by means of a directive through which we spell out the ground rules?
I maintain that this directive would emphatically mean progress.
It is clearer than the regulations we have at present, and we should therefore vote in favour of it.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are all absolutely convinced of the need to complete the internal market in services, by eliminating barriers, restrictive practices and protectionism.
It is a genuine, widespread problem.
The initial proposals of the Bolkestein directive were, however, contradictory and, in many respects, ambiguous and wrong.
Its basic mistake was to have given rise to opposing and negative perceptions.
On the one hand, there was the impression that the revitalisation of fair competition was essentially being reduced to a for social and democratic dumping.
On the other hand, because of the perfectly legitimate resistance to such ambiguities, there was a feeling in many countries, especially the new Member States, that the intention was to consolidate or uphold protectionist barriers and obstacles to the free movement of services.
I believe that, on the basis of the compromise texts that have been tabled, those contradictions and failures can now substantially be put right.
One justified criticism, perhaps, concerns certain exclusions and derogations for particular sectors, which will have truly adverse effects on the prospects for competitive growth in Europeâs productive, economic and social systems.
Those sectors include professional activities, banking, financial and insurance services, and energy supplies.
Many people maintain that this mountain of a directive is likely to give birth to a mouse of a result.
To counter that objection I would point out that it is preferable to run that risk than to create a scorpion, since the sting in that little creatureâs tail would certainly poison the balance of the European social model.
Â Â  â () A commercial television station in the Union told us today that EU workers are protesting against the Services Directive.
The report forgot to add that these are workers only from the old Member States, whereas workers in the new Member States, second-class citizens in the EU, want the Directive.
Czechs, like others from the new Member States, cannot freely work in Germany and elsewhere.
What is truly laughable is the fact that we eat subsidised food from the west and we buy western goods that cross our borders freely and without import taxes.
The key article is Article 16, which in the wording of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection carefully acknowledges that providers may come under the regulations of their country of origin, has fallen victim to a compromise between the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
This is not a compromise, however, so much as a castration of the entire Directive.
Buck-passing is no way to operate a law by which providers are to be regulated, as it places them in an uncertain legal position. It may involve only a non-binding declaration, but there is extensive reference to public interest as a ground for restricting the activities of service providers.
This throws the entire text into confusion, because subparagraph 1 indicates that it should be the law of the country of destination that directly applies, while subparagraph 3 can be construed as stating that it is the law of the country of origin.
If we are to delay exposing our economy even to internal competition within the framework of the EU, how can we expect to compete with the outside world?
If we fail to make use of the rapidly developing new Member States to force the pace for greater efficiency in the workplace, we will be depriving ourselves of one of the greatest benefits of Union enlargement.
Â Â  () We are on the point of taking a far-reaching decision affecting the fate of one of the basic freedoms of the Union, which has formed part of European law for more than fifty years.
At the same time as Europe is opening up to the economies of third countries, the countries of the Union are erecting internal barriers to the mutual provision of services.
The moment has come to either knock down these artificial walls or give them our seal of approval, which would be greeted by applause by the trade unionists.
The outcome will show how well the Union has coped with enlargement.
The Berlin Wall has fallen, the new Member States have opened their markets to goods and services from all over Europe, and yet there are still EU Member States that have not duly implemented European legislation on the free movement of services.
These states are hypocritically protecting their markets against mutual competition, in contravention of the law of the Union and the rulings of the courts.
We are confronted with Chiracâs idiotic phantom in the form of a Polish plumber, hovering over France and other countries.
Now is the time to find out who takes the ideas of the Lisbon Strategy and the flexible market seriously, and who does not.
On what will the opposition be basing their arguments, I wonder.
They have not presented us with any studies, but have rather used the rapporteur to foist false impressions on trade unionists.
It is simply not true that the Directive will transform labour laws, nor will it amend laws on workersâ programmes or undermine their protection.
On the contrary, all of the studies show that it will bring 600Â 000 new jobs, EUR 37 billion for the economy and an end to discrimination.
The proposed watering down of the Directive and surrender of country of origin principle goes against the interests of everyone, including consumers, and it would also represent an ideological blow to the concept of deregulation and continuing harmonisation.
Our experience with the movement of goods has shown that such an option is unworkable.
The Member States would never agree on it, and more importantly, through bringing further regulation rather than simplification and flexibility, it would only delay the goal of a successful Europe operating within the framework of a global economy.
The Directive thus provides a test of whether we favour short-term national protectionism or a common European prosperity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, far from doing any credit to the principle of better regulation, this directive, in fact, does the opposite.
It is you, Commissioner, who must bear responsibility for the annoyance, indeed the indignation of almost all groups in European society, and for what we just heard about from MrsÂ RoithovÃ¡ â the playing off of Members from the East and West against one another.
We are not talking about raising the drawbridge.
The internal market is not an end in itself.
That is why we needed the three major exceptions: the Posting of Workers Directive, the Temporary Workers Directive, which must remain an exception for as long as the Council keeps the European directive on ice, and in particular the Professional Qualifications Directive, adopted by all of us here in this House.
An efficient internal market without barriers and without discrimination, with fair framework conditions, is a win for Europe â for providers, service providers, consumers and employees.
But that is certainly not what this directive gives us.
I would particularly like to thank the European Trade Union Confederation, which has been working with us to advocate protection, without falling into the trap of national narrow-mindedness.
The solution is not to reject, but to reshape.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to say that this is not about the East against the West, because I come from the West and I am all in favour of the Services Directive.
We should not lose sight of the directiveâs objective, which is to break down unnecessary barriers for small and medium-sized companies, enabling them to offer their services in other countries.
With a watered-down directive as proposed by the Socialists and some members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we are at risk of battening up the markets even more.
Whilst we should protect valuable social achievements, we should not indulge in protectionism, nationalism and certainly not xenophobia.
In the global economy, it is important to strengthen the European market, rather than fragment and weaken it.
The services market offers marvellous opportunities to many, and innovative and quality jobs can be created in the services sector.
The debate reeks of hypocrisy, for, while the old Member States in the West fear competition from the East, they forget that Western undertakings have been doing business in Eastern Europe for the past 15 years, and have been doing very well out of it.
The directive must be adopted with the widest possible scope, which means that services of general interest or services of general economic interest â and it is perhaps time we defined those terms â that are currently on offer should fall within its scope without further ado, just like health care, temporary employment agencies and gambling.
The country-of-origin principle, even if we change its name, should simply be left alone.
I will vote for this directive only if it results in more free movement of services.
A compromise that intends to batten up the markets even more will not receive my vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, this is a huge step for the EU and a small step for free trade.
Whether or not it is a step forward will depend on the vote on Thursday.
There are too many exemptions, and the principle must not be unduly weakened.
It is important for small companies, and it is especially important for small countries.
Without added value, the compromise will be worthless.
The Commission therefore has a special responsibility in the ongoing work.
EU protectionism that hides itself behind social policy or consumer protection is preposterous.
Allow me to give two examples.
Anyone wanting to build 25 identical private houses in Germany has to submit 25 plans to the authorities for approval and pay 25 times over, in spite of the fact that it is exactly the same house that is to be built.
Is that sensible?
No, it is expensive for the consumer and it is absurd.
If a group of Swedish tourists goes on holiday to Greece accompanied by a diving instructor, the person concerned must actually be able to speak Greek.
Otherwise, he is not allowed to work with, and talk to, a Swedish group in Greece, in spite of the fact that none of the group speaks any Greek.
That really is idiotic.
We therefore need better rules for the cross-border trade in services.
We can improve this compromise on Thursday by reducing the number of exemptions and also including private health care.
We should, then, carry through what the Austrian Presidency says it is seeking, namely an ambitious Services Directive that contributes to increased prosperity for us all.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on services in the internal market could be made beneficial, if you were to centre the debate on the harmonisation of employment arrangements, with the objective of their maximum possible improvement and the convergence of economic structures and technological capabilities.
However, this specific proposal for a directive, on the pretext of institutional deficits and emergent malfunctions, is trying to impose a strategy alien to social interests, which aims to further strengthen capital and reverse the working-class achievements.
European socialists are engaging in an historic battle.
Any attempts to find compromises for a better legislative text will fall wide of the mark, given that, if we take account of the recent circumstances, there is no reason to believe that a pro-worker or development regulatory framework will be achieved which will safeguard the Union's social model.
The principle of the country of origin is the principle that will ultimately be applied, given that the Article 16 at issue, which constitutes the essence and the basic weapon of the directive, does not radically amend it and services of general economic interest are not in essence exempted from the scope of the directive.
At a time when it is assumed that we want to get closer to the citizens, by trying to simplify Community law, we are being called on to adopt a text with very serious ambiguities and contradictions, a text which, in trying to please everyone, does not clarify crucial matters which ultimately the courts will inevitably have to clarify.
There is too little time for further technical analysis, but the essence is that the economic liberalism which informs the entire text is not a one-way street.
Â Â  Mr President, so much has been said today, but my hope is that whatever form of compromise we vote on Thursday, it will represent a step forward.
I hope that it will underline and take forward the long-standing basic Treaty freedom to provide services, and that at last we will make this existing freedom more of a reality than it has been to date.
However, let us learn one clear lesson for the future from all of this: a matter of such importance deserves thorough and long-standing preparation, particularly preparation of Europeâs public â the citizens we seek to represent and who in large number we seem to have managed to antagonise over this proposal.
Compare this with 1992: the years of preparation, the number of separate pieces of legislation, the final and general excitement to welcome the free market in goods.
Contrast that with this present method: one far-reaching proposal for a directive literally dumped on the table at the end of the last mandate.
This cannot be the way to do things.
I hope indeed that we will learn the lesson for the future about communicating Europe. '
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are today debating one of the most significant legislative acts for the future of Europe.
It may well lead to a new dimension for the Union, but it will be one in line with the founding fathersâ original vision.
The criticisms voiced by certain opponents of this directive are only loosely related to its draft.
In fact, they are an effort to call a halt to the economic integration of Europe on the basis of four fundamental freedoms.
We cannot go along with hypocrisy and calls for the restrictions on enterprisesâ freedom to provide services and for restrictions on consumersâ freedom to access these services, all under the pretext of protecting national sovereignty.
Neither can we go along with the proposal to take yet another step backwards from the current legal situation, and the jurisprudence of the Court this year, by limiting the scope of application of the directive and continuing to allow national administrations complete freedom to impose new barriers and retain existing ones.
We are also concerned that, in certain Member States, the debate has centred on the Polish plumber and on the Latvian or Portuguese construction worker, whilst genuinely discriminatory administrative barriers are actually the most serious problem.
The single internal market is still plagued by divisions between the old Europe and the new Europe.
Many Member States implement discriminatory practices with regard to service providers from other Member States.
This tendency has become even more marked since the enlargement of the Union.
The result of the discriminatory restrictions affecting the cross-border flow of services is that small and medium-sized enterprises are missing opportunities to develop and create jobs.
Europe needs a sound Services Directive with a wide scope of application, a strong ArticleÂ 16 and indeed ArticlesÂ 24 andÂ 25.
Such a directive would only remove administrative barriers and would not impact on the Directive concerning the posting of workers, contrary to what everyone is being led to believe.
Europe needs a Services Directive that will ensure the provisions of the Lisbon Strategy do not simply remain on paper.
A clear and unambiguous text is required if we are to achieve this aim.
Thanks to Parliamentâs work, parts of the text that were unclear have been improved, but we must not create new difficulties as we vote on the draft.
The original sense and purpose of the directive must not be sacrificed in the interests of what are often far-reaching compromises.
Protectionism does not create jobs.
Protectionism is an evil short-sighted instrument with which to defend workersâ rights.
It is a manifestation of the national bureaucraciesâ lack of political ability to face up to the challenges of the real economic and political world.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, Mrs Van Lancker and their shadows in the other groups for the excellent work they have done in seeking to strengthen the services directive.
It is obvious to most people in this House that a race to the bottom in any area will not win the allegiance, or indeed build the confidence of European citizens in the European project.
I had hoped that Commissioner McCreevy here today would have demonstrated that he had understood that message, but unfortunately his remarks with regard to services of general economic interest do not encourage me to believe that he has.
To those who want to vote symbolically against Bolkestein for domestic reasons, I say fine.
But then please support the broad progressive majority in this Parliament to deliver a âde-Bolkesteinedâ directive by supporting the key compromise amendments which have been painstakingly negotiated.
This House will be abdicating its responsibility by refusing to adopt the amended directive now on offer and leaving our services market, our labour rights, our consumer rights and our environmental rights in this area to the uncertainty of case-by-case decisions of the European Court of Justice.
It is not elected to make law â we are.
Finally, to Mrs de BrÃºn, who has now left this House, I would say that if she wants to prevent an Irish Ferries-style race to the bottom in the services area, then she should, as an obligation, vote for the amendments that she will be offered here tomorrow, as a first step â not as the only step, but as a first step â to prevent what she fears.
Â Â  â In my opinion, the Services Directive is the most important document, which the European Parliament will adopt during this term.
Why?
Because it is a unique indicator of changes in European thinking.
We will see if Europe is ready to establish the internal market, ready to liberalise it and legitimise the fundamental provision of the European Union.
It is a pity that the declarations of the Lisbon Goals still fail to be matched with real actions.
Fear of change, competition and fear of voter pressure still have an effect on the actions of politicians.
There is no need to threaten people with the destruction of a social model; we must talk to them about reality and the changes that are necessary if Europe is to be competitive.
Sooner or later we will liberalise the market, but a delay may be disastrous.
And social welfare in the European Union is like water in connected flasks.
At the moment, social welfare is available only across the entire European Economic Area.
Compromises are possible and necessary to a certain degree.
I believe that the country of origin principle should remain in essence.
We really must trust one another.
Â Â  â The European Parliament has seldom been as much in the spotlight as now, when it is poised to decide on this important Directive.
The result of our vote is being awaited by the European Commission, the Council, small and medium-size enterprises and labour unions.
This is aÂ gratifying outcome of democracy and an acknowledgement of those that represent Europeâs citizens.
However, it requires a good measure of responsibility.
We are about to decide on a Services Directive that represents a new lease of life and a new dynamism for the revised Lisbon Strategy.
The Services Directive will directly benefit small and medium-size enterprises, primarily by simplifying and facilitating the provision of services in other Member States.
Complete services market liberalisation is particularly important to the new Member States.
IÂ am therefore in favour of the articles on worker assignment being reinstated in the Directive.
I would like to praise the work of the shadow rapporteur, Mr Malcolm Harbour, who has managed, on the basis of an agreement between right-wing and liberal factions, to maintain the country-of-origin principle, and also called âthe freedom to provide servicesâ, while the Member States may turn down a service provider for reasons of health protection and environmental conservation.
However, I have a problem with the compromise amendment that includes, in particular, the possibility of registering a reservation for reasons of consumer protection or social policy, as this enables the authorities in the country of destination to block access to a service provider from another Member State at any time, and thereby negates the country-of-origin principle.
It seems to me that the public discourse on this Directive has focused too much on criticism of the country-of-origin principle.
Very little has been written up to now about the substantive benefits of the Directive, which simplifies administrative cooperation, and establishes single point of contact or a standard form available in electronic format.
In conclusion, allow me to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Evelyn Gebhard, for her hard work in drafting the report.
Â Â  Mr President, since the compromise that is before us is in the spirit of the best Dutch tradition of combining open markets with a reasonable level of social protection, it enjoys the full support of my delegation.
Our Economic Affairs Minister recently said that his main concern was that there were so many exceptions in the directive.
I cannot share his concern and would like to explain why some of those exceptions are very valid to my mind.
First of all, with regard to the exclusion of health care and other sectors that are governed by an excessive number of compelling reasons of general interest, those are sectors which I think are better off being regulated on an individual basis, and it is also necessary that a horizontal framework directive be adopted for services of general interest, which clearly spells out the powers of non-central authorities, with a view to imposing rules on sectors of this kind for reasons of general interest.
Another sector I should like to touch upon is that of temporary employment.
As you know, we reached a marvellous compromise on this very subject in this House four years ago, one that enjoyed broad support from us but has since been with the Council, frozen, for a long time.
For the temporary employment sector too, the directive we came up with then and which struck a balance between protection and opening up markets, was a much better basis for imposing European legislation on the relevant sector with more accuracy and care, and I should like to ask Mr McCreevy to deliver on his commitment and to create legislation in the areas of health care and temporary employment that is different from this directiveâs.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, there has been much talk this evening about the need to open up the services market in the European Union and also the need to remove obstacles to the achievement, or implementation, of some of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
To this end, this services directive is not just a necessary instrument but also an essential one.
What requirements should this directive, this text, have in order to fulfil the role we have set for it, however?
In my view, firstly, it should set some clear criteria, which provide everybody with legal security, both consumers and entrepreneurs and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses, which make up the majority â some 80 or 90% â of the European Unionâs business fabric.
And furthermore, this text - which should offer legal certainty and, I repeat, be clear - needs to be applied to all of the countries of the European Union.
I must say that, in my opinion, the text approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection met these requirements.
I have to say, however, that, at this point, I have my doubts as to whether the compromise texts that have been agreed meet the requirements of clarity and legal certainty.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to make a brief observation.
This evening, some people have tried to set two models for Europe against each other.
Those who claim to defend the European social model â and who set themselves up as its only defenders â want to set their position against that of those of us who advocate the need for competition and competitiveness.
I would like to say that the best kind of social policy is one that generates economic growth and creates jobs.
I would like to say that the only possible danger to the European social model is a European Union without economic growth, clinging to old prejudices and incapable of competing with other economies, because, if we do not grow, it will be impossible to maintain our social policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union is based on four fundamental freedoms.
These are the freedom of movement of goods, capital, the workforce and services.
These pillars of the European Community were agreed back in 1958 because even then it was already clear that they were the of the genuine integration of Europe.
Several decades have gone by but there is still no free movement of services in Europe. The main reason for this situation is the weakness of the political class.
Politicians have been either unable or unwilling to explain to the citizens that the freedom to provide services results in new jobs and faster economic growth.
Instead of clarifying the meaning of the enlargement of the European Union and highlighting the opportunity offered by competition, politicians have opted to alarm the voters with the spectres of social dumping, the so-called Frankenstein Directive and the notorious Polish plumber.
This is the background to todayâs debate on the Services Directive in this House.
The adoption of the directive will make life easier for consumers and entrepreneurs, accelerate economic growth and create 600Â 000 new jobs in Europe.
Unfortunately, the directive is under increasing attack from those of a populist and protectionist persuasion.
We have heard time and again that opening up the services market will result in social dumping and poorer working conditions, but these views are totally unfounded.
A compromise is still possible, however.
I would remind the House that issues relating to employment and labour law have been removed from the scope of the directive, which should allay the fears expressed by the Trade Unions.
Services of public interest have also been excluded.
I believe that this will ensure a balance between the need for competitiveness and the need to protect labour rights.
I therefore appeal to the European Parliament to adopt the directive as it now stands.
It will allow competition to be strengthened and the labour markets to be opened up.
It will also make life easier for consumers and businesses.
Â Â  Mr President, I have two pieces of bad news, two pieces of good news and one recommendation.
The first piece of bad news is that I am rather saddened by the debating atmosphere that we have in Europe today.
It is one of protectionism, nationalism, near-racism and xenophobia.
To me, as a pro-European and as a federalist, protectionism is anti-European.
My second piece of bad news concerns the Commission.
I am a big fan of the Commission.
I always support it.
However, Mr McCreevy, trust me: do not have your office call upon me to water down the Services Directive.
It is your job to defend the Services Directive, not to defend protectionism.
Your office wanted to make this into not the freedom to provide services, but into the freedom to prevent services.
Please let that be the last time!
The good news is, first, that I believe we will have a compromise tomorrow.
I believe we will move forward.
We need this directive.
The second piece of good news is that we might get a broad majority in the European Parliament.
I hope that the Austrian Presidency can get a broad majority in the Council.
My final point is a recommendation: my modest recommendation is to approve the compromise on ArticleÂ 16 as it stands between the PSE and the PPE-DE Groups, as long as we get three things into the directive: firstly, health services; secondly, temporary working agencies; thirdly, posting of workers.
Those are essential.
I believe that the way in which this debate has gone is very unfair.
We see it as a case of old versus new. It is not.
It is about protectionism and liberal markets.
I am afraid that some of us are losing it.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that Mrs Wallis hit the nail on the head when she said that the Commission has worked badly on this issue.
At the end of the last legislature, they suddenly presented us with a piece of legislation equivalent to the entire package that Delors had prepared for the liberalisation of goods between 1988 and 1992.
Furthermore, this proposed directive from the Commission does not even deal with the liberalisation of services, because the central issue is the liberalisation of the labour market.
That is to say, Article 16, in relation to the principle of country of origin, is not going to liberalise services; its intention is to liberalise the labour market, because there are certain concessions made by the then Commissioner that run counter to social protection, environmental protection and consumer protection.
This Parliament has therefore had great difficulty: it has taken us two years of work.
The main rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, has worked extremely hard, as have the shadow rapporteurs, including Mrs Van Lancker.
I believe, however, that Parliament is currently on the point of presenting a genuine directive on the liberalisation of services.
It must not be mixed up with the labour issue, which is causing so much argument at the moment.
The proposed services directive, which I believe will be approved on Thursday as a result of the agreement between the two big political groups, is now going to enable services to be liberalised, in accordance with normal procedures.
We must remember that we already have areas in which services have been liberalised. Services have been liberalised in relation to transport, communications, audiovisual transmissions and professional activities.
We must continue along this route.
If this directive is approved by the Council â and, as Mr Stubb said, I hope that the Commission will approve the European Parliament's proposals â it will actually enable services to be liberalised.
Furthermore, one of the amendments introduced calls upon the Commission, in agreement with social actors, to present concrete proposals for the liberalisation of services within five years.
If the Commission approves Parliamentâs amendments, the Council could agree to it and we could see the beginning of a genuine liberalisation of services.
Â Â  â Mr President, I personally had many reservations about the initial text which the European Commission presented two years ago.
Nonetheless, any reservations which anyone had are no longer very important, because this text has been amended a great deal by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament and I think that it will be amended even more by plenary the day after tomorrow.
The Commission first presented a text with a great many exaggerations and a great deal that missed the mark and, in this way, did injustice to the idea of completing the internal market in the European Union.
In other words, it did not seek in the right way to overcome any administrative and legislative obstacles in order to facilitate investments in this sector.
A correct objective was wronged by the policy, mainly the communications policy, of the European Commission. This provoked reactions from various social groups, whereas the OECD maintains that a rational opening-up of services in the Member States could create 2Â 500Â 000 new jobs and increasing European GDP accordingly by 1.8%.
The Committee on the Internal Market has made material interventions both in the scope of the directive and in workers' rights and I think that the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, improve the text of the directive still further, address certain problems with the initial country of origin and create the preconditions for broad social and parliamentary consent.
The objective of the majority of MEPs, of all the Member States and of the European trades union is not to reject any form of directive on services, but to have a better directive on services and I think that, all together, we shall achieve that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the work of our rapporteur, MrsÂ Gebhardt, who has, in actual fact, succeeded in completely rewriting the text.
How should I go about telling you, MrÂ Barroso, that Europeans have had enough of this Europe of social dumping?
Using language related to the country of origin principle, perhaps?
Despite some important advances such as the preservation of the Posting of Workers Directive and the exclusion of health care and services of general interest, I regret that SGEIs and social services are still not excluded.
I refuse to see these public service tasks made subject to the rules of the competitive market.
Similarly, it would be very useful to have labour law excluded from Article 2 so as not to cause a dangerous dispute.
Even if, in the end, the country of origin principle is no longer mentioned, the proposed compromise will hand over the actual power of the legislator to the Community judge, who will decide the direction in which European social policy is steered.
Applying the country of destination principle to the exercise of service activities and the country of origin principle only to the right of access would have been preferable.
As for those who falsely claimed that voting against the draft European Constitution meant the death of the Bolkestein Directive, the current situation shows them that, on the contrary, this directive is still very much alive and that it requires us to be extremely vigilant and to keep on fighting.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are addressing a topic that is important for truly creating the internal market.
I was the rapporteur for the directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, on which some 800 amendments were tabled, and for the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, on which some 600 amendments were tabled.
In both cases I worked with MrÂ Harbour and MrsÂ Gebhardt, as well as many others.
The results we achieved enjoyed such broad support that last May the latter directive was adopted unanimously by both Parliament and the Council, with just two Member States abstaining.
I should once again like to thank both colleagues.
The principles behind the two directives are analogous to the principles that should be inspiring the services directive, and their aims are the same.
Unfortunately, the Prodi Commissionâs proposal incorporated neither the reasoning nor the content that made Parliament have to rewrite the two directives, just as today we are being forced to rewrite the directive we are examining.
We all want the market to be opened up for work as well as for goods and money, but we believe that that should be done once again by harmonising the national systems themselves and not by overturning everything.
The five-year-maximum revision clause allows for gradual transitions.
We want this directive without trauma or ideological clashes, and so we are hoping for a cautious approach with common-sense political solutions.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already stated a position that I share and, from my personal experience in this field, I do not appreciate those who, rather than seek a compromise, want to reject the whole idea, thus going against the Treaties.
On the other hand, I do appreciate the compromises that have been reached, and I hope that this directive too will enjoy a large majority.
Lastly, I should like to thank MrsÂ Gebhardt again for the work she has done.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a crucial debate for Europeâs future, which resonates in the economic, social and political spheres.
The compromise solution obtained between the main political groups strikes me as a well-balanced one.
It is vital that the application of the country of origin principle, temporary work in the areas of health, other social areas, services of general interest, and lotteries be removed.
It is also vital that the criteria relating to the services of general interest be made abundantly clear, completely removed or set out by each individual Member State.
As in this compromise, I naturally wish to highlight the importance of not interfering with the directive on the posting of workers.
Ladies and gentlemen, whilst it is necessary to press ahead with building the internal market, it is no less important to guarantee fair competition in all Member States, not by fomenting social inequality, and certainly not by distorting labour markets or by dismantling labour relations, but by cutting through red tape and by breaking down unjustifiable technical barriers.
Although this process of establishing the internal market in services is very important for Europeâs economic development, the rules ensuring European social cohesion must be complied with.
If this did not happen with the initial version of the directive, we can now, as Members of this House, adopt a text that will make a balanced and lucid contribution to the creation of a genuine European market in services that will, at the same time, guarantee social cohesion.
To this end, clarity and courage are of the essence.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall begin by saying that I am going to vote in favour of the compromise, that I much prefer the compromise to the original directive, and that I shall focus on a single issue: the reimbursement of costs generated by a citizen from one Member State for services they have received in another Member State.
If the President will allow me to employ the case method, I shall use the example of the Valencian Community, although I could be referring to any other region, an Italian region for example.
We receive more tourists every day; every day more European citizens acquire a second home there; every day we receive more citizens who come to be treated in our Valencian Community, exclusively, given the quality of its medical services.
This pressure poses a threat to the health services.
This financial pressure is difficult for us to endure.
On numerous occasions, the Court of Justice has acknowledged that, pursuant to Articles 49 and 50 of the EC Treaty and the regulations implementing them, the Member State providing medical services has the right to be reimbursed by the State of the citizen being treated.
But in practice the reality is that this right is not respected, that this right is a purely rhetorical statement.
The Commission has taken the view that this Directive is a good instrument for making this right a reality, and this view is enshrined in Article 23.
At the moment, I do not know what the situation is with Article 23 or the amendments intended to remove it.
I shall simply express my desire that this article be retained as drawn up by the Commission.
I would call upon the Commissioner not to restrict himself to making a formal statement promising once again that the problem will be resolved.
We want this article to be approved as it is, and that is how I shall vote.
Â Â  Mr President, there are those who think that we have given misleading information about the directive.
Today, I am delighted that, with the amendments, we have made sweeping changes to the Bolkestein directive.
I wonder, though, whether, with this amended document, we are providing for legal certainty.
Along with many others, I fear that we are not.
Commissioner McCreevy, you would be able to win us over if you said to us today that the services of general economic interest are best kept outside of the scope of this directive, but you have stated the opposite.
You do not breathe a word about a framework directive on services of general interest.
In conclusion, in our final verdict, we will take into consideration the fact that the directive that is before us is anything but harmonised â quite the reverse, in fact.
A decision has been made in favour of legislation on the basis of the differences between the 25 Member States, and I do not consider that to be the right way to go about the integration of markets.
Â Â  Some say that a watered-down directive is still better than nothing.
However, this is not true, because there is a limit beyond which we are no longer helping the free provision of services, but creating further obstacles in its way.
Unfortunately, a few amendment proposals submitted last week are doing just this.
If we vote for them, we will destroy the essence of this proposal.
We have a lot to lose, because in the past decades the European Court of Justice has repeatedly protected the rights of service providers against restricting attempts made by Member States.
If we now accept a directive full of new obstacles that are conflicting with the spirit and letter of the founding Treaties of the European Union, we cannot hope that the Lisbon Programme, intending to create jobs and new European growth, would be successful, because we would actually restrict this market for another 30 years.
The new Member States have already opened their capital and goods markets a few years ago.
This was not an easy decision.
We, too, could have said that our economies were too weak and unfit for competition.
This is why many of us, MEPs from new Member States, are shocked to see that now, when we should be jointly opening the services market, several old Member States with a strong economy are hesitating.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now your turn.
Will you stand by one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union, or not?
A strong Services Directive would be good for small and medium enterprises, it would be good for old and new Member States, and it would be good for all the citizens of Europe.
Fellow Members, let us wipe out from the draft all endeavours restricting a free services market!
We, Hungarians, can only support a directive that does more than preserving the Treaty of Rome principle concerning free services in name only.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive we are debating will doubtless be remembered for the tortuous and difficult path it has followed.
The directive has been openly and strongly criticised right from the start.
It is no coincidence that even today a large European trade union demonstration has been vehemently pointing out that, for the sake of the European labour market, Europe needs to have a services directive that completes the internal market without damaging social cohesion.
We in Parliament have been working along these lines in order to contribute to development and growth in the important services sector in Europe, without ever losing sight of the social dimension that Europe must have and the need not to put off the harmonisation process indefinitely.
The amendments that have been introduced and the compromise we have reached to a great extent address the questions and demands that have been raised concerning both working rights and the so-called country-of-origin principle.
There are still some unresolved issues, however, including services of general economic interest, which I hope will find a solution during the final vote, on the basis of the amendments that have been tabled.
I definitely think that some good work has been done so far, thanks in part to MrsÂ Gebhardt.
We have not shrunk from confronting the issues, but rather we have helped to identify a number of possible solutions and we intend to remain committed even after the vote at first reading.
Â Â  MrÂ President, following talks with the staff and managers of two dozen small and medium-sized enterprises in Hesse alone, and with representatives of trade unions and employers, things looked gloomy, to be quite honest, for an acceptable Services Directive.
In the wake of the one-sided Bolkestein approach, the compromise now reached strikes the right balance between removing obstacles and national barriers in the internal market and the need for social cohesion.
Services of general interest should not be liberalised, and nor should any public companies be privatised.
Nor will competition law or state aid rules be restricted.
Fears that it would result in social and wage dumping are no longer justified.
The new principle of free movement of services provides that the countries in which the services are provided can insist that their national regulations are complied with, and that compliance monitored.
That applies to guarantees of public safety and order and to environmental and health protection.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs gave the process of greater cooperation added impetus, and that is important.
We think it is important that industrial safety must not be put at risk and that existing arrangements from tariff agreements must be upheld.
The Posting Directive has priority, which means that the construction sector and other sensitive sectors in the Member States can be protected, and minimum wages can be maintained.
In order to prevent business from simply registering a PO Box address in another Member State, a consumer-friendly regulation has been laid down: a branch office will only be recognised if it can be demonstrated to have appropriate infrastructure and a permanent presence.
Many of the slogans at today's demonstration were not up-to-date.
People are entitled to protest in public, but they have greater credibility if the content of their protests is accurate.
The public, the Commission and the Council are awaiting the decision of this Parliament, and there is an awareness everywhere of how important this House really is.
The inter-group compromise is the right way to go.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been consistent in its basic intention both to give the internal market a new dynamism â with Lisbon as the watchword â and to maintain social standards.
Â Â  Mr President, it is better to accept the proposed compromise than reject it.
In any case, this is the starting point for a single, viable labour market.
As legislators, we have to aspire to accuracy and precision.
Every vague paragraph in a directive is a potential case for the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
When reading the proposal, one has the feeling that the more highly educated or qualified someone is, the more likely his or her field is to fall outside the scope of the directive and be protected from genuine competition.
Europe needs economic growth.
Growth is achieved by increasing work or raising production.
We cannot oppose social dumping by preventing human mobility, but rather by creating a cross-border system in which anyone who commissions services is responsible for complying with the terms and conditions of employment.
How can we think of competing with China or India if we cannot rid our membership area of needless barriers to competition?
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union is constantly seeking stimuli for development, to help create a Union capable of rising to the challenges of the third millenium.
This directive was supposed to make the European Union stronger at global level and better able to compete with other economies the world over.
The fact that we are now a Community of 25Â countries and not of 15 seems to have been overlooked.
Members of this House are increasingly of the opinion that it is the new Member States that are competing against the Union, not China or the USA.
The European Union seems to be afraid of itself.
The old Member States that joined forces against this directive have caused a recrudescence of combative jargon.
The division between the old and new Union is becoming ever more marked.
Once again, the Member States are being divided into better and worse countries.
The rich countries support a short-sighted policy based on fear, not on rational indications.
Paradoxically, the rich countries that hitherto presented themselves as the strongest advocates of integration are the ones resisting the full implementation of the provisions of the Treaties.
They are spreading alarm through references to social dumping from the new Member States and to possible threats to the European social model.
I believe that the new Member States will manage.
Economic growth in the eurozone is practically nil, and the economy is developing slowly.
Resistance to opening up the services market fully carries with it the risk of losing a key stimulus that would accelerate the Unionâs economic growth and create new jobs.
To date, the new Member States have been described as moaners.
In the two-speed Europe that is now emerging, they must, however, develop ways of responding swiftly to the tactical coalitions against them that are arising more and more frequently.
The original draft of the directive represented a new opportunity for the European Union of 25Â Member States.
As it now stands, having lost the articles banning discrimination against firms providing services abroad and the country of origin principle, it is gradually losing its meaning and transparency.
Â Â  Mr President, I come from a new Member State. I support the compromise; to do otherwise would be socially and politically myopic.
The way in which the majority in Parliament seems to have converged in order to drastically rethink the Services Directive shows the relevance of this institution.
We are converting a proposal that could have had disastrous effects on our societies â especially on those most in need â into a much more sensible one.
We are still not fully satisfied; we want public services to be clearly excluded and we want clearer safeguards on other sectors.
Nevertheless we must admit that we have a much more realistic piece of legislation in front of us.
We are renewing our agreement with the principle of freedom of movement of services and facilitating it, but we are agreeing that social rights come first.
After our rejection of the Port Services Directive, for the second time in a relatively short period we are showing our commitment to a social Europe.
I believe that Mr Whitehead would have been proud of Mrs Gebhardt and the rest of us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the stage we are at with this matter this evening, I am aware that it is politically improper to oppose a compromise painstakingly drafted by leaders of two political groups.
Each architect of this compromise is claiming victory, which makes me uneasy because I do not like being taken for a fool.
My colleagues swear to me that the country of origin principle is implicit in the compromise text.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament boast that they have nipped it in the bud.
I, like others, regard the country of origin principle and the history of European integration as being intimately connected.
Dogmatically rejecting this connection means going against what we are patiently building and means introducing the principle of widespread suspicion.
Of course, this principle would be unable to prevail over all the others because we have controlled and managed it.
We made it clear that the legislation of the country of destination applies to all aspects related to the social sphere.
Continuing to talk about an attack on social standards is therefore exceptionally misleading.
We are told not to mix up commercial and non-commercial services.
Yet, on this point too, we did mix things up and we ended up toning down the directive, which now includes so many derogations that it would be better to define what it does actually apply to, and not the other way round.
The bottom line is that the rules of the country of destination relating to the posting of workers have never been the subject of dispute.
So, what more do people want?
To go back on the of the Treaty of Rome?
The compromise on Article 16 hardly confirms these .
This is by no means progress!
I believe that, in these conditions, rather than picking apart a directive until there is nothing left of it, it would be much better to stick to the version of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
MrÂ President, I am not willing to swallow just anything in order to reach a solution that, on the pretext of defending social standards, actually defends protectionist standards, and I will vote accordingly.
Â Â  An hour ago, this House heard that trade unionists only from the old Member States were demonstrating in Strasbourg against the Directive.
In fact, they were also joined by colleagues from the new Member States, and those who listened to them carefully saw that they were not at all opposed to the Directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, you remember very well how we recently rejected by aÂ large majority aÂ proposal agreed upon by the Council when approving the Financial Perspective for 2007â2013.
At the time, our preference was for European interests over specific self-interests.
We were able to unite ourselves in the interest of the entire European Union.
I was proud that we had resisted attempts to influence us and that we managed to find agreement in the European Parliament.
A compromise is very important for a fundamental document such as the Services Directive.
IÂ think that the rapporteur has done aÂ very good job.
In my opinion, we have achieved a number of acceptable compromises.
Therefore, I believe that we should vote for what represents a âwin-winâ situation in support of Europe, offering the best solution for both the old and the new Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, having listened to the debate here in plenary, there is good reason for recalling why we need a Services Directive and why we are working to obtain a more open trade in services.
It is because we are all basically agreed that an increased trade in services will provide more jobs, more new companies, increased growth and greater competitiveness.
On the basis of the debate in this Chamber, it would seem, however, as if many have forgotten this.
Free trade in services is something positive, not negative.
Unfortunately, the opponents of the directive have succeeded in cutting it back. This means that we shall obtain less competitiveness than we might otherwise have had.
It means fewer new jobs and fewer new companies.
It is not what Europeans expect.
Together with other Conservatives, I shall support the compromise, not because it is what we are looking for but because it is a step in the right direction.
I wish, however, to emphasise that I do not accept the picture presented, in terms of which we are concerned here with a conflict between East and West and between new and old Member States.
What we have instead is a division between those who want to see the trade in services produce further European integration and cooperation, borders that are more open and a greater number of new jobs, and those who take a different view.
We shall make efforts to have private health care added to the directive, to have the Posting Directive made clearly and unambiguously open to all and to prevent any discrimination against the people of any country.
We shall also endeavour to make it possible to have temporary agencies included in the area covered by the directive.
I want to say the following to the Commission: this is a first step, and you have a responsibility to ensure that we take more steps in the direction set out by the Treaty.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am taking the floor to explain why I shall vote for this directive, together with the rest of my delegation.
We are certain that it represents the beginning of the way ahead and a step forwards in strengthening the idea of completing the internal market.
From that point of view, mine is a safe vote.
I should like, however, to comment on what has been happening within the political groups over the last year and a half, and above all in the last few weeks, as well as this afternoon and evening here in this Chamber.
It demonstrates â and I want to be perfectly clear about this â that effectively there is a difference within the 25 Member States.
It is the difference between those who believe that we can achieve growth and development by taking a gamble and investing in what is new, in innovation, flexibility, the possibility of working in a freer, more open market and, above all, in a market of almost 500 million people, and those who instead believe that what they have achieved so far can best be defended by closing in on themselves.
That has been the real conflict.
That is why I hope that the close of this debate will also see an end to the argument based on a division between old and new countries, because there has never been such a division.
Instead, there has been a different division, which has led to a directive which, in my view, is only a first step.
Nonetheless, I shall vote for it with conviction, because I consider that even a small step forwards is, in any case, important.
Â Â  Mr President, it is rather ironic that we should be debating the Services Directive on Valentineâs Day, because, for the Services Directive â but certainly also for Mr Bolkestein â this must surely be a case of unrequited love.
Last month we overwhelmingly rejected the Port Services Directive and, this time round, we could almost have done the same, were it not for the fact that the Commission proposal will be transformed by this House into a compromise â not the best one, perhaps, but one which can still be workable and which, crucially, strikes a balance between our objective of opening up the services market and our intention of addressing the social concerns that are justified.
I stress âjustified concernsâ because we all know by now that this proposal has been plagued by scaremongering.
Coming from a new Member State, this scaremongering seems like dÃ©jÃ  vu.
In my country, opponents of EU membership used to conjure up nightmare scenarios that foreign workers would invade us and take our jobs.
The same Cassandras played the same act in the old Member States too, but now we know that the doomsday scenarios were just not true: they did not materialise, nor will they materialise with the Services Directive.
The opening-up of the services market is good and we should say so loud and clear.
It is good for business â in particular for SMEs â and it is good for jobs.
We have a reasonable compromise. I say âletâs go for itâ.
Â Â  Mr President, it is very late at night for such a serious debate and the Commissioner must be tired.
I should like to make just a few points which might freshen up the debate, or perhaps make you even more tired, Commissioner!
At the beginning of todayâs debate I thought that it might be just an ideological clash between protectionism and an attempt to liberalise the market in services.
I admit that I was a dreamer.
Unfortunately it is more serious than that: the debate over the watered-down directive is beginning to bear the hallmarks of a clash between the new and the old.
We are used to listening to endless speculation about why people in the Member States do not understand the brave new European ideas.
Why should they?
I am a Member of the European Parliament representing the Czech Republic and defending the interests of the Czechs.
The Czech Republic fully liberalised access to its market in the early 1990s.
Many traditional but inefficient companies had to close. That resulted in a higher unemployment rate and heavy political losses.
Is it not fair to expect the same of the old Member States?
Go to any Czech town situated somewhere on the Czech/Austrian border and try to explain to a local service provider that he or she cannot provide their service in the same way as their Austrian competitors â and I stress, â in their Czech town.
I bet you will not succeed.
Try to talk about noble European ideals and say in the same breath that they are not allowed to run their businesses freely wherever they choose.
The idea of opening the internal market was a brave one, but todayâs reality is just the proverbial crying over spilled milk.
I thank the Czech interpreters for their valiant work.
Â Â  Mr President, it is difficult to make any real contribution to the services directive debate in a two-minute time-slot.
This directive is attempting to achieve a massive amount in one brave step.
That is why the debate has been so robust and why all groups have had Members working on this directive almost full time in recent months.
In this regard, I want to recognise the work of MrÂ Harbour in particular, who has put an enormous amount of effort into bringing the compromise wording this far on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
However, in the intensity of debate on specific amendments, particularly relating to ArticleÂ 16 on the freedom to provide services, let us not lose sight of the overall objective of what we are trying to achieve.
This is the first stage of a process that aims to create a directive that will promote a more open and better-functioning internal market for services.
If adopted in the right form, this directive can facilitate growth, job creation and increased economic activity in the services sector.
The reality is that the EU economy needs a kick-start.
This directive can contribute to that.
