But I think it is interesting to see that the Opposition is, at least, coming together again.
It has been split.
It has been in a resigned mood.
Now there is, at least, a new will to go for elections and perhaps change the situation, at least of the Government.
But of course, as I said before, the screening of the candidates by the Council of Guardians is now under way and is crucial.
As Ms Beer said, if 7 000 candidates can run for 290 seats, too many candidates have already been rejected.
Two thousand of them will have been rejected.
Therefore I strongly hope that an appeals procedure will indeed redress the situation.
The Iranian electorate deserves to be able to choose its representatives from amongst a wide spectrum of parties and opinions.
Of course it is clear that we are not supporting any specific party, but it is important that there is the establishment of a genuine pluralism.
Having said this, I completely agree with all those - and I did not go into all the details - who said that we have to do a lot on the human rights front, even if we cannot go forward with regard to the nuclear issue.
We have, of course, supported all the UN resolutions; Canada has introduced such a resolution.
This has been adopted, clearly showing where Iran - unfortunately - stands today.
I would like to say, to some of the Members of Parliament who have mentioned that we should use the EIDHR instrument, that we are already using it via implementation through the UN, UNICEF and UNODC: for instance in the areas of juvenile justice and young people addicted to drugs, and on the question of justice.
But it becomes more and more complicated in this very rigid atmosphere.
I have been trying to have one diplomat in one Embassy in Tehran, to ensure a smoother coordination of joint projects.
This is, of course, only a small step, but hopefully a meaningful one, which could pave the way, at least a little, for the development of our cooperation.
Unfortunately, however, Iran remains evasive.
Last week, when I personally mentioned this, I did not receive an answer.
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, very briefly as I had the opportunity to answer earlier.
There are not many new questions and, as I have already said, we basically share the views expressed.
Concerning a question put by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, a debate is now taking place in the Security Council, so I do not think I should be elaborating on that.
You asked me what I would like to see.
I would like to see a resolution which is not needed because the dialogue that we are asking for is a reality.
You know which elements have to be put in place in order to have a meaningful dialogue.
Concerning other reflections about enlarging cooperation, there are many other fields in which we can and should cooperate.
Afghanistan and drugs have been mentioned.
This is an important issue on which we would very much like to cooperate.
Other questions have been put about the group of six in the United Nations.
I cannot speak on behalf of anybody. I can speak only on behalf of the six with which I am negotiating.
I have received support from everybody, from all the members of the group, including the European Union - there is no doubt about that - but also the other members of the Security Council who are not members of the European Union.
(FR) In answer to the question from Mrs BÃ©guin on nuclear energy, I do not want to enter into the debate on nuclear energy in general today.
We shall have time to do that when we are talking about energy, but I shall explain to you the clear distinction between nuclear power for electricity generation and nuclear power for other uses, which you have indeed separated.
The fundamental difference is that, in order to generate electricity, nuclear power needs to be enriched by X and the enrichment needed to manufacture weapons of mass destruction is far greater than that.
The second question concerns waste.
It is very important to know what is being done with this.
You know that it contains plutonium and other materials that are usable.
It is also the responsibility of the firms providing the technology to take all the waste.
The situation is therefore quite different from the situation we have in mind when we talk about Iran and the autonomous enrichment process.
In my first speech, I described the Iran that I should like to see. I think that that Iran is both possible and desirable and that Iran is a country we should engage with.
It is a vibrant country that has many intellectual, cultural and other depths, and we should like to see it commit itself to working with us in several areas, including energy, human rights, the Middle East and nuclear energy.
To do that, we need to start a really serious dialogue on all those issues.
Thank you for your attention to this important debate. I shall be happy to come and talk to you about Iran or any other matters whenever I am invited.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 31 January.
Situation in Gaza (debate)
As the next item we have the statements on the situation in Gaza by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission.
EU High Representative for CFSP. - (ES) Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor in this important debate which we are about to begin.
Mr President, we are opening a debate on tragic events which have unfolded over recent weeks and days: the issue of Gaza, the issue of the borders between Gaza and Egypt and the border crossing points between Gaza and Israel.
The outcome witnessed by us in recent days is tragic: there has been a very sharp deterioration in the humanitarian situation and even the security situation has worsened considerably.
I believe that today's debate should be a debate on how we can contribute to resolving problems.
We have had many debates in this Chamber on the problems of the past, and I believe that today we should see if we in the European Union are able to contribute to resolving this major issue (because it will also have an impact on the Annapolis Conference and the peace process).
I would like to point out once again that we, the European Union, have been consistent in calling for the border crossings to be opened and for there to be free movement of people and goods, subject to security guarantees, not only goods for humanitarian aid purposes, but goods which may assist in the economic development of the region, more specifically, the West Bank and Gaza.
If those three basic elements - political development, economic development and changes in the situation on the ground - are lacking, it will be very difficult for us to move forward.
Progress in these three fields must be made and that progress must be made in all three at the same time.
What can we Europeans do?
Since the emergence of this new situation we have been in constant contact with the key players.

As you know, on Sunday there was an important meeting of the Arab League where all the issues were raised and efforts were made to draw up a formula for a solution: a formula which is not too far removed from the one Minister Fayad put to the European Council a number of weeks ago and which he reiterated on Sunday at the Arab League Summit or the Ministerial meeting of the Arab League: a method must be sought of recovering control of the borders so that the Palestinian Authority can have responsibility for them.
If this were to happen then in my opinion the European Union should raise the issue of Rafah again exactly as we did in 2005.
As you know, we do not now have a physical presence there; we are available for deployment as soon as we are called upon but currently have no presence there; we have not been present on the border since Gaza came under the control of Hamas, because we were not given permission to be.
I believe that what we would have to do would be to operate in accordance with the debate in the European Council on Monday and with the Council Resolutions, as I believe that Monday's resolutions are very good and have provided a sense of direction which has been welcomed by all parties: Egypt, the Palestinians and Israel.
Therefore I believe we are on the right road.
What we must do is work out how to ensure that the road we are setting out on in accordance with the Council resolutions can become a reality quickly.
The human suffering being experienced is terrible: so is the human suffering in southern Israel which also comes under fire from rockets launched from northern Gaza, towards their own people, a factor which in point of fact make stability impossible.
If we were to draw up a package covering all these matters, including the liberation of Al-Haram ash-Sharif, which must be included if our aim is to stabilise the situation, we could perhaps work together, and this is something I would very much like to do again, to resolve the situation.
As I said, I am in constant contact with the most important players.
I shall travel to Egypt as soon as the working sessions under way between the Palestinians and Egyptians, which started today, have finished.
Tomorrow or the day after I shall be there so that I can take part too and outline the contribution which we in the European Union would be able to make.
I honestly believe that the best solution would be to return to a more all-round situation in which the Palestinian Authority had control of borders and there was free movement of goods and people; not only for humanitarian aid but also for economic development and trade, which are necessary in order for genuine progress to be made.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are facing a very difficult situation because, as I said at the beginning, everything in the Middle East is bound up with everything else.
If we cannot make progress towards resolving the Gaza issue then the peace process will also be in difficulties.
Therefore there is a great responsibility on our shoulders; please be aware of what is ahead of us, and aware that we, the Commissioner and I, are going to do everything possible to dedicate the time left to us in these few weeks to see if we can help find a solution on behalf of the European Union.
Mr President, I do not have anything much further to add except to express my wish to help achieve that end and to have the support of the Members of this House in achieving it.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think that, when we were in Annapolis, there was a moment of hope.
I always spoke of cautious optimism, knowing how difficult it would be to launch the bilateral negotiations between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, and then we had what I would call a very successful pledging conference in Paris, where we saw so much support that we thought there was now real new momentum.
But at the same time we always knew that this new momentum could derail at any moment.
I think the situation in the Gaza and the large amount of violence that we have seen in January is one of those very difficult situations, among many other things - including the rocket and mortar attacks that have injured the Israeli civilian population - that could make the whole process derail.
Of course, we understand the obligation of the State of Israel to defend its citizens.
The Israeli military reaction has caused many deaths and injuries amongst the Gaza Palestinians.
We have always said that civilian enclosure measures will not be feasible and have always spoken out for freedom of access and movement.
These have taken a heavy toll on the Gaza civilian population.
So it is no wonder that things went excessively far when people broke through the various fences and walls between Egypt and Gaza.
The question now - and I completely support Javier Solana in this - is: what can we do in order to really make a difference again?
We had the EU BAM for Rafah there for a long time, but unfortunately in recent months they have not been able to do anything, so perhaps there is a chance for us Europeans to take this up again and to try to reach some sort of solution.
I think it is good that Javier Solana is going to Egypt to start asking what we can do and perhaps to bring all the different parties together, which is very complicated.
But I think it is also good to see that Salem Fayed has for some time been prepared to bring in the Palestinian Authority in order to control the borders, because this is also important.
In the end, it is their own responsibility.
In order to make that possible, I think that the European Union might again be a facilitating factor.
Maybe we will not even be mediators there but facilitators.
We had the first follow-up meeting in Paris very recently where Bernard Kouchner, the Norwegian Foreign Minister and also Tony Blair met.
I am also one of the co-chairs of this Conference.
We tried to see what could be done on the ground in order to make the situation move forward, not to have only negative experiences.
We all decided to go for the so-called quick start projects - on security infrastructure, on the one hand, and on the other hand, on schools in particular, because this is an area where everybody can see, feel and maybe even smell that there is hope, that we want to instil hope, and that freedom of access and movement is indeed one of the necessary conditions, because otherwise economic development will not be able to take off.
Therefore, we are in full support of this and are now trying to follow up this strategy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, if I had to describe in a single word what we have seen over the last few days on the southern border of the Gaza Strip I would use the word 'despair'.
Two years ago elections were held in Palestine.
Several fellow Members of this Parliament - Mrs De Keyser, Mr McMillan-Scott and others - were present during that electoral process and today, two years later, the Palestine cause is in pieces and the situation is one of desolation, despondency and despair, which proves that consolidating a democracy does not mean only exercising the right to vote but that there must be representative institutions, a legitimate distribution of powers and respect for human rights, beginning with the right to life.
The international community implored Hamas to renounce violence.
They would not do so and for that reason remain on the European Union list of terrorist organisations.
It is obvious that matters have not been conducted well on the other side either: Israel has welcomed the division in the Palestinian cause, has pursued its settlements policy, exercised indiscriminate repression and has also implemented a savage blockade which has achieved nothing apart from bolstering the Hamas organisation.
What can we do?
I believe that Mr Solana has described things perfectly: support the High Representative's efforts, support the approach taken by the Naples Conference through the Quartet and the moderate Arab countries, and above all support a policy in respect of which I believe we should express our appreciation to the Commission and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, namely a policy which places human beings at the heart of European Union action, human beings who have been suffering, in pain, distressed and dying and, in my opinion, have unfortunately been doing so needlessly for a long time in the Middle East.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, all walls eventually collapse: the walls of Jericho, the wall of the Warsaw Ghetto, the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic Wall, the wall of indifference.
The Rafah Wall, with its symbolic significance, is part of this blind urge man has to be free.
What did the people of Gaza do, though, with their newfound freedom?
Did they escape to Egypt?
Did they arm themselves with Kalashnikovs?
No, because unfortunately weapons always reach their destination, without or without a wall.
They went to stock up with emergency goods.
They went to shop, to buy medicines and milk for the babies, which is not available in Gaza.
Mopeds, goats and cattle were hoisted into Rafah by cranes, to the cheers of the crowd.
It was a surreal sight.
After that, everyone went home.
These images say it all: what was previously impossible was suddenly within their grasp, and then they returned to their everyday lives.
We now have a historic responsibility.
The question is no longer who is going to open up the gates of an outdoor prison, but who is going to shut them again, to return the people of Gaza to their slow suffocation.
Since the start of Annapolis, the European Union has lost its touch.
Because of the road map, it handed over control of the peace process to the United States.
Securing the joint presidency of the Conference of Donors in Paris was a real achievement.
Well done!
Europeans have, however, had a mandate for access to Gaza since 2005.
Are we, together with the Egyptians, the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and Israel, going to be able to reopen the dialogue and manage access to the outside world for the Palestinians, or are we on the other hand going to look on as observers of the repression that will inevitably come?
That is the whole issue.
Apart from the task of the EU BAM, this involves the future of Palestinian unity and the peace process, respect for international law and the reputation of the European Union.
On behalf of my group, I want to give Mr Solana a very clear message: for goodness' sake, press ahead!
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as a member of Parliament's delegation to the Palestinian Legislative Council, I have been trying to work out why, when we call for an end to settlement building, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing.
Why, when we call for the removal of the checkpoints, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing.
Why, when we call to an end to the collective punishment of people in Gaza, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing.
So I am really grateful to Marc Otte, the EU Special Representative to the Middle East, who came to a meeting of the delegation yesterday and said that our policy - Europe's policy - is to follow the leadership given by America.
Now, just a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister of Israel said of President Bush, 'He is not doing a single thing that I do not agree to.
He does not support anything that I oppose.
He does not say a thing that he thinks will make life harder for Israel.'
So, American policy is Israeli policy, and we Europeans play follow the leader.
So, no wonder our condemnation of Israeli actions sounds so hollow to Palestinians.
And no wonder it is so lacking in success.
This European approach led to us sponsoring the elections in Palestine two years go, but then refusing to pay heed to the result - undermining our support for democracy across the Middle East.
This approach has led to us calling for the formation of a Palestinian Unity Government - and when a unity government was formed, we refused to talk to the Prime Minister and half the cabinet, and the government collapsed.
This approach has meant that we refuse to talk to representatives of Hamas in Gaza, even though they are the real power in that area.
What lessons from our history have we learnt?
Is it not time that Europe cut the strings that blind us and tie us to this one-sided policy of America and Israel? Is it not time we spoke with independence and acted with vision?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, taking a whole people hostage has been a failure.
It is a lesson from another era that could not work, but the worst part of it is that the situation has become worse, politically and in human terms.
We do therefore have to ask ourselves questions.
The policy of isolating Hamas and thereby isolating Gaza has failed.
Hamas is now more popular than ever.
It is very strange: Mr Solana and the Commissioner said that the Palestinians have to regain control on the borders, but how can the Palestinian Authority regain power in Gaza?
The West Bank is not the borders.
That is one problem.
The other problem is the borders of Gaza.
Besides that, there is an agreement between Egypt and Israel, under which the Egyptians in Sinai are not allowed to be armed.
That is the agreement dating from 20 years ago, from the peace treaty.
Even if the Egyptians wanted to stop terrorists in Sinai, they are therefore not allowed to.
The situation is thus totally crazy and it is true that in this crazy situation we have to assume our responsibilities.
The first responsibility is for the people of Gaza to be able to live and for that we have to negotiate with those holding the administrative power in Gaza.
We cannot say, 'We want to give them food and drink, we want to give them medicines, but we do not want to talk to those who can have the medicines taken to them'.
Secondly, it has to be said that the Palestinians will believe in peace when peace gives them something.
On the West Bank at the moment, there has been no improvement with the borders, or with freedom of movement.
Peace is concrete, not abstract.
The rockets are not going to stop in the current situation, and if Israel is to be secure we therefore have to say to it, 'The blockade is making life impossible for the Palestinians and that is endangering the security of Israel'.
That is the truth.
We also have to say to Mr Bush: 'In any case you will not be there in a few months' time.
So keep quiet and leave the politics to other people who have a better understanding of the situation'.
Whether Israeli policy follows American policy or vice versa, they are a failure and we cannot support them.
It is therefore not enough for the European Union to say 'Press ahead' it needs to say, 'Press ahead in the right direction, talk to those who are in charge, and talk to the Israeli leaders'. It needs to say that our solidarity with Israel does not mean that we shall go on supporting it in a totally suicidal policy.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, the heroes of Gaza have once again proven that no fortified wall can imprison the free spirit of humanity and no form of violence can subdue life.
I am quoting from the speech made at the gates of Gaza last Saturday by the Israeli peace campaigner and Sakharov prizewinner Nurit Peled, who was there with other Palestinian and Israeli demonstrators.
It is impossible not to sympathise with the emotion felt by this Mother Courage at the sight of these people, oppressed and humiliated to an intolerable degree, forcing their way through the blockade imposed by Israel and finally breathing fresh air, with time to find milk for the children, food for the family and a little happiness to bolster their morale.
What happens now?
We can all see the dual threat that is looming from the Israeli leaders.
Firstly, the intention to use force to close off this small free space, or have it closed off again.
The second, more general, threat is to get rid of the responsibility of the occupying power for Gaza and hand it over to Egypt.
If the true words of the Council statement of 28 January are to have any real import, the European Union must agree to put more pressure on the Israeli authorities than the usual tortuous circumlocutions, directly and in the Quartet, to accept the principle of the transit points being opened up permanently, under the responsibility of the Palestinian authority and with the support of the European Union and the Arab League.
If the Palestinian Authority continues to be deprived of any possibility of offering its people the slightest hope for the future and working towards the national Palestinian reconciliation that is needed, that would be to accept the worst possible scenario.
I am afraid we are headed that way fast at the moment.
We all know that an impetus is needed from the international community on Gaza and on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
That impetus will not come from a worn-out and discredited American president.
It is up to Europe to act.
Mr President, Gaza remains a human tragedy, and none of us in this House can blame its long-suffering Palestinian citizens from rushing through the Rafah border-crossing breech in the wall to buy goods in Egypt.
Nevertheless, EU-banned terrorist organisation Hamas remains in brutal control of the territory and of the citizens of Gaza, and Hamas has continued the indiscriminate war crime, in my view, of launching Qassam rockets on Israeli civilians, including recently their longer-range version on Ashkelon.
This means that you cannot blame Israel for maintaining an economic blockade, allowing in only essential humanitarian aid.
I am sorry, Mr Davies; I am sorry, Mr Cohn-Bendit: if Hamas stops the rockets, Israel will lift the blockade - it is as simple as that.
Mr President, the separation in fact of Gaza from the West Bank on the one hand complicates even further an already complex picture.
But, on the other hand, it simplifies it.
Let me explain myself regarding the latter.
First, it facilitated dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian authority from the West Bank.
Second, it contained an Islamic radical militancy allowing a clear approach to it because, on the one hand, we have the Hamas radical leaders and the rest of the population, and, in that respect, it is no secret whom we have to support.
Third, arising from that, instead of two factors in the equation (one very clear - Israel - the other, the Palestinians, a bit blurred), now we have three clearly defined factors - Gaza included - in an equation with a multiplication sign between its factors, meaning that if any one is zero, the product is zero.
(ES) Mr President, just a few very specific questions: how can we go back to the EU BAM to the Rafah crossing point, given the insecurity of the previous situation?
This is an unarmed European corps!
If a single shot is fired, if a situation arises where there is the tiniest chink in security, will all the police officers return to their hotel in Ashkelon?
How can we negotiate an agreement with the Palestinians, Egypt and Israel to change this situation?
If we are unable to do so there will be little point in going back to the previous situation, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has said.
We must have a situation which is insecurity-proof.
Next, how can we move towards peace without dealing with the situation in Gaza?
The Naples process glossed over the Gaza situation, and I believe that this attitude is impossible to maintain: it is impossible for any Palestinian authority to exist which can put up with the insecurity in Gaza while there is no peace.
Finally, I would like to ask about medium-term solutions for supplying water and energy in Gaza.
Would it not be possible to propose solutions in the frontier zone between Gaza and Egypt on similar lines to the proposal on installing desalination and energy generation plants?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday a child died in the Shifa hospital in Gaza, and 80 are dead in the Gaza hospital because they were unable to go to Israel for treatment.
Today the Israeli court of justice ruled in favour of the government, i.e. Barak, as regards blocking and reducing fuel supplies.
This is the current situation.
Mr Solana asked: what can we Europeans do?
The Commissioner said that we should make a difference.
Truth can make the difference.
The difference is the courage not just to say: I know that you have an enormous task, that you are always working, that you are suffering with us for the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis, but there is also, for pity's sake, a need to do something!
We must tell the Israeli government in no uncertain terms that, if it wants to help Salam Fayyad and Mahmoud Abbas, it should not only stop the blockade of Gaza, but it should stop killing young boys as it did yesterday in Bethlehem and it should stop shutting Palestinians in the ghetto in the West Bank.
It is not just Gaza.
Gaza has become the dominant picture, but the occupation continues every day.
Peace is essential for everyone, it is essential both for the Palestinians and for the Israelis.
We must block ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, it is good that we are able to conduct this debate so soon after the horrific events in the Gaza Strip.
It is also good that Parliament has this opportunity to outline its position to Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
At the same time, it is important that we take this opportunity to inform ourselves more fully.
Mr Cohn-Bendit said that it was not enough to provide food but that we had to talk too.
We now have new mechanisms like the Pegasus programme that can foster more fruitful dialogue and cooperation.
Perhaps the Commissioner can give us more information about these.
(NL) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I wholeheartedly agree with fellow Members who have said that the time is past for merely expressing concern about the dramatic events and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and that simply providing money is not enough.
On the contrary, I think that the situation in Gaza and the blockade have to be seen in the context of the overall conflict between Israel and Palestine.
The Palestinians have clearly placed all their hope in the EU to come up with results at last.
A lot of promises have been made in the past, but we can see that in actual fact the EU, in the follow-up to implementation of the Annapolis Conference negotiations, and in the UN, is failing to step up to the mark as an active mediator.
I think this is unacceptable, and the EU can no longer allow itself to be sidelined by the United States, but must adopt an independent stance.
(EL) Mr President, the events in Gaza are tragic and all my fellow Members have expressed their shock.
These events are also regrettable for the European Union.
Not only are we suffering from political weakness, but I also do not know how we can honour our commitments in contributing effective financial assistance and humanitarian aid where we are committed.
TIM is developing into PEGASE, and we are investing in human resources, mechanisms and Community resources.
The question is, how can we be successful at this point.
Have you any news, Commissioner?
Is humanitarian aid reaching Gaza?
Is cooperation taking place with Israel, even if only on this issue?
Can the Palestinian Authority contribute in any way to smoothing the path and facilitating humanitarian aid?
PEGASE ought, logically, to be implemented tomorrow.
Your services have invested in the detail, in planning and in human resources.
How can we live up to this vision and these resources, Commissioner?
(EL) Mr President, the situation in Gaza demands the immediate lifting of the Israeli blockade.
Assistance has to be provided to the people of Gaza in order to tackle their immediate needs.
The Arab League, the European Union and even Israel must facilitate contact between Fatah and Hamas in order to achieve unity among the Palestinian people, as was the case when the government of national unity was in power.
For this to happen, all Palestinian elected representatives who are members of Hamas must be released from Israeli jails.
The right conditions must be created to hold general elections.
Both the European Union and the United States must be clearly committed to abiding fully by the election result, whatever it might be.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Allow me to restate briefly my position on this truly thorny issue, which we discussed at length once again in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday.
I must tell you, though it goes without saying, that we do not confine ourselves to discussion: together with the United States, the Palestinians and the Israelis and, of course, with the United Nations and Russia too in the Quartet framework, the European Union has played its part in the adoption of a joint strategy.
I previously referred, albeit very briefly in connection with Annapolis, to one aspect of this strategy, namely the bilateral negotiating process between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert.
The other aspect, which has more to do with me in the Commission, is the effort to generate a new development that will bring progress for the people, and I am fully aware of the enormity of that task.
I have always been acutely aware of the difficulties, but we naturally wanted to make every effort to help, and that remains our position.
For this reason, the thrust of our policy is to support Mr Abbas in his efforts to bring about peace through his talks with a view to using that peace to foster a process of conciliation with Hamas.
That was the underlying idea of the strategy.
We still intend to support further meetings too.
In the last few days there has been a meeting between Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas.
We know that it did not achieve much in terms of substance, but this is understandable, since all meetings at the present time are overshadowed by what is a very fraught situation.
We must nevertheless keep pursuing this approach.
We still have the means to open a few doors in time for the next meeting in Moscow if we assist both parties.
That is one side of the coin.
The other side is the humanitarian and economic perspective.
On this point, I should like to say the following to those that might not have read my statement: on 21 January, I delivered a very clear position statement on the situation in Gaza, because I, too, realised that things had simply gone too far.
Together with other statements from foreign ministers and international organisations, it has helped to improve the situation.
The blockade, of course, has not been fully lifted, but the situation has improved considerably.
Accordingly, on the humanitarian side - and this also answers your question, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou - many deliveries are now actually arriving in Gaza.
We are none the less aware that this is not enough.
And I myself am aware, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that we face an extremely daunting task.
You are entirely correct in saying that it is an extremely difficult situation; the High Representative is fully aware of that, and he will perhaps comment on it too.
Nevertheless, for the time being we shall continue to pursue the common strategy which we have jointly defined and intend to implement jointly, and we have no option but to press for the opening of the border, which Salam Fayyad himself, as you know, regards as a crucial step.
Let me just say a brief word on the mechanism we devised, which will actually become operational in two days' time, on the first of February.
It is a permanent mechanism, unlike the previous TIM, the Temporary International Mechanism, which we had to keep extending.
For good reasons, the new mechanism has also been created in partnership with the Palestinian Authority.
We worked very closely with Mr Fayyad on the project so that the result would match his requirement for a development and progress plan for Palestine's economy and, of course, for its infrastructure.
This should be a common European effort, by which I mean that the mechanism - a financial mechanism - can be used not only by ourselves but also by Member States.
The idea, indeed, is that some international organisations and non-European countries should also be able, in principle, to avail themselves of this mechanism.
Like TIM, it offers full supervision and monitoring, because we naturally want to meet all the transparency criteria, and it is designed either to provide direct budgetary aid, to channel aid through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and other organisations or to fund our projects.
I am aware, however, that this question currently takes a back seat behind the major political question, namely what we can do to resolve the current situation.
I am, of course, fully conscious of the problem, but at the present juncture this is the only answer I can give you.
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I have been listening with great attention to what has been said.
I could say the same and say it with the same emotion and with the same sentiment, because our sentiments are shared.
But you are saying we have to act and not to talk.
Do you think that action will change our policy 180 degrees today?
I do not really know if that is a sensible approach, to tell you the truth.
What has happened in the last few days, apart from the humanitarian drama?
We can talk for hours and really express our sentiments, because we have the same sentiments as you - at least I have - and I am sure the Commissioner has the same.
Earlier in the week, only a few hours after the tension erupted, the Arab League met.
They took a decision, a decision that was supported by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday, a decision that we are going to try to implement in the coming hours after a meeting taking place this morning between the Palestinian Authority and Egypt - which is continuing as we are speaking now and which will continue during the night and probably tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - when they have reached the point where we can really be of effect.
But I think that a month after the Paris Conference, a month and a half since the Annapolis Conference, when all the Arab countries are engaged, when other countries are playing for the first time a constructive role, I think we have to adapt in that direction.
Now it would not be serious on our part to play a role alone.
We have to play a role along with all the partners that are there.
We are supporting - and the Council's conclusions are very clear on that - the resolution of the Arab League of Sunday as far as the borders are concerned, and that was proved on Monday.
We are following the discussions on Wednesday and Thursday.
I think this is action, but I do not know what I can do.
It is a different story if you ask me to
(FR) 'press ahead in the right direction'.
That means we are going in the wrong direction at the moment.
(Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: '... unknown direction ...')
Mr President, I think that if Mr Cohn-Bendit,
a distinguished Member of the Parliament, says that the strategy of the European Union today is 'inconnue', je ne comprends rien.
You can say whatever you want.
You can say that the strategy of the European Union today after Annapolis, after having chaired the Paris Conference, after having supported the Arab League is 'inconnue', you can say other things, but I do not think that 'inconnue' can be sustained.
You may not like it -
(Objection)
You may not be in agreement, but it is very difficult to say that it is not known.
I share many of the sentiments you have expressed very eloquently.
And I could say that you have, we have, responsibilities in the coming days and hours that we are going to tackle.
Are we able to resolve the situation?
I do not know.
You do not know.
But you can be sure that we are going to try, and we are going to try to support Mr Fayyad, because he has been our interlocutor all this period of time.
He is a man of goodwill, which is why we cannot let him down.
I am not going to let him down.
Therefore we have to continue working in this direction.
There will be frustrations.
It will be frustrating.
Are we going to solve all the problems?
I do not know.
But we are going to try with all our energy and our best will.
I share all the sentiments that have been expressed.
I would not say more deeply but at least at the same depth as you, all our friends here, because we are on the same side, we have been engaged in this battle for a long time together.
Therefore there is no difference in sentiment, and we have to continue what we have been doing.
I think we have to move in that direction.
I promise you that I will go there.
I will try to meet with the Egyptians, the Saudis and everybody - the Americans, the Russians, everybody - to see if we can come up with something that cannot be the same.
It has to be something collectively different.
Otherwise I think we will not be able to produce any results.
You may say that you have not seen results in several years.
Since 1967 we have not produced a result, collectively, as an international community.
That is true.
That is our responsibility.
But I do not think we can resolve the problem tomorrow by taking a decision now which is different to the one we took in the Council on Monday.
We now have a structure from the European Council on Monday and we must try to implement it.
I would be happy to return and talk to you and express very frankly, as we doing here, the consequences of our acts.
But please do not think that we do not have the same sentiments.
We do.
We have experience of the situation there and we cannot say more.
Concerning action, be sure that we are going to do as much as we can.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the February part-session.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (IT) Thank you, Mr President.
This House has, in long debates, discussed the Israeli-Palestinian issue too many times.
We should, however, recognise that, objectively speaking, the role that the European Union has managed to play to date as regards this situation has been altogether marginal: so many proclamations, declarations of intent, motions and documents but, in truth, very little consistency as far as actions are concerned.
I recently visited Palestine and I found an atmosphere of distress, disillusionment and resignation among the people, who are tired of years of broken promises: the situation is becoming worse and there is a serious risk of driving the Palestinian territories into the arms of Hamas extremists.
The air that you breathe there is heavy, and recourse to violence seems almost unavoidable.
Just now, time is really running out: either Europe will have the strength and the capability to turn this situation around or we shall, all of us, bear the responsibility of not having done enough to avert the worst.
in writing. - As my colleague Michael Gahler has said, the current resolution is following the line of six powers to keep up pressure on Iran.
As I see it, the practical problem is how this resolution will be perceived by the Iranian regime.
In a situation where the big players in international politics are not willing or able to agree on applying serious sanctions to Iran, there is hardly any chance that this resolution will make a difference.
However, there is still one way - as yet untried - to make an impact.
This is to give a chance to the Iranian opposition movement by ending its political suppression by EU governments.
The European Court of First Instance in December 2006, and the British courts last November, ruled that there are absolutely no grounds to isolate the Iranian opposition like this.
Freeing the hands of Iranian opposition for peaceful activities will provide the EU not only with efficient leverage to influence the regime of mullahs but will open a third and more realistic option between wishful diplomacy, on the one hand, and USA-type military intervention on the other.
If our sincere intention is to bring about a positive change in Iran, let us give this third option a chance.
US anti-missile defence system (debate)
The next item concerns the declaration of the Council and the Commission on the US anti-missile defence system.
President-in-Office. - (SL) The Council did not discuss the installation of the US anti-missile defence system on the territory of the European Union.
Therefore, I am sorry that I am unable to give the Council's opinion on this matter, but I would like to remind you that the decision on any installation of any armed forces or military equipment rests within the national competence of each Member State.
For that reason the Member States make decisions on such matters independently.
Allow me to clarify: there have not been any discussions so far between the European Union and the United States of America on the installation of the anti-missile system.
Also, neither party has planned for a possible cooperation in this area.
The Council of the European Union did not therefore plan for talks to discuss this matter, either with the United States of America or with the NATO Alliance.
As we know, anti-missile defence is a subject of cooperation within NATO as well as within NATO-Russian Federation Council.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be very brief today, because the Commission has very little competence in this matter.
But let me say that interaction between the United States of America, Russia and the EU Member States in the areas of security and defence has wider implications for these important partnerships.
That is clear.
Therefore, although, as I said, we really do not have competence or responsibility in this question, we hope that a balanced solution can be found that is, in the end, satisfactory for all.
We have welcomed, from the very beginning, the high-level talks that started in Moscow last October, followed by expert meetings.
And we see in the recent direct dialogue between Moscow and Warsaw an opportunity to clarify respective positions in respect of national sovereignty.
In conclusion, in whatever forum these issues are discussed, be it NATO or be it the OSCE, I think it would be important that decisions on the future of the European security architecture should also involve the European Union.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we in Europe talk of anti-missile defence, the discussion normally revolves around the United States' planned installations in Poland and the Czech Republic.
Many people are unaware that these are merely extensions to an existing system designed to protect the United States of America.
We in the European Parliament, however, must focus first and foremost on its implications for the security of the continent of Europe.
As we know, the United States has already spent more than 100 billion dollars on its anti-missile defence system and is investing a further ten billion a year in the continuing development of the system.
Yet the United States is much further away from potential sources of danger than we are in Europe.
The present situation is rather like Luxembourg spending money to build dykes but the Netherlands seeing no need to do likewise.
We must ask ourselves whether a threat actually exists and, if so, whether we need to respond to it.
The debate we have just heard with Mr Solana shows that the situation in Iran remains a source of concern.
We are also aware of the threat that could emanate from the unstable situation in Pakistan.
We in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence have engaged in intensive dialogue with representatives of the United States, including Lieutenant General Henry Obering, Director of the Missile Defense Agency.
It emerged clearly from these talks that the US system would be able, in theory, to protect part of Europe but not the whole continent.
In particular, it could not protect Cyprus, Malta, parts of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria or southern Italy.
From a European point of view, however, we cannot tolerate a division of our continent into areas with differing degrees of security.
Accordingly, we must jointly define our common European security interests in this context.
The present appraisal reminds us that there is currently no forum in which this matter is being discussed and in which these common European security interests are being defined.
This is clearly another area where very close coordination with Russia is needed.
We expect NATO's Bucharest summit in April to present proposals for a joint system, and we expect these proposals to take due account of our specific European security interests.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this is not the first time that we have discussed this issue; it is also not the first time that we have had the same answers from the Council, which says that it has no competence here, as does the Commission, although - and I must congratulate the Commissioner for this - she did say at the end that things need to be organised differently in the European Union.
If something happens that affects the security of all Europeans, and that comes under the security strategy that Mr Solana described to us, we need to be able to talk to each other about it.
Parliament fortunately is able to talk about it.
This is an issue that concerns both the citizens and the Member States of the European Union, so we feel it is entirely proper that it should be on the agenda.
I do not intend to go back over all the objections that our Group has already voiced against this plan that the Americans have come up with.
What we think is wrong is that bilateral negotiations are going on with two NATO Member States which - coincidentally or otherwise - are also Member States of the European Union, and this affects relations with Russia, including the European Union's relations with it.
It is also wrong that the system is being developed unilaterally, albeit within NATO, and that it has not been clearly explained exactly why the system is necessary, whether it will work and whether it is becoming too costly.
There is an interesting debate going on in Poland at the moment, where the new government has said that it may be prepared to cooperate on the system, but that this is because it is what the Americans want and because it is America's security at stake rather than Poland's.
After all, the system is actually more of a threat than an improvement to Poland's security.
This is why the Poles are also asking for more help with developing air defences for the Polish army, for example, creating a sort of arms race.
So it is interesting that the debate has restarted in Poland on whether the system is useful or necessary, and that the new Polish prime minister or at least the Polish foreign minister has had the guts to talk to Russia about it.
We wholeheartedly support this.
The situation is rather different in the Czech Republic, where we have the impression that the system and the Czech contribution to it are being pushed through against the will of the people, since I believe that 70% of Czechs are against the development of the system.
I therefore fear that there are moves afoot to push through decisions this year, to conclude agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic, before a new administration - hopefully - takes over in the United States.
We know that the democrats are fairly sceptical about developing the Air Missile System.
In any event, we hope that there will be a discussion in the Council, and we urge that this issue be taken very seriously.
If it goes through, it is bound to have an impact on our already difficult relationship with Russia.
The public are anxious.
What we have is a new arms race, and there are a number of other things that we think the European Parliament simply has to speak out about.
We have done so in the past, and we should carry on doing it.
I think that our main role is to see whether this is necessary, whether it is the start of a new arms race, whether it really will improve security and whether it really will help us to combat the 'rogue states'.
I am still not convinced that the Iranians will have the capacity to fire missiles as quickly as the Americans claim.
This is something else we have had contradictory information about.
So I hope that we can take the discussion forward on this issue here in Parliament, and also monitor what is happening in the Czech Republic and Poland.
My Group remains opposed to the system.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the biggest threat to humanity is not the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries.
The real problem is the existence of nuclear weapons generally.
The only ethical and permanent option in our approach to anti-missile defence systems and other nuclear weapons systems is to abandon their use.
The EU too should commit to new agreements controlling armament and be proactive in its attempt to initiate the disarmament process.
America's anti-missile defence system would increase the risk of nuclear war.
The nuclear shield planned for Poland and the Czech Republic is based on the assumption that a nuclear war can be won.
The type of anti-missile defence practised by the United States is radically different from its earlier deterrent policy, because the aim of that was to prevent one country from taking its revenge on another.
The former deterrent effect of nuclear armament is thus out of the picture.
The balance of fear therefore disappears.
That is why an US anti-missile system in Poland or the Czech Republic is a crucial matter of concern for the whole of Europe and all its Member States.
That being so, it is important that the EU should debate the matter and make known the concerns of its citizens.
We should really also be considering here whether this will improve security in Europe and Europe's defence, or whether it will go the other way, with the new system actually weakening security in Europe.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, at times President Putin's rhetoric reminds us of the possibility of Russia aiming its missiles at Europe.
This proves that there is a certain strategic balance between the United States and Russia.
There is, however, no such balance between Europe and Russia.
Nor can this be ensured by France's and Great Britain's 'nuclear umbrellas'.
I therefore believe it is right to ask how Europe's rather than the United States' joint missile defence can be ensured.
Are we discussing these issues only because the United States takes care of its own defence?
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, members of the Commission and the European Union are not even concerned about this form of defence.
Do you not think that it is only natural for the United States, NATO and also certain Member States to decide on this together?
I believe that the European Union must formulate an unequivocal position that should then be executed together with NATO and the United States.
Otherwise, we should not waste our time here because everything will be decided by NATO.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I admit that that is undoubtedly the new European policy.
It reminds me of my son when he was four years old.
When you asked him, 'Where are you?' he would put his hands over his eyes and say, 'I'm not here'.
That is what the Commission is saying to us: 'We are not here.
It has nothing to do with us or with Europe'.
(DE) I am sorry, but that is absolute nonsense.
We have to decide now whether we want a common European foreign and security policy.
We even have a new treaty that gives us our own foreign minister with responsibility for a common foreign and security policy, and when we have a common foreign minister we shall surely have to discuss matters at the European level, not as individual governments discussing their countries' security with other individual governments, or like Mr von Wogau, who maintains that Europe is threatened by Iran or goodness knows what other countries.
I do not share that view, and at the very least we must discuss things at the European level.
We cannot simply say that the Americans have hit on some hare-brained scheme, that George Bush will no longer be in office six months from now, so they might drop their hare-brained scheme, but we Europeans have nothing to do with all of this.
We are highly sceptical about this whole anti-missile defence strategy, but we firmly believe it is something that we Europeans are duty-bound to discuss.
It is not a decision for the Polish or Czech Members or for Members of any particular nationality - Romanians and Bulgarians tomorrow, Sicilians the next day or whatever.
No, we have a common interest in taking decisions about our security.
That is essentially laid down in the Treaty that you have ratified and that we intend to ratify, in the provisions on a common foreign and security policy.
Accordingly, this issue must be a matter for the European Union.
The decision must not be taken bilaterally between Poland and the United States or between the Czech Republic and the United States.
It is a European decision.
It is a European problem, and we must find a European solution.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the issue of installing American anti-missile defence tools in the Czech Republic and Poland, i.e. on European Union territory, is being dealt with by the European Parliament, which is the most democratic institution given that it is directly elected by the citizens of the Union, whom this issue affects.
In this context I would like to stress that I am supported by my colleagues in the GUE/NGL Group and I also draw on my own experience as a military expert; but most importantly I am supported by the majority of citizens in my country, where 70% of the population are against the installation of the American radar system.
The American anti-missile defence is presented to us as a defence shield, so why was the Czech Republic, for example, not allowed to sell the Tamara passive radar detection system without active military components to China?
The reason given was that China would gain an inadequate advantage in its relations with other countries.
Is this not a manipulation of words?
Is not the real issue of stationing the radar in the Czech Republic also about gaining advantage?
Even a layman can understand what warriors had known long before Hannibal: a shield in a soldier's hand is a means for a better and more efficient use of his sword.
The talk is about increased security but is the issue not really about increasing security risks?
It is only logical that we will immediately become target number one for potential adversaries.
We are told that we should oblige the US in order to prove that we are good allies.
Canada has not obliged either: does that make it a bad US ally? Is it not the case that Canada has perhaps learned a lesson from the purpose-built justification for military action in Iraq?
We are surprised at Russia's reaction.
However, given that the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty and acts in its own interest, this reaction is not illogical.
Was the United States happy years ago about the close proximity of Soviet missiles in Cuba?
There is no doubt that the US is a superpower, and its views, proposals and requests cannot be swept off the table just like that.
However, if we are really concerned about greater security, especially in Europe, then the road to it follows a more complicated path via negotiations and agreements, not unilateral steps.
This is the responsibility not only of the major players - the US and Russia - but of the European Union too.
(CS) There is huge proliferation of medium and medium-long range carriers at the start of the 21st century.
Unfortunately, in the absence of an international security regime the only way to stop it through effective defence.
Effective defence is the paramount right of the EU Member States.
The SOFA negotiations that are currently taking place in Prague are a legitimate right of the Czech Republic.
Because the radar situated on Czech Republic territory will ensure the security of many European countries and because this will be the first opportunity for the Czech Republic, a country that had been occupied for many years, to actively contribute towards European security, the Czech Government must be extremely responsible in its actions.
The anti-missile defence system must be trustworthy and defensive and must respect the indivisibility of security.
We thus welcome information about the Bucharest summit, where a decision on the construction of a complementary LTBMD system should be made.
Moving negotiations to NATO guarantees implementation of indivisibility.
Making it clear that this is a purely defensive system is the subject of American-Polish-Czech-Russian negotiations.
My final point concerns effectiveness.
Taking into account what we know about Iran's November tests, we must realise that we have a common responsibility.
We must not ruin the effectiveness of our common defence with quarrels over whether we should defend ourselves at all.
(CS) Allow me to make use of this one-minute speech to call on the Council of the European Union and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss the American anti-missile defence system at European level.
The installation of the American anti-missile defence system in Europe is a pan-European issue.
It is not just a matter for Czechs, Poles or Americans.
Intra-European Union relations, EU-NATO relations, EU-US relations and EU-Russia relations are all at stake.
I would therefore ask that this issue be included in the Council's agenda.
As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, I would like to mention one fact: 70% of the citizens of the Czech Republic are opposed to this system.
Three quarters of the citizens of the Czech Republic want a referendum on the subject.
The Czech Government does not communicate with the public; the Czech Government does not inform the Members of the Czech Parliament, the Czech Government does everything behind the backs of the Czech people.
It is important to know this and it must be highlighted in the Council of the European Union.
(PL) Mr President, may I first remind everyone that the missile defence shield is not only an issue for Poland and the Czech Republic: it concerns the United Kingdom and Denmark too, since facilities in both those countries are also to be included in the system.
So let us not talk only about Poland or the Czech Republic.
The second point is that the missile defence shield, and the installations that form part of it, will not be a magnet for terrorists.
Terrorists strike at soft targets, not well-defended military bases.
Finally, a third point.
The European Union is not a military ally.
Perhaps it is pity that it isn't, but that is the fact of the matter, and the new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, changes nothing in that respect.
That being so, a defence issue is either NATO's responsibility or the responsibility of countries that have not decided to join an alliance and wish to defend themselves separately.
Obviously, there has to be a discussion in NATO about how this system should fit into other systems that NATO intends to develop.
That is absolutely essential.
Let us not forget that 21 countries in the European Union are members of NATO.
(DE) Mr President, one of the supreme anti-war novels is about the good soldier Schweik, by Jaroslav HaÅ¡ek.
The position adopted by the Commission and the Council, however, outshines Schweik; it outdoes Franz Kafka too, and it even outdoes any ostrich.
We cannot pursue this head-in-the-sand policy.
We must discuss this issue among ourselves, on the floor of the European Parliament, but we must also discuss it, of course, with the members of NATO.
We must discuss it with the Czechs, the Poles and the Russians.
This is an essential process that must be conducted on a pan-European scale.
(DE) Mr President, the technical function of the planned anti-missile system is to take out a potential enemy's second-strike capability - of that there is no doubt.
In other words, it is also an attack system.
This must be taken into account in the debate.
Whether the missile system is set up by the United States, by NATO together with the United States or by any other combination, it remains an arms programme.
The salient point for me is that the European Union is unable to come up with a common position on the issue.
In this matter the common foreign and security policy of the European Union is being exposed to ridicule.
Mr Cohn-Bendit can cite the Reform Treaty until the cows come home - as long as the present situation continues and no common position is adopted at all, the Union will simply make itself a laughing stock.
What we must do is to say clearly that we do not want this anti-missile system.
The fact is that a very clear majority of this European Parliament says 'No' to this system.
In the countries of Europe, including the Czech Republic, public opinion is firmly opposed to the anti-missile system, and of course the Polish Government has undoubtedly refined its previous position.
For these reasons I would welcome our adoption of a resolution in which the House clearly rejects this missile system.
(CS) Allow me to thank the Council, represented by the Slovenian Presidency, and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for adhering, fairly strictly, to the tone of the European Treaties.
According to the Treaties, these issues are entirely the responsibility of the nation states.
I should mention that even the new Lisbon Treaty explicitly states that issues of national security are the competence of the individual EU Member States alone.
I am convinced that European security is indivisibly linked to the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic region, and in a situation where the European Union is incapable of protecting its members from new risks, be they financial or technological, this link becomes vital.
Regarding public opinion, which has been mentioned here several times, I can only add that those who refer to opinion polls and call for a referendum are often the same people who opposed a referendum on another very important issue, namely the new European Treaty.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to sum up all the arguments.
Essentially this issue is not only about increasing the security of the Czech Republic and Poland, but in fact increasing the security of the whole of Europe.
The negotiations on the positioning of such a system are the responsibility of the nation state as such.
Similar systems exist in other countries, in Member States of the European Union.
Today's speakers have clearly emphasised that there is a real danger.
We need to realise that when it comes to the issue of security, decisions must be made very quickly.
Such decisions can also have a preventive element.
Only if we are ready and strong can we force aggressors to negotiate and to adhere to security requirements.
To conclude I would like to say that I completely reject the view that the Czech Government has not communicated with its citizens about this system.
An information campaign has been under way for several months.
(CS) I would like to make four points concerning this topic.
The first relates to the Founding Act between NATO and the Russian Federation of May 1997.
In this Act both sides pledged jointly to eliminate the use of force, and even the threat of force, in the continent of Europe.
If this Act is valid, then in fact it rules out the possibility of a situation such as the one we have been discussing here arising in our continent.
The second point concerns the Helsinki Process.
The signatories to the Accords, to the Declaration, pledged in Helsinki to reduce the presence of military systems in Europe.
This action would reverse the trend.
In my opinion, the reduction in the number of military systems in the European continent should continue.
The third point concerns the number of bases.
There are American bases in 18 European countries.
If we include the new ones the total would rise to 20.
We would thus be confirming Zbigniew BrzeziÅski's words that the European Union is a de facto American protectorate.
The fourth point concerns the purpose of the whole system.
I think it is sufficiently clear: to ensure intelligence coverage and intelligence control over the whole continent of Europe.
(PL) Madam President, Prime Minister Tusk is sensitive to the arguments of his European neighbours.
Poland's possible participation in this American project must not become a source of misunderstanding within the Union itself.
The new Polish government values good relations with the United States but knows Poland is above all a member of the European family.
Poland is also paying heed to Russia's reservations and reacting calmly despite the harsh tone adopted by some representatives of the Russian armed forces.
At the present time, when the European Union does not have a common foreign and security policy, Poland's final decision as to the stationing of elements of the missile defence shield on its territory will be its sovereign decision.
Poland appreciates different opinions and does not resent criticism.
Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to respect our position, which must first and foremost guarantee the security of our own citizens.
(Applause)
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to thank Mr Cohn-Bendit for reminding us of the fact that, yesterday, Slovenia was the second Member State to ratify the new Treaty of Lisbon.
However, the Treaty is not in force yet.
As we know, we need 24 more countries to ratify it, and the Presidency of Slovenia is hoping that the States will ratify it on time and that the new Treaty of Lisbon will come into force by the planned deadline.
I would like to stress that it will not bring major changes or anything new in terms of the basic premises on which European security and defence policies are founded.
In particular, it will not change the fact that this policy is based on national competence, which the Member States retain in the domain of national security and defence.
The European Union already has a European security and defence policy, which already provides a framework for such discussions within the Council as well.
Alternatively, such discussions will take place within the framework of the Council, but that will not depend so much on the Presidency as on the will and interest of the Member States.
Let me assure you that the Council will be informed in detail about today's debate and the viewpoints expressed in it.
The debate is closed.
Accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services (13593/6/2007 - C6-0410/2007 - (rapporteur: Markus Ferber).

rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a long debate that has stretched over four legislative terms in the European Parliament, beginning in 1992 with the publication by the European Commission of its White Paper on the development of postal services, which was followed by the adoption of the first Postal Directive in 1997 and its revision in 2002; now, at the start of 2008, after more than 15 years, I hope we are poised to adopt jointly a rational set of rules that will help us to reconcile the interests of consumers, the interests of the companies that have hitherto enjoyed a monopoly in the provision of postal services, the interests of the competitors wishing to enter this lucrative market and the interests of those who are employed in the postal sector.
We in the European Parliament have been working very hard to achieve these goals over the past months.
I must point out, Mr President, that the clock is fast - I have not been speaking for three and a half minutes yet!
I believe we have succeeded here in the European Parliament in achieving an acceptable compromise between all these interests.
I should like to thank all those who helped to achieve it - my fellow Members of the European Parliament and particularly Brian Simpson, with whom a 14-year friendship was forged by our joint efforts in the realm of postal services.
We have been tracking this important issue together here since 1994.
I wish to thank the Commission, which has played a very constructive role, both in its proposals and at the negotiating table.
At this point, I am afraid I have to address my special thanks not to the current Slovenian Presidency but to the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, which succeeded in formulating a common position on 1 October last year.
I am especially proud, and we in the European Parliament can all be proud, of the fact that the Council, in its common position, embraced the outcome of our inter-group deliberations and incorporated more than 95% of it into the foundations of the common position.
That is a great success for the European Parliament, and it shows that Parliament can resolve such complex issues as deregulation of the market in postal services, which is further justification for the additional powers entrusted to it by the Reform Treaty.
Accordingly, in the committee discussions prior to second reading, we tried to identify areas of the common position to which we could make improvements.
We did not make life easy for ourselves, because every compromise inevitably has some aspect here or there where there might be some scope for improvement.
In December, however, we in the Transport and Tourism Committee, in an overwhelming vote of approval, established that all the points to which Parliament attached importance had actually been taken into account by the Council and that we could not make anything better.
Any amendment would have been a retrograde step.
This is why your rapporteur is now able to say that the recommendation made by a large majority of the lead committee is that the common position be adopted without amendment, and I should be delighted if that were to happen tomorrow.
We would also have set an example by wrapping up this complex issue of the liberalisation of postal services, which has exercised this House for 15 years, without once having recourse to the conciliation procedure.
Let me just remind the House that we have always managed to reach agreement at second reading.
To do so again would be the icing on the cake at the end of a long legislative process.
I therefore ask for your support and reiterate my thanks to all those who have cooperated very constructively in this process.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am greatly honoured to be here at your plenary session today.
The Commission's proposal for the directive on the accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services has been one of the most demanding legislative proposals for the co-legislators over the last 15 months.
When the Commission proposed it in October 2006, everyone expected endless disagreements and lively debates within our institutions about the future of one of the oldest and most traditional public services in Europe.
Discussing this matter was an extremely demanding task for the German and especially Portuguese Presidencies in 2007.
From the outset, in the debates, our institutions established the common aim of avoiding populism and demagoguery and focusing on the essential parameters of this matter, including social aspects for postal employees and the permanent financing of a universal service.
As we know, the postal sector is threatened with structural change and it must adapt to new economic and social circumstances.
The final phase of total reform of the internal postal services market offers a unique opportunity for growth to all contractors involved.
In the end, the public expects us to preserve and improve the quality and efficiency of postal services to benefit the users, regardless of where they live.
The opening up of the postal services market has so far been a success story.
New players have entered the market and new opportunities have been exploited, not only by these new players but also by the established ones.
New user services have been developed.
It is self-evident that total liberalisation of the postal services is a necessary condition for enlivening this sector and securing its existence alongside new forms of competition and alternative services.
The approach of our two institutions is further proof of the fundamental principles of protecting high-quality, reliable and affordable services for all users and disallowing discriminatory obstacles for new agents entering the market.
At the same time both the European Parliament and the Council accept that some postal services markets within the European Union operate under basically different conditions.
Therefore, when expressing its common position, the Council adopted the decision to set the end of 2010 as the common final date for liberalisation.
However, some Member States have been allowed a transitional period up to the end of 2012 to implement the new rules.
In common with the basic principle of all previous directives on postal services, the principle of subsidiarity allows the Member States to adjust the common rules to special national circumstances and ensures an independent regulatory authority to supervise the postal services market.
Ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this brief address, allow me to congratulate Mr Ferber and the rapporteurs of all the political groups involved, i.e. the shadow rapporteurs, on their contributions to our fruitful and constructive discussions.
Although we did not always fully agree with their specific remarks, I would like to remind you that the Council included a number of appropriate changes in its common position in November 2007, thereby demonstrating its political decisiveness, openness and constructive flexibility.
I would especially like to emphasise the fine work of the Commission in the whole process of common decision-making and its commitment to the effective support and guidance of the Member States in all questions relating to the implementation of the new directive.
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will receive the final decision and again acknowledge our principal agreement according to the provisions of the Council common position and the recommendation by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on 9 December last year.
We are certain that we have found the right balance between the different aims and have openly and sensitively dealt with the political challenges without endangering the legal security of postal services contractors and consumers.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for your cooperation and for the text, which I am certain will be approved, and thank you for your attention.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, tomorrow the European Parliament should take a historic decision that marks the end of a process launched more than 15 years ago.
The Third Postal Directive brings to a good end the well prepared gradual process of full market opening.
What today appears a clear and obvious solution was far from uncontested when the discussion started.
On 18 October 2006 the Commission presented its proposals.
Intense and constructive negotiations in the institutions followed.
It was eventually the European Parliament, through its report at first reading of 11 July 2007, that paved the way for the compromise result in front of you today.
Many in this House have actively contributed to this important result, and - on behalf of my colleague Commissioner McCreevy - I wish to pay tribute particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, and his fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups who have shaped the compromise.
The same goes for the Finnish, German, Portuguese and - last but not least - the Slovene Presidency.
Some remarks on substance: the text that is now on the table is balanced.
It takes into account the interests of different political groups and Member States.
The Commission's proposal had envisaged an earlier date for market opening, confirming the target date set by the existing Postal Directive.
Two additional years is a substantial period.
It will give all operators time to complete their preparations.
It should not, however, lead to complacency.
What is important for the postal sector, its customers, its operators and its employees is that there is a final and unconditional date for full market opening.
The common position provides for fair conditions and requires us to do away with market entry barriers.
A limited number of amendments have been tabled for tomorrow's vote.
Mostly these are amendments that were already rejected by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in December.
As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, observed at the time, these amendments do not bring added value for the internal market, for postal users, or for postmen and women.
There is a momentum to finalise the process of postal reform.
To sum up, the text in front of you is, on balance, good in substance, and, if you look at its main provisions, you will agree with me that it is faithful to our objective: real market opening not as an end in itself but as the means through which we pursue the broader objective of a high quality, highly efficient and sustainable postal sector adapted to the needs of the 21st century.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, in recent years all of us, myself included, have repeatedly lamented the fact that, even in the case of major legislative projects, most of the seats on the Council bench have remained empty.
We should therefore make a point of expressing our pleasure at the high-level representation of the Slovenian Presidency at this important legislative debate and at the fact that Slovenia is already entering, as it were, into the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, of course, it has just ratified.
The internal market in postal services has been a long time coming.
We are delighted that, if all goes well, this present draft of ours will help to bring the process to a successful conclusion.
The initial proposal from the Commission was, in principle, coherent and acceptable, but for us in the European Parliament the basic principle was, in many cases, too broadly applied, and we felt that major points of detail remained unresolved.
In this respect it was a good thing that, under the direction of our rapporteur, Markus Ferber, whom I warmly congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, our committee, acting by a very comfortable majority, was able to add numerous important elements to the Commission proposal at first reading and to interpret and flesh out its provisions.
On the financial side in particular we have added an extra option - an important one, since it ensures that a key issue is not disregarded.
We reinforced the social provisions, especially on matters such as working conditions, working hours and leave entitlements.
In particular, we introduced a temporary reciprocity clause to ensure that the Directive does not yield windfall profits by letting a few remaining monopolists expand their operations into deregulated markets.
In return we agreed to the entry into force of the Directive being postponed by two years.
We believe that the proposal was generally well balanced, and we feel vindicated by the actions of the Council, which very largely endorsed the position of the European Parliament.
We should accept that position tomorrow and share the satisfaction of the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur with the outcome.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of the PSE Group I would like to thank Markus Ferber for his report and his hard work over many years.
The PSE Group accepts that a great deal of Parliament's first-reading position has been accepted by the Council, and this will guarantee the universal service; it will guarantee the financing of that service; it will also recognise that social protection must be in place, and it delays the implementation by two years to the end of 2010 for all the old Member States and 2012 for the new ones.
In my view this is a good deal.
There are those who still fight the anti-liberalisation battle.
But that battle was lost over 15 years ago when Parliament accepted - against my advice at the time - to liberalise the postal services sector.
Some of us in this Parliament have delayed the full implementation for those long 15 years, but there comes a time, eventually, when we have to face up to reality.
Although, personally, I would like to see a second reading with no amendments, my group believe it is right to clarify the financing of the universal service and to protect those services presently provided for the visually impaired and the blind.
So we will be supporting amendments 1, 2, 6, 18 and 19.
We must ensure that postal services are able to compete, not necessarily against each other, but against other technologies.
But we need the playing field to be level, and I hope, with the reservations I have outlined, that we can conclude our work on this dossier based on our first-reading position and get back to the most important issue of providing a reliable, regular and affordable postal service to our citizens, and to recognising the important work done by all those postmen and women throughout the European Union.
Finally, when Markus Ferber and I started work on this dossier, neither of us had any grey hairs.
Now look at the both of us!
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, like all my colleagues, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, on his work.
This was a job that was initiated a long time ago and during the course of which we have had significant moments of convergence and some moments of constructive discussion.
As far as my position and that of my group is concerned, there has never been any conflict of principles or ideology against the idea of liberalisation, which we all agree with and support, while, of course, seeking to ensure the guarantees that are necessary for a universal service.
In the current proposal for the Directive, which was approved by the Parliament during its first reading and then reconsidered by the Council, we can see that this guarantee is there, even if some of the conditions could be made more precise, specific and detailed.
We do not want to be like those who cannot see the wood for the trees, but, on the other hand, nor do we want to ignore the fact that sometimes the devil is in the detail.
For this reason we would have preferred that, as regards some of the issues concerning authorisations, concerning ensuring proper competition and also concerning tariff payments between the operator charged with providing the universal service and other individual services, concerning rights and responsibilities as regards network access, that some of the questions had been gone into in more detail.
We would have preferred this, but the majority of the views taken in Parliament, which were also represented among the committee, was probably that making the guarantees more precise was unnecessary, and preferred instead not to run the risk of coming to a complicated agreement.
In summary, at this time we hold this standpoint and, as regards the amendments concerning conditions for the blind and the visually impaired, we would like to state clearly that, if these and only these amendments were to force a settlement to be reached, we would not be in favour.
However, if other amendments should be approved we shall also vote in favour.
Otherwise, we would vote against all the amendments put forward.
Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council. I should first like to thank Mr Ferber for his work in seeking a compromise between Parliament and the Council in such a politically sensitive area as postal services.
I should like to emphasise that the objective difficulties in liberalising the approach to universal services, mainly for the new Member States, were reflected in the directive as an adequate additional time-limit of two years to reserve these services.
At the same time a sound legal framework has been put in place to guarantee universal services.
I therefore believe that the ball is now in the court of the Member States' authorities.
Despite the difficulties encountered by postal enterprises in some Member States, including my country, Latvia, I believe that liberalisation of the market will resolve the seemingly hopeless situation of outdated postal service providers.
As regards tomorrow's vote, I invite you not to support the aforesaid proposals, because the Member States must make use of their competence also in respect of the visually impaired.
Thank you.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am afraid the facts of the matter prevent me from joining the celebrations.
Fact number one: who will benefit?
Those consumers who live in cities and love to receive advertising material in their letterboxes.
They will benefit. So will businesses that specialise in mass mailings and postal advertising campaigns.
Those people who are blind or visually impaired, on the other hand, will not benefit.
I therefore implore you to support our amendment on this matter.
There will be no benefit to the employees of the postal services either, who will be working for low pay and will be under enormous pressure, which can only increase in the envisaged conditions.
Another group that will not benefit are people who live in the country or in remote areas and will have to rely on private postal services, for we shall see a creeping erosion of service levels down to the minimum possible and permissible.
In particular, there will be no benefit to taxpayers, who must once again finance the universal service that was previously funded internally, as it were, being effectively subsidised by revenue from mass mailings and private postal services.
For these reasons I come down against the directive.
I believe it is misguided.
Competition is good, but care must be taken to ensure that it takes place on a level playing field. That has not been done in this case.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, postal services are a labour-intensive public service.
In the second half of the nineteenth century the states of Europe decided that they needed to have their own monopoly on postal services because the private sector was not up to the job.
There have always been private companies that tried to get round this situation.
They offered cheaper services, but selectively, choosing the busiest parts of the postal delivery service and offering poorer working conditions and conditions of employment.
Since the 1990s a political majority have tried to create ever broader scope for such companies, and this proposed decision gives them almost an entirely free hand.
My Group expects this to result in poorer delivery services for consumers, deteriorating conditions for workers and extra costs for the Member States to maintain and restore their universal postal services.
Even now that the three biggest Groups have agreed a compromise on deadlines and accompanying measures, my Group still sees this choice as a step backwards.
In addition to measures to improve certain details, such as stricter guarantees for blind customers and for staff, we therefore propose that this liberalisation should be rejected.
This would also be in line with the recent thumbs down given by voters in the German city of Leipzig to the sale of public undertakings.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I note the phrase 'a fixed and irrevocable date'.
One thing EU designer Jean Monnet hated about democracy was that nothing is irrevocable.
No democratic government can bind its successor with the irrevocable.
There is a democratic deficit in the EU because the ever-closer Union was designed as irrevocable.
No openings for democracy.
The people may only vote to support what the EU elite want.
It is a one-way street.
The French and Dutch people voted against this irrevocable union.
Ignoring them and introducing the same failed constitution proves my point.
You are failing to learn from history.
The Soviet Union went.
Hitler's TausendjÃ€hriges Reich lasted 12 years.
The backlash you are creating by denying the people a referendum will bring this intolerant EU empire down as sure as day follows night.
(HU) Madam President, by the end of 2012 postal services will be fully liberalised, and the common market will have been achieved in this area too.
Since opening the market will have different impacts on the markets in individual Member States, what we have achieved through the legislation is that the market will be opened step by step.
We have also achieved a situation in which the relevant post offices can keep the revenue they have at their disposal until the end of the derogation period, and I personally put this down as a result.
After a long time, European regulation has been born, so that puts everyone in a competitive situation.
Particular thanks to the rapporteur for this.
In other words, this regulation will not mean disadvantages for competing companies after the opening of the market, but new prospects.
Madam President, all this is only half a victory if the next steps are not taken.
What are they?
Firstly, the post offices that enjoy the derogation must focus, in the years to come, on being able to meet the requirements supported by European competition, that is, that they really do use the time benefits that they are being given now.
Secondly, state regulation and policies must ensure that, whilst the post office is slimmed down with the slogan of becoming competitive, universal service really must be ensured at a corresponding level.
We should not forget that responsibility for service will still be the obligation of the state.
In fact, regulation was born so that European citizens, wherever they live, even in the smallest places, should have access to postal services, at a suitable price and of suitable quality.
Thank you for your attention.
(FR) Madam President, I think that the issue we shall be voting on tomorrow is a historic one, because the post has been a public service from the early days, especially since monarchies.
That was because the distribution of mail is strategic, and it also ensured a universal and fast service.
We have just put an end to public control of postal services, or we shall be ending it tomorrow, to replace it with a largely deregulated postal market.
What is proposed in this directive will first of all be a wonderful market for lawyers and legal practitioners, because it is not harmonisation. Each Member State can decide on its own method of financing and there are four different methods.
The directive also proposes something completely paradoxical: compensating for the financing of the universal service through State subsidies where, in some countries, what was not financially viable was financed by equalisation when that was viable.
I think we are making a mistake.
Time will tell, but we already have some indications of that today. Over EUR 880 million have been invested in the postal service in the United Kingdom.
In Spain it has just been announced that, because of the pressure of competition, rural areas will no longer receive a direct postal service. The Germans are having problems in bringing the minimum wage into line with the postal services market.
My feeling is that we are now benefiting companies, we are going to let them cream off the best part of the market, but we are not serving the general interest in postal services or the external competitiveness of the European Union.
(NL) Madam President, I support the compromise reached by Mr Ferber and approved by the Council because I am in favour of an open market for postal services.
I think this directive gives the Member States sufficient scope to ensure that their markets are opened up in a proper manner, and that there are different service-providers competing for customers on the basis of guaranteed quality.
It is certainly not the intention that the Member States should use this scope to prevent their markets from being opened up, although this is also a risk.
It would be easy to apply this directive so that new firms faced such strict requirements that no one new would bother with the letter post.
If this is how the Member States apply the directive, then we will have adopted a fine piece of legislation, but will have changed nothing in practice for postal customers.
I think we certainly have to approve the text, but I would ask the Commission to make sure that the aim of creating an open market in postal services is not circumvented by measures taken by the Member States.
I see that the rapporteur's country, for example, has recently taken measures that have actually closed down the postal market in Germany again.
(GA) Mr President, the postal service in Ireland has a central part to play in the lives of rural communities, especially for rural dwellers and people in remote regions who have no neighbours around.
So I welcome the provision for universal service - something that is vitally important for people in Ireland and, I am sure, every other Member State as well.
I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for sticking firmly to that principle.
For the benefit of customers it should be laid down in our draft documents, and in this connection I also welcome the new financial service being set up by the Irish Post Office in Ireland.
This shows that postal service providers can gear themselves to new market requirements while continuing to provide their universal postal service.
In addition, I should like to welcome the recent ruling by the Court of Justice to the effect that a postal service provider is entitled to enter into an agreement regarding the distribution of social welfare payments.
(PT) The Council agreed to the full opening of the market in postal services at EU level from 31 December 2010 during the Portuguese Presidency, applying competition rules to what some say should be a public service to create an internal market in postal services.
'That's great', the Portuguese Prime Minister will say.
That decision, however, represents a great blow to the public postal services, particularly with the abolition of the reserved areas, setting in motion a process to dismantle them and subsequently hand them over to profit-driven transnationals, and at public expense to boot, jeopardising the rights of the nation and of workers in the sector.
If there were any doubts as to the true significance of the inclusion of the 'protocol on services of general interest' in the draft Treaty, this directive will dispel them: continuation of the dismantling and destruction of public services, threatening their ownership and provision by democratically managed and controlled public companies.
Hence our proposal to reject this directive.
(SV) Madam President, the post is one of the public services which the people of our countries, both old and young, value most highly.
Hence the formulation of the decision is absolutely vital.
In previous debates on the directive I have expressed fears that the needs of thinly populated areas might not be catered for.
It was not clear that the same service would be guaranteed for everyone.
On one occasion during question time with Commissioner McCreevy I was promised that there would be no change in the requirement to provide a universal service.
We now have a compromise which gives guarantees that those of us who live in thinly populated areas will have our post collected and delivered five days a week just like everyone else.
I will support the compromise to the Postal Directive tomorrow.
Let us hope that this leads to a better service, lower prices and a more effective postal system for everyone when we deregulate the single market in one further sector.
(NL) Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, most warmly for the work he has done.
He managed to get Parliament to agree on this difficult issue at first reading, even though both he and I felt that we should have gone a step further.
In the end, however, our united stance was what guided the Council, and so I too wholeheartedly agree with the common position.
Members of the Socialist and Green Groups have unfortunately got cold feet and cannot see the enormous opportunities that this directive will offer for new businesses and jobs.
I am absolutely convinced of this, and examples in a number of Member States back me up.
But everything will now depend on the European Commission keeping to the directive, so that it does not remain a dead letter.
If the directive is introduced, it will certainly achieve the aim of opening up the markets.
There will be better services for consumers, and not what Germany is doing, squeezing new players, and not just new players but new businesses too, new services, new jobs, out of the market on the pretext of social protection.
So I am happy with the response that I received yesterday from the European Commission.
I understand that the Commission is to investigate the situation in Germany.
I would urge you to do so, and quickly, because the new players on the German market are in serious trouble, and it would be absolutely terrible if things do not work out, as well as setting exactly the wrong precedent.
I predict that France and other countries will follow, and then we will achieve absolutely nothing in the end.
So the Commission has a huge responsibility here.
I hope that you will use every possible legal channel and also bring political pressure to bear to ensure that this directive is properly applied to the European postal market.
(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, postal services are of major importance to the economic and social life of communities.
Therefore we must guarantee the accessibility of postal services and above all we must ensure the quality of those services.
Full liberalization of the postal service market, including deliveries weighing less than 50 grams, will allow increased competition, the emergence of new operators and the creation of new jobs.
However, I would like to dwell on several important issues.
First of all, it is essential for universal service to be guaranteed and for every citizen to be able to receive mail, irrespective of whether they live on a mountain top or on an island.
Secondly, we must ensure decent working conditions for people in this line of work; in particular, we must ensure that there are social guarantees concerning jobs and incomes.
Thirdly, for Member States to guarantee universal service, it is essential for them to define as soon as possible the means of funding the universal service.
The Directive allows Member States flexibility in this regard.
Fourth, as we live in an increasingly digitized world, it is essential that mail operators should diversify their activity so as to provide electronic services, as well.
Some Member States may have two extra years before postal services are fully liberalised.
No matter when liberalisation takes place, mail operators should have an effective management which should guarantee the high quality of those services.
(PL) Madam President, allowing private operators to provide postal services is a controversial decision.
Time will tell whether it is beneficial for consumers.
We must remember that in some of the new Member States with a lower level of development, institutions defending the interests of competition and consumers are weakly anchored in the public conscience.
There is a danger of disrupting the balance between the interests of capital and those of the consumer.
Setting the date at 2012 is therefore to be welcomed.
At the same time, I would suggest that before 2012 an analysis be made of the operation of the postal services market in those countries that have already adopted the new rules, with a view to identifying and preventing any irregularities in the remaining countries.
I also consider that an operator providing public services should be rewarded by the authorities and not as - the authors of the report suggest - merely compensated.
Years of work on this legislation have turned Mr Ferber's hair grey.
I trust the introduction of the new regulations will not cause him further distress and result in actual hair loss.
(DE) Madam President, it is surely very obvious that Mr Ferber's position and those of Mrs Wortmann-Kool and other Members are poles apart.
I believe it is wrong to treat privatisation and liberalisation of public services as the standard response to globalisation.
I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach.
In a referendum in Leipzig last weekend, 80% of the electorate, or rather of those who voted, rejected privatisation, thereby preventing the city council from carrying out any more privatisations for the next three years.
Let me also tell you that it is simply not the case that this directive we are discussing today incorporates real safeguards to protect people - employees - from social dumping.
We have seen how the introduction of minimum wages in the postal services in Germany has met with resistance from those very companies that have built the foundations of their business on rock-bottom wages.
I also have serious concerns about the implications of public institutions awarding contracts to such companies.
(PL) Madam President, work has been going on for over 15 years on liberalisation of the postal sector, which is worth over EUR 90 billion a year in the Union as a whole.
Today we are on the eve of voting on and inscribing such legislation in the history of the Union, and I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work.
The present version of the project is a broad compromise in which the main aims appear to have been achieved: full implementation of the internal market in postal services, mainly through termination of the mail monopoly, and assured continuation of a high-quality, low-cost public service.
The present version of the directive is not, however, as ambitious as the Commission's original proposal.
In the course of the deliberations, departure from the idea of liberalisation in favour of a gradual, rather cautious opening of the postal market for letters weighing less than 50 grammes became increasingly apparent. This is reflected in the compromise date for the entry into force of the directive, specifically in the case of new Member States and countries with small populations, small geographical areas and public service clauses.
The date of 31 December 2012 for Member States that joined the Union in 2004 seems unnecessarily distant.
I realise it is part of the negotiated compromise, which we accept, but it may well put a brake on the proposed changes.
I fear such a long period - over four years - for the entry into force of the directive will simply slow down changes which, in the case of a two-year period, for example, would take effect almost immediately.
Finally, I want to support Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡'s call for clauses concerning the blind and visually handicapped to be reinstated in the proposed directive.
They are missing from the present version.
(NL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members who have helped to achieve a result that is a considerable improvement on the original Commission proposal.
I understand why many of us want to leave it at that, but behind the positive elements that have been added to the directive there also lurk a number of dangers.
Nothing has actually been achieved yet, because the Member States are being given a lot of responsibility on two crucial points.
Firstly, there are still a lot of question marks over how the universal service is to be funded.
The Member States have a number of options here, but it is not always clear whether these really work.
In many cases this will lead to all sorts of disputes, including legal ones.
I therefore feel it would be useful to make two things clear: firstly, that the Member States are under an obligation to guarantee the universal service and funding for it whatever the circumstances, and secondly, that the Member States must be required to get their house in order and to prepare for this new situation thoroughly and in good time.
The second important point is the social field.
Here it is important to point out that this directive allows the Member States to require all postal operators, through a licensing system, to comply with the same collective agreements, for instance, or other minimum standards.
This is a good idea, but it is still only optional, and it will be applied differently from one country to another.
In a word, I think the directive could be tightened up, and this has nothing to do with having cold feet, but reflects the fact that a free market has to be regulated and liberalisation needs to be carefully prepared.
(EL) Madam President, we are dissatisfied with the European Commission, the Council and our rapporteur, because they have made no reference to fluctuations in the number of workers in the sector, working conditions, working hours or pay.
Similarly, provision has been made neither for an effective check on tariff policies for businesses, nor for the private monopoly situations in parcel transport and express post.
Furthermore, the report stresses the stable employment in Member States, despite local fluctuations, but no data has been produced to demonstrate this.
In these circumstances, then, it is not possible to make a proper evaluation in the interests of workers.
Finally, it should be emphasised that the Council has, in a certain sense, ratified Parliament's amendments while allowing for plenty of discussion on the social consequences both for employees of services and for consumers.
(DE) Madam President, the accomplishment of the internal market in postal services amply illustrates the truth of the saying 'Good things come to those who wait'.
Even I can support this draft on the table, the result of fifteen years of hard bargaining.
I happen to be one of those who would rather have preserved the monopoly of national postal administrations for letters below the 50-gramme threshold.
Now this last stage in the controlled deregulation of the postal market is set to take effect on 1 January 2011.
In view of the structure of the postal services in Luxembourg, the statutory requirement to employ volunteers from the armed forces in the public service and the resulting costs, I could not have subscribed to rapid and insufficiently controlled deregulation of the market in postal services, because that could have had intolerable consequences for postal staff and customers.
For the first reading, I therefore asked the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to allow for a two-year extension of the transposition deadline for small countries with relatively few inhabitants so that they could continue to limit the provision of certain services to the universal-service provider, and I thank him for his understanding.
I had discreetly circumscribed this arrangement in order to ensure that Luxembourg benefited from the exemption, but the Ministers preferred to preclude any misunderstanding by naming the relevant countries.
This keeps us safe.
The important thing is that the universal-service requirement guarantees the collection of mail and its rapid delivery to the designated residential or business address on each working day, even in remote or sparsely populated areas.
The external funding that might be needed to cover the net cost of the universal service, and hence the question of affordable rates, has also been satisfactorily regulated.
Lastly, the best possible measures have been taken to safeguard permanent skilled jobs with universal-service providers and to guarantee adherence to terms of employment and social-security schemes based on existing legal provisions or collective agreements, contrary to what the Left would have us believe.
They ought to read the wording of the draft.
It also expressly stipulates that preparations for the deregulation of the postal market must take account of social considerations.
On the motion tabled by our philanthropic missionaries regarding free postal services for the visually impaired, I personally do not see why wealthy people with impaired vision should send their mail free of charge at the taxpayer's expense.
In any case, those who propose this amendment are barking up the wrong tree, because it is the Member States that guarantee such arrangements.
SubsidiaritÃ© oblige!
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the gradual opening up of the postal services market is an important milestone in achieving the internal market.
It will contribute to ending special rights within the postal sectors, and it will set a specific and irrevocable date for opening the market, ensuring a sustainable, high level of universal service.
Opening the market will intensify competition, and so the level of service can be improved with regard to quality, price and opportunities for choice.
This measure will promote the harmonisation of the fundamental principles relating to the regulation of postal services, and will probably produce lower tariffs as well as better and more innovative services, and greater conditions for growth and employment will still be created.
The amendment to the Directive is the result of an exemplary compromise, a compromise that took into account the differences arising from the historical and economical characteristics of the Member States.
It pays regard to the fact that preparing for liberalisation requires more time in some Member States, mainly those in Central Eastern Europe.
At the same time, taking into account the interests of others and in order to prevent distortion of competition in the market in countries where the postal sector is already fully liberalised, the postal services of countries that are not yet opening their market may not provide services until the derogation deadline at the end of December 2012.
I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his work, but naturally thanks are also due to Mr Simpson, the shadow rapporteur.
(PT) I congratulate Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson for the quality of their report and all those Members and parties involved for their openness during the negotiating procedure.
This liberalisation of the market in postal services is still far from achieving a competitive market in which consumers and companies are the biggest winners.
I therefore argued that the Commission's approach might not sufficiently guarantee the universal service.
I accordingly supported the shadow rapporteur Mr Simpson's position on the need to guarantee the universal service and to establish a compensation fund, and on the commitment to open up postal services below 50 grammes in 2010, or in special cases, such as the new Member States with outermost regions, by 31 December 2012.
I am also pleased with regard to those states with the special provisions included, though I must point out that they may not be sufficient, in which case additional measures will be required.
In terms of employment, I am delighted with the addition introduced previously to make it obligatory for a report to be submitted on the overall development of employment in the sector, the working conditions applied by all operators within a Member State, and any future measures.
I am very pleased with the common position achieved, but support the amendments submitted by my colleagues Mr Savary, Mr El Khadraoui and Mrs Ayala Sender, among others, and by my parliamentary group, since they reinforce the idea of the need for a considered process of liberalisation to reinforce equal universal access, development and employment.
For all these reasons I urge the plenary to support this report and the Council, and to support Parliament's position.
Madam President, Parliament should pass our amendments to restore compulsory free postal services for blind people to this directive.
Mr Vizjak, you say you were open and flexible and yet you completely rebuffed Parliament's amendments on compulsory free services for blind people.
We have heard Mr Orban say tonight, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, that our amendments do not bring added value to postal users.
Mr Orban, are not blind people postal users?
And is not the real added value you are talking about the actual added costs that blind people are going to have to be forced to pay?
To Mr Ferber, I regret to say that I believe you were wrong to make a deal, dropping this requirement which Parliament passed at first reading.
Yesterday you also failed to answer my question: is there a threat to blind people's services?
I hope you will today.
Because if there is not, what objection can you have to putting this into the directive?
If there is, that shows why we need to put it in.
In Italy, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, the post office, not the government, provides this free service.
New and existing providers in a liberalised market will inevitably seek to cut costs; blind people must not be the victims.
After liberalisation in New Zealand, blind people's services were ended.
We must not let it happen here.
Finally, for those who tell us that they are sympathetic to disabled people but this is not the right place or way to do it, you told us that about the Lifts Directive and the Buses and Coaches Directive, other single market legislation.
But Parliament said no, and we insisted on binding access for disabled people.
Today, again, we must insist on compulsory rights for Europe's blind and partially-sighted people.
(SK) Madam Chairman, thank you for giving me the floor.
The common position adopted by the Council does not include the amendments concerning free postal services for blind people in spite of the fact that at first reading the European Parliament voted to maintain free postal services for blind people following liberalisation of the European postal market.
I intended to vote in favour of Amendment 3 tabled by Eva Lichtenberger, in which Parliament's position at first reading is reiterated.
Following today's discussion with the rapporteur, Marcus Ferber, I was informed that approval of any of the amendments would jeopardise a previously agreed compromise on the adoption of the Directive on accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services at second reading, which could mean having to enter into conciliation.
I realise the importance of adopting this Directive.
When transposed into national law, the Member States will be able to solve this issue in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
I would therefore urge all of the Member States to provide free postal services for blind and partially sighted people in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and universal service obligations.
(PL) Madam Chairman, I would also like to support the amendments concerning visually impaired persons.
If the European Union declares to all and sundry that it tolerates no discrimination, then access to postal services must also be equal for all, and for the visually impaired that means assisted access.
Madam President, this directive is yet another example of how one-size-fits-all, incompetent EU legislation adversely affects the lives of British people.
This directive is the reason why post offices are closing and why postal workers will lose their jobs.
Post offices play a vital role in the community, especially for the old, the poor, the immobile and the disabled.
This is just one of a multitude of EU laws that have damaged, and will continue to damage, my country.
The British people know this, and this is one of the reasons why they are being denied a referendum on the EU Constitution.
If it is ratified, they can look forward to a lot more of the same.
Madam President, I believe the rapporteur has, in general - though not entirely - achieved a fair balance.
The universal service provision will ensure consumers have full access to postal services and Member States still have the flexibility to determine the most effective and efficient mechanism to guarantee the USO.
The USO will also ensure that sufficient access points are established to take full account of the needs of users in rural areas and sparsely populated areas, and I know this will be welcome, particularly in my own country, Ireland.
Initially, I have to say I had some reservations about the impact on postal workers, but Member States still have the authority to regulate employment conditions and collective bargaining in the sector, where this does not lead to unfair competition.
Finally, I want to say that I support the amendment that there should be an obligation to supply free services for blind and partially-sighted persons.
I disagree with Commissioner Orban - or is it Commissioner McCreevy? - I do believe this will provide added value, because, in a fully liberalised market, free services for blind or partially-sighted persons will disappear, and it will be added value if we can guarantee to them that they will continue.
(SK) Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Chairman.
First of all, I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report, thanks to which the long-awaited Directive will soon enter into force.
This Directive will mean that from 1 January 2009 the internal market in Community postal services will be fully accomplished.
I am particularly pleased that the principle of subsidiarity has been maintained and that concrete implementation has been left to the Member States, which will draw up legislation that is specific to their own situation.
However, I would also like to stress the social aspect of this legislation as regards the rights of disabled people, especially blind or partially sighted people, and their right to avail of free postal services.
I call on my fellow Members to support the relevant amendments that were tabled in plenary this week and that were adopted by Parliament at first reading.
These services are appropriate and crucial for this section of the population: people with exceptionally low income, areas with very high unemployment levels and people in difficult social situations, not to mention those affected by social exclusion.
Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.
I congratulate the rapporteur for the work done.
I think the public believe this is already happening because in many Member States there is not a postal service of equal value between the regions.
I am glad to see that there will be subsidiarity on this issue and the Member States will decide the best way to implement the principle of a deregulated market.
I need to support my intergroup chairman, Richard Howitt, on the issue of disability.
Unfortunately, the point was raised that rich blind people will benefit.
Sadly, there are too few rich blind people in Europe and globally.
I wish we could stand up and say that they were all rich and, indeed, famous, but it is not the case.
I think we have to make a big stand on this, just to show that, while Europe is about freedom of movement of capital and services, it is also concerned about those who have no voice and those who have no sight.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Today's lively debate has shown that there are many justifiably differing opinions about the regulation of this traditional and oldest public service.
It was also right that many different opinions and concerns were expressed.
However, we must stress that the proposed text is a balanced compromise between, on the one hand, the opening up of the internal market in postal services, securing competitiveness and the added value that comes with it, and, on the other hand, consumer protection and protection of the rights of consumers and the rights of vulnerable consumer groups and those living in remote areas.
In short, in the Council's estimation, it is a good compromise text and I would like to express my support for that opinion.
We also appreciate the intention behind certain amendments, but through discussions in previous debates a final compromise solution came to light.
We are therefore of the opinion that this is a good text and I hope you will exercise much political wisdom tomorrow when you have the final chance to support this text.
The Commission. - First of all I would like to extend my thanks to all the participants in the debate and stress that this debate has proven the MEPs' great interest in this dossier.
This interest is closely linked to the crucial role that postal services play in the European economy and in the everyday life of European citizens.
I would like to stress that the completion of this process will ensure a consistently high quality of universal service for all European citizens and for the business community.
The main goal of postal reform is to benefit all consumers and postal service users, including special needs groups.
In this context, I paid particular attention to the contributions of several Members who spoke about the continuation of free service provision for the blind and partially sighted.
The European Commission is particularly sympathetic to these concerns.
We believe that the liberalisation of the market will not change this, and that international obligations will continue to be met in full.
I would like to underline that the common position specifies that market liberalisation will not prevent the provision of free services to the blind and partially sighted.
Under Article 23 of the Directive, the European Commission must prepare a report on the application of this Directive, including information about the groups mentioned above.
The Commission believes that the Directive as it now stands, in the current format to which the European Parliament has contributed significantly, is the best legal framework, that will lead to high quality and sustainability in European postal services, while complying with international obligations.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the report, as prepared by Mr Markus Ferber and adopted by the Committee on Transport by a large majority, should be supported.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to make just a few remarks.
Firstly, I should be happier if those Members who delivered impassioned speeches for the whole world to hear would at least stay in the chamber for the rest of the debate.
That did rather disappoint me, I must say.
I am referring specifically to Members such as Mrs Lichtenberger.
Secondly, I must point out that we are talking here about liberalisation and not privatisation.
The proprietary structure of existing postal services does not interest the European Union and is not mentioned in this directive.
Thirdly, let me say that, 500 years ago when the first postal services were created, it was private undertakings that provided postal services.
Not until later did governments decide they could do it better.
So let us have no distortions of history please.
Fourthly, I should like to remind the House that government monopolies are also abused.
I am glad that Mrs Zimmer drew attention to that problem.
In point of fact, she comes from a region in which the state most certainly abused its postal monopoly until 1990, to the detriment of innocent people.
This is another point that needs to be made forcefully in the present debate.
Let me get one thing straight: we did not forget blind people in this legislation.
They are included, but they are included in a way that accords with the spirit of this directive.
Through its provisions, the European Union is telling the Member States that they are responsible for the universal service and for funding the fulfilment of universal-service obligations, that they are responsible, through licensing and authorisation procedures, for ensuring that certain services, such as postal services for blind people, can be maintained in the long term.
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his announcement that the Commission intends to give consideration to this matter in its report under Article 23 of the Directive.
We have not forgotten anything; we have not forgotten blind people.
Nevertheless, I do wonder whether blind people should have free access, guaranteed by European legislation, and wheelchair users should not.
That is something else to ponder.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 31.1.2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the approval, at second reading, of the Council common position amending the 1997 postal services directive with a view to full accomplishment of the internal market in postal services and I congratulate my worthy German colleague, Markus Ferber, for the huge amount of work he has done.
I am pleased that the Council accepted all the key aspects of the European Parliament's position, particularly deferral of general market opening until 31 December 2010, with a two-year extension for those Member States that have joined the Union since 2004; the principle of a universal service comprising at least one delivery and collection five days a week for every EU citizen, with a sufficient number of access points maintained in rural, remote or sparsely populated regions; and observance of subsidiarity with regard to social considerations - a matter on which I hope the social partners will work at European level.
I am sorry that provision has not been included for the creation of a European regulatory mechanism.
My final point is this: I am keen to see operators reaching agreement soon on the introduction of a European stamp for 50 g letters and I intend to take a policy initiative to that end at an early date.
in writing. - (RO) The common position satifies the demands made by Parliament in its votes for the first reading, as well as the amendments proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
However, the Commission has yet to provide clear research on the impact that the liberalisation of postal services is likely to have on employment.
In its opinion, the Committee asked for an impact assessment of the effects of this measure on the five million or more jobs related to or depending on postal services.
This study is facilitated by the fact that postal services have already been liberalised in several EU Member States, such as the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands.
Experience in those countries has not so far indicated that liberalisation has led to an increase in the number of jobs in this sector, or to an increase in their quality.
I believe that certain protection mechanisms should be allowed for situations where the emergence of new postal service providers on the market will lead to massive redundancy.
One of the mechanisms available to the companies and Member States affected could be the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the road to the liberalisation of postal services is getting longer, and for that the European Parliament is partly to blame, having extended the European Commission's deadline by two years.
The positions taken by national delegations reflect the varying situation on the markets of the 27 countries.
Sweden, the United Kingdom and Finland, as front runners of the open market, as well as Germany and the Netherlands, which have gone a long way in that direction, all see the final deadline as a victory for protectionism.
Starting from their model of a state-controlled economy, the new Member States consider not only the original proposal of 2009 but also the compromise deadline of 2011 as a threat to jobs in the postal sector.
Poland, for example, has some 100 000 people employed by Poczta Polska, which is incapable of facing open competition in the medium term.
Having found allies in public services in western Europe, first and foremost France's La Poste, they have succeeded in negotiating special conditions that postpone the free market in practice to the end of 2012.
In the event, the corporate interest of the postal workers has prevailed over that of the customers, who were sorely tried during the Christmas peak period in December 2007, when the incapability of the postal monopoly was harshly demonstrated.
The slow progress made in liberalising this sector of the European market, which began as far back as 1989 with the first draft directive, shows the strength of the corporate interests defending the status quo against an extension of the public interest.
in writing. - Yet again we have an ideologically driven proposal, this time on postal services.
There has been no assessment of the social impact it will have, and no serious consultation with post office management, with employees or with consumers.
There is no demand, no logic and no justification for the liberalisation of postal services.
People do not want to be presented with an array of competing post offices marketing their products.
They do not want to see their local post offices closed because the market offers insufficient profit for the private postal companies which will swamp the market, driving public operators like An Post to the wall.
People want a reliable postal service which will deliver their mail with the minimum of fuss and which will keep local post offices at the centre of the communities they serve.
How can people take seriously the idea the EU is promoting a social Europe when this proposal drives yet another nail in its coffin?
It is time to call a halt to the ideologically driven forced march towards liberalisation and privatisation.
People in Ireland have the opportunity to stop this by voting no to the Lisbon Treaty.
in writing. - (ET) I support the market being liberalised as quickly as possible and I welcome the directive which accomplishes the establishment of the internal market in postal services.
The closure of small post offices in Estonia has generated anger among people, but it is clear that with the implementation of new technologies such as the Internet the demand for a traditional postal service has fallen.
Where there is competition a new business in Internet-based services may arise, and this is to be welcomed.
I also understand the need for a known deadline in the Member States.
It is therefore important for the principle of reciprocity to apply when allowing Member States to refuse to open their market to postal service providers from neighbouring States whose providers are protected by law.
The important thing is for the universal postal service also to be guaranteed for everyone, including people in outlying areas and islands.
The postal service must be affordable, high-quality and accessible to all.
It is necessary to draw up plans for a cost-oriented universal postal service, since the concept is viewed differently in different Member States.
I believe that there are grounds for demanding that cost considerations of all services should be excluded from the universal postal service indicator.
in writing. - (DE) EU-wide liberalisation of postal services will happen - not in 2009, as originally planned, but in 2011.
In economic terms, the postal sector is very important, and it also impacts on other sectors of the economy.
As in all other areas of economic activity, more competition in the realm of postal deliveries makes sense.
Nor will businesses be the only beneficiaries, for consumers will reap great benefits too.
This will not be the case, however, unless the basic conditions are right.
In other words, it must be guaranteed that letters will be delivered as efficiently as ever and at reasonable prices.
Care must be taken to ensure that the blanket provision of postal services is guaranteed in the long term - and guaranteed everywhere, including remote areas.
Particular importance attaches to good working conditions and, above all, job security for all those who work in the postal services.
It is also important that the same conditions should govern the operations of all postal-service providers.
It was firmly established from the outset that this was not to be a cut-throat liberalisation.
We must create a good and sustainable arrangement for everyone - the postal companies, their employees and, of course, their customers.
in writing. - (FI) Opening up postal services to free competition will inevitably mean a worsening of services, especially in sparsely populated countries like Finland.
The post office should be a public service, and we need to guarantee it has adequate funding by using the cash earned from services which are 'easy' to manage to assist in areas which are more 'difficult'.
A nation that wishes to preserve its unity and its sense of community will not privatise public postal services.
We also rely on a public service to safeguard protection of privacy and ensure the kind of security we demand of the post office.
Privatisation might result in an unsound staffing policy, which will damage confidence in the post office.
That is why our Group is voting against the position on privatisation adopted by the Council.
in writing. - The liberalisation of postal services is an important area of the European internal market.
Throughout the discussion we have had many concerns about universal postal services.
I think we can build on the experience of some European postal markets, which are already liberalised.
