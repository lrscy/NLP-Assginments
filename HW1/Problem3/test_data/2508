We defend human dignity and human rights.
We, in the European Parliament, are utterly convinced that the death penalty is irreconcilable with these.
I urge us all, the institutions of the European Union and the Member States, to stand up, the United Nations, for the abolition of the death penalty.
If we want to achieve our goals, we must continue to work on building a European Union that is capable of action.
We must endow ourselves with a constitution that ensures that we can represent our values and interests in Europe and as a respected partner in the world.
The great speech given by Louise Weiss on 17 July 1979, here in Strasbourg, in her capacity as Oldest Member of the first directly elected European Parliament still rings in my ears.
She said: 'In any event, let us never forget that we are heirs and executors at one and the same time: the heirs of an intellectual world and its executors for the benefit of coming generations'
I cannot put it better myself.
Our feelings today are scarcely any different from those expressed in 1979 and yet at the same time we live in a world of new challenges that are peculiarly our own.
The idea of uniting Europe has for the most part been carried through successfully since the signing of the Treaty of Rome 50 years ago.
It has become the outward expression of one of the happiest periods in our long European history.
To begin with, after the Second World War, the idea of Europe drew its strength from the desire for peace and freedom.
Then strengthening prosperity and achieving social equality became the tasks and motivations for European union.
In both ideas Europe remained true to itself, as the unifying of our continent afforded a unique opportunity for the two halves of the continent, which had been divided for far too long, to grow together in freedom.
Today, Europe is motivated by its citizens' desire for security, and is respected by them on that account.
This is our very serious concern, thrust upon us, unasked for but unavoidable, by the need to combat terrorism.
For this we need answers to the questions that weigh heavily on the minds of our citizens.
The need for security also includes the task of providing employment and social protection in a rapidly changing world.
We cannot make ourselves safe from globalisation.
We must construct a cushion by strengthening our competitiveness while retaining the European social model.
It includes not just talking about the dramatic change in climate, but taking the necessary measures - together with our partners in the world - and enforcing them with determination, before it is too late.
Security involves such things as a shared supply of energy and a common immigration policy that takes as much account of human rights as of the need for integration in our society.
We must not allow people to go on dying in the waters of the Mediterranean.
We cannot find the security we seek in a world that is going up in flames, in which people live in poverty and subject to social pressure, a world in which disorder prevails and in which the natural environment continues to be destroyed.
If we in Europe wish to live in security, we must commit ourselves as a partner to every aspect of the world's security, and we must be aware of the fact that, without European solutions, most of the challenges faced by this continent and the world can no longer be met.
Paradoxical though it may seem at first sight, Europe's unity has always been strengthened by crises.
I am not saying that we need crises because we are incapable of extracting good results from good circumstances.
The European Union needs a new departure, a renewal.
The road is a hard one; that is true, but I am firmly convinced that our continent is better equipped today for its future in the world of the 21st century than it was 15 or 20 years ago.
We ourselves shall be judged on how well we set the newly achieved European unity on a lastingly good and safe path.
Politicians, such as ourselves, are expected to exercise leadership; we must give better reasons than we have so far for why Europe is good for us all, what added value European union brings and what the aims of our efforts are.
We must overcome the impression that European policies only have a technical function, with no long-term goal or enduring meaning.
We must persuade by what we do, and if we are to do that, we must concentrate on essentials.
It is our common task to prepare for the future in such a sustainable way that it is as safe as humans can make it for our children and our grandchildren.
For this we need to make a new start, for a better Europe, a stronger Europe, a Europe that looks to the future.
Above all, though, we need a Europe that believes in itself, that draws its strength from its values and that wants to, and can, be a good partner in the world.
Without the media we cannot convey Europe to the public.
I would like specifically to thank the correspondents and journalists here in Strasbourg for their fair and objective reporting, but I appeal to the national media, particularly the television channels, whether private or public, to play their part in relations with the European public.
It is no longer appropriate to the times to portray European union only from a national perspective.
I ask the national broadcasting corporations to open their studios to European themes and to invite Members of the European Parliament there as guests to talk about them.
(Applause)
We need a new pact between the citizens of Europe and their political institutions in the European Union.
The 'Citizens' Europe' and the credibility of the European institutions depend upon each other.
The 'Better Lawmaking' programme can make a contribution to this if it achieves more democratic oversight, transparency in the Council, reliable transposition into national law, social, environmental, economic and administrative impact assessment, and simplification of the legal texts.
When planning a piece of European legislation, we should always ask ourselves: Does it serve people and the environment? Is it necessary in the light of the subsidiarity principle?
Does it make us more competitive?
Does it reduce red tape and costs? Only if these questions can be answered in the affirmative should we, the legislators in the European Parliament, go into action.
We, the European Parliament, should not only be at pains to represent citizens' interests.
We should also show our respect for the dedication of European citizens who by their work are raising Europe's profile - in Europe and in the world.
We should introduce a European Parliament award for that.
Why, too, for that matter, should we not also pay particular honour to commitment on the part of young people to the European idea?
High-ranking European awards have had such a good effect on public awareness, why do we not create awards for the younger generation, for young Europeans who are showing exemplary dedication to the European ideal?
In national museums, European history is nearly always represented in purely national terms.
I would like to suggest a locus for history and for the future, where the concept of the European idea can continue to grow.
I would like to suggest the founding of a 'House of European History'.
It should not be a dry, boring museum, but a place where our memory of European history and the work of European unification is jointly cultivated, and which at the same time is available as a locus for the European identity to go on being shaped by present and future citizens of the European Union.
A 'House of European History' such as this should be established in the seat of the European institutions and should network with comparable foundations in the Member States.
The 'Declaration on the Future of Europe', to be adopted jointly by the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission on 25 March 2007 in Berlin - an event over which you, Mrs Merkel, will preside - could create the conditions for this.
The European Union is the largest grouping of nations in the world, consisting of 27 nations with almost 500 million citizens.
Europe is a complex continent, one that presents us with enormous challenges, and the European Union can no longer be governed by the instruments of current Treaty law, which have become inadequate.
If our community of values is to endure, it needs fundamental reform.
The Constitutional Treaty strengthens both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, strengthening both parliamentary life and democracy.
Communal self-administration as the basis of our European democratic order is recognised for the first time.
The distribution of powers defines European competencies.
I will be quite frank in saying that I say to you quite openly that I do not understand people who on the one hand criticise 'Brussels' - and sometimes that is just as justified as it is to criticise national politics - but at the same time reject the Constitutional Treaty, which is the very instrument we need to help eradicate and rectify the perceived deficiencies.
(Applause)
This House stands by the Constitutional Treaty - about that we must not allow there to be any doubt.
We want to help make the principles and substance of the Constitutional Treaty, including its values, a legal and therefore political reality.
The consensus arrived at here in the European Parliament on the services directive and on the limits of the European Union's ability to enlarge is a constructive response to people's concerns.
The 'Declaration on the Future of Europe' scheduled for 25 March 2007 in Berlin could be another important milestone on this road.
At its heart should be commitment to our values and to the necessary reforms; an undertaking to rise jointly to the challenges of the future of which I spoke earlier; a commitment to solidarity among the nations of Europe and to the supremacy of law as the basis for our actions.
No country, no nation of the European Union is to be left alone with its fundamental problems.
That also, however, rules out national selfishness.
Anyone who serves only the interests of his own country will ultimately squander these as well, because he will destroy the solidarity that is needed if they are to be defended.
(Applause)
We intend to help to ensure that under the German Council Presidency a road map and a mandate are agreed at the summit in Brussels on 21 and 22 June, as the outcome of which full implementation of the substantive core of the European Constitution will be in place by the next European Parliament elections in 2009.
I would like to remind you that the Constitutional Treaty was signed by all 27 governments and has already been adopted by 18 countries.
Of course, we have to respect the results of the referenda.
Quite apart from that, though, if a change of government in a country calls into question that which has been agreed by the European Union, not only is society split in that nation, but our continent, which is already quite complicated enough, is increasingly incapacitated.
We must commit to our European legal principles: pacta sunt servanda - treaties are to be honoured.
Our will to implement these necessary reforms must be strong and determined, and we must drive forward these reforms in such a way that the nations of the European Union are brought together rather than driven apart.
We insist that the European Parliament must be appropriately involved in the work.
We in this House must also be prepared to reform ourselves.
In the first instance that will make great demands on every one of us, for example in terms of being present for votes and important debates.
As we are all aware, a lot remains to be done in this respect.
I wish the House were always as full as it is this morning, although there is still room for a few more, and so, on Thursday, the day after tomorrow, I shall be submitting a proposal to the group chairmen for a comprehensive reform of the way this House works.
The Conference of Presidents, in other words the group chairmen - and they are important people - have already set up a working party on how to improve the way we work.
I can see smiles on the faces of the Group Chairmen, who are pleased to hear that confirmed.
I ask you, fellow-Members, to start work and to present us with its results as soon as you possibly can.
This House is efficiently run, and I should like to thank Secretary-General Julian Priestley, who will be leaving office on 1 March after ten years, most warmly and sincerely for the great dedication he has shown!
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about the fact that, from time to time, and perhaps more frequently than that, there is cause to criticise the administration; we positively welcome such criticism.
Those, though, who have worked closely with Mr Priestley and his staff come to recognise just how aware of their responsibilities they are and how great their commitment is, and I have never known any of them to act contrary to the President's intentions.
I do of course hope that things will go on like that throughout my term of office, and, in order that we may all go in the same direction, I shall maintain close contact.
My warm thanks, then, go to Mr Julian Priestley, and let me say that the only yardstick by which the administration should be judged is the way that it serves our European convictions - without party political bias, fairly and objectively.
I can tell this House that Europe's future is largely dependent on successful coexistence between the cultures and religions within the European Union and between the European Union and our neighbours, first and foremost in the Arab and Islamic world.
We must therefore do our part to ensure that dialogue among cultures and religions is the hallmark of Europe.
We live in the continent of the three great cultures and religions - the Christian, the Jewish and the Islamic, and we have fellow citizens who come from one of the world's other great cultures and who are adherents of the world's other religions.
We, in this European Parliament, must encourage and support examples of European civil society that are dedicated to dialogue between cultures.
In Seville I made the acquaintance of the work of the 'Tres Culturas' organisation, and I say to you - not only to honour my Spanish predecessor, Mr Josep Borrell - that we must actively support every example of coexistence in Europe of Christians, Muslims and Jews - and also, of course, of those who do not belong to any of these religions.
This is a crucial investment in our intellectual development.
At the same time, it is the best contribution we can make to encouraging dialogue between cultures across the Mediterranean and beyond, to the Middle East and North Africa.
We do not want the 'clash of civilisations', we want peace in freedom and justice among all nations and beliefs.
This means building an intellectual and cultural bridge across the Mediterranean.
This dialogue must be grounded in tolerance and truth.
Tolerance does not mean accepting anything and everything.
Tolerance means peaceful coexistence through respecting the convictions of the other while maintaining one's own.
On one of my many visits to Arab countries, I was asked by a senior Islamic dignitary how Muslims live in Europe.
My answer was that they are often not sufficiently integrated, but that they can live out their own beliefs and have their own mosques and places of prayer.
I went on to ask him if it was true that in his country a Muslim man or woman could be put to death for converting to Christianity.
The fact that I received no answer was an answer in itself.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am firmly convinced that the Dialogue of Cultures can only succeed if it is based on truth and mutual tolerance.
(Applause)
It is my intention to visit the European Union's neighbouring Arab states and, when visiting European Union countries, to try to have talks with ethnic minorities, particularly their younger members.
We have an important parliamentary institution for dialogue with the Middle East, including Israel and the Arab world, in the shape of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.
We must use this institution effectively for peace, partnership and, if possible, friendship.
Last weekend, the four presidents who govern the Europe-Mediterranean Assembly, namely the presidents of the parliaments of Egypt, Tunisia - which is currently presiding - of Greece, and I myself, met in Tunis and agreed that the dialogue between cultures and the problem of unemployment in the countries around the Mediterranean would be the theme of the forthcoming dialogue in March, and that we wanted, in June, to give particular attention to the Middle East and to the peace process there, which we hoped would actually be up and running at the time.
As soon as circumstances permit, I shall visit Israel, Palestine and Lebanon.
I am grateful for the invitation I have received to address the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset.
When inviting speakers to address the European Parliament, we should place the emphasis on the Dialogue of Cultures.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is the task of us all to strengthen democracy and the European parliamentary system, and so we intend to collaborate with the national parliaments in constructive partnership for the good of our nations and of the whole European Union.
Helmut Kohl, honorary citizen of the European Union, once said, 'We do not have much time.
The world we live in is not prepared to wait for us to solve our internal problems'.
He was right.
To this I would add that failure to act, indifference, would be the greatest wrong we could commit.
At the end of my term of office a new European Parliament will be elected.
If we do convincing work and if good things are said about Europe in the national capitals as well, then the turnout for the European Parliament elections will go up again.
It should be our ambition to achieve this.
Our work is often unglamorous, it can be stressful and not particularly spectacular, but our goals are great, and so much is expected of us.
We seek to live up to that.
In this task I would like to represent you all in such a way that the dignity of the European Parliament, the unity of our continent of Europe and the effectiveness of the European Union are strengthened.
I ask you for your help, thank you for your confidence and hope that together we can achieve our goals.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, Mr Poettering, former Presidents and present Members of the European Parliament, Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, you, Mr President, are one of the Members of your House who witnessed its first hours; it could, I think, be said that you have helped shape this House in its remarkable growth from its earliest infancy to becoming what is now a very emancipated parliament with confident Members, clear party structures and parliamentary groups, and hence a demanding partner in European debate, and one we cannot imagine ourselves having to do without.


The development of this Parliament is one of the European Union's success stories, and we now know that without the work of the European Parliament, much of what we have achieved for Europe's citizens would have taken another form.
I would like to call to mind, from recent history, the work on the chemicals legislation REACH, the elaboration of the services directive and the debates on the financial perspective, in which we constantly strove to set forward-looking priorities and managed to push them through, in tough negotiations with the Council and the Commission in some cases.
In your speech today, you drew our attention to the next European Parliament elections in 2009.
We will face the citizens of Europe together - we as representatives of the nation states and you as representatives of the European Parliament - and will have to give an account to almost 500 million people of what concerns us, in what way this Europe of ours benefits them and why it matters.
It has to do with peacekeeping, with solidarity within the European Union and with prosperity and social security in a global world in which competition has become much tougher for all of us.
It is for this reason that we must not lose sight of the whole picture in the midst of all the specific routine parliamentary work.
With your work programme you have emphasised the role which you envisage for the European Parliament as well as for the European Union in the world.
We agree that the issue of the constitutional treaty will be the crucial issue for the 2009 elections - both in connection with our self-perception and our relationship to our citizens, and, secondly, also in terms of a 27-member European Union's capacity for action.
It is for that reason that the German EU Presidency, together with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States, will do everything in its power to set a timetable for completing this project so that people in 2009 know what kind of Europe they are voting for and how this Europe will be able to act in future.
(Applause)
My plea is that we should continue our discussion on how we can further clarify the structure of the respective relations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council, even though it still sparks controversy in some areas.
For that reason too, as I mentioned in my opening speech, I have put the issue of discontinuity on the agenda, because I believe this topic will be important in the longer term.
How does a newly elected Parliament - or, for that matter, a newly-elected Commission - perceive itself?
What has to be achieved, and how?
Even the Constitutional Treaty does not fully answer these questions, and that is why I believe the debate must go on.
(Muted applause)
Turning to the problems of substance, it is clear that the subject of energy will play a quite central role at the Spring Council on 8 and 9 March.
I would like, today, to tell you about our efforts to organise this Council meeting, but not before expressing my sincere thanks to the Commission, which has given us ambitious packages of directives and findings on energy and climate protection for the agenda.
In the upcoming councils to prepare for the Spring Council - the Competition Council and the Environment Council - we now have to establish the decisive conditions for a fruitful debate within the Council.
I support the goal of the Commission to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020 as long as we find international partners.
I believe that our international travels give us all encouragement to draw attention to the fact that Europe generates 15% of CO2 emissions, while 85% are generated outside the European Union.
Europe must be a pioneer - a goal to which I think we should commit ourselves - but Europe must also make clear that no problem illustrates more visibly than this one how this world interacts and that the action of one continent is not sufficient to dispel the threat posed to the whole of humanity.
(Applause)
We will have to hold discussions on developing a competitive internal market; we can already sense that these will be very difficult, but that will come as no surprise to anyone who has studied the subject.
We will not shy away from these debates, for a functioning internal market within the energy market is essential.
We intend to put the issue of energy efficiency on the agenda, and we will talk about renewable energies.
The German EU Presidency will appeal for the adoption of specific figures and reduction approaches which are binding.
I want to make it absolutely clear that no Member State can evade this responsibility.
For this reason the Federal Republic of Germany, if I may say so as Chancellor, has already had to make compromises with the Commission, and we did not find that easy.
We did this quite deliberately because I believe that each Member State must do its part.
It would be foolish to believe that climate protection works without anyone noticing, and that is why that erroneous belief must be abandoned.
(Applause)
We will have to give our attention to the topic of external energy policy, particularly in the negotiations on a cooperation agreement with Russia.
Here, too, I have to say that we hope and are working to ensure that these negotiations can commence.
We have not, alas, got that far yet, but I am optimistic that we will have taken a positive step forward by the time we meet for the EU-Russia Summit in May, and we will put the issue of 'better regulation' on the European Council agenda; here, too, I would ask for your House's support in order to ensure that we do not become bogged down in vague assurances, but that we commit ourselves to quantitative reduction objectives.
I am aware of the concerns and the fears that less regulation may also entail less protection.
That is not what we want, but there is room for improvement in the way in which we organise bureaucracy today, and I would add that, from the perspective of Europe's citizens, improvements are needed on that front. That does not mean that a regulation is not valid if we do not use the most complicated form to verify it.
(Applause)
Mr President, our consultations in connection with the declaration on the Europe of the future on 24 and 25 March are going well.
We intend that they should continue to do so.
In your comments you emphasised very clearly what people expect from the European Union with regard to its external relations and its security and defence policy, and I share your commitment to human rights, of which your House has a great tradition, and I am pleased to note your desire to make dialogue between cultures one of your priorities.
During my recent trip to the Middle East I was made aware of the great expectations which people have placed in the European Union and all its institutions.
One can, in the Middle East, almost physically feel the yearning for peace and the concern about Iran's nuclear programme.
In this area we have a great responsibility to do everything we can - with the players in the region as well as the United States of America and Russia, of course - to set in motion the peace process which people await with such longing.
I have said before, and will say again, that the end of the Cold War brought something unexpected into the lives of Europeans such as ourselves.
We have seen that today, now with twenty-seven Member States, we can again work and contend for peace and freedom in a democratic process with almost all European countries, even though it is not always easy.
This, the wonder of our age, should encourage us to strive for miracles and opportunities in other regions of the world.
That which Palestinians and Israelis have not experienced for decades - a life in peace, a life in two neighbouring countries which are not at war, a life with the prospect of prosperity - must also be our goal, because we have simply seen firsthand that peace and friendship can emerge from seemingly insurmountable differences.
This experience brings with it an obligation for us as Europeans to become involved in this process.
That is why I am very grateful that you, together with all your colleagues in the European Parliament, have set this as one of your priorities.
Mr President, you quoted Mr Helmut Kohl and said that we must hurry and cannot afford to constantly focus on ourselves.
For people in the European Union expect us to continue to shape this successful continent successfully in the age of globalisation in the interests of its citizens.
Millions, indeed billions, of people in the world expect the European Union, with its experience and prosperity, to do its part in enabling the world to enjoy more peace and more freedom.
Let us work together to that end.
Thank you for your speech; I look forward to good cooperation with your House.
(Applause)
My warm thanks to you, too, Chancellor Merkel, for that encouraging speech.
We will do everything in our power to ensure that the Council, the Commission and this House work together successfully for our continent, for the European Union.
President of the Commission. Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, former Presidents of the European Parliament, Presidents of the European institutions, honourable Members, this year we celebrate what the European Union has achieved over the last 50 years: a history which has seen the European Parliament increasingly come to embody European democracy.
I salute the presence here today of the former Presidents of the European Parliament.
On my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, I thank you all for your individual contributions to Europe.
I want to congratulate you, Mr President, for this initiative.
It is indeed important.
Some politicians believe the world did not exist before they were born.
I think that it is important that we who are serving our citizens through institutions keep this institutional memory.
A decent and civilised society pays homage to its history and respects the institutions.
I want to thank you for your speech, which had both vision and substance.
I share the views and commend the commitment.
Honourable Members, you have elected a President whose experience and commitment to our common European project is second to none.
Our European values underline the essence of the Europe we want and treasure: a Europe of peace, freedom, democracy, prosperity and justice.
The enlargement and integration of Europe to include 27 countries, free of war and free of totalitarianism, underlines the strength of these values and the lessons we have drawn from history: only through a shared undertaking are we able to provide the answers to our citizens in the global world of the 21st century.
Cultural and religious pluralism is a strong European value.
In this sense, I particularly welcome the emphasis by President Poettering on intercultural and religious dialogue.
The European Union is well placed to promote this dialogue.
We are steeped in diversity: diversity of traditions, of cultures, of language, of nations.
It is one of our precious gifts as Europeans.
We are to some extent a success in globalisation.
We, better than anyone, can shape this globalised world.
Dialogue is the way to ensure that diversity, far from causing division, enriches our unity.
I strongly believe that cultural diversity is a source of Europe's strength and of its ability to promote its values and interests in the world.
This dialogue has to be nurtured properly.
We intend to make next year's Year of Intercultural Dialogue the platform for this dialogue.
The Commission has long pursued a dialogue with religions, churches and communities of conviction, including those who do not have a religion.
I would like to take this forward in partnership with the European Parliament, as a visible demonstration of how European institutions, working together, take European integration forward.
To signal the importance of this dimension, last year I invited the President of the European Council to participate in a meeting with religious and church leaders.
I welcome the agreement to hold a summit in May this year, with the three Presidents of the European political institutions and leaders of the main religions and churches, which I will be honoured to host.
On 25 March, we have the opportunity to celebrate both our achievements and our values.
I am delighted that the European Parliament and the European Commission are playing a full part in the preparations for the Declaration on the future of Europe, following my proposal last May.
This Declaration, to be signed in Berlin, represents a real common point of reference - a confirmation of what the European Union is for and a mission statement for what we want to achieve in the 21st century.
Last month, in this House, I made proposals I would like to see in the Berlin Declaration.
I did not do it for the sake of making proposals.
They correspond to results that European citizens want us to achieve.
And I believe that it is by focusing on the goals of our common project that we will be able to reach a strong and enlarged consensus, including a consensus for an institutional settlement.
I am convinced that if Europeans see the European Union addressing globalisation, promoting economic growth and jobs, showing social solidarity, tackling climate change, increasing democratic legitimacy, bringing security to its citizens, defending our values and interests worldwide, then they will trust the European Union to reform itself to meet tomorrow's challenges and to deliver practical results.
We are all here to serve European citizens.
If we are to enjoy public consent, we need to target our activities on citizens' priorities and we need to work in a way that justifies their confidence, particularly respecting the principles of subsidiarity and transparency.
We set out exactly this approach in our Citizens' Agenda Communication of last May.
In order to achieve results, we need to preserve and develop institutional partnership; a partnership founded on the separation of competences, but also on the idea of institutional interdependence.
While respecting the autonomy of each institution, we need to stress the commonality of our European principles.
Despite some natural political and ideological differences, those who are committed to these principles should build a truly European partnership.
I believe that cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is working well.
It has proved itself against some stern tests.
Over the past year we have seen difficult dossiers resolved on services, chemicals, REACH and the financial perspectives, to name but a few.
This was a result of the three institutions working together with this spirit of partnership.
I am committed to working closely with you, Mr President, as well as with Chancellor Merkel and her successors at the helm of the Council.
I am convinced this is the best way to deliver the results our citizens demand.
The resolution of the debate on the future of Europe is not a sideshow: a more efficient and democratic European Union goes to the heart of our ability to deliver policies and results.
We all know this is what the constitutional treaty would have achieved, and there are limits to what we can achieve without it.
As I often say, we cannot build tomorrow's Europe with yesterday's tools.
The Nice Treaty is not enough.
(Applause)
I know that the European Parliament shares the commitment of the European Commission to give full support to the work of the German Presidency to find the right way forward.
The energy and commitment of Chancellor Merkel gives us real hope that we can find a consensus and make a compelling case for reform and progress to European citizens.
But the Presidency of the Council can only achieve results if it is supported by all the Member States.
Today, where all the European institutions are here reunited, I wish to repeat my call on Member States to find a solution as regards the constitutional treaty.
I know, after the 'no' votes in two Member States, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to ratify exactly the same text.
But let us not forget that all the governments signed the treaty.
This has at least a double implication.
First, Member States recognised that the Union needed to solve common problems and common challenges.
And we have not solved them yet.
Second, the act of signing a Treaty also implies a responsibility towards the other Member States, towards European institutions and towards European citizens.
It is the duty of all European governments to be constructive and active in the search to find a common solution.
And I would like to stress the word 'common'.
At a historical moment like this, when we celebrate the peaceful unity of Europe, we do not have the right to divide it again.
Regarding their positions about Europe, sometimes some politicians remind me of James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill.
John Stuart Mill once said that his father loved mankind in general, but hated each person in particular.
(Laughter)
We also see many politicians in Europe that profess their love for Europe in general, but then resist European solutions to energy, climate change, immigration and, of course, the institutional settlement.
Let us be frank: we do not need declarations of intent; what we need is commitment.
(Applause)
And we face decisive tests in the near future, starting with the energy and climate change package in the European Council in March.
I very much welcome the statement Chancellor Merkel made just now.
Let us be honest with ourselves.
Coherence is a requisite for credibility.
We are not credible when we say that we want to speak with one voice to the outside world on energy and we keep speaking among ourselves with 27 voices and 27 markets.
We are not credible when we set the fight against climate change as one of the most important priorities for Europe and afterwards we are not able to agree on specific goals for our policies.
So, we need to be coherent and credible.
Mr President, Madam Chancellor, honourable Members, I have high hopes for the period between now and the end of this parliamentary term.
I believe we have established the right priorities, and the right foundation of partnership to make them work.
I look forward to working closely with President Poettering and with this Parliament, and with colleagues in the European Council, to deliver real reform in Europe and real change for Europe's citizens to the end of this decade.
I believe we can build a Europe that will be able to shape the future of our world around the values of freedom and justice that are so important for us.
(Applause)
President Barroso, I should like to thank you for your statement and especially for your commitment to partnership with the European Parliament, which is most welcome.
I should like to thank you on my own behalf as well.
We look forward to the continuation of our good cooperation.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to offer my wholehearted congratulations to you, my dear Hans-Gert, on your brilliant speech on how Europe needs to regroup and once again join forces.
Addressing, on the one hand, the speakers from high office who took the floor before you and whom I take this opportunity to greet, and, on the other, representatives of all Europe's institutions, you expressed your vision of the future of the EU.
It is a vision of a united, integrated Europe, but also a Europe that is open to the world and aware of its international responsibilities, a Europe with which the citizens will more readily identify and to which they will feel closer.
It is a vision that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shares deeply.
I appreciate the proactive, positive and constructive tone of your proposals.
The time has come to stop talking negatively about Europe and to stop asking what we will become. Rather, we must channel our efforts into doing what we have to do.
The European Project is a success.
Not only has it led to the development and prosperity of our countries, it has also guaranteed peace on our continent.
We have changed the course of history thanks to this project and those who feel that this is not enough should take a look around them in their daily lives, and they will see that the benefits of Europe are to be found everywhere.
It would be churlish not to acknowledge this, but it is certainly true that we need to state more strongly the convictions that we have in our deeds and must learn to accord them their due worth.
This applies to the euro, which has been a success, and also, on a broader level, to our work as lawmakers.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have every reason to be confident in our future within the EU.
We will face the challenges ahead as a united and determined Europe, and certainly not as a morose, inward-looking Europe obsessed with its past.
Mr President, our group shares your priorities, which we believe address both the major challenges posed by the modern world, and our citizens' day-to-day concerns.
The two are interlinked.
What do European citizens want?
They want more freedom - true in particular of young people - and more security and protection against the threats we face.
They want to be able to work and to enjoy the fruits of their work.
They also want Europe to defend and promote the values of our civilisation and our culture.
They are in favour of environmental protection and the fight against climate deterioration at European level.
They are in favour of a common energy policy guaranteeing safe, affordable supplies, and do not rule out any energy source that may guarantee our independence.
They want a fair agriculture and food policy offering prospects for the countryside and guaranteeing food safety, whilst remaining at the forefront of technological developments.
They also want a research and development policy that places Europe at the cutting edge of innovation on the world stage, as we proposed in the Lisbon objectives.
Personally, I wish to emphasise today the importance of being close to the citizens and of the need to marry this objective with that of dialogue between cultures and religions, which is the positive side of the fight against racism and intolerance and against exclusion and xenophobia.
It is not enough to speak out against these wrongs or to fight against these scourges. What we need to do is to demonstrate, in a positive way, the advantages of exchanging knowledge, the benefits of social mixing, the nobleness of hospitality, the greatness of tolerance and the mutual enrichment of the meeting of cultures.
At the same time, the EU must be very clear about its geographical limits, about its borders and about a common immigration policy.
The EU must also define its strategy on globalisation.
This strategy must not be based on the survival of the fittest, but on a mix of competitiveness, high employment levels and social protection.
What we need is controlled globalisation.
I should once again like to commend the German Presidency, and in particular Mrs Merkel, on pursuing all these issues with such determination.
These challenges are not only for the next six months, but for the next ten or 20 years.
The 25 March Declaration, on the occasion of the Union's 50th anniversary could be an opportunity to propose the rebirth of political ambition for Europe.
In accordance with the long-term project of the founding fathers, that ambition involves a relaunch of the institutions.
I am aware, Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, the extent to which you set great store by this objective.
We trust the Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, to be up to the task of addressing the issue of the institutions.
The Commission is both Guardian of the Treaties and guardian of the Community's general interests.
We will always stand foursquare behind the Commission as it carries out this dual role responsibly.
It is by joining forces and sharing our convictions that we will be able to pull the EU out of its rut.
To finish, I could have quoted Mr Pierre Pflimlin, former President of the European Parliament, whose hundredth birthday would have been this year, who dearly wanted to see a Europe of the values of the spirit. I shall instead turn to that most Europhile of our 20th century writers, Stefan Zweig, who in his superb biography of Erasmus, handed a key to the builders of the Europe of the past and the future: 'There will always be a need for those who show people what unites them over what divides them, and who renew in the hearts of men the belief in a higher form of humanity.'
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, former Presidents of this honourable House, ladies and gentlemen, it is in order to avoid the impression that we are at a European People's Party congress that I, a social democrat, have now taken the floor, and what I am now putting myself through is a difficult exercise.
You will be aware that I take the view that the speech of this House's President must do justice to everyone in it - or at least approximate to doing so - and that it should not become the subject of partisan political debate, for that is the sort of speech to be delivered, not by the one who convenes all, but by one who puts forward an individual's view for the purposes of debate.
I want to acknowledge, Mr President, that you have delivered a speech behind which the whole House can unite, one in which you have described the essential tasks that lie ahead of us, and that your term of office falls in a decisive period for European politics.
There is no way of putting it other than to say that the reforms will either succeed or fail, and if they fail, if the Constitution does not come to pass, if we are thrown back onto the incomplete Treaty of Nice, then - as you brought out very well in your speech - it will be not only a Treaty that will have been brought low, but also an ideal.
In your speech, you gave a description of what the European ideal is, explaining that it is in cooperation between cultures that we find solutions, that religious intolerance is to be overcome by dialogue between religions, that it is on economic and social integration that peace and peaceful coexistence are founded, and that the surrendering of territorial claims can be accomplished through territorial integration.
If we set this ideal against the challenges we face, then the nature of those challenges becomes clear; they are hatred between races and peoples, which we find everywhere throughout the world, religious intolerance, which is everywhere on the other side of our borders, and, alas indeed, renewed claims to power over territory.
If you want peace throughout the world, with peace established within Europe and between it and its neighbours, you need more than ever the ideal of Europe to counteract such cause of warfare as hatred, intolerance, exclusion and oppression.
To these things we respond with integration - both social and cultural - with solutions arrived at between religions and across ethnic divides, and these you described well; my group can do no other than give them its full support.
At the same time, though, we face the challenge - as you so rightly said - of dealing with day-to-day conflicts.
People want more than just formal sittings, although I congratulate you on this one, for which we have all been preparing for a long time, and, however sceptical I might be, I will concede that it has gone well.
It is not every day, though, that we assemble in formal session.
The public want us to come up with solutions to day-to-day conflicts.
When the echo of what is said in formal session has died away, everyday life wastes no time in catching us up.
There are three things that people want from us: First, they want us to say what is what; secondly, they want us to come up with suggested solutions to it; and, thirdly, they want us to be decisive and to act - together in so far as that is possible, but, if it is not, to do so by a majority decision of the kind that is customary in a democracy.
That, too, must be possible, and - by the way - in the Council as well.
Turning to you, Madam Federal Chancellor, before you tell us more about discontinuity, I have no objection to us discussing that, but the greatest generator of discontinuity is the Council over which you preside.
That is the problem!
(Applause)
We are, of course, caught out by our own problems, the ones that we all have to address - us here in this House, you in the Council and the Commission with its own.
On New Year's Day this year, Mrs Merkel, the magazine 'Cicero' published a marvellous interview with you, which I read with a great deal of attention.
One tremendous thing you said in it was this: 'Another thing I aim to do in 2007 is to make more progress on dealing with climate change. [...]
With that in mind, I will be giving particular attention, within the international context, to environment issues'.
And quite right too!
You said the same thing today.
Let me now quote what you said elsewhere, something that - if I remember correctly - you said in the German Bundestag, to the effect that you would be vigorous in preventing a single threshold value for the emission of CO2 from new cars with effect from 2012.
VoilÃ  - the grim reality of everyday life has caught up with us again.
(Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'Discontinuity!')
That, too, is indeed, discontinuity.
We must ...
(Interruption by Mr Ferber)
Mr President, you can see that what I feared is coming to pass; this formal sitting could become a lively debate, but Mr Ferber's CSU has so much of its own stuff to deal with that we will allow him an interruption.
Mrs Merkel, Mr Poettering, we must try to meet both demands.
We must not only organise formal sittings characterised by high-flying rhetoric, but must also make things happen from day to day.
That is what we are calling for.
In every speech I have heard today, I have heard reference to the social Europe being the core and basis that holds our society together.
Two and a half years ago, when I said that in my first speech as chairman of my group, what I got for it was mocking laughter from certain quarters in this House.
Our having made that sort of progress in two and a half years, with all of us now agreed on it, gives me the hope that we will, by the end of your two and a half years in office - and that is how long you have said you will stay there - have moved on even further.
I should like to make just two brief closing comments.
I do not, Mr President, share your view that it was the United States of America that defeated Communism or helped to overcome it in Eastern Europe; it was not the United States that did that, but the courageous men and women in Poland; it was they, the Hungarians, and the people in the Baltic States, who defeated Communism, not the Americans, and that, more than ever, needs to be said in this House, with gratitude to the Members from those countries, who represent the new democracies.
(Applause)
My last comment I shall address to you, Mr President, for, since you have turned your attention to the issues of our future, and delivered a speech that is, to my mind, one of the best in this House for many years, it is to you that I will say that I also have the confidence that you will put that into practice.
As President of this institution, you will have a weighty task, particularly as regards the Constitutional Treaty, and if you can help to find common ground between the highly divergent views of the Heads of State or Government, in the same way as you managed, as chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats) to hold the conflicting interests of that group together, then I am confident that your Presidency will be a good one.
(Applause)
Mr Schulz, It is not for me to judge your speech, but I would like to say that, for one who did not actually want to speak, you managed to do so with a great deal of conviction.
Thank you very much for doing so.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, your experience in this House since direct elections in 1979 has qualified you well and has given you a rare sense of perspective for the post you occupy.
I congratulate you on your speech this morning.
You have seen the European Union grow from 9 countries in the 1970s to 12 in the 1980s, 15 in the 1990s, 25 and then 27 in this decade, with a queue of countries waiting to join.
You have seen the Treaty of Rome supplemented by the Single European Act, the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, and now the draft constitutional treaty, as the common market has been enhanced with a single market, a single currency and policies in justice and home affairs, foreign and security arrangements and now energy.
You have also seen - as have some others of us of more recent vintage - a profound change in what the European Union is all about.
It is no longer a Union to guarantee peace and security of food supply, but a Union which has to be capable of meeting the three big challenges we face: rapid world population growth and migration, energy resources and climate change, and internationally organised crime linked to terrorism.
Hitherto, the drive for the building of this Union has come from within.
Increasingly, it comes from beyond our borders and the response of our institutions has been uncertain.
There is a malaise affecting our Union which has led to squabbling between the Member States, who, in the name of preserving national sovereignty, are too often giving free rein to global anarchy; and squabbling between our institutions, which turns our citizens cold, like different denominations of the church, arguing about substantiation rather than asking why nobody comes to church any more.
Mr Poettering, you have the opportunity to lead this House at a time when it is increasingly becoming the dynamo of European integration.
It is increasingly to the European Parliament that Europeans must look: a House resurgent and outspoken, holding the Council and the Member States to account when their action against terrorism rides roughshod over the rights we cherish; forging consensus - which escapes the Commission - on the single market in services or on consumer protection measures; working with national parliaments to scrutinise the executive, ensuring the law is respected.
In short, this House is coming of age.
Ideology has surpassed nationality as the main determinant of voting behaviour.
It is true that this House does not yet possess a right of initiative or the right to propose the President of the Commission, but neither is now unthinkable and increasingly people believe that both would enhance our Union's culture of democracy.
Therefore, Mr Poettering, I hope that you will use your two and a half years to grasp the need for reform of this House; to give us a Parliament better equipped to provide such leadership; a House that meets in full session every week; a House that concentrates on profound political choices rather than voting on hundreds of amendments to move semi-colons; a House that uses its new powers of scrutiny to the full to recall and re-examine our laws.
When you were first elected, this Parliament was a consultative assembly, designed to give a pro forma cover to decisions taken by bureaucrats and diplomats.
Now it is a cornerstone of our European home.
In 13 years of codecision, that one function has developed the organs of this body, and transparency has given oxygen to our bloodstreams.
I should like to say to Chancellor Merkel that codecision is now needed in all areas of policy-making if the checks and balances of democracy are to work at European level.
The fact is that the Union makes decisions that are binding on Member States without proper democratic or judicial control, exposing us to censure by the Court of Human Rights or the constitutional courts.
We had a close shave when the German Constitutional Court examined the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and came very close to contesting its legitimacy.
If the German Government, which blocked the use of the passerelle clause in Article 42 just a few months ago, really wants to promote democracy in Europe, you will recognise the imperative of qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament as a basis for all law-making, otherwise in your time at the helm you risk looking like the mime artist, Marcel Marceau, appearing to climb a wall but actually going nowhere.
Mr President, the years 1914 to 1989 on our continent were a 75-year rage of self-mutilation.
This year, with Bulgaria and Romania in our Union, we can put to rest the ghosts of that period.
However, the roots of freedom lie in courage.
I believe there is a German word 'Zivilcourage': you, Chancellor Merkel and President Barroso need to muster the collective courage to take our Union forward as a true democracy, to create what Winston Churchill called in 1945 'a wider patriotism' and a common citizenship for the distraught people of this turbulent and powerful continent.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Watson.
When you spoke about the vast numbers of amendments I saw smiles on the faces of many of the former Presidents!
I think this is a problem which the former Presidents also faced.
The worst, however, was when it started in 1979 - as President Simone Veil will remember - when in some cases we had more than a thousand amendments, but we did not have the electronic machinery in place to deal with them.

TÃ¡ tacaÃ­ocht iomlÃ¡n tugtha ag mo ghrÃºpa polaitÃ­ochta don iarracht pholaitiÃºil riamh agus is mar sin a bheidh amach anseo.
Mr President, today is a day that we should reflect on where we have come from, but also give a vision for the future.
I think that in your speech to us today, you presented not only a report card of the past, but also a clear pathway to the future.
You raised a number of points in your speech that so far none of my colleagues has touched on.
The first, which is in one sense the most impressive of all, is the fact that the President of the Council, Chancellor Merkel, and the President of the Commission, President Barroso, have shown you and this House the respect to be here today to share in this occasion.
It reflects well on you obviously as a German to have your leader here, but reflects still more so on this House that Angela Merkel has taken the time to be here with us, despite all the work and efforts that she is soon to take on as President of the Council.
I think it behoves us to respond to that, not just because of the presence of the office holders, but most importantly of all because of the responsibility which the voters of the European Union have placed on us as their advocates and their voices.
Sometimes that brings us into conflict with the ideals of the technicians of the establishment of a new European Union.
Sometimes it brings us into conflict with the demands of Member State governments.
But our one sacred duty as a Parliament is to be that voice, to be the voice of reason, to be the voice of peace, to be the voice of vision, but most importantly of all, to be the voice for the voices.
We must remember those who have been lost or forgotten by our societies and ensure that they can be brought forward towards that new future and given that new opportunity.
In your speech today, Mr President, the one thing I thought was fantastic - and it is the first time that I have heard it from anybody in this House with such real sincerity - was what you said about the role of young people within Europe: your idea of having a new programme for young people, a prize for young people, to allow the new generation to appreciate and understand what we already can understand from our own history.
As my colleagues rightly said, we speak about America's defeat of communism and Nazism.
They played a role.
Let us not deny that Europe would have died without American assistance in the 1940s.
Let us not forget that Europe would have died without American assistance in 1918.
Let us not forget that, without the assistance of the US in the 1960s and 70s, we would have been under constant and immediate threat from further war and violence.
But, let us not also forget that those men and women of vision - whether it was in Solidarity in Poland, the Hungarian uprising, the Spring Revolution, the Velvet Revolution or Pope John-Paul II - all brought a belief in the dignity of human beings, the dignity of difference and the right for people to speak up and to be free in all walks of life.
That not only defeats totalitarianism, it defeats all ills which face humankind today and that is why your idea of a cultural dialogue, of an understanding of different faiths and traditions is so important for the future development of Europe.
If you read about us, Europe does not present a threat to anybody, of any faith or of none.
Indeed, in a lot of ways we tend to become so liberal that we forget about pluralism.
We forget about understanding some people who have strongly-held beliefs of a non-violent nature and tend to hound them out of office or out of positions, but at the same time, we can show accommodation to those that have a fairly radical viewpoint in life and give them a space for themselves.
The last two points I would like to make are in relation to the comments made by some colleagues and by the Presidents of both the Commission and the Council in relation to the development of European policy in the future.
Maybe I am misinterpreting what the people are saying, but European citizens are fed up with the nitty-gritty talk about institutional change and reforms.
What European citizens want to see is action; what European citizens want to see is a positive response to the problems that face us.
We have had some progress towards tackling climate change, social policy and other issues of importance in the single market, but citizens want to see action being taken on a real level that affects their lives in real ways, rather than mere reaction to problems when they arise.
Too often in this Parliament we look back and say 'that was done wrong in 1979' or 'this was done wrong in 1992' or something else was done wrong in 1997 or 'we missed an opportunity'.
Let us not forget that politics is an art, whereas economics is a science and you get the right result every time if you use the right formula.
Politics is an art because it must respond to the needs of society, to the wants and desires of people and, more importantly of all, to the volatility of society as a whole.
Lastly, the most pressing task that we have before us in creating a fairer area of peace and understanding is in the Middle East.
I applaud your desire to visit Lebanon, Palestine and Israel and to start to build that process.
Europe must be re-involved at a central level in finding the solution to peace in the Middle East.
I would just like to say to you, Mr President, for the next two and a half years, despite the travails that we have brought against you and even though rough winds will blow on your face, you should always realise that you have the support of this House at your back.
(Applause)
Thank you Mr Crowley.
You spoke for longer than the time allotted to you.
I would not say that you got more time because you said many nice things, but subsequent speakers will have to stick to the time allotted to them even if they do not always share your position.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we certainly recognise and respect the seriousness and depth of your European commitment, and your speech, today, sets out some priorities with which - even though they remain a little vague - the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is substantially in agreement.
You rightly recalled this Parliament's history, and I am very grateful to you for having brought into the Chamber today past presidents of our Parliament.
I was able to meet some of them when I arrived in Parliament, as a young and enthusiastic federalist, and to collaborate with many of them on their work: I am therefore truly happy to see them here today.
Despite this, Mr President, we await concrete evidence, and this evidence confronts us with very specific choices, which cannot remain vague.
Our Parliament will have to decide whether to remain silent and disciplined or whether to be the forum where action is taken in the name of European interests and values, today almost lost behind diplomatic manoeuvring and national interests.
This is our institution's responsibility: to be a platform for European debate and for proposals for a democratic Europe.
In this context, Mr President, the contribution of our institution to resolving the constitutional deadlock must not simply be - as you said, repeating word for word, and surely not by coincidence, what Mrs Merkel said to us - 'saving the substance of the Constitution'.
We cannot be content to 'save the substance of the Constitution' in a purely rhetorical fashion.
As a matter of urgency, we must do two things which in the past, under the presidency of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and under the presidency of Mr Schulz, this Parliament has not been able to achieve - no, I refer to the two presidents of the majority groups - and that is, firstly, to find a consensus on what to do exactly, as Parliament, in a fully autonomous way, with regard to the Constitution and, secondly - more importantly - to fight for the European Parliament to retain the constitutional role won for it by the Convention.
If there is to be debate on a timetable or on a proposal, we wish to act, Mrs Merkel, Mr Poettering, as codecision-makers and not observers.
Mr Poettering, I want to see you fight for this right of Parliament's.
(Applause)
Mr President, you spoke of values and cited specific cases relating to the defence of human rights, which is a subject of the utmost importance for our institution.
You also spoke of tolerance, a word of which you are very fond.
I must tell you, speaking personally, that sometimes this word worries me, because behind the word 'tolerance' crimes are committed and individuals' rights are infringed - crimes and infringements that are, precisely, 'tolerated' - and this is something that we absolutely must not forget.
This is why we prefer to speak of 'rights common to all men and all women', which are equal for everybody and must remain so.
To speak of relations with Russia means bringing up the subject of Chechnya and, responsibly, opening a debate on decreasing energy dependency, which involves strong criticism of those countries - and there are many of them - that are running in a disorganised fashion to the court of 'Czar' Putin.
In our dialogue with the United States we must not forget the death penalty in force in that country, CIA flights, the issue of passenger data, and pre-emptive war.
Finally, with regard to the defence of human rights we must not forget, by means of small emergency resolutions, to defend those individuals who by themselves, forgotten in some prison or some forest, are defending those rights.
Merely speaking of security, Mr President - and you spoke at length of it, in the name of our Parliament - cannot make the resolutions that have been adopted in favour of disarmament and a code of conduct on arms progress to the second stage.
Mr President, we will be very active in the work on internal reform.
There are two subjects that you did not mention and that seem to me to be fundamental: the first is the debate on Parliament's seat.
I hope that you, personally, and the parliamentary groups will have the courage to hold a debate in this Chamber on the European Parliament's seat.
Perhaps the home of European history may best be located here, in this very beautiful building.
Who knows?
I think, however, that it is important for you to truly take the initiative in tackling the problem of where Parliament should meet.
The second subject - and I know very well that I will have to work hard here to convince you - is making this institution greener, not from a political point of view but in terms of its environmental sustainability.
I will succeed in convincing you, I am absolutely certain of it, since every day the resources wasted even by this Assembly in terms of water, light and official cars is something that, if we want to be true to our commitments on climate change, we cannot tolerate.
In conclusion, I would briefly like to address Mrs Merkel.
Your proposals on bureaucracy, on discontinuity and on better regulation leave us rather cold and concerned.
The problem of bureaucracy is national rather than European: how many people are there in the delegation accompanying you today?
It is certainly more substantial than that accompanying President Barroso, and those complaining of excessive regulations are the multinationals, not the citizens, who say - going by successive Eurobarometer surveys - that they want more laws to protect them, not fewer!
Finally, the proposal on discontinuity in fact brings in an opportunity for your institution to boycott and delay all the laws that you do not like.
Mr President, I wish you success in your work and I believe that we will have fun over the next two years.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mrs Frassoni.
With regard to human rights, we have always agreed with each other.
As for the issue of where Parliament should sit, I have indeed given thought to whether I should talk about that, but came to the conclusion that I should not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, former Presidents who remind me of many times spent together, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is not often that we have a chance to take a step back and enjoy the opportunity that is given us today, however briefly, to exchange views on the entire period between now and the next European elections.
True, it is no secret that my group does not share the political options of the majority of this Parliament.
I will nevertheless deliberately use some of the key points of your speech to make several specific proposals.
They are limited measures with nothing revolutionary about them, and I sincerely think you do not necessarily have to sympathise with the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to identify with them.
If the President of the European Parliament simply took them into account that would send a positive signal to important sections of our public opinion; it would say that you have heard them.
Thus, referring to the aspirations of Europe's citizens, Mr President, you stressed and I quote: 'we must preserve the European social model' and, more importantly, you went on to say 'our acts must be convincing'.
That is in fact essential if we are to dispel a deep malaise that is being fed by the idea that instead of protecting the citizens from the effects of today's globalisation the European Union is too often helping to make everyone's existence increasingly insecure.
A significant act to begin to dispel this feeling of inevitability would be welcome.
I suggest, Mr President, that you call on the Council, Commission and Parliament to abandon a proposal for a directive that affects the entire population of the European Union and that seems so dogmatic, so unjustified and so devastating for the future of public services that it is likely to provoke a new Bolkestein effect if nothing changes in the next few months; I am speaking of the proposal to liberalise postal services on 1 January 2009, six months before the next elections.
More generally, you stressed another idea which I consider very right and very important.
You say we need 'a new pact between the citizens and the institutions of the European Union', then, about the future European treaty, you say: 'we need a thoroughgoing reform of the European Union'.
Everyone agrees this is necessary, but opinions on the substance of the future European basic law differ.
Mr Barroso has just addressed the Netherlands, saying to them: please help us, everyone has to move.
I am suggesting to you a method that will allow everyone to move, to help relaunch Europe.
Let the process which is starting be an opportunity for a real public debate across the Union, a candid debate, as close to the citizens as possible, on the meaning of Europe 50 years after the Treaty of Rome, on the purpose of our common policies, on the commitments we are prepared to assume together in the future.
If the President of Parliament sets himself the task of bringing such an initiative to fruition, he will instantly have fulfilled his mandate.
Finally, Mr President, you made some apt remarks about intercultural dialogue and more particularly the Middle East, where you hope to go as soon as possible, you said.
That does not surprise me, and I thank you for it.
With this in mind, of all the initiatives I would like the President of Parliament to take, the most symbolic in my view, following the almost unhoped-for Mecca agreement, in which the whole of Hamas promises to comply with the international resolutions and the agreements signed between the PLO and Israel, would be to solemnly call on the European Union to lift the blockade on the Palestinian Government and to give a new chance to the hope for a just peace in a region that has been bruised by occupation and war for several generations.
I know that none of these initiatives will be easy to take, Mr President, but if you do, they are such that history will remember them.
Thank you, Mr Wurtz. I am grateful for the respect that we have always shown each other.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, Mr Barroso, esteemed former Presidents of this Chamber, whom I remember with pleasure from the Conference of the Presidents, we now have Mr Poettering as President, and he is eager for a bigger dose of the EU, even though he also cleverly talks about subsidiarity.
He should allow himself a referendum in which he might convince his fellow Germans that they too should vote in favour of a Constitution with more laws and regulations made in Brussels.
Three thousand regulations are not enough.
It is not enough that 86% of the laws ratified in the German Bundestag are now enacted in Brussels.
Listen to the warning from the former German President, Roman Herzog, who headed our Charter Convention.
Note the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands.
The French and the Dutch had a chance to vote in favour of the Constitution, and they threw it away.
The lesson now drawn from this is that we should never again have a referendum.
The former President of the Bundestag's Europe Committee, JÃŒrgen Meier, also stated in the Constitutional Convention that a voluntary referendum could be agreed in the Bundestag, with an ordinary majority sought.
Why not allow the Germans to express their opinion on the Constitution that the President and the German Presidency of the Council are so keen to see adopted?
Officials in Brussels and the judges in Luxembourg have a pathological attachment to supersizing and have a fear of democracy.
They have not understood the modern trend towards slimmed-down organisations, decentralised accountability and outsourcing.
What is good enough for businesses is not good enough for the EU.
Nothing is to be farmed out from Brussels to the Member States or to the citizens.
Laws are much better for having been drawn up by 3 000 secret working parties in the Commission and adopted by 300 secret working parties in the Council of Ministers, as well as by 15 000 professional lobbyists.
Long live technocracy in a corporate EU!
Mrs Mussolini can spare a friendly thought for her grandfather's dedication to corporatism.
The voters can be allowed to go to the polls every five years and vote in favour of someone who can neither propose nor adopt laws.
Elected representatives can only advise the Commission by tabling amendments.
That is what it all comes down to at present, and a similar mindset is also at the heart of the Constitution - only in many more areas.
If something cannot be adopted by Council ministers and officials, there is always the possibility of going to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg with proposals that neither the electorate, national parliaments nor governments will know anything about.
Unanimously adopted penalties in connection with environmental issues are deemed unlawful because the judges want to see such penalties adopted by majority decision-making and well within their own control.
Enshrined as it is in treaties and draft constitutions alike, property law is clearly a matter for the Member States.
However, the obligation incumbent on farmers to reside on their own farms is judged to be unlawful, despite the unanimous verdict of the Danish Parliament to the contrary.
Voters and their parliaments are regarded as incapable, and family holdings are seen as being out of date.
Let us, rather, have a bunch of jumped-up Prussian-style Junkers running agriculture everywhere in the EU.
Farmers are not good enough, and nor are employees' and employers' collective agreements, penal legislation, national judges or the voters.
The EU grandees know far better.
We have won many small victories for openness, and the Bundestag in Berlin has introduced the best rules yet for scrutinising the EU.
The time has now come when the threefold division of power into openness, proximity and democracy needs to govern the whole of the EU.
There must be no more laws that cannot be amended by elected representatives.
There must be no more laws that cannot be amended by the voters at the next election.
There must be no more treaties and constitutions that have not been adopted by the voters in referendums held throughout the EU, and preferably on the same day.
The President mentioned our electronic voting equipment.
I fondly recall the time when the new system from Olivetti was introduced.
It is a system I should like to have back again, for then my proposals could actually be adopted.
Ladies and gentlemen, those who are less familiar with the details - particularly our guests in the galleries - may perhaps not be aware that elections in Denmark are held on Thursdays rather than on Sundays, and Mr Bonde always takes that to mean that he has been a Member of this House for longer, even though that is wrong in legal terms, since he and I both became Members of it on 17 July 1979.
His constant insistence on this does, however, give me hope that he cannot be that lacking in affection for the European Union and for this House if he so readily asserts that he - as he understands it - has been in this House for longer than anyone else.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, former Presidents, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament has just done a skilful job of describing the kind of political programme that one might perhaps have expected to hear from a President of the European Council or, indeed, of the Commission than from a President of Parliament in his role as arbiter.
In view of the group dynamics that often prevail in institutions, your speech, Mr President, concerning the will of the peoples no doubt reflects the opinion of the majority of this House.
You will allow me, however, to express what lawyers in the English-speaking world call a dissenting opinion.
You spoke of the 'temporary' hitch - the word 'temporary' was yours - involving the draft European Constitution as it was received in France and the Netherlands. The impression you gave was that this was merely a hiccup limited to two Member States.
However, everyone knows, or ought to know, that if this project had been submitted directly to the people of the Member States and not merely to members of the national parliaments, the document concerned would, in all probability, have been rejected much more widely.
We need, then, to know once and for all why, when nations express themselves freely in opposition to the dominant way of thinking, they go on being presented with the same menu that they have rejected.
When, however, they come out in agreement with the dominant trend, it is emphasised that their commitment is apparently definitive, irrevocable and perpetual and that they will not be entitled to backtrack.
In your speech, you mentioned several important features of our European tradition, and four in particular: Greek philosophy, Roman law, Judaeo-Christian spirituality and the Enlightenment.
That, however, is a crucial element of the problem: how faithful is the European Union to these components of its intellectual, moral and spiritual heritage?
Is the European Union now inspired by Christian values or by a general hedonism that is out to destroy these same values in the name of a human rights ideology that brooks no resistance but of which variable geometry is always a feature?
Are the structure and operation of the EU governed by Greek philosophy's demand for clarity and simplicity and by the Greek political tradition of citizens' direct participation in the affairs of the city state; or are we instead seeing the implementation of a heavy, centralised and shortly to be outmoded structure that is ostensibly designed for governing almost 500 million Europeans but that, in practice, disregards their differences?
Is European legislation inspired by the precision and concision of Roman law or is it a concoction of thousands of obscure and wordy texts involving detailed restrictions?
Are we genuinely respectful of the tradition of public debate handed down to us by the Greeks and Romans?
As for the Enlightenment, I would not conceal from you the concern we felt last month on hearing Chancellor Merkel quote freely from Voltaire in this House but then say to us - not literally, admittedly, but in essence - that there should be no tolerance for the enemies of tolerance - a statement that recalls the words of the French revolutionary Saint-Just, spoken before the revolutionary court that instigated the Terror: 'no liberty for the enemies of liberty'.
To conclude, Europe is the only region in the history of humanity to have invented the liberty and equality of nations.
It is the region in which the people have always risen up against putative dictatorships - a fact that explains their current distrust of the wayward direction taken by the EU.
We do not need a Eurocratic superstate to guarantee the mutual security of our nations and borders, to launch detailed industrial, cultural and research cooperation projects and to protect us properly against migratory flows or against imports of products that have been manufactured for next to nothing and that are ruining our industries.
The instruments of international law are more than adequate to this task.
We have to rediscover the true genius of Europe and the law appropriate to Europeans.
(SK) Mr President, may I begin by offering my sincere congratulations on your election to the position of president of the European Parliament, which is the most democratic and, at the same time, one of the most important of European institutions.
You have become the first president of the European Parliament after the adoption and implementation of the Treaty of Nice.
Currently, the European Union comprises 27 Member States.
I have not referred to this fact by chance, as political experience demonstrates that the implementation of one treaty is followed by preparations for another.
Two years of wavering and marking time with regard to the Constitutional Treaty have harmed the idea of a united Europe.
You are assuming office at a time when Germany, one of the founding Member States, holds the presidency of the European Union, and I therefore expect you to decide on what needs to be done next concerning the Constitutional Treaty.
Most Member States have opted for supporting the Constitutional Treaty and are willing to carry on implementing the vision of a united Europe, and their wishes cannot be overlooked because of the negative stance adopted by two of the Member States.
I would appreciate it if, following the election of its president, the European Parliament would now give some thought to introducing new rules or revising the existing Rules of Procedure.
I have respected the 'gentleman's agreement' made in the past by the two big political groups with regard to the election of the president of the European Parliament.
However, a democratic system should also allow a candidate from a smaller political group to be elected.
I am quite sure that in this House there are many distinguished and capable people in smaller political groups as well.
Mr President, I sincerely hope that during your term in office you will advocate greater involvement by the twelve new Member States in the shaping of European policies.
Looking at how the new Member States are currently represented on the committees of the European Parliament, I cannot help feeling dejected.
Similar discrimination against the new Member States can be seen from the number of their nationals employed by the European Parliament.
What is important here is not only the mere numbers but the positions these people fill.
There are nationals from our countries who often have two university degrees, foreign work experience and a good command of three of the EU 15 languages, and yet are in secretarial positions and therefore assisting superiors whose academic and language skills may be significantly inferior to their own.
By way of an example, let me refer to the procedure known as internal tendering to fill secretarial positions, which was carried out last year and served as the basis for assigning about 50 employees from the new Member States to secretarial jobs.
All of these people are university graduates and are currently performing at grade B and A levels but collecting secretarial pay.
The European Union is generating savings, as skilled work is carried out for low pay, but I am wondering whether this represents fairness and non-discrimination.
Non-discrimination also includes gender equality, a topic so often debated here.
We even have a dedicated committee to deal with this issue, but we are lagging behind in enforcement.
In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to wish you every success in your role as president of the European Parliament.
I have great esteem for you personally as well as for your rich track record and experience in European politics, and I believe that you will make a good and just administrator of public affairs.
I greatly welcome the remarks of both President Poettering and Chancellor Merkel.
Quoting Robert Schuman, we can say: 'the story of European integration is fundamentally a success story'.
A failure of the constitutional process would put at risk the continuation of this success story.
If we do not succeed in creating a more efficient and more democratic Union, one that is closer to the citizens, this would seriously affect the success of the Lisbon Strategy, the creation of a more competitive Europe that nonetheless preserves its social values.
I consider an important element of this to be the creation of a more transparent, more unified legislation, which can promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises at the European level, and thereby help create jobs as well.
Increasing competitiveness is also indispensable in order for Europe not to be forced to play the role of 'economic giant - political dwarf' in world politics.
Today it may be more important than ever for European values, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and equal opportunities to be represented globally.
This is especially true in the year of equal opportunities, when both at European and at national levels we must make efforts to help those who suffer disadvantages.
While welcoming the importance given to the integration of migrants, I would like to add with regard to their situation: we should not forget the largest and perhaps more disadvantaged minority in Europe, the Roma.
In this regard as well, we need to tear down the imaginary economic and social Berlin Wall.
I would note especially the protection of women and children, who are the most vulnerable and suffer from a dual discrimination.
With regard to the rule of law, I wish to recall that the Union is fundamentally based on legal principles, and its functioning presupposes that every citizen respects its laws.
Members of the European Parliament must lead the way in respecting our laws - otherwise we shall set a bad example to all of Europe's citizens.

rapporteur. - Mr President, I should just like to bring to the attention of the House a technical amendment that we should make pursuant to Rule 155.
In the Commission's proposal there was a technical omission under Article 2, dealing with the transposition of the proposal.
The exact date for the transposition in the Member States is missing.
Therefore I propose under Rule 155 to add '[18 months after the date of publication]' as the date for transposition.
This should be specified.
I should like to propose that to Members as a technical amendment.

Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule II programme) (vote)
After the vote
Mr President, it is not much use me speaking once the vote has happened, so all I want to say is that you need to keep more of an eye out in future.
I would like to thank both the German Presidency and its Finnish predecessor.
We have wrapped up this topic in just one reading, and we will be spending some EUR 100 million on fighting fraud over the coming years.
That is what I wanted to tell the House.

Rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation (vote)
Before the vote
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why I have asked for the floor is that I have to make the House aware of an alarming situation in the negotiations between the Council and the Commission.
What you have before you is one of the last chances for the Barroso Commission to make headway towards an unreservedly positive statement of assurance.
We have made so bold as to pick up the Commission's own proposals and include them in this report.
The Commission now seeks to reject it without proposing anything else to put in its place.
If, today, by doing nothing, you prevent simplification, improved recovery of wrongly disbursed funds and more efficient monitoring, you are ensuring that the Commission's management will have a black mark against it in April 2009.
We will then, in the discharge procedure, have an especially fault-ridden budget for 2007 to deal with - the first of the new Financial Perspective and only two months before the European elections.
If our proposals are not accepted, the Commission and the Council will be putting the brakes on and throwing the Euro-sceptics a juicy issue for 2009.
It is regrettably the case that the Council has been on a collision course particularly since the German Presidency began; instead of organising on a joint basis the publication of grants in aid and their recipients - which has already been agreed to - the Council has surprised everyone by saying, bluntly and without explanation, 'no', both to it and to research and development subsidies, that is to say, to the direct international joint administration as a whole.
In so doing, it is sowing dissent in Europe, for, without standardisation, everyone can do or fail to do whatever they please, and we are stuck with a loss of trust on the part of the European taxpayer.
The Council is robbing this Commission of transparency, which was its most visible success in the Budget sphere, and is of no value if it is not given tangible form.
I appeal to the Commission and the Presidency of the Council, as a matter of urgency, to face up to their responsibility for this legal draft, and to join us in making things simpler and cutting back bureaucracy.
The proposals are on the table before you, and I ask - I beg - you to give your assent to them.
(Applause)

Explanations of vote
Our aim is not to issue an opinion on the validity or otherwise of this decision to repeal Directive 68/89/EEC, although, as a rule, we have our reservations as regards the Commission's harmonising tendencies.
Our view is indeed shared by most businesses and Member States in stating that they do not apply this Directive.
It is important, on the other hand, to issue an opinion on the process of which this forms part, namely the 'better lawmaking' initiative, which, under the guise of simplification, is in practice a policy of market deregulation at national and Community level.
The Commission's justification leaves no room for doubt: 'better lawmaking is vital to improving the competitiveness of European businesses and to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda'.
The objective, for the Commission, is to cut 'unnecessary costs and obstacles that block adaptation and innovation' and to put into 'practice the right incentives and the basic market conditions for businesses to develop.'
In other words, the purpose of 'better lawmaking' is to benefit business rather than to protect the consumer's labour, social and environmental rights.
This is what we object to.
We do not want this process to lead to the repeal of any legislation that undermines the notion that competition and the profits of business are of prime importance, above all other considerations.
in writing. (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule II programme).
Mr BÃ¶sch has tabled a good report.
The changes in the preamble are a better reflection of the criteria and purpose of this regulation.
The proposed change provides improved tools for implementing the action programme and strengthens supervision of its correct implementation.
Allocating an additional EUR 67 million to the Hercule II programme annually will have a significant effect on combating smuggling and fraud.
in writing. I support the Hercule II programme and the work it is carrying out for the prevention, detection and combating of activities damaging the Community's financial interests.
The type of fraud combated under the programme must be tackled in order to retain the tax base of Member States.
in writing. (PL) I am voting for the report on the proposal on the Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
Mrs GrÃ€Ãle and Mr Pahor, the rapporteurs, have compiled an excellent report which includes a number of amendments.
Implementing the regulation will provide greater flexibility and transparency in the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
It will better secure the Community's financial interests, while at the same time giving the Committee on Budgetary Control more transparent opportunities to assess the proper implementation of the Community budget in the relevant section.
in writing. I support the amendments put forward by this report as the European Parliament's budgetary function is vital to maintaining democratic scrutiny at the European level.
I especially support the amendments aimed at improving the comparison between the political will expressed in Parliament's remarks on the budget and the actual implementation.
(DE) Mr President, the INSPIRE data system is a considerable gain for us in Europe, since, for every policy, particularly in the environmental sphere, we need mutually comparable data on space, and so I would like to thank Mrs Brepoels, the rapporteur, for negotiating an outstandingly good compromise, which is the only way in which we can enable the public to inform themselves on the environmental hazards in store for them and to participate in the systems that we are setting up in Europe.
INSPIRE is making an essential contribution to this.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report as it will create a waste management policy that will help us meet our objective of reducing waste and protecting our environment.
We need to protect the environment at an EU level and this report represents an attempt to do this.
The report meets the priorities I feel we should have for our environment of reducing the production of non-reusable or non-recyclable waste, making producers and importers responsible for waste, avoiding the reclassification of energy recovery incinerators for waste disposal and introducing a requirement to develop national waste prevention programmes.
(DE) Mr President, two things were of particular importance to us Austrians when it came to the revision of this framework directive on waste.
One was the special rule for organic waste, since both we and Germany have systems for dealing with this, which work very well and need to be maintained.
At the same time, though, we urge the Commission to keep working on this in order to establish a Europe-wide system for it.
The second thing we were concerned about was catering waste and waste from guesthouses, which can, after appropriate treatment, be reused in the husbandry of pigs.
That is quite essential if those and similar food flows are to be properly reprocessed.
(DE) Mr President, slowly, but surely, society is rethinking its approach to waste, but, since more and more countries want to reprocess old waste and the owners of plant want to spare them overload, the consequence is that waste is transported from one end of Europe to the other.
Even if we are now paying attention to the environment, we become aware from time to time of black sheep quietly or blatantly disposing of waste in an illegal manner or claiming money for costly reprocessing that they have not actually carried out.
Not only does that do harm to the living space we all share, but it also costs the state and municipalities a lot of money, and we need to be more vigorous in dealing with this.
We also need to do more work on informing people, since some members of the public, out of ignorance, dispose of such things as medicines in the wrong way.
It also goes without saying that we have to do more about recycling, and that the EU and its Member States need to set us a good example in this respect.
Over and above that, too, we must not forget that the issue of the storage of nuclear waste has still not yet been resolved, and that is yet another reason to refrain from building more nuclear power stations.
in writing. We and the Fianna Fail Delegation in the EP have voted in favour of a stronger Commission proposal on waste favouring the five-stage hierarchy with the essential emphasis on Prevention and Reduction of waste, followed by reuse, recycling, recovery and then the safe and environmentally sound disposal of waste in this order of priority.
We have voted in favour of calling for binding targets for Member States to stabilise waste production at anticipated 2008 levels by 2012 and support the EP call for greater reuse and recycling to reduce pressure on landfill sites, for Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that, where practicable, all waste undergoes recovery operations, to take measures to promote recycling and to set up collection schemes of different streams, to move towards a Recycling Society by 2020 where 50 % of our municipal solid waste should be recycled in addition to biowaste and industrial waste.
The issue of the distinction between Recovery and Disposal is a very important one.
We have voted in favour of amendments that clearly distinguish between recovery and disposal and have voted against amendments that would reclassify units from disposal to recovery.
in writing. - (FR) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the excellent work that they have done.
We do indeed need to take action, as waste management policies do not always advance the cause of recycling and composting. Unfortunately, dumping and incineration are still the most widespread ways of dealing with waste.
I am in favour of the five-level hierarchy applicable to waste management (prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and dumping) as, in my view, the objective of reducing waste must be given priority, and precedence must therefore be given to a policy of waste prevention.
I am in favour, for example, of introducing product labelling designed to develop eco-consumption.
I am pleased that, for purposes of simplification, excavated land has been excluded from the list of forms of waste.
However, I think it necessary to make a clear distinction between recycling and recovery, and to manage incineration practices, with a view to creating genuine energy recovery, which must not constitute a risk to human health and the environment.
I support the proposal whereby, in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, those who produce waste would, as a matter of general practice, be held responsible for it.
This report raises a number of points that are, in some cases, inconsistent.
The report proposes priorities regarding, on the one hand, waste management, with the emphasis on prevention, reuse, recycling and other recovery operations, and, on the other, regarding waste disposal.
This is something we welcome, and we hope that the final text will eventually reflect this proposal.
Unfortunately, however, some of the positive amendments that were tabled - aimed at removing incineration from classification as a recovery process, and at ensuring that using this method would automatically be null and void - were not adopted, whereas others, much more limited in scope, were adopted.
Therein lie some of the inconsistencies.
Consequently, at the forthcoming negotiation stage, all our attention must be focused on the process, in order to monitor the development of the definitions and the content thereof.
Hence at this first reading we have prioritised the aspects that improved on the Commission's original proposal.
The final vote at second reading, however, will depend on clarification of the existing inconsistencies.
in writing. I will be voting in favour of the Jackson report on waste.
It is important that we avoid burying ourselves under the proliferation of packaging consumer society imposes on us.
I am in favour of recycling to the maximum practical level, but that is not enough.
We must limit the amount of waste generated before recycling.
However much we try, there will be material requiring disposal.
Provided that it is kept to the minimum practical level, I have no problem if some of that material is burnt.
I have visited in Germany CHP schemes based on waste incineration which are to be commended.
We will help our planet and our future by utilising a variety of measures and not by making one scheme fit all.
in writing. I supported the Jackson report today because it encompassed the thrust of the Environment Committee's progressive stance on waste prevention and management.
I am particularly satisfied that the European Parliament has rejected the Commission's proposal to re-brand municipal waste incinerators based on certain criteria.
Sinn FÃ©in supports those communities in Ireland fighting against the imposition of dangerous incinerators onto their communities.
The Jackson report sends out a clear signal that the European Parliament supports the principles of a recycling society - Member States should do so too.
The inclusion of the five-step waste hierarchy plan and the insistence on obliging Member States to provide waste prevention plans are also welcome.
I regret that clearer and more ambitious targets were not included, however.
The issue of waste treatment is extremely important.
The debate should focus on the idea that the excesses of those championing the environment will result in unrealistic, unworkable legislation.
Such legislative inadequacy will in turn lead to environmental negligence and to an avoidable legacy for future generations.
One must, on the other hand, be mindful of the fact that, for all our good intentions on reducing pollution, the truth is that the ongoing increase in standards of living in the EU, and indeed throughout the world, will always lead to higher consumption and inevitably to more waste.
We must therefore be realistic and, more importantly, seek to obtain a positive return, as suggested here, on waste treatment, in terms of energy.
in writing. - (FR) Prevention is better than cure.
This adage, which ringingly endorses the desire to tackle the root causes of problems, applies perfectly to European waste policy.
What, then, are the facts?
Between 1995 and 2003, global waste production has increased by 19% an average of 3.5 tonnes per person per year.
If we add to this the fact that less than 20% of waste is recycled, that - in 50% of cases end-of-life materials are not recycled and end up scattered throughout the countryside and that, moreover, allowing incinerators and waste that is dangerous to the environment and to public health to proliferate is not a tenable policy, what we have is a whole waste management philosophy that needs to be re-thought, and to be re-thought along three main axes: eco-design as a priority of waste prevention policy, given that 80% of the environmental impact occurs at the time that a product is manufactured and processed; the implementation of green taxation, which is intended to have a deterrent effect and which discourages excess packaging and energy-guzzling products; and the closure of Europe's 10 000 illicit rubbish dumps or the modification of these dumps to bring them into line with the 2001 EU Landfill Directive.
in writing. I welcome this report in tackling the EU waste problem.
I am pleased that a legally binding stabilisation target has been introduced for waste prevention.
I am also pleased that there has been no weakening of the principle of the five-stage 'hierarchy of waste': prevention and reduction of waste, re-use of waste, recycling of waste (less than a third of waste is recycled today), other recovery operations and, finally, the safe and environmentally sound disposal of waste.
As we know, one of the problems of modern society is waste production.
We therefore endorse the adoption of this document, which places the accent on the primary objective of waste management, namely the protection of the environment and human health.
We would also highlight the adoption of what is referred to as the 'waste hierarchy', that is to say, the establishment of the following action priorities, in order: prevention, reuse, recycling, other recovery operations such as energy recovery and lastly disposal.
With the higher importance attached to the issue of prevention, the intention is to reduce as far as possible the waste created.
Let us not forget, however, that given the enormous amount of waste currently produced, measures aimed at reuse, recycling and disposal that could be implemented remain inadequate and incapable of meeting our needs.
Waste reduction is therefore a crucial issue.
To achieve this, however, entails a change in standards of production and consumption.
It also involves clarifying the problem and raising awareness among the entire population.
Consequently, it must be clarified how waste management is to be paid for, and guarantees must be put in place to ensure that it is not the 'weakest link in the chain', namely the consumers, who have to carry the can.
We therefore feel that reference to the application of the 'polluter pays' principle is dangerous.
in writing. - (EL) In Greece, there are now 3 500 uncontrolled dumps.
About half incinerate, with serious repercussions on the environment and public health.
The volume of waste is increasing and most of it is dumped in landfills.
On the other hand, the re-use and recycling of waste are still at excessively low levels and illegal cross-border transportation of waste is increasing.
All this applies to most of the Member States and is rightly pointed out in the report entitled 'Thematic Strategy on the recycling of waste'".
Unfortunately, instead of finding solutions to these social problems, the Commission is using confusing targets and phoney definitions and a lack of qualitative and quantitative targets to promote the interests of the manufacturers and operators of incineration plants, which are major economic interests, at a time when we know that incineration produces gaseous pollution, dangerous solids and toxic liquid waste which contribute to the greenhouse effect.
At the same time, incineration acts as a counterincentive to recycling.
This confirms that the capitalist ÎU cannot by its very nature apply a waste management policy based on the criterion of environmental protection and public health, because this is incompatible with unhampered action by capital to generate profits.
We also express our disagreement with the principle of 'the polluter pays' and the principle of the 'waste generator's responsibility', as they are tools for shifting blame from the polluter, who can basically pollute with impunity and just pay a financial price.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report as I believe we should create a waste management policy that will reduce waste and protect our environment.
I believe the basis of the EU waste policy should be the protection of the environment and not to facilitate the trade of waste.
The 'polluter pays' principle, the principle of producer responsibility in the EU waste legislation as well as the implementation of concrete targets for prevention are important aspects of this report that I favour.
in writing. The proposal for a separate directive on sewage sludge, a revision of the waste incinerator directive and proposals on waste prevention should be welcomed.
(NL) Mr President, I voted against the Bozkurt report.
Whilst a number of necessary conclusions have been drawn, we in this House are passing up an opportunity to bring real pressure to bear on the Turkish Government.
The accession negotiations with Turkey could be used as a lever to make progress in the area of human rights, in this case women's rights, but it would appear that we have made a conscious decision not to do this.
In this House, there is a majority that assumes that Turkey must be able to join the European Union at all costs.
The official line is, of course, that negotiations with Turkey can be suspended at any time if it transpires that that country is clearly flouting the human rights conditions.
It has, though, become evident to us, time and time again, that the negotiations will never be suspended.
It is a stipulation that serves one purpose and one purpose only: to pacify the majority of the voting public in Europe who are opposed to Turkey joining.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Mrs Bozkurt on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey.
Although the legal framework for women's rights appears to be generally satisfactory, its actual implementation is still deficient, in my opinion: violence against women - and, in particular, honour crimes and forced marriages - must be systematically condemned.
I welcome the proposal in the report inviting Turkish institutions to build alliances with all groupings - civil and social - in society so as to initiate campaigns to spread awareness of violence committed against women and children.
I am also delighted by the adoption of the recommendation addressed to the Turkish political parties to include more female candidates on election lists as from the next elections in 2007.
Finally, I am very pleased about the request to the Turkish Government to make it mandatory for girls prevented by their families from attending school to have access to knowledge.
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Bozkurt because it reinforces the idea that the Turkish Government must adopt measures enabling women to play a more prominent role in Turkey's social, economic and political life, despite progress that has already been made.
This report illustrates that there is a long way to go when it comes to protecting Turkish women against domestic violence and honour crimes.
It also calls on the Turkish Government to build more shelters for women who are victims of violence.
By voting for this report we only wanted to endorse protection of the rights of all Turkish women, including in accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU, high on the agenda of which is the crucial issue of respect for human rights, including women's rights.
Yet we do not consider this to be the only issue to take into account in the negotiations with Turkey.
Our opposition to accession negotiations while Turkey continues its unacceptable occupation of Northern Cyprus is well known.
We therefore object to a number of points in the report before us.
As the adopted report says, although the new Criminal Code, which entered into force in June 2005, has substantially improved the fundamental rights of Turkish women, the European Directives on gender equality have yet to be transposed in full.
We also deplore the fact that, in some parts of South-East Turkey, girls are not registered when they are born, which hampers the fight against forced marriages and honour crimes, as the victims have no official identity.
We also join in calling on the Turkish Government to guarantee women from the Kurdish minority equal involvement in women's rights programmes.
in writing. (SV) We fully share the view that Turkey, like other candidate countries, must establish a democratic constitutional state with full human rights and gender equality.
However, we are critical of quite a few individual points in the report.
For example, it is absurd for the European Parliament to propose that a mandatory quota system be adopted, ensuring fair representation of women on election lists (paragraph 41), that the Turkish political parties adopt internal rules guaranteeing the presence of women in their management bodies at all levels (paragraph 43) and that the political parties in Turkey include more female candidates on election lists (paragraph 44).
The EU does not impose this type of requirement on other candidate countries or on existing Member States.
It is self-evidently absurd for a candidate country to be treated differently through the formulation of special requirements.
Moreover, it is, in the end, for individual countries to decide what type of measures are to be taken to strengthen the role of women in society.
On the basis of the above reasoning, we have each chosen to abstain in the final vote.
in writing. I and my British Conservative colleagues support the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
We also believe it is important that Turkey, as with all other candidate countries, must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
However, this report seems to set the barrier of membership of Turkey at a higher level than other states.
We cannot support treating Turkey differently and less favourably than other candidate states.
Of course, Turkey must also ensure it will abide by the Copenhagen criteria with regard to the rights of women and girls.
We have decided to abstain on this report as we are concerned that the long list of demands in it will be used politically by those opposed to Turkey's membership of the EU.
By the same token, we want to make clear that we are supportive of genuine attempts to improve the position of women in Turkey.
We MEPs of the New Democracy party voted in favour of the Bozkurt report, which refers not only to the problematic situation of women in Turkey in all sectors, but also to the measures that need to be taken in order for the acquis communautaire to be adopted and applied in the candidate country.
Constant, multilateral efforts by Turkey must continue in order to defend women's human rights, by eliminating violence, crimes of honour and polygamy, and in order to eliminate discrimination in the family, in economic and social life and in general.
We abstained from Amendment 15.
We believe that this amendment gives no added value to the resolution.
It is a fact that the dimension of equality forms part of the acquis communautaire, which must be adopted and applied by the candidate country.
Thus, freezing negotiations, as called for in the amendment in question, would delay the application of equality between the two sexes.
We should not forget that there is already leverage in this direction at the current stage of negotiations.
We would remind the House that opening negotiations on Chapter 19 on social policy and employment, which relates directly to discrimination against women, requires compulsory developments in and compliance by Turkey, with specific targets to promote equality.
in writing. I have voted in favour of this report as it seeks to evaluate and suggest measures to evolve women's rights in Turkey.
Cooperation with Turkish authorities and civil society is needed in order to improve women's rights and the report suggests this.
In particular, in light of the country's candidacy for EU membership, respecting human rights, including women's rights must be made a priority.
There are persistent problems with women's rights such as: Violence against women, including honour crimes; lack of education for women and girls; the decrease in women's participation in the labour market.
I am pleased to support a report which recognises the need to address these issues and gives concrete suggestions for how we can achieve this.
Forced marriages, domestic violence, honour crimes, illiteracy, etc: the situation of women in Turkey is not a bed of roses.
According to Unicef, 700 000 girls are prevented from attending school by their families every year.
The employment rate among women is less than 25%, way below the 55% in the European Union.
These are worrying figures when Turkey's accession to the EU is arousing controversy.
That is why Parliament is proposing constructive measures: an assessment of Turkey's progress according to benchmarks; the creation of refuges for women who are victims of violence; the obligation to register all girls at birth in order to prevent forced marriage; training the police and judiciary in the prevention of honour crimes, to encourage the systematic opening of inquiries and the necessary sentences; a mandatory quota system for the involvement of women in political life.
I am not a fundamentalist when it comes to positive discrimination, but I am convinced that temporary measures will be useful in Turkey.
The country is crying out for women in positions of power, who will serve as models and bring about a change in traditional ways of thinking.
in writing. (SV) In the vote on Mrs Bozkurt's report on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey, I chose to vote in favour of the amendment designed to delete paragraph 41 on the subject of a quota system.
I think it a great problem that there are not more women in Turkish politics, but, for me, a quota system is not the right solution to this problem.
in writing. The start of talks with Turkey on EU accession should be welcomed.
However, the rights of women need to be closely monitored.
The case of girls in south-east Turkey not being registered at birth needs to be challenged.
All births should be officially registered regardless of gender.
As for women in politics, more work could be done to encourage, nurture and help women into elected office.
However, we should remember that in the EU there are still countries whose female representation in national politics falls short of the mark.
In the UK, it will take 200 years before women are equally represented in the House of Commons.
We must do all that we can to address gender inequalities where they occur.
in writing. (SV) Present circumstances show that the membership negotiations with Turkey have been embarked on too early.
The report highlights a number of serious problems, especially the occurrence of honour killings and violence against women.
Quite apart from whether or not it becomes a Member State, Turkey is on the EU's doorstep and will constitute an important trading partner for the EU.
It is therefore important for the EU to continue to put political pressure on Turkey with a view to the country's constructive development.
However, it would be extremely unfortunate if the European Parliament were to go so far as to propose a mandatory quota system for the representation of women on various election lists.
The EU does not have the power to interfere in nomination proceedings that comply with democratic ground rules.

Preparations for the European Council (8-9 March 2007) (debate)
The next item is a statement by the Council and the Commission on the preparations for the European Council on 8 and 9 March.
Mr President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, this spring summit of Heads of State or Government will, as in previous years, be primarily devoted to economic issues, the Lisbon Strategy in particular.
We are of course delighted that this year's spring summit is being held at a time when the economy is in a good state and good things are happening on the labour markets.
From this we arrive at the cautious conclusion that the Lisbon Strategy's first-fruits are appearing, but we are also persuaded that it would be quite inappropriate to rest on our laurels.
Far from doing that, we want to put the overall favourable trends and the incipient mood of optimism to work in the interests of further structural reforms, to join together in undertaking further efforts at securing for the long term, and building on, the successes of recent months, for it is important that we get Europe in top form ready for global competition.
Following intensive preparatory work, which was characterised by very close and very fruitful cooperation with the Commission, the meeting of the European Council on 8 and 9 March is ready to be hammered into shape.
The General Affairs and External Relations Council yesterday discussed the annotated agenda for the Council that the presidency had drafted, and I am glad to be able to tell you that the Member States wholeheartedly endorse the list of topics proposed by the presidency.
Over the coming weeks, COREPER will coordinate the contributions of the various sectoral Council formations and do further work on the draft conclusions for the Council in the light of their essential comments.
Perhaps I might remind the House at this point of the dates on which the various specialist Council will finalise their contributions.
The Energy Council will be meeting the day after tomorrow in order to discuss the Energy Action Plan, which is one of the really big issues for the European Council; the Education and Youth Council meets on 16 February, followed by the Competitiveness Council on 19 February and the Environmental Council on 20 February.
This round is concluded by the Council responsible for employment and social issues and the ECOFIN Council, which meet on 22 and 27 February respectively.
Although your House is not directly involved in these preparatory activities, I am able to assure you that the Presidency will be taking account of the opinions you have adopted in connection with the themes of the Summit.
Perhaps I might now go into rather more detail about the Presidency's plans for this year's spring summit.
I will also refer back to what the President of the Council said in this Chamber this morning.
We will endeavour to ensure that the European Council performs its essential role, which involves it in concentrating on core issues, setting general directions, taking decisions about the future and issuing policy guidelines to the responsible entities at European and national level.
Today's exchange of views and, of course the in-depth dialogue with the President of your House in the course of the session are, of course, important elements in performing this function.
With these general considerations in mind, we have tried to focus the European Council's deliberations on topics in respect of which action is generally recognised as being necessary and areas in which further efforts need to be made.
Our specific concern is with supporting the structural reforms embarked on in the Member States and moving them forward by integrating recommendations specific to the country in question.
Within the area of the internal market, we want to strengthen the shared desire to close loopholes, identify weak points, and make the EU more competitive against third countries, while at the same time pushing for the relaunch of the Doha Round.
We are no less keen to encourage innovation, research and education than to promote job creation and the further development of the European social model, central to all of which are 'flexicurity' and demographic change.
As the Federal Chancellor said this morning, better regulation is important to all of us, for there is, in it, considerable potential for making the European economy more competitive, and so the reduction of bureaucracy is a priority issue for the German Presidency.
We have set ourselves the goal of sending out ambitious messages from the meeting of the European Council; in practical terms, our main concern is with the simplification of existing laws and consideration of how the impact of new ones might be better assessed.
As the lawmaking authority, the Council and Parliament have a particular responsibility for ensuring that proposals from the Commission for the simplification of legislation are both thoroughly scrutinised and promptly processed.
Our main concern is that the reduction of bureaucracy be driven forward, particularly through clear quantitative targets being laid down.
Finally, the European Council, as decided last year, will give its attention to the EU's comprehensive plan for energy, which is committed to the EU's three fundamental goals in this area - security of supply, competitiveness, and environmental compatibility, the latter of which is always to be emphasised.
It is evident from the Strategic Energy Report, which the Commission presented in January, that only an energy policy that addresses all three points of this triangular objective will be equal to the challenges that face the EU, and that is why we are pushing for a bundle of measures without which - being taken together - the desired effect will not be forthcoming.
This package includes measures that reinforce competition on the internal energy market, that attach greater importance to renewable energies and help to develop better energy technologies and greater energy efficiency, and it is of great significance in this respect that greater weight is being given to the foreign policy components of energy policy.
I would like to make it clear that Europe must increasingly speak with one voice where energy issues are concerned.
The issue of climate protection is inseparable from that of energy.
Since climate change presents us with the challenge of the century, we are firmly determined to bring about ambitious and forward-looking resolutions, including quantitative targets, in this area too, and the proposals put forward by the Commission for full coordination on energy matters provide us with a good basis for this.
The European Council must work towards sending out a strong signal in favour of the further development of the international climate protection regime after 2012.
Only if the industrialised countries, led by the European Union, take the lead with commitment to demanding targets and measures will it be possible to expect the emerging countries to show the willingness to accept undertakings appropriate to their own circumstances to limit their own rapidly increasing emissions.
Many thanks, Mr President-in-Office, not only for what you said, but also for having used up only half the time available to you in saying it.
That is something we should take as an example when considering the reform of the way our House works; the Council, too, is capable of imposing limits on itself and nevertheless saying something worth hearing.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, March offers a real opportunity for the European Union.
Firstly, it gives us a chance to show citizens a European Union taking ambitious, clear decisions on subjects that they care deeply about.
Secondly, we will be called upon to agree a declaration that will not only celebrate our achievements over these 50 years, but set out what we can do in the future.
So, the two are closely linked.
A successful spring Council would provide the perfect springboard for an ambitious Berlin declaration.
Europe has to take action.
It has to be political, effective and play a key role when it comes to addressing the major challenges of today's globalised world.
Growth and jobs, climate change, energy: these are subjects on the minds of Europeans every day.
We have a real opportunity to show what the European Union can offer, of course, in full compliance with our renewed commitment to better regulation.
I should like to focus on climate change, energy and the growth and jobs agenda.
Two weeks ago the UN Panel on Climate Change set out clearly, calmly and irrefutably the facts on climate change.
The goal of limiting temperature gains to 2Â°C is still achievable - just!
The next decade or so will determine whether we manage to bring the situation under control.
Our international partners, investors and citizens are all looking to the European Union for clear, determined action.
The scale of the problem is huge.
A bold response is the only one that makes sense and that means practical policy proposals and binding targets.
That is why we proposed that developed countries accept a 30% emission reduction target by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
At the same time, nobody questions the need to bring developing countries into the global efforts to cut emissions, and they can realistically be put on track to limit the growth in their emissions, to start with, and to start cutting by 2020.
I expect the spring European Council to send a convincing and strong signal on the need for determined action on climate change.
The resolution on climate change, which this House will adopt tomorrow and which is both encouraging and stunning, contains an important and urgent message, which the Commission will pass on to the Heads of State and Government when climate issues are being discussed at the spring Council.
However, we must also show both inside and outside the EU that we are prepared to act ourselves today.
That is why the spring Council should agree a firm, independent EU commitment to achieving at least a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. This will be a real demonstration of our commitment.
Energy is key to cutting emissions.
However, it is more than that: secure supply, fairer prices and more choice are all issues that are central to citizens' daily concerns for themselves, their families and future generations and, of course, to European industry.
There is also an instinctive sense that these issues can only be tackled effectively at European level.
Therefore, this is also a stern test for the European Union itself.
Last month, the Commission set out its vision of how to put European energy policy on track and I very much welcome the supportive stance of this Parliament.
Whenever we face a long-term challenge, it is essential that Europeans can look to their democratically-elected representatives to explain why reform is essential, to put short-term change in the context of long-term purpose, to convince us that every one of us can play a part, for example through doing what we can on energy efficiency.
The comprehensive resolution that you adopted on 14 December last year reflects the essential role that Parliament plays in this context.
So the ambition and conviction of the European Council are critical.
We cannot put off decisions any longer.
Europe needs to send the clearest of messages that it is committed to transforming the shape of European energy over the next few decades.
Investors are ready to step in on a massive scale, but they need a clearer signal.
That means decisive action in the internal market.
It means real steps to ensure solidarity between Member States.
It means making research in this area our top priority, for example as the first target for the European Institute of Technology.
It means a precise, ambitious and, in particular, binding target of bringing renewable energy into the mainstream by 2020.
With a clear green light from the European Council, the Commission is ready to bring forward a wide range of precise legislative measures this year.
Climate change and energy are integral parts of the broader issue on which the spring Council will focus, the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
Real steps are being taken to invest more in innovation, to make life easier for new and growing businesses, to help citizens prepare for change.
The economic situation, as you know, is improving and Europe has shown that it is facing up to the challenge of globalisation, but these first steps now need to accelerate.
The consensus for change needs to be translated into action in all parts of Europe and in all sectors.
Modernising our economies and societies is essential if our values and quality of life are to flourish in this rapidly changing world.
The spring Council needs to give a clear message that we will press ahead with reform at all levels as set out in the Commission's annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, including the country-specific recommendations.
The Commission strongly welcomes Parliament's support on this point.
Your resolution gives a timely reminder of some of the key benchmarks by which the credibility of action will be assessed.
For example, reducing start-up time for new businesses to no more than one week, or cheaper protection of intellectual property rights.
Time is running out if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, tackle the global imbalance between energy supply and demand, and secure real modernisation.
It is time to put our best wisdom at the service of these objectives.
George Bernard Shaw said that we grow wise not by remembering the past, but by being responsible for the future.
At a time when we are celebrating 50 years of the European Union, this is a wise thing to remember.
Bold, ambitious and long-term decisions from the spring Council in March will put the European Union on the road to finding real answers to these most urgent questions.
Thank you very much, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, especially because you did not use all the time allocated to you.
This is a very good example from the Presidency and from the Commission.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each generation has a duty and responsibility to do its bit for progress.
Ours too is facing a challenge, namely that of globalisation.
We are living in a world that is changing fast and is opening up.
In the European Union, we need to face up to worldwide, sometimes aggressive, competition with an ageing population and against the backdrop of global warming.
This competition is becoming more cut-throat not only on the supply side of our market, but also on the demand side of the market of raw materials and energy.
We could ignore it, we could passively submit to it, or we could prepare for it.
If, however, we want to give today's children any prospect of a quality life and a good job, then there is only one answer: to ensure that we are competitive.
Being competitive does not mean yielding blindly to the pressures of globalisation.
It does mean, though, that we must equip ourselves with the right instruments that will guarantee us a future for what is dear to us, namely our European social model and the values on which our way of living and society are founded.
In order to be competitive, we need a bold vision, strategy and people, as well as resources.
We have the vision.
We have the Lisbon Strategy with the partnership for growth and jobs and this is something to which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have always been 100% committed.
We are also enormously grateful that the Barroso Commission is putting in so much effort, as is the German Presidency, with its desire to focus more on the weak areas that need improving and on a serious energy plan.
In the last Commission report, we read that the economic prospects had improved over the last year.
Let us seize this momentum to achieve our goals with all the more force, because there is a great deal left to be done, not least by the Member States of which the Commission reports sometimes show in too rosy a light.
With the spring summit in mind, we will be voting on a resolution tomorrow.
We have been able to verify it against the view of the national MPs, with whom we had a good meeting last week.
This resolution also voices our priorities that will be further highlighted by our shadow rapporteur, Mr Lehne.
The completion of the internal market, not least for both the consumer and the SME, administrative simplification, a study into the effect of the practice of goldplating, more research and innovation, a renewed approach to energy policy and to fighting climate change, with due attention to energy supply, affordability, less dependence, more renewable energy sources and lower greenhouse gas emissions. These are all measures that need to be taken if we want to achieve our objective of more growth and jobs.
For the majority of our group, there is room for nuclear energy as well, even though we fully respect the principle of subsidiarity in this respect.
Lisbon is, of course, more than the sum total I listed so far.
What matters most of all is caring about the well-being and dignity of the people and of their position and share in society.
This is also why all our attention is focused on training, education, lifelong learning, the fight against exclusion and sound migration policy and indeed, gender equality, for the fact that talented women opt out is also a form of brain drain.
As for labour market reform, we are looking forward to the discussion of the Commission document on flex-security.
Since Lisbon is about people, the process must also be supported by people.
As long as the European strategy for growth and jobs is seen by the public more as part of the problem than as the way to a solution, there is cause for concern.
The involvement of both the people and civil society must increase.
In previous major projects, such as Europe '92' at the time and also when the euro was introduced, we were successful thanks to a huge, broad-based communication initiative.
We, and certainly the Member States, missed opportunities during the enlargement process.
Without a proper communication strategy, Lisbon will not be understood properly, supported or carried out adequately, something that is probably attributable to a lack of political courage.
Hence, I would like to make a passionate plea to the three institutions to pledge their funds for this cause and also, if possible, to make some room for this in the important Berlin declaration that is being compiled.
I should like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteur for the resolution we will be endorsing tomorrow and which we prepared in the working party with the 33 under Mr Daul's presidency.
The resolution turned out to be rather long, but as it is one that enjoys broad support and that is also positive, it allows us to send out a broad message about where we want to take this strategy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when global problems are piling up, a number of EU Member States are tempted by nationalism.
The fact is that the indisputable lesson of the globalisation under way is that even Germany, France, Great Britain or, indeed, Poland are relatively helpless faced with the foreseeable rise of certain large nations.
Everyone concedes that the Treaty of Nice is no longer enough to ensure the effective governance of the EU-27.
However, the Constitutional Treaty has collapsed, and not only because of the French and Dutch 'no' votes but also because certain Heads of State or Government refuse to honour their signatures.
The vision of Europe cannot be summarised solely in terms of the internal market.
Our fellow citizens want to see a more social dimension and joint action that is more effective.
European integration began with the European Coal and Steel Community.
Last year, China became the world's top steel manufacturer.
In January, China and Russia signed 15 energy cooperation agreements, one of them relating to the construction of two gas pipelines, each with a capacity of 40 billion cubic metres.
This month, India, China and Russia are to take part in a tripartite forum with a view to promoting trade with each other.
The United States and Russia have just signed a joint nuclear research agreement.
The Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Russians and Americans are cooperating in the development of new technologies designed to combat climate change.
Where, then, is Europe in all this?
We are far from the solidarity of the now defunct CECA.
We are struggling to define an energy policy characterised by solidarity and therefore of a joint character, and this at a time when our energy dependence is increasing.
Admittedly, we are giving priority to ambitious objectives, but with deadlines in 2020, 2030 or 2050, that is to say beyond the foreseeable future.
Chancellor Merkel reminded us this morning that the EU was responsible for 15% of total CO2 emissions.
According to Commissioner Dimas, our share fell to 14% in 2006 - a figure indicative not of greater efficiency on the part of Europeans but of an increase in the emissions of other industrialised nations.
If it is obvious that Europe must set an example, it is no less obvious that we are not going to be able to overcome global problems on our own. Europe has some aces up its sleeve when it comes to making its presence felt in the global debate.
We remain the biggest economic power, generating 30% of gross world product.
More than a third of the two thousand largest companies in the world are European.
We still lead the world in practically all sectors, with the exceptions of digital technology and biotechnology, and the Lisbon Summit has defined a strategy for remedying these deficiencies.
This strategy is still a live one, even if progress is desperately slow, particularly where research and innovation are concerned.
The forthcoming summit will provide the opportunity for a new departure.
All the analyses have been carried out, and all the problems are known. The time for practical decisions has come.
The political relaunch of Europe must take place by June at the latest. That, at least, is the ambition of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, EU growth in 2006 hit 2.7 % - the highest in six years.
Unemployment is at its lowest since 1998, at 7.9 %.
One is tempted to say, 'well done!', but that 2.7 % growth has to be measured against 9.5 % in China and India, and our 7.9 % unemployment rate against under 5 % in the United States and 4.1 % in Japan.
In this light, the Lisbon goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 sounds not only ambitious but unrealistic.
We have already dropped the target date.
Can we maintain the target?
Well, we hold this debate annually; some Member States perennially ignore our exhortations.
The Kok Report told us two years ago that the objectives of Lisbon have become muddled and the results are unconvincing.
It is because some Member States have tried to muddle through instead of reforming their ways.
Lisbon will only work if reform is made Europe-wide.
Solidarity cannot mean those governments who have gone through the tough process of reform now having to bail out those who have not.
In some countries, even the opposition does not see the need for reform; it makes promises to citizens which cannot be kept and, I am tempted to say:
(FR) It might be said that there is a dire need in this case for a reality check.
A knowledge-based economy needs a willingness to learn.
We in Europe can learn from each other.
Economic growth and low unemployment, a dynamic business environment and high social standards are not mutually exclusive - look at Denmark or Finland.
The way to modernise social protection and benefit systems is to bring in more flexibility.
Youth unemployment is far too high, but protecting our citizens does not mean that we have to protect uncompetitive jobs.
The social safety net should not prop up failing businesses, but help those affected to reintegrate into new business opportunities.
My group believes, too, that investing in green technologies is key to containing climate change and catering for energy security in Europe.
Energy is literally the driving force of our economy, and, as our Energy Ministers meet this week in Brussels, they must rise to the challenge and have the courage to open up the energy sector to greater competition and flexibility, not just separating infrastructure from supply.
Building a true European energy market is important but not sufficient: we also need to cut energy consumption, and I hope the Commission will be even more ambitious in future than it has been.
We have got to create incentives for individuals to change their habits and make thoughtful purchases and investments through using the tax system.
We also have to deliver proper implementation of European legislation, letting our citizens know what needs to be done, and Member States have to live up to their promises of economic reform so that we can give the green light to Lisbon.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Gloser, ladies and gentlemen, one of the things that irritates the general public most of all is the European Union's excessive regulations. Rules that are not just too numerous but also hard to understand and complex: this trend must be halted.
