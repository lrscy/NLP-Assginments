I also see it as very important that these rules should cover not only sales, but also their mediation and brokerage.
It is not, however, the legal basis that is the actual problem where arms exports are concerned; the real problem lies in the different ways in which these legal bases are applied in the various countries within the European Union.
It is on this problem that we must focus our efforts â for a start, by declaring the Code to be legally binding.
If this cannot be done at Community level, there is nothing to prevent the Member States from doing it, and, indeed, a number of them already have done so.
This is the road down which we must go; whilst, on the one hand, we must aim to eventually stop treating intra-Community transfers of defence equipment as exports, this can be done only when every country in the European Community applies the rules relating to this uniformly and with rigour.
Let me now turn to the question of the embargo on China.
My group takes the view that this strategic partnership with China is what will take us into the future, and that we must seek to bring it about.
We are aware, though, that there are a few problems left outstanding, such as Chinaâs approach to human rights, problems that have to do with Taiwan and Tibet, and so my groupâs position is that the conditions are not yet in place that would allow us to lift this embargo on China.
Â Â  , Mr President, I should like to join in thanking the Presidency and, in particular, Mr Patten.
We are very sorry because the EU could still benefit from âhis wayâ.
Whilst the proliferation of nuclear arms calls to mind apocalyptic scenarios, the fanning of the flames of conflict by the trade in conventional arms does incalculable harm to the development of many communities, and leads to death and to the violation of the human rights of millions of civilians throughout the world.
According to the strategic safety approach adopted by the EU, the main threats that we must address are regional instability, failing states, organised crime and international terrorism, all of which are threats that might be exacerbated by unchecked arms exports to buyers outside the EU.
In recent years, we have seen efforts by EU Member States to improve controls on exports of conventional arms originating in, or passing through, Europe.
There remains much to do, however.
As Socialists, we argue that the Code of Conduct on arms exports must become binding, and that national and European legislation must be adopted with a view to increasing transparency in the activity of arms brokering.
The scope of the prohibition of exports of certain instruments, such as those used in torture, or anti-personnel mines, must be widened.
The sale of arms to governments or groups in conflict zones must be subject to tighter control, in light of information obtained by the control mechanisms set up by the United Nations Security Council to enforce arms embargos.
EU governments have a responsibility â one that they must not shirk â to press ahead with internal laws aimed at ensuring that companies and individuals breaking arms embargos declared by the EU or by the UN Security Council are seen to be punished.
As Socialists, we support measures to mitigate the effects of the arms trade, such as the creation of a tax to assist victims of armed conflict and to combat poverty, as recently proposed in the current UN General Assembly.
The EU can and must go further.
With measures such as those identified in this Resolution â of which we voted in favour â and extending the binding enforcement of the Code of Conduct, not only to our partners in the enlarged Europe, but also to our new neighbours, so that there can be a common European arms market, in which the recently set up European Arms Agency plays a control and regulation role.
As Socialists, we have tabled practical amendments on this Motion for a Resolution calling on the Council and Member States to maintain the arms embargo on the Peopleâs Republic of China and to ensure a coherent approach as regards arms embargos in general.
The embargo was imposed following the Tiananmen Square massacre and has been maintained ever since, due to the serious human rights problems that persist in China. This is despite the fact that China has opened up to the outside world and has recorded extraordinary economic growth.
In 2003, Parliament delivered an opinion through a specific resolution on this issue and recommended maintaining the embargo.
Parliamentâs reports, along with those of various human rights non-governmental organisations, have, year after year, highlighted grave concern over human rights violations in China and Tibet.
One resolution on the suitability of the arms embargo as a means of bringing about significant change cannot lead to a lifting of the arms embargo, at least for as long as there is no binding Code of Conduct on the export of arms and instruments that may be used for internal repression and torture.
The entire scheme must be consistent in this area, yet the recent decision to lift the arms embargo on Libya is inconsistent and leaves the EU open to accusations of double standards.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Romeva Ruedaâs report is an especially balanced one, containing plenty of interesting recommendations on how to improve the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, and it is to be hoped that the Council will take them on board this time.
Only then can the Code become an efficient and effective instrument of control, legally binding, and with sanctions for non-compliance.
Let me make specific reference to paragraph 20 of the report, which calls for the EU to maintain its embargo on China.
Lifting the embargo now would be an especially poor message; it would, I think, be a classic example of hypocrisy and of a selective approach to the defence and protection of human rights around the world.
The values and standards by which the EU sets such store would then once again be taking second place to crude mercantilism.
The prospect of fat juicy orders for German submarines and French aircraft appears to be reason enough for some to thwart the arms embargo on China.
To do so would make the EU look like a horse-trader selling his principles for a handful of pieces of silver, and that, Mr NicolaÃ¯, is just not on under a Dutch presidency.
Europe cannot, indeed, supply weapons to a country seeking to use military force to secure the unity of its territory and now making continual threats of military action in the Straits of Taiwan, where over five hundred rockets have been set up.
The idea that the Code of Conduct could impose tight restrictions on arms exports is thus a false excuse. The risk of China passing on weaponry to developing countries has not gone away.
No matter what, the lifting of the arms embargo cannot be an option for our group.
Â Â  . Personally, I am delighted with the words I have heard from Members of this House and I note that Parliament has certainly adopted a wise attitude.
I should like to say to Mr von Wogau â whom I congratulate on his position on the lifting of the embargo, in other words, his desire not to lift it â that at the same time the restrictive nature of the Code cannot be left in the hands of the Member States.
It is clear that certain Heads of Government have few scruples when it comes to China.
Have we not heard MrÂ Chirac say that the embargo belonged to a different era?
In this context, I should call on these Heads of State, whose eyes have clearly been opened wide by the enormous market that China represents, to go and take a closer look at what is happening in stadiums, at what is happening in Iveco trucks and at what is happening in a number of places where summary executions are carried out.
I feel that China is the current world champion of human rights violations and, failing that, the world champion of capital punishment, which goes on unchecked and in entirely unacceptable extrajudicial conditions. I should like to ask if violating the Code, which, as everyone has said, the lifting of the arms embargo on China would represent, should not also be condemned if expressed verbally, as some Heads of State have done.
I welcome the fact that the Council is seeking to reform the Code and urge strenuous efforts to prevent such statements, which clearly harm the credibility of many policies pursued by the EU in the field of respect for human rights.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a great risk that this debate will become an annual ritual, in which we declare ourselves more or less of one mind, but all that remains afterwards is a list of good intentions and recommendations to the Commission and the Council.
In order to avoid this it is absolutely necessary that the Code of Conduct should become legally binding and that we set out strict sanctions against businesses registered in the European Union which do not respect it.
It is also essential for the Union to commit itself to demanding that other countries, such as the United States, Russia and China, adhere to the Code of Conduct, in view of the fact, as well, that over 50% of world arms manufacturing takes place in countries that are members of the UN Security Council.
As we speak, my country, Italy, has increased its arms exports by 25% in one year and is forecasting a 40% increase in future.
Among the greatest beneficiaries of the Italian arms trade is Saudi Arabia, which is certainly not an example of a country that is respectful of rights.
I believe that we certainly must maintain the embargo on arms sales to China, and, moreover, that the protection of human rights must take absolute priority over the economic interests of profit.
One final observation: last year, world military spending equalled 900 billion dollars, 700 billion dollars of which was spent in the civilised countries of the first world alone.
That is not the kind of civilisation that we want!
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate, and indeed debates on values are particularly important in the European Union.
As we are talking of values with regard to this particular case, however, I should like to draw your attention to a number of other cases.
Poland, which at the time was experiencing difficulties, was once persuaded by one of the most important countries in the world to stop sending arms to a South-East Asian country.
In agreeing to this, Poland did significant damage to its economic potential.
The country in question promptly took advantage of the opening left by Poland, and made a clear profit in doing so.
The Code of Conduct is a necessary and rational solution, but I should like to emphasise at this point that if it is to serve any useful purpose, it must be formally binding throughout the European Union.
An international agreement must also be signed, and the latter should at least be approved by the United States and Russia.
If it turns out that by taking the lead we will impoverish our societies and economies in the name of the so-called values at which we excel, and that others will take our place, increasing their advantage over our economies and the opportunities we have to influence the global situation, we will actually reduce our chances of improving the enforcement of human rights throughout the world.
I am in favour of lifting sanctions against China, as they are ineffective and reduce the EUâs opportunities for economic development.
Â Â  Â Â MrÂ President â I was about to say Minister â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has to react to a situation where half a million people die each year from violence related to light weapons, both in armed conflicts and in connection with criminal activity.
This debate is part of our reaction.
The European Union exports death, although it must be said that it exports it mainly out of Europe, as during the past five years as much as 80% of EU arms exports went to countries outside Europe.
We should not let ourselves be carried away by the wishful thinking of pacifists who would like to rid the world of wars and arms, as such fancies lack any basis in reality.
We can and must control the production and sale of arms in the EU, however.
We must also be firm in demanding this of the future EU Member States.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs has adopted amendments I tabled to this effect.
The countries involved are of course Romania and Bulgaria, and also Croatia and Turkey.
As a Polish citizen, I should like to draw your attention to an initiative taken by the Polish Government.
Together with the Swedish Government, it has already organised five informal meetings of COARM, the Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports, with the participation of both old and new Member States.
I should also like to lend my wholehearted support to itemÂ 28 of the motion for a resolution, concerning an export ban on all equipment used for the death penalty and torture.
At the same time, however, I have my doubts as to whether the proposal in itemÂ 40, concerning a special tax on the arms trade, is realistic.
I do not believe that a further tax would help bring about peace in Europe and the world, although it might appease the consciences of bureaucrats.
Â Â  Mr President, it may even be true that the embargo against China seems anachronistic, especially after the lifting of the embargo against Libya, which is certainly not a model of respect for human rights.
It is also understandable that China, a sovereign state, should seek to reinforce its defences to protect its security and territorial integrity.
It is also true that a little progress has been made in improving respect for human rights, and that China remains a protagonist in the fight against terrorism and is exerting useful pressure on North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons.
However, it is also true that Beijing is trying to exploit the differences between ourselves and the United States on the subject.
I am astonished that no one in this House has drawn attention to this dimension: our transatlantic relationship, which for us must remain of primary importance, will be affected by the more or less unified approach that we adopt towards the growing power of China.
We also need to take account of the strategic, albeit precarious balance that currently exists in the Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan is a model of democracy from which China is still very far removed.
If, therefore, we intend to lift the embargo for reasons of , for economic and political reasons, rather than out of respect for democracy, we should be able to do so only by binding the Chinese Peopleâs Republic to clear and continuous progress on human rights, as the Commissionâs representative has moreover said today.
We must try at least to discuss â I do not mean harmonise â our position with that of the United States and those European countries that are currently opposed to removing the embargo.
I consider it essential that our approach to this issue should be as unified and as concerted as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, the supply of weapons from EU Member States to third countries needs to comply with a common, clear, and binding framework that must be capable of being tested.
That is of course a requirement if we want to bring about a truly responsible European policy.
It is quite simply a pity, as Mr NicolaÃ¯ said, that a number of countries are still resolutely standing in the way of a binding framework of this kind.
Three important test criteria are a conventional human rights policy and of course the resultant practice in a given country, regional tensions in a specific field and also the ratio between what a country spends, on the one hand, on combating poverty, and, on the other, on its defence budget.
It is against these yardsticks that the attempt by China â and now also by a number of countries within Europe â to have the arms embargo lifted must be measured.
The human rights situation is still a matter of concern to the EU, and rightly so.
China may well have signed up to essential treaties, but what it does in practice is another matter.
The treatment of dissidents, of ethnic and religious minorities, and the large-scale imposition of the death penalty are, to put it simply, very worrying.
Tight restrictions on freedom of expression and on workersâ rights, as well as on the right to form trade unions and to go on strike are also still giving cause for serious concern.
The second point about regional development is also self-evident.
Tensions are apparent at the level of global politics.
Let me conclude with the economic aspect.
China is of course undergoing enormous social changes and is, in economic terms, extremely dynamic; it is also characterised by hardworking capitalism on a vast scale, and by massive economic growth.
In this, a lot of people have lost out, though; there is inequality in the shape of some 200 million people in search of work, living below the poverty level, accompanied by all the social unrest that results from that.
In such a situation, economic change needs to go hand in hand with fundamental political reforms and social democracy, so I wholeheartedly endorse the position my group has taken in this House, that being that the arms embargo must not be lifted now, while also stressing the need for dialogue with China, which is a towering actor in both economic and political terms.
We in Europe must try to foster the process of democratisation and offer to help resolve social problems.
We must help China to play its part as a global actor effectively and fairly, for that is in the interests of the international legal system.
Â Â  MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, it is always good to see you again.
The arms embargo against China was the EUâs response to the events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
It was our way of showing our abhorrence of what happened to thousands of peaceful demonstrating students.
Since then, the world has changed.
China has changed, but not the regime.
China is the worldâs largest dictatorship.
Hundreds of thousands of dissidents are oppressed or imprisoned in labour camps.
The country leads the world in terms of executions; human rights are infringed every day; freedom of expression is severely restricted, and all opposition is in principle banned.
The regime would thus seem not to be changing, and now we are discussing whether we should lift the embargo, in spite of the fact that no changes have occurred.
What kind of signals does this send to the surrounding world and to China?
China presents good trade opportunities, and we must trade with China; but we must not forget with whom we are dealing.
We cannot betray all the thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of democracy activists, political prisoners and young people who secretly surf the Net to find out what is really happening.
All these people have their hopes pinned on Europe.
Are we to betray them by selling weapons to the regime that oppresses them?
Are we to have European missiles and submarines directed against the Democratic Republic of Taiwan?
No, we must be consistent.
It is our credibility that is at stake, and that is more important than the French mirage aircraft, the Swedish JASÂ Gripen or German submarines.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is counting upon you, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, to stand up for human rights and retain the embargo and to send that message to the Council.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to emphasise to this House today that the Code of Conduct is, as Mr NicolaÃ¯ rightly said, a very important instrument, but let us be realistic.
Day-to-day practice â and I include my own country in this â indicates that there are still plenty of loopholes, that definitions are unclear, that prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and that commercial considerations all too often take precedence over respect for human rights.
The result of that is suffering to an unacceptable degree, an unacceptable number of people suffering oppression, and an unacceptable number of people killed.
Hence, therefore, our Houseâs justifiable demand for a stricter formulation; hence also the justifiable demand for this Code to be made binding in law; hence also the need for more monitoring, including of end-users.
That is why it is right that the embargo on China should remain in place, and so countries such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Scandinavian countries, Poland and the Czech Republic, which, in the Council, are still saying that they want the embargo to stay, have my full support.
Stand firm, Mr NicolaÃ¯, and do not lift the embargo, neither at the EU-China summit on 8 December nor at the European Council on 17 December.
We are all right behind you.
Â Â  Mr President, even to consider lifting the arms embargo on China is in fact an outrage that cries out to Heaven.
Contrary to what one speaker has just argued, the arms embargo is no anachronism.
Maintaining the embargo is, first and foremost, about human rights. It is not about Chinaâs immense population, and the extraordinarily interesting economic potential it offers, inducing us to suddenly throw our principles in human rights matters overboard.
If France â to name but one country â gets what it wants and the embargo on China is lifted, the European Union will lose all the credibility it has.
This is not just a human rights issue; it is also about the fact that China constitutes a positive threat to Taiwan, which is a democratic country.
Over 600 rockets are trained on Taiwan, and it is disgraceful that we are even contemplating supplying new weaponry to a country that is threatening a democracy in such a fashion.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, Commissioner Patten, while the Councilâs representative has been very frank in laying bare the ongoing disputes between two groups within it, I think the important thing for us has to be proper consideration, at the Summit, of the fundamentals of our relationship with China.
It is on this that the Presidency should try to agree, while acknowledging that, although there have indeed been improvements over recent years in the way in which human rights are handled in the Peopleâs Republic of China, they have not gone anything like far enough.
It is evident from the way in which religious freedom, freedom of assembly and association and the freedom of the press continue to be brutally repressed in the Peopleâs Republic of China that it simply is not enough to cast a veil of economic interest over it.
I therefore call on the Council to draw a clear line here and to say that we acknowledge the improvements, but that they are utterly inadequate.
China, under its new leadership, must make the first move.
I agree with the previous speakers that we cannot lift the arms embargo while prominent representatives of the government in Beijing are threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, as they did yesterday.
It is not acceptable that armed force across the Taiwan Strait should be a means of making policy.
Commissioner Patten has always shown us the right way to go.
We have always called for political dialogue between the Peopleâs Republic of China and Taiwan â a political dialogue on which both states must embark.
I hope that the Chinese political leadership will indeed take the first approach, that of resuming dialogue through association.
At a time when the Peopleâs Republic of China is threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message.
I think we are all agreed on that, and, at the Summit, the Council should do some straight talking to that effect.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like first of all to welcome the progress made with regard to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, but it is still a sad fact that 500Â 000 people die each year as a result of the use of small arms and light weapons.
These are, in my view, the real weapons of mass destruction in the world today.
It is extraordinary that while we know that 20% of the weapons that the United States sells fall into the wrong hands, we have no statistics whatsoever on the quantity of arms exports from the European Union that fall into the wrong hands.
We have no idea of the extent to which we are responsible for the 500Â 000 deaths resulting from the use, and indeed misuse, of small arms exports.
On the question of China, it is neither wise nor indeed feasible to believe that we can ignore or isolate China.
Nevertheless, it is important that we maintain pressure on the Chinese Government to improve the political and human rights situation in China.
It is therefore necessary to maintain the embargo and indeed to tie it in with making our own Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally binding.
Â Â  Mr President, I am anxious to contribute to this debate to emphasise two main points.
First of all, there is nothing wrong with legitimate arms trade and legitimate EU arms exports consistent with a working code of conduct.
Secondly and more importantly, effective control of arms exports is an essential part of a coherent policy that meets EU objectives on peace, respect for human rights and democracy.
As many speakers have said, conventional arms kill more that half a million people a year, that is one person every minute.
There are 639 million small arms in circulation in the world produced by over one thousand companies in a least 98 countries.
It is essential therefore that the EU have a strict arms code policy that equates with EU values if we are to offer global leadership on this issue.
The EU must also continue to promote an international code of conduct.
The export of small arms in particular to third countries which do not uphold values of democracy and human rights creates greater instability, not just in the regions to which the arms are exported, but for the world as a whole.
It is a fact that uncontrolled arms exports undermine global security.
The voluntary code of conduct in the European Union has had some success; we need to build on that success.
Continuing the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on a voluntary basis in the future does not go far enough.
I support the recommendation that the voluntary code becomes a legally binding one.
This would be a bold step but one that can allow the European Union to increase its control, in a more realistic way, over the export of arms from European Union countries.
I would like to comment on the recommendations in the report that a tax be imposed on arms exports.
It is my view that if the industry in Europe abides by a binding code of conduct and the only arms being traded are legitimate and consistent with that code, it is then inappropriate to burden the industry with an extra tax.
With regard to the lifting of the embargo on arms in China, I support the rapporteur's view that the ban should remain in place.
While I welcome and support the dialogue and the development of a positive relationship between the European Union and China, removal of the arms embargo in the immediate term is still premature.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the Council's proposal to lift the arms embargo on China.
I want to ask everyone, has any foreign state threatened China?
If yes, then which one?
If no, then why are modern arms needed by a state which is known for its neglect of human rights, its one party dictatorship and the absence of the rule of law.
Since when did the European Union decide to arm communist dictatorships?
We have seen how the People's Republic of China threatened and continues to threaten a democratic state like Taiwan with military invasion.
If we wish to avoid fanning additional flames of tension in that region, then we must approve the document prepared by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which recommends that the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China is not lifted. Otherwise we can expect one more conflict, to which, no doubt, we would react with some sort of new resolution.
But that would have no effect.
When talking about a code, it must be said that it ought to be legally binding. Otherwise it will only be an empty collection of papers.
Â Â  Mr President, British Conservatives believe that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports has worked well as a politically binding instrument since it came into being in 1998, but there is scope for some improvement and refinement.
However, we are opposed to the Code becoming legally binding.
We sense that there are often fine political decisions to be made and that these are best taken by politically accountable ministers rather than by judges.
Some of the information on which decisions are based is highly sensitive and confidential and should remain within the domain of government.
We certainly would not wish to see the European Court of Justice involved in this area.
In any case, a legally binding ban would merely present another opportunity for certain states to exercise their hypocrisy, as we have seen, for example, with the efforts by some to evade the European Union's targeted sanctions against regimes in Zimbabwe and Burma or, indeed, the efforts by certain states to circumvent UN sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
If we look at the Romeva i Rueda report, some of its provisions would simply be counterproductive if adopted.
For example, it calls for the publication of information on the number of licences refused, stating the reasons for refusal.
The published details on licence applications that have been denied would give unscrupulous arms manufacturers and dealers knowledge about which goods are wanted by whom â effectively a rogue traders' customer list.
We already have adequate laws in the United Kingdom, but want to encourage other states to meet our own high standards.
You can be sure that any new EU law would be gold-plated and rigorously enforced in Britain but ignored in other countries.
We spend a lot of time policing ourselves in Europe, but the main problems are countries which are not bound by any scruples or international rules.
Â Â  Mr President, every year arms kill hundreds of thousands of people and cause immeasurable human suffering.
Not only are unlawful killings in wartime on the increase, but equipment is being misused by soldiers, paramilitaries and police to kill, wound and commit terrible atrocities against civilians in peacetime as well.
On current trends, by 2020 the number of deaths and injuries from war and violence will overtake the number of deaths caused by diseases such as malaria and measles.
Although the EU Code of Conduct was welcome as a first step, export controls across the EU still have many weaknesses and loopholes and we need the political will to implement the changes required to add to and tighten up the Code criteria, to regulate licensed production overseas, to apply the Code to weapons components, to strengthen arms embargoes and to ensure that all EU Member States publish annual reports on arms exports, which Austria, Greece and Luxembourg have failed to do.
Otherwise the rules will continue to be bypassed.
For example, the helicopters used against civilians and insurgents by the security forces in Nepal contain EU components.
German Deutsche AG diesel engines bypass EU embargoes by going to China and to Burma and the production of military small arms has been shifted to Malaysia, a country that has aggressive export plans for these arms and would not be subject to the EU Code.
As already indicated in operative provision 11, this should not stop at Europe.
The British Conservatives hypocritically preach that others should do what they claim is done in Britain.
I am proud of what Britain has done, but I want to see an international arms trade treaty.
They will not support that in this resolution.
Finally, I should like to endorse the view expressed in this debate that there are many hurdles to be overcome before the embargo against China can be lifted.
First, it is crucial that any decision to lift the embargo should not adversely affect stability across the Taiwan Straits.
Second, we need to understand fully the impact on the flow of arms if the embargo is lifted.
Third, we should express our continuing concerns about China's human rights record and any decision must be subject to its progress in meeting human rights standards.
Â Â  . I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament for their remarks on this very important matter.
Let me start with the sensitive issue of China.
Strong opinions have been expressed about human rights and other concerns, such as regional conflicts.
It was stressed that the Council should not lift the arms embargo on China, with almost all the Members of Parliament present expressing the same sentiments.
MrÂ Van Hecke mentioned the Dutch position.
However, everyone knows that I am here not as a representative of the Dutch Government, but of the Council presidency.
Nevertheless, the Dutch Government is facing a very critical Dutch Parliament, which is almost unanimously of the same opinion as this Parliament.
That is also the case in other countries.
I listened very closely to your remarks and share many of your concerns on this matter.
These are currently also being voiced in the Council, and I must make it clear that even if this embargo is lifted, a restrictive EU export policy will be applied.
It is important to be aware of that.
With regard to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, many Members of Parliament mentioned the issue of the Code's status and stressed the importance of it being legally binding.
Mr Van Orden, on the other hand, mentioned the issue of judicial consequences and the possible increase of the role of judges, which is also under discussion in the Council.
I understand the arguments but you must be aware that positions are divided in the Council.
The content of the Code and how we implement it is of greater importance than its status, which would probably have no effect on the arms export policy of the individual Member States.
I agree with Mr Czarnecki, who stressed the importance of aspiring Member States applying the Code of Conduct.
That is one of the reasons that the presidency organised a seminar to help these countries in that respect.
Mr Agnoletto stressed the importance of urging other countries â the Russian Federation and the US â to apply this Code.
We are in regular contact with these countries, aiming to maximise cooperation in this field, thus making export policy more efficient.
Mr von Wogau raised the issue of differences in the interpretation of the criteria, which is indeed an important point.
I agree and have already told Parliament that harmonisation of the application of the criteria is an important objective.
In another question, Mr Henin asked about post-shipment controls.
As I stated in my initial remarks, post-shipment controls are essential to ensuring that arms go where they are meant to go and do not fall into the wrong hands.
Unlike the US, the EU Member States do not apply such controls, at least not on a regular and systematic basis.
This issue has been identified as a priority in the Sixth EU Arms Export report.
As a first step Member States will in the near future organise a meeting with US experts in order to be briefed on the US programme.
On the basis of this briefing, Member States will have to decide how best to move forward this important issue both nationally and jointly.
There were also questions from Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Gomes about the trade regulation on torture equipment.
This draft regulation is at present being discussed in Council.
Mrs Gomes also asked about taxation of the arms trade.
We are aware of the various suggestions made in that regard, including those by Member States of the European Union.
However no concrete detailed proposals are currently being discussed within the European Union.
I would like to conclude by commenting on what MrÂ Romeva i Rueda said in his introduction.
On the one hand he paid compliments to the presidency for the review of the Code of Conduct, but on the other hand he said it was not enough.
In a way I agree that we should go further, and that this should not be the final step.
It is indeed a first review and we should continue our efforts.
I very much appreciate Parliament's strong commitment to this issue and the active role that Parliament has played.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  . We must defend the values of freedom and democracy through the legitimate use of words and the responsible adoption of legislation.
The fact that the Peopleâs Republic of China is a big market should not lead us to forget that its political regime has inherited what remains a distinctly Communist system of values, which is a very long way from meeting acceptable standards.
The people of Taiwan are still suffering the political oppression and economic isolation imposed on them by the Peopleâs Republic of China, which has recently threatened Taiwan once again with military action.
The conditions are not in place for lifting the embargo on the trade in arms.
If under current circumstances it is hardly possible to restrict the arms race of the Peopleâs Republic of China, then what will happen if the embargo is lifted?
Furthermore, it would be seen as an approval of the current status of confrontation, rather than an insistence on the necessary political dialogue between the Peopleâs Republic and Taiwan.
Let us promote political action rather than military action.
Â Â  The next item is Council and Commission statements on the ALTHEA mission in Bosnia Herzegovina.
I give the floor again to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr NicolaÃ¯.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Security and Defence Policy is on the brink of a historic step.
The EU's first military crisis management operation, Operation ALTHEA, will start on 2 December.
In the development of the ESDP, we have made great progress from concepts and capabilities to concrete actions.
Like the first EU police mission, the first military operation will take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The preparations for the deployment of Operation ALTHEA after SFOR leaves Bosnia and Herzegovina are well advanced.
An operational concept has been approved, force generation has taken place, and 11 third countries have been invited to contribute to the operation.
A committee of contributors has had its first meeting and the operations plan has been approved by the Council.
Operation ALTHEA will be an EU-led operation, with the use of NATO assets and capabilities.
Therefore, the Deputy SACEUR was appointed operation commander in early July.
The operation's HQ has been established in Mons.
In early October the force headquarters in Sarajevo reached initial operational capability with a view to reaching full operational capability by early December, when authority is transferred from SFOR.
People might consider the transfer of the operation from SFOR to the EU a big and risky step.
They might have doubts about the capabilities of the EU mission.
However they are wrong, if only because 80% of the SFOR forces have transferred to ALTHEA, while the departing 20%, which are US forces, will be replaced by additional European forces.
All the EU Member States currently contributing to SFOR will continue their contributions in ALTHEA.
However, ALTHEA is not just an EU operation.
Third countries like Morocco, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway and Turkey will participate as well.
I am very pleased about their participation, because it shows that it is not just the EU that cares about Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As members of the committee of contributors, these countries will have the same rights and obligations as the EU Member States taking part in the operation in terms of its day-to-day management.
No effort has been spared in ensuring a smooth transition from NATO to the EU and that includes the delineation of tasks between ALTHEA and the remaining NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, arrangements on the availability and use of reserve forces and on the sharing of intelligence.
The EURFOR commanding officer and the commander of the remaining NATO headquarters will be based at the same camp, ensuring operational coordination.
NATO itself also remains present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We therefore have a NATO strategic reserve for support in emergencies.
This can be used for both NATO and Operation ALTHEA.
This is a good example of the pragmatic and efficient use of limited resources.
It also emphasises the good cooperation between the EU and NATO.
With the transition from NATO to the EU, the last phase of military presence will start.
The accent will no longer be on the prevention of inter-ethnic fighting but on assisting civil and military reforms.
After that, a military presence can be withdrawn.
With ALTHEA, we are contributing to the security and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is important to the reforms in that country.
At the same time, operation ALTHEA is â dare I say â the final element in a comprehensive European Union policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is also part of our broader strategy for the Balkans.
The combined activities in the political, economic development and security fields mutually reinforce each other.
The situation in the country has a direct impact on the region and on the EU.
We therefore have a clear interest in its stability and prosperous development.
EU involvement is not only in its interests but also in our own and, given our comprehensive and coherent approach, it is only logical that the EU has taken over the NATO operation.
The ultimate objective is to put Bosnia on track towards the EU and this will be achieved through the strengthened stabilisation and association process.
The EU military mission, together with other EU activities such as the EU police mission, the EU monitoring mission and the CARDS development programme, will complement that process
A comprehensive approach reflects our belief that the future of Bosnia lies firmly in Europe.
It exemplifies our long-term commitment.
It is now up to the Bosnian people to make the vision come true.
They will eventually have to decide whether to join the European political and economic union.
Such a choice requires fundamental reforms of state, economic and judicial structures.
Equally, they will have to confirm the decision to join the European community of values.
Such a decision requires an environment of tolerance, dialogue, respect for religious freedoms and a tough stance in words and deeds against the impunity of war criminals.
The right political will and popular support by the Bosnians, combined with our comprehensive role, could and should lead Bosnia away from conflict into a stable and peaceful future, a future in which our special representative Lord Ashdown will play an ever more important role.
Let me conclude by saying that Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the right track.
Stability and security are increasing and, with its integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, the country is moving more and more from the area of Dayton to the area of Brussels.
However, much remains to be done, because we are still concerned about the lack of cooperation with ICTY, particularly in the case of the Republika Srpska.
ICTY cooperation is an important criterion for closer relations with the EU and NATO.
Here Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to deliver.
I hope the reforms of the defence and police apparatus, one of the key tasks of ALTHEA, will also bear fruit in that field.
In that way operation ALTHEA will bring even more benefit to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their quest for a durable and just peace.
Â Â  . I am extremely glad to have this opportunity to say a few words about Bosnia and Herzegovina, just two weeks before the handover to EUFOR on 2 December.
The launching of the ALTHEA mission is an important event: important because it will be the first significant military operation undertaken under the European Security and Defence Policy.
The transfer from NATO has required long and detailed discussions because it was crucial to get things right from the very start.
My colleagues Mr Solana and Mr de Hoop Scheffer deserve a great deal of credit for securing a successful outcome.
I know some will be concerned that a brand new military mission in Bosnia sends a signal that the country continues to suffer from significant instability.
That would, in my judgement, be an entirely wrong conclusion to draw.
Last Spring the North Atlantic Council Ministerial Meeting noted an 'improved security environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina'.
As a result they decided to reduce the number of troops committed to SFOR from 12 000 to 7 000.
I have been visiting Bosnia for several years and I can personally attest to the transformation which has come over the country during that period.
It would be the height of folly to take for granted the undoubted improvements which have occurred.
All that is happening is that Europe is taking on more direct responsibility for its own continent â not before time, some might say.
However, there will be a review of the operation every six months.
This will take account of its duration, as well as its size and configuration.
There is no question of keeping troops in Bosnia unnecessarily; as soon as conditions permit, the number of troops can be reduced and eventually the mission will come to an end.
It is important at this time to recognise that Bosniaâs European future will assume growing importance as the military presence continues to reduce in size.
Bosnia, like all the countries of the Western Balkans, has a clear European perspective as a potential candidate country.
Last November the Commission published a feasibility study setting out 16 points on which the country needed to make significant progress before a recommendation could be made to the European Council to start negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement.
Although there has been progress since then, I am disappointed to end my mandate as Commissioner without being able to give Bosnia the green light.
I very much hope that my successor, Commissioner Rehn, will be able to do so early in his new mandate.
Once he did so, the Council would have to accept his assessment and a negotiating mandate would then have to be agreed.
Only then could negotiations start.
There is no reason why they could not do so some time during 2005.
If Bosnia is to make progress on this timescale, a number of things are required.
First, the authorities have to make further progress on the legislation associated with the 16 points.
Much has been done here, but there are continuing blockages in areas like VAT and public broadcasting.
Second, Bosnia has to recognise that passing laws has little utility if they are not implemented properly.
There is still a great deal of work to be done here.
Third, the Commission indicated in the feasibility study that it would expect proper cooperation with the High Representative in his reform agenda, as provided for in the Dayton Paris Peace Accords.
One crucial area here is the question of police reform.
I very much hope that, by the end of the year, Mr Wilfried Martens will be able to report agreement on the way forward.
Finally, there is the question of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
Bosnia Herzegovina is a member of the United Nations and a signatory to Dayton.
As I have made clear on a number of occasions, there can be no dilution of the absolute requirement for full cooperation with the Tribunal.
This is fundamental to Bosniaâs prospects for further movement through the stabilisation and association process.
It is a crucial test of Bosniaâs commitment to its international obligations and to the rule of law.
It is also a fundamental part of the process of allowing the victims of the atrocities to let go of the past.
Allowing those accused of terrible human rights abuses to remain free makes it impossible for the communities to be properly reconciled.
Next week the Chief Prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, will be reporting to the United Nations Security Council on the cooperation of the countries of the Western Balkans with the Tribunal.
Up until now, she has been quite clear that Republika Srpska has not been cooperating at all.
It is indeed a disgraceful matter that not one indictee has been transferred by the Republika Srpska to The Hague, although there are reports today that some war crime suspects have been arrested by Republika Srpska for trial locally.
This is welcome news, but Republika Srpska will be judged by the international community on its cooperation with the Tribunal on cases which fall under its jurisdiction.
It is on that issue that Mrs del Ponte will be reporting to the Security Council.
I have no reason to expect that her report will be positive on Republika Srpska.
If that is indeed the case, Lord Ashdown will have to consider his response.
Certainly, it is intolerable that the prospects for the whole country to make progress towards joining the European Union and NATO are being compromised in this way.
I urge the political leadership of Republika Srpska to take action now to fulfil their obligations.
If they do not, they will be responsible for any consequences which flow from their failure.
Honourable Members, the people of Bosnia Herzegovina suffered the most from the Balkan wars in the 1990s.
Now they have emerged from that terrible period and have a clear chance of creating a real country with a genuine prospect of joining our European family.
As I leave the Commission, I wish them every success and I look forward to hearing of their progress in the months to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transfer of responsibility for the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina from NATO to the European Union is a very important step on the road towards a European defence identity.
This operation follows on from those in Macedonia and in the Congo; it is the third of its kind and also the biggest, involving 7Â 000 men and women, so it is much bigger than anything of which we have prior experience.
What are we in this House now to do?
Our task is to exercise democratic control, although, at this stage, I would prefer to speak of parliamentary guidance.
There are, however, certain questions we must ask.
Is the leadership structure the right one, and is it capable of doing the job?
Will it stand the strain even in times of crisis?
What about the equipment and weapons of the soldiers who are being sent there â are they mutually compatible?
Do they meet the requirements?
It will also be very important to see how cooperation with NATO works in the aftermath of the âBerlin Plusâ negotiations, and particularly â in what is a speciality of the European Union and its security strategy â how well the civilian and military sides of this crisis management operation work together.
We also regard the issue of how this operation is funded as most especially important.
Time and again, we have cause for concern about the emergence of shadow budgets capable of being monitored neither by the 25 national parliaments nor by the European Parliament.
It is for that reason that the resolution we will be adopting includes the demand that the expenses incurred in this operation should â insofar as this is possible at this stage in the Constitutionâs development â be borne by the European Budget.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to make use of this opportunity to compliment Commissioner Patten, who is still with us in what is actually extra time, on the part he has played over the past years in the Balkans and particularly in the former Yugoslavia.
Despite his sombre view of the stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, I do think that it is essentially a good thing that the European Union, after all these years, has achieved its ambition of mounting a major operation, and, remarkably enough, doing so in the former Yugoslavia.
Following the Dayton accords in 1995, it was NATO that assumed responsibility as the stabilising power in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Now that the European Unionâs Common Security and Defence Policy is taking shape, it is a logical progression that the European Union should take upon itself responsibility for stability in the heart of its own continent.
So it augurs well that the European Union should, at the end of this year, be replacing NATO as the stabilising power in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
ALTHEA is an important test of the European Unionâs ambitions in the defence field.
With an initial 7Â 000 troops, the operation is manifestly bigger than the European Unionâs previous operations, such as Concordia in Macedonia and Artemis in the Congo.
In operational terms, the mission is a continuation of SFOR.
ALTHEA has the same solid mandate, which, as we see it, is the best possible guarantee of our soldiersâ safety.
NATOâs experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be drawn on, but political responsibility lies with the European Union, so that it can demonstrate its ability to play a generally external role on a larger scale than before.
In my experience, people in Bosnia take a generally favourable view of this mission.
Everyone I spoke to on my recent visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed greater involvement by the European Union.
At the same time, there are still tensions between the countryâs various constituent parts, to which reference has just been made.
While the Bosnian Croat federation is clearly drawing closer to Europe on its way to EU membership, Republika Srpska is still unwilling to cooperate with the tribunal in The Hague.
The operation must help to further stabilise the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
ALTHEA must, as best it can, help to build up the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the rule of law, police and the army and stable democratic structures, enabling the country to be integrated into European structures.
The ultimate objective must be that Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes capable of standing on its own feet as a complete and integral state â and that, I believe, must be the European Unionâs ambition.
No date has as yet been given for the EUâs mission to end, but it cannot be the intention that a military force should simply remain in place until such time as Bosnia is ready to join the European Union.
For the time being, there is no realistic timeframe for this, but accession to the EU is, so to speak, a civil rather than a military operation.
Only a functioning state, capable of guaranteeing its own security, can credibly apply for membership of the European Union.
So it is that normalisation is the objective, and hence it is also necessary that the European Council, having resolved upon this mission, should also, and as soon as possible, devise some kind of exit strategy which might well be connected with the stabilisation and association process.
Such an exit strategy will also require the EU to step up its involvement in developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Only if we are working towards withdrawal can ALTHEA make any substantial contributions towards achieving the ultimate objective, that being to prepare Bosnia and Herzegovina for stability as part of the European structure.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation regarding security in Bosnia and Herzegovina has improved, but the country is nevertheless unstable, and an international presence is needed.
The forthcoming operation will do much to bring Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to the European Union and will strengthen the Unionâs role in the Western Balkans.
The proposal before us is an excellent one, and MrÂ Wiersma has done a magnificent job.
As shadow rapporteur on ALTHEA, I made some observations with regard to the basic proposal, and I am pleased that they were taken into consideration when the proposal was being drawn up.
It is important that action is taken in Bosnia and Herzegovina to combat organised crime and trafficking in women.
I wish to emphasise how important it is to ensure that there is a more balanced representation of ethnic groups when police forces are being assembled.
This will increase confidence of all groups in the region and their commitment to maintaining order.
War criminals at liberty must be caught.
The Dayton Agreement must be implemented.
This is a matter of credibility, and is a task for NATO staff.
This will be the first major EU-led military operation and we need to monitor its progress very closely.
It will be important to attend to its operational aspects and consider clearly how responsibilities are to be divided.
The EU must ensure that ALTHEA troops respect human rights in all their aspects.
The EU is committed to respecting human rights, and that must be conspicuous in all action associated with the ALTHEA mission, whether it concerns the treatment of prisoners or those being detained, or any action.
A parliamentary delegation will inspect the work of the ALTHEA mission next year, and, in addition to all its other responsibilities, it should also be given the opportunity to make an evaluation of respect for human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group, I would like to highlight the very fortunate fact that we all agree on how important it is, not only for the European Union, but also for Bosnia, that we have taken over this mandate.
If it should turn out to be the case that this is the keystone to which you, Mr NicolaÃ¯, referred, I would like us to take another step forward, politically speaking, by expressly calling on the Bosnian Government to invite us to undertake this mission.
We have every basis in law for doing this, provided by SFOR, that is, by the military intervention that made this advance, this stabilisation, possible after ten years.
As we talk about how we see Bosniaâs future prospects in Europe, should we not strive to achieve what we achieved in Macedonia, with the Government asking us to be present in this window of transition?
I believe that would be a triumph.
Having concluded what is known as a SOFA â a status of forces agreement â with other states that have asked us for help, why should we not conclude one with Bosnia and Herzegovina too?
Secondly, we need these regular reports, and I hope that we will, tomorrow, make that a binding requirement.
This House is committed, for we have all been committed for years.
We are talking not only in terms of military intervention.
Next year will see the tenth anniversary of the attack on Srebrenica, and the anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, and I believe we are obliged to make this clear.
I hope that we will do as Commissioner Patten wishes and give close attention to Bosniaâs future.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the light of what is happening today, it is difficult to assert that European intervention in the Western Balkans was a resounding success.
In order to bring stability to what a German publication eloquently called the ârestless Balkansâ, help was needed from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.
The bottom line is that NATO is not there for nothing.
I am still to some degree reassured by the fact that NATO is still there, and still, too, involved in the European ALTHEA mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The fact is that this whole operation, which we call âEuropeanâ, is founded upon trans-Atlantic cooperation on the basis of the âBerlin Plusâ accord between the European Union and NATO.
What brings me to this conclusion is the letter of 9 November from the Dutch Presidency to the parliament of the Netherlands.
If anything, the ALTHEA mission is something for Europe to be modest about.
Moreover, I am convinced that it also puts another big question mark against the idea that a European security and defence policy is useful and necessary.
Such an ambition for power can only eventually weaken or undermine NATO, and then, Mr NicolaÃ¯, to use a Dutch expression, all of us in Europe are far from home.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in congratulating Mr Wiersma on the quality and comprehensive nature of his report, I wish to emphasise on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group the importance that this European Union military peacekeeping mission assumes in the extremely sensitive area of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
This is a first for the Union; apart from the symbolic fact that it will allow the 7Â 000 soldiers already serving under the aegis of NATO now to wear the 12-star symbol on the sleeves of their uniforms, the mission does, in any event, mean a greater European presence and hence greater visibility for the Union in the Balkans.
In the nineties, when bloody ethnic conflicts broke out one after the other in the region, people used to wonder where Europe was, and it was distressing that we were so absent.
Today, however, we are witnessing a presence and attention on the part of our institutions that befits the circumstances.
The 7Â 000 soldiers will arrive in Bosnia in a strong position, and their strength derives not so much from their weapons as from their expertise, their humanity, and their willingness towards the local population.
The people are mindful of the need for a military presence on their territory in this delicate phase of stabilising their country, and are therefore ready to welcome them warmly.
These soldiers are not arriving alone in unknown territory.
With them in Bosnia there are the institutions, the Commission, the High Representative of the Union, who for two and a half years has been working as a truly enlightened governor in Bosnia, in a far-from-easy attempt to ensure the establishment of the rule of law within a renewed framework of peaceful co-existence between the three major ethnic groups in the country.
Parliament, through its delegation led by its indefatigable chairman, Mrs Pack, closely follows events in Bosnia, as shown, among other things, by the recent visit to that country.
This visit brought home to members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament the principles and routes through which they could have a closer relationship with the European Union.
Today the perspective is that of a stabilisation and association agreement and tomorrow, at a time we cannot yet foresee, the prospect of future accession.
We should not allow ourselves to be deceived by all this, however.
Important steps have been taken in Bosnia on the path to stabilisation.
The desire for normalisation is palpable in many areas of the country and the wish to forget the past and to think of the future is shared by all its inhabitants.
Of the sixteen points set out in the feasibility study, many have already been translated into law.
It is fitting and heartening to note this, but there is still much to do.
The military peacekeeping mission under the aegis of the Union from 2 December is there for this purpose.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too would like to take this opportunity to bid you farewell and thank you most warmly for your cooperation over all these years.
You have dedicated yourself in particular to the Western Balkans, where I would have preferred there to have been no need, ten years on from the wars in the Balkans, for the EU to mount further military backup operations.
As MrÂ Solana once said, though many years ago, this is a front with which we will have to deal for some time to come, and it is in Europe, on our own doorstep.
It is closer to us than other crisis regions, whether Sudan or the CÃŽte dâIvoire, regrettable though all of them are, and notwithstanding our responsibilities for all of them.
ALTHEA, though, is more than these; it is a test case for the EUâs visible role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, now that it is, for the first time, taking over duties from NATO.
The mission is part of a coordinated and coherent approach including also the Stabilisation and Association Process, which will, I hope, make further progress in view of the disconcerting fact that 16 points are still outstanding.
Although Bosnia and Herzegovina needs the European perspective, which ALTHEA is meant to help secure for them, what is essential is that there should be a clear line of command avoiding needless duplication between NATO and ALTHEA and making it as clear as possible who is giving orders to whom.
Cooperation between ALTHEA and NATO is therefore also being put to the test.
It is regrettable that financial provision is being made outside the normal EU Budget, and so the European Parliament is not as involved as it should be.
All these things considered, I welcome the report and assure you that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of it.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the switch to an EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I also applaud the fact that Lord Ashdown will promote overall EU political coordination there and, specifically, will give the EU force political advice.
NATO's SFOR was criticised by Amnesty International for human rights violations.
Lord Ashdown will have an important role in ensuring that the ALTHEA EUFOR mission does not practice arbitrary arrests or ill-treatment of detainees.
I would urge that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights Ombudsman be given jurisdiction over their activities.
I also hope that the EU takeover of military responsibility will lead to an energetic effort to find war criminals and deliver them to The Hague.
Finally, I want an assurance of zero tolerance towards sexual abuse, exploitation and use of prostitutes who are victims of trafficking.
It is at last time to say goodbye to Commissioner Patten, but I look forward to working with him in the quest for a 'yes' vote on the Constitution in Britain.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we want a better future, we do well constantly to recall the past.
Not that long ago, the headlines were full of expulsions, murder and ethnic cleansing in the Western Balkans, in the heart of Europe, while the EU, as if paralysed, was incapable of taking any effective action to prevent these things.
Painful the memory of Srebrenica, Mostar or of Banja Luka may be, but it is right to remember them; the former military presence under NATO command may have brought Bosnia and Herzegovina a certain stability, but we need to be aware of how fragile that stability is.
It is a good thing that with this, its first major joint military mission with an extended mandate, the EU is taking on far greater responsibility in this part of Europe, and aiming in the long term to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina can be stable, at peace, multi-ethnic, and capable of cooperating at regional and international level.
It will be a further touchstone for Europe, and also for the decisions in this area that will very probably have to be taken next year and will also affect Kosovo.
I would also, however, urge this House to include support of this kind in the Financial Perspective, as well as making provision for economic development and expenses.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just a few comments to make on the central issue.
The first is that, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), I am delighted that the military mission â which is still necessary â is now in European hands and backing up the EUâs great financial and civilian commitment under the leadership of Commissioner Patten.
The second is that this changeover from SFOR to EUFOR is being welcomed in Bosnia and Herzegovina too. It does indeed highlight how closely intertwined are Bosnia and Herzegovinaâs destiny and our own.
The success of our mission â political, economic and military â is the litmus test for our foreign and security policy.
Thirdly, EUFORâs tasks should be clearly set out.
It should not involve itself unnecessarily in statesâ prosecution of their own criminals.
In these countries, the police and the justice systems have now become capable of pursuing ordinary criminals and imprisoning them.
Apprehending war criminals such as Mladic and Karadzic should also still be a matter for the remaining NATO contingent, and, in particular, for the Serbs of Republika Srpska.
Even though neither has so far demonstrated any enthusiasm for doing this, and Republika Srpska has even obstructed it, EUFOR should have other tasks to perform.
Fourthly, how will cooperation between the police mission and EUFOR be organised?
My fifth point has to do with an issue that has started to worry me in recent years, and that is whether the EUFOR troops have been advised about the problems with trafficking in women and forced prostitution.
Is there an ethical context, and where, when and by whom are offences to be punished?
Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a transit country, but also â not least because of the international presence â a destination.
The sixth thing I want to say is that EUFOR is the right name.
Why, then, call it ALTHEA, after a mythological woman associated with blood, retaliation and vengeance, and who ends up taking her own life?
What did the person who thought up this name have in mind?
They could have done with a bit of sensitivity.
One might have expected something else in an area where we are working to counteract revenge and the settling of scores.
Moreover, EUFOR is the name by which the mission is already being welcomed on great big posters in Sarajevo, so let us leave it at that and chuck ALTHEA out with the junk where it belongs!
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank Members for their remarks.
As they were remarks rather than questions, I think I can be brief.
Most of the Members who spoke agreed on the fact that the step we want to take in Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important step for the security and defence policy of the European Union.
We also agree on the fact that it is important for them and also for the European Union because of the European perspective on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Mr von Wogau, Mr Wiersma and others were very clear on that.
There were questions, especially from Mr von Wogau, about the command structure.
I shall explain.
We have the Deputy SACEUR as commander of operations.
He is supported by an EU operation which has its headquarters located within those of NATO in Mons, as I mentioned before.
Under the Deputy SACEUR we have an EU command element in Naples where the regional NATO headquarters is located.
This is in charge of the regional Balkans operation.
The field commander falls directly under this command element and hence there is a very thorough military structure.
As with all European Union operations, the Political and Security Committee has political control and provides strategic direction.
As regards armaments, as I said before it is the same people with the same equipment.
I agree with Mrs Poli Bortone and others that progress has been made but a lot remains to be done.
In addition to the ICTY cooperation I have already mentioned and the internal reforms, I hope indeed Bosnia and Herzegovina will also become more active in regional cooperation.
Croatia has made considerable progress and could be an example in a number of fields â except perhaps with regard to ICTY, as we will hear from the Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, on 23 November.
I end with a short but important remark.
On behalf of the presidency I would very much like to thank Commissioner Patten for the important role he played in the Balkans.
As he said, we are all looking forward to the new Commission and the new Commissioner, on which this Parliament will decide on Thursday.
Nevertheless we will miss Commissioner Patten.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, not only did I make a speech, I also asked two questions.
I asked you in what way soldiers have been prepared for this difficult task, particularly with regard to trafficking in women and forced prostitution, and I asked you how and where soldiers are sentenced or called to account, should the need arise.
Secondly, I asked you whether you are considering phasing out the name ALTHEA, which is a terrible word and has caused problems in the region.
These were two important questions, and I should like to receive an answer.
Â Â  . I cannot add very much.
I tried to explain in relation to the first question and also to MrÂ von Wogau's question.
With regard to the second question, it is a tradition that we choose Greek, Roman or Latin figures as names for operations and activities.
I suppose that it was chosen for this reason.
Â Â  Mr President, like Mrs Pack I asked some specific questions.
One of these was similar to hers and concerned assurances as to the non-use of prostitutes who are the victims of trafficking.
This is not a trivial point, it is really important.
Secondly, I asked whether the Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights Ombudsman would have jurisdiction over EUFOR activities with a view to avoiding the kind of criticisms levelled at SFOR regarding arbitrary arrests and the ill treatment of detainees.
These were very specific questions and I would be very grateful for an answer from the presidency.
Â Â  . Mr President, unfortunately I cannot be precise enough to answer the second question.
As to the first question, I fully agree with the importance of the remark and the issue itself.
Â Â  The debate is closed after the tabling of a motion for a resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  â Mr President, I apologise for interrupting before we start the debate on Mrs Rothe's important report, but as my motion is pertinent, I am asking for the floor now.
I have certain information, which I would be most grateful if you could check, that the plenary service known as the Tabling Office has tabled or intends to table an arbitrary amendments provision to Mrs Rothe's report.
When I found out, I shrieked and, as the walls have ears here, the service may already know and may already have made the necessary change.
If it has not, I repeat, if it has not made the change, please inform the Deputy Secretary General, Mr RÃžmer, that he must make the change and remind him that, when we voted for the creation of the Tabling Office under the previous presidency, we made it clear that the Tabling Office has no political jurisdiction whatsoever.
If you saw the amendments provision which I have here, I am certain that its tabling on the part of the Tabling Office conceals a political expediency which I also denounce.
To close, I repeat that, if it has not already made the change and does not intend to do so, the matter of the Tabling Office will be raised by me at the Conference of Presidents of the political groups.
Â Â  Thank you for your motion.
I promise you we will check it.
Â Â  â Mr President, on the subject of support for the Turkish Cypriot community, which has been struggling for some time, we want this matter to end smoothly without further problems.
My comment is that Parliament's Committee on Budgets decided, quite rightly, that financial support would be given to the Turkish Cypriot community under heading 3, in other words under the heading for assistance for Member States of the European Union.
Now I understand that the European Commission has recommended that this support be given under heading 7, in other words under the heading for pre-accession assistance ...
Â Â  I am sorry, but that is not a point of order.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will seek in the course of my remarks to answer very robustly on the Commission's behalf the point made by the honourable Member, and to make it clear why it views heading 7 as the correct one for this assistance.
If the honourable Member can wait for a moment and listen to what I have to say, it may help inform him on any subsequent points of order he wishes to raise.
I would like to cover both the question of the extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate until the end of 2006 and the question of the Commission's proposals for helping Northern Cyprus.
There is a connection between the two and I will make that clear in my remarks.
I wish to start by paying tribute to the Agency and to Richard Zink for the splendid work done since 2000 to help Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Agency was set up to deliver aid fast and effectively to communities which were in urgent need of it.
That is exactly what it has done.
The independent external evaluation of the Reconstruction Agency has concluded that the Agency has done an excellent job in fulfilling its original mandate.
If the House remembers, it was a Commission Task Force for Kosovo, established just after the end of the conflict in July 1999, that laid the basis for the establishment of the Agency in February 2000.
Since then its key positions have been held by detached Commission officials with long experience in managing our assistance.
The Agency's record of success is the basis for the Commission's proposal to maintain it in its present format until the end of 2006, when the current assistance programme for the Western Balkans â the CARDS programme â also expires.
On the strength of this positive evaluation, the Commission has not proposed any other substantive change to the Agency regulation as it stands.
We have, however, given a great deal of attention to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in particular to the suggestion to submit a Commission report on the future of the Agency by June 2005.
I am sure the House will appreciate that the important debate on the new Community financial perspective for 2007-2013 will have an impact on how to deliver assistance to the Western Balkans.
We therefore feel it realistic to set the end of 2005 rather than the middle of 2005 as a deadline.
Also, as the committee has requested, and in order not to leave any doubt about the future of the Agency, we will ensure that any proposal to extend the Agency beyond 2006 should be made by the Commission by 31 March 2006 at the latest.
For formal reasons, we have not deemed it appropriate to accept as a legal requirement an obligation to report on the division of tasks between our delegations and the operational centres of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
The existence in the same country of both the Agency and the delegations calls for close cooperation on the ground to ensure that our assistance effort is not dissipated in any way.
We have made great efforts to ensure that any difficulties are addressed by making the necessary changes to administrative procedures.
However, we will continue to be available to discuss with the Committee on Foreign Affairs any concrete issues that it thinks could hamper the Agency's work.
I would like to underline once again the very important job which the Agency has done.
When I became a Commissioner in the autumn of 1999, there was considerable concern as to whether we would be able to deliver assistance sufficiently rapidly in the Western Balkans.
The Agency did the job extremely well and I want to pay tribute again to all those who have been responsible for that.
In order not to jeopardise the effective performance and operations of the Agency in the Western Balkans, we have also found it sensible to go ahead with the original proposal to extend the time limit of the Agency's mandate and not to await the final outcome of the Council's discussions on the assistance package for the Northern Cyprus community and the extension of the geographical scope of the Agency.
Since the current mandate of the Agency expires at the end of next month, the positive opinion of Parliament today is essential so as not to interrupt our assistance to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo.
Let me now turn to the Commission's proposals for assisting Northern Cyprus, in the course of which I shall try to answer the point of order the honourable Member raised earlier.
As the House is aware, the Council invited the Commission, after the failure of the referendum on the reunification of Cyprus in April 2004 â and I would like to wholly associate myself with everything that my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, said about that â to bring forward comprehensive proposals to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community.
On 7 July, the Commission duly adopted a comprehensive package of trade and aid measures, as requested by the Council.
Although today we are only discussing the Rothe report on the financial instrument, I would like to stress again the political importance of the package, which aims at facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by means of financial assistance and trade under preferential conditions.
The proposal for a Council regulation establishing a legal instrument for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community creates a specific financial instrument for an amount of EUR 259 million, to be implemented from 2004 to 2009.
At this point I will explain to the honourable Member why it is we have argued that heading 7 is the correct heading for this assistance.
The financial instrument aims to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging economic development, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island through approximation and alignment with the acquis, mainly through TAIEX, and by improving contacts between the two communities and with the European Union.
Most of the activities will therefore be similar to the pre-accession activities financed under heading 7, which appears to us to be the most suitable financial perspective heading for this particular assistance.
Priority will be given to investments in the field of infrastructure, transport â including links between the two communities â and environment projects such as waste disposal, sewerage and improvement of the water supply, water quality and the distribution system.
Rural development, as well as measures concerning small and medium enterprises, will be another priority.
Other objectives are social policy, labour market policies, vocational training and treatment of illegal immigrant workers, as well as reconciliation, confidence-building measures and bicommunal projects.
As regards implementation of the funds, different options have been carefully examined by the Commission.
We finally propose that the Commission be enabled to entrust the European Agency for Reconstruction with the implementation of large infrastructure projects under this regulation, and amendment of the Agency Statute to this effect is considered in the Samuelsen report which we are also discussing here.
The Agency option is clearly the most suitable as regards economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
It would allow the Commission to rapidly deliver assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community after the regulation is adopted.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the financial instrument as expressed in the Rothe report on the proposal.
Concerning the proposed amendments, I think the House is aware that these have already been discussed in depth in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets.
The Commission is grateful for the proposals made by those committees and we can support the substance of the majority of them.
I would, however, also like to take this opportunity to underline that in our judgement it is regrettable that the Council has not yet been able to agree, after nearly four months of discussion, on the text of the financial instrument.
Implementation of the assistance could start immediately after the adoption of the regulation and the Commission has already taken the necessary preparatory steps.
As for the solution to the Cyprus problem, the conditions still do not exist for a new international initiative.
In my view the Annan Plan remains the only realistic basis for a comprehensive settlement.
Concerning its possible role in any new process aimed at a settlement, the Commission remains ready to support efforts towards a settlement that would permit a reunified Cyprus to be fully integrated into the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, at its meeting in Luxembourg on 26 April 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council underlined its determination to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community.
To that end, the Council invited the Commission to bring forward comprehensive proposals, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the islands and to improve the contact between the two communities and the European Union.
The Council also recommended releasing the EUR 259 million already earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement.
In that light, as the Commissioner has just said, with a view to the economic integration of the island and improved contact between the communities, in July 2004 the Commission submitted a draft regulation establishing a financial instrument in which the opinion of the European Parliament is requested.
It also submitted a draft regulation on direct trade between the northern part of Cyprus and the rest of the EU.
In line with the mandate given by the Council on 26 April, the Dutch presidency committed itself to putting the proposals forward and made considerable efforts to that end.
Both proposals were carefully considered in the Permanent Representatives Committee.
Difficulties were encountered and concerns were expressed during that discussion on certain issues such as property and sovereign rights.
Progress was made after intense discussion, especially on the draft regulation establishing a financial instrument.
The remaining point is the definition of the role of the European Agency for Reconstruction, and discussions are also continuing on the direct trade regulation.
There are still substantial problems with this draft regulation and the Council and the Commission are working very hard to resolve the issue.
The Dutch presidency is considering discussing this at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council.
I would like to say that we are grateful for the constructive work undertaken by the parliamentary committees involved.
The aim of the Dutch presidency is to provide real and effective economic opportunities for the Turkish Cypriot community, by promoting trade with the EU whilst respecting fully the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus.
We trust that this will ultimately benefit the people of Cyprus throughout the island.
Â Â  . Mr President, the process by which we have come to the point of prolonging the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate does not merit high marks for artistic performance.
The Commission's request for a prolongation itself came at a very late stage.
Members will recall that Parliament in its previous resolution on the European Agency for Reconstruction had asked the Commission to present its evaluation report on the status of the Agency by June 2003 at the latest, in order to allow the EP to hold a debate on the future of the Agency and its adequacy in managing EU external assistance in some Stability Pact and stabilisation and association countries.
The Commission did not follow Parliament's recommendation and only presented its report during this year's electoral period.
Further delays arose as a result of the change in the regulation with regard to the Agency's geographical area of responsibility, the intention of which was to bring assistance for the promotion of the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community within the remit of the Agency.
My committee rightly took the decision to postpone adoption of this report and the one regarding assistance to the northern part of Cyprus until it received the relevant documentation.
However, these shortcomings should not cloud the fact that an impressive job has been done on the ground by the Agency's staff.
I have always been in favour of extending their mandate.
They are doing a good job and need to know that they can sign contracts for buildings and pay salaries for next year.
My concerns were directed at the lack of clarity and coordination in the division of tasks between the European Agency for Reconstruction's offices and the Commission's deconcentrated delegations, a matter which I have addressed in my report.
The progress made in developing an effective decentralised system for contracts and financial management systems for EU assistance as foreseen in the CARDS multiannual programme for 2005-06 for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia needs to be examined further.
I would be happy to incorporate a proposal fusing the ideas of two fellow Members by asking the Commission to submit by June 2005 a report on the future of the Agency after 31 December 2006.
This should ensure that a prospective extension is not addressed with the same haste as in the past.
I agree that the remit of the European Agency for Reconstruction should be extended to cover the implementation of financial assistance for the northern part of Cyprus.
I would propose that we adopt the relevant part of the Commission's text, in agreement with the rapporteur on the proposed instruments, to ensure consistency between the two reports.
I hope that all Members will join me in supporting the extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate for the term proposed.
I should like to inform Parliament that I have asked for the oral question and debates on the future of the Western Balkans, originally planned to coincide with the vote on the European Agency for Reconstruction's report, to be postponed until the December part-session.
It would be more useful to debate the future of the region when the new Commission is in place, as we had originally envisaged would be the case at this juncture.
A debate in December would also save this important debate from drowning under speculation over the new team of Commissioners.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will focus on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a financial support instrument to support the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, a proposal which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I greatly welcome.
EURÂ 259Â million have been earmarked to support the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community until the end of 2006.
These funds were originally to have been released only after Kofi Annanâs plan had been adopted, with the aim of reducing the significant economic disadvantage suffered by the Turkish Cypriot community.
After the vast majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the plan in February, but the Greek Cypriots against it, so that the plan could not be adopted, the Council recommended that the financial support instrument be implemented even without an agreement having been reached in Cyprus.
In my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I can say, on its behalf, that our support for this plan is unanimous.
At this point I should also like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent cooperation within the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The Community aid provided for in this regulation can and should help to achieve greater compliance with the , in order to prepare for the takeover which will be necessary after a solution to the Cyprus issue has been found, and indeed one of the primary aims of this financial support instrument is to promote such a solution.
We greatly welcome the fact that around EURÂ 260Â million has been allocated for projects relating to the environment, transport, telecommunications, water and/or energy, for restructuring measures, for example in rural areas, for measures which are of particular benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises, and for bicommunal projects which facilitate trust-building between ethnic groups.
Measures can and should of course be planned for Famagusta, in order to make it suitable for habitation again, and you will be aware that relevant initiatives are underway in the town.
My report notes that the planned measures must not infringe the property rights of EU citizens.
We have reiterated this point, even though we know that it has always been self-evident that this principle must be observed when implementing European projects.
All the members of the committee were unanimous in their support for the Commissionâs additional proposal that the measure as a whole be managed by the Agency for Reconstruction.
The point I should like to make to MrÂ Samuelsen is that there is broad support for this proposal, and this is something upon which we all agree.
As has already been noted by MrÂ Patten and the Council, financial support is part of the package proposed by the Commission in July.
Although Parliament has no official right of consultation with regard to the direct trade which has also been proposed, I believe that this House will make it clearly known to the Council tomorrow that a prompt decision is expected on the trade proposal, just as we expect a prompt decision on the financial support element.
In my opinion, it is crucial that the EU should send out a clear signal to the Turkish Cypriot community by implementing this proposal for a regulation and the proposed direct trade.
This signal would be directed in particular at the large majority which voted for the Annan plan and for a âyesâ to the European Union, and it would make it clear that, although we want a swift solution to the Cyprus issue, we are also, even today, taking the concerns of Turkish Cypriot civil society very seriously.
It is in the interests of all Cypriots and in the interests of positive developments in Cyprus that the democratic, pro-European forces in the Turkish Cypriot community receive backing and do not under any circumstances abandon their fight.
I hope that Parliament will, by means of this report, help to achieve this, and I expect and hope that the Council will follow suit very shortly.
Â Â  . Mr President, the EU has always shown itself to be in favour of the accession of a reunified Cyprus.
In spite of diplomatic efforts, however, this has not been possible, given the unfavourable result of the referendum held in April 2004.
In order to avoid further isolation of Turkish Cypriot territory and to strengthen contacts between the two communities, the European Commission has tabled a proposal intended to establish an instrument for economic development for this community totalling EURÂ 259 million for the period 2004-2006.
In view of the fact that no political agreement on unified Cyprusâs accession to the EU has been reached, such funding has raised a number of issues of a legal and budgetary nature.
There is, indeed, no heading allowing the direct award of Community funding to a Member State whose government does not have absolute authority over part of its territory.
I should like to point out that the Republic of North Cyprus has not been recognised internationally and cannot therefore be deemed a state.
This lack of budgetary basis implies that such funding can only be seen in parallel with draft amending budget No 10/2004.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I have analysed the Commission proposal before us.
The Commission argues here that funding is intended to finance activities similar to those of pre-accession, which falls within the scope of category 7 of the budget.
Without entering into the political aspects of the debate, I did agree, however, with the financial implications of this proposal on the Financial Perspectives, despite it not being entirely clear under which category this financial support would fall.
I therefore deliberately left open the choice of the most suitable budgetary basis, a task that the Budgetary Authority must undertake once the Council has tabled its proposed text.
I could not finish this speech, Mr President, without drawing the attention of this House to the difficulties of having to express a financial opinion on a text of which the most important part has not in any way been the subject of a Council agreement.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  . Mr President, the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction â which was meant to be called the European Agency for Reconstruction and Development, but which is still called the European Agency for Reconstruction â has to date been mainly focused on Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro.
It has now been assigned an important new task, namely that of managing the financial instrument for north Cyprus.
There can be no question that the Agency has efficiently performed the tasks involved in its former mandates, and I am sure that the same will be true of its activities in north Cyprus.
As in the previous cases, however, it is also important with regard to Northern Cyprus that the Commission present a report on the future of the Agency after 31Â December 2006 to the European Parliament and the Council by June 2005.
South-Eastern Europe and the Agencyâs future tasks are of too great an importance for the EU to allow the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction to remain unclear.
The relationship between the Agency and what are termed the âdeconcentratedâ Commission delegations must also be clarified in order to prevent a lack of activity or the duplication of work.
The report should of course also cover the implementation of the 2005-2006 multi-annual CARDS programme for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, something which is not yet the case.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore endorses the proposal to extend the Council Regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
Â Â  . â Mr President, first I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Samuelsen and Mrs Rothe, for the very responsible job which they have done in their reports.
First, as regards the European Agency for Reconstruction, we should point out that, based as it is in Thessaloniki, it has played a decisive role in the reconstruction of the Balkans as a whole, in configuring the necessary infrastructures, in building democratic institutions, in promoting the rule of law and in defending human rights in the Balkan countries.
This strategy is the only reliable proposal for the peaceful reconstruction of the Balkans and the strengthening of their European prospects.
That is why it is absolutely necessary to extend the operation of the agency until the end of December 2006 and to make provision for examining the possibility of even extending its operation beyond that date, given that there will be important developments in the Balkans both in 2005 and in the next period and policies are needed to consolidate stability and security in the Balkans.
For this reason, my request to Mr Patten is that the Commission submit a report on the matter to the Council and the European Parliament.
The agency's efficient operation, transparency and in-depth knowledge of the procedure of reconstruction of the area as a whole are a guarantee for extending its jurisdiction to the implementation of financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community.
Now to the question of the report on financial support for the Turkish Cypriot community.
This money needs to be given to the Turkish Cypriot community, because it will help Turkish Cypriot citizens and the Turkish Cypriot community, it will contribute to economic development, to the incorporation of the , to the configuration of the necessary infrastructures and to the creation of jobs.
In other words, it will help to create conditions which will allow the reunification of Cyprus through the development of contacts, dialogue and exchanges between the two communities.
We need to use financial support to strengthen the prospects of resolving rather than consolidating partition.
That is why the messages which we send the Turkish Cypriot community must be clear and unequivocal.
We are not financing intransigence.
We are financing dialogue and this is where the European Commission and the Agency for Reconstruction need to be particularly careful and act in cooperation with the Republic of Cyprus and with respect for the principles of European law.
Finally, I would like to ask the Presidency to take a stand on the question of the heading for financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community.
Mr NicolaÃ¯ needs to take a clear stand on behalf of the Dutch presidency on whether financial support will come under heading 7 or heading 3.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is the first concrete expression of the European Union's appreciation that the Turkish North Cypriots voted strongly for the Annan plan.
It is the first, but it is behind schedule and it is a small sum of money: far too small for the Commission's list of glamorous priority projects that Commissioner Patten, whom it is very nice to see still here, read out earlier.
As a result of a lack of generosity, the money will be spent in such a circumscribed fashion that it will only apply to 15% of the territory of North Cyprus, excluding many villages that voted en bloc for the Annan plan.
I would like to say that I deplore the sluggish progress on this question in the Council.
Worst of all, the financial regulation has been split from the trade regulation, which is by far the most important part of the package.
Will the Minister commit the presidency to produce a result on the trade question within three months?
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be said often enough that the European Agency for Reconstruction has made a considerable contribution to the EUâs positive image in the Balkans.
Indeed, before 2000, the European Union was, above all, a bureaucratic monster that delivered on all kinds of promises either far too late or not at all.
After 2000, the European Union, via the agency, was very much capable of providing prompt and efficient aid, often under difficult circumstances.
It has never happened before that such a large proportion of funding that was budgeted for granting aid was actually spent.
Once again, all credit for this.
Having said that, the question remains, which we in this House have discussed with the Commissioner on different occasions, as to what exactly the Commissionâs thought process was when allocating a certain task to the Bureau, the various offices of the Bureau or to the decentralised delegations, the embassies of the European Union.
Although the Commission may not admit to this out loud, it does suggest now and again that Parliament is going on about this while insisting on an answer.
The reason is that we want to avoid further ambiguity.
Allow me to give you an example.
There is every chance that the European Union will be allocated more tasks in Kosovo in the course of 2005 and 2006: in other words less UN, less UNMIC and more European Union.
Does this now entail a greater role for the Bureau or does it mean that we can expect a larger, all-singing, all-dancing delegation and a larger embassy?
It is important for Parliament to know, because it is we who must take difficult and awkward, political and financial decisions.
I will not conceal the fact that I am also overcome by a certain wistfulness.
This debate is the last of the many debates we have had with the Commissioner.
I think that one of the reasons for the Commissionerâs popularity in this House is that he has given the EUâs Balkans policy a face and a voice, and has done a sterling job of it.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for this.
I wish the Balkans a sound successor and, above all, wish the Commissioner much enjoyment in governing Oxford University and in penning fine books.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial segregation and distress of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots was never the objective of the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
The underlying reason for this segregation is not the so-called embargo on the Greek Cypriot side, it is the Turkish occupation, the breakaway action of the occupying regime and the fact that the economy of the occupied areas is inextricably bound up with the Turkish economy, to the point even that the Turkish pound has been introduced as the currency of the occupied areas.
Following the Turkish invasion and occupation in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus announced that its occupied ports and airports were closed, because it could not exert any form of control over them.
This was also an act of self-defence, so that we would not be led into recognising the pseudo-state.
Security Council resolutions 541 and 550, together with a series of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights upheld the above decision in full.
The same happened in the recent opinion of the Council's legal department, which expressly recognises the right of the Republic of Cyprus to keep the said ports and airports closed.
Our group supports the financial regulation for Turkish Cypriots, provided of course that the Republic of Cyprus is respected and no benefit or political advantage is reaped by the occupying regime.
We hope that understanding and broad agreement have been reached on these matters.
As regards the report on the European Agency for Reconstruction being debated, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus wonders why it has been tabled for voting before us today, at a time when there is no agreement at COREPER level, by the Commission or the Council.
I would remind the House of the view of COREPER, that the matter would be debated under the next Presidency, under the Luxembourg Presidency.
It is precisely because the Republic of Cyprus is not a third country and the occupied areas are not independent territory, they are, as the Accession Treaty expressly states, territory of the European Union to which application of the has been stayed, that the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus cannot vote in favour of the regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction.
It goes without saying that our vote against the regulation does not mean that we reject assistance to the Balkan countries.
Finally, what we want is to vote on the protocol without clarifying the heading from which this money will be taken.
It has been said that the matter will be resolved depending on where there are appropriations.
However, no appropriations are available under the internal assistance heading.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I have listened to Mr Patten and his views very closely.
First, on a point of order, I am not sure if Mr Patten is entitled to even be in the House, given that Commissioner Prodi's brief expired on 31 October.
Apart from which, all Commissioner Prodi's acts are being audited to see if they are legal.
I believe that this matter will be resolved before the Court in Luxembourg.
Who is to blame for the fact that northern Cyprus and southern Cyprus have not developed equally, when the northern part is more fertile and more suited to tourism?
The occupying army is to blame.
However much money Europe gives, it will be wasted, because the occupying army has created a constricting framework which prevents any development.
We therefore need to see what can be done, as the Commissioner says.
The occupying army needs to leave and Cyprus needs to return to its following the Zurich and London Treaties, which were also signed by England, of which the Commissioner is, of course, the eminent offspring.
The occupying army needs to leave, calm needs to be restored to the island, the 1960 Constitution needs to be applied and economic prosperity will follow in northern Cyprus automatically.
As long as there is an occupying army, there will be no prosperity.
The money will be wasted.
We therefore need to have the courage to find a realistic solution.
If we had not kicked Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, would we today be providing financial support to occupied Kuwait?
If we had not kicked Milosevic out of Bosnia, would we be funding Milosevic today?
So why do we not do the same with Turkey?
Tell Turkey to get off the island so that northern Cyprus can develop.
No one wants poor neighbours.
Most of all, the Greek Cypriots do not want poor neighbours.
If you have the courage to kick out the occupying army â which is the only occupying army in a European country â development will automatically follow.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we also wish to express confidence in the Reconstruction Agencyâs being able to help improve the economic and social situation in the Turkish-occupied zone in northern Cyprus.
It is important to remember the background to the current situation in the northern part of Cyprus.
The background is the Turkish invasion that took place in 1974 and that meant that the population in the northern part of Cyprus now finds itself in an economic and social situation clearly worse than that which existed before July 1974.
In that connection, I have to emphasise that, as others have already pointed out, the efforts at development are to take place in cooperation with the government of the Republic of Cyprus.
What must not happen is for the EU now to go in and provide aid as a thank you to those who voted in favour of the Koffi Annan plan and to forget those who voted against the plan.
There are motives that, in my opinion, have not been properly examined in this Parliament, and I remember the discussion with MrÂ Verheugen, during the last sitting, of the whole issue of the Koffi Annan plan.
This was clearly unjust and clearly unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot population, and it was consequently rejected by a huge majority.
No doubt all of us want to see the situation improve, and an essential prerequisite for this is, of course, an end to the military occupation of northern Cyprus.
As long as Turkey has occupied part of another European countryâs territory, we cannot conduct negotiations, such as may be decided upon in this House in December, with the Turkish Government about Turkish accession to the EU.
Any negotiation must always be conducted with the involvement of the GreekÂ Cypriot population and with an appreciation of their interests.
It is the GreekÂ Cypriot population that have been the losers since 1974.
It is they who have been victims and they must not be punished through the efforts that we in the EU now put in to normalising the situation.
Â Â  Mr President, I was somewhat surprised to hear Commissioner Patten say that the Annan plan remains a sound basis for a possible reunification of Cyprus.
We should not overlook the fact that in April of this year, a referendum was held about this plan, and that a large majority of the Greek Cypriots voted it out.
When a referendum is held, the outcome should be respected.
The financial support to that part of the island that is occupied by the Turks was intended to be conditional on the Annan plan being rubber-stamped by referendum, which did not happen.
Pledging EUR 259 million to the northern part of Cyprus is tantamount to recognition of the military occupation of that area by more than 35 000 Turkish soldiers.
It appears that the European Union has no problems with the fact that a candidate country is occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State.
Not only are we about to start accession negotiations with Turkey, but the occupation of Northern Cyprus is now also being rewarded financially, and this is absurd.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe and, of course, Mr Samuelsen on their reports.
I, of course, shall focus more on Mrs Rothe's report.
It is a fact that the report, as formulated following the discussions and vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, is a very good report and, as such, the decision which derives from the report on financial support for the development of the Turkish Cypriot community is also a very good decision, a decision which we all support.
In other words, we consider that this support will contribute towards the general development of the Turkish Cypriot community, so that when, God willing â and this is something we hope will happen soon â the Cyprus problem is resolved with the reunification of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriot community will be at the same high standard as the Greek.
I wish to say, however, as the Council has also taken a stand, that the regulation on financial support is one matter, while the regulation on trade relations is another.
Although it may be logical for us to link the two, I would advise great caution as regards the matter of the regulation on direct trade relations.
I am certain that the Council will exercise this caution in its work and that the solution found â when it is found â will be fair and will be the right solution.
Finally, a couple of words on the positive role of the European Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki, in my country; I would like here to express the hope and my agreement to its managing financial support to the Turkish Cypriots and I naturally hope that this management will be based on the regulations of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, we are to vote on the report of my colleague Mrs Rothe regarding the financial support of Northern Cyprus.
This is good news: Northern Cyprus needs this aid.
Over the last few decades events have separated the island politically and economically.
The people of Cyprus suffered immensely from the partition of the island.
All those involved must do their best to overcome the separation.
It was the explicit aim of the United Nations and the EU that a united Cyprus would join the European Union on 1 May 2004.
The governments of Northern Cyprus and Turkey have followed the steps laid out by the United Nations and the EU.
The population of Northern Cyprus has overwhelmingly supported the unification of the island as well as EU accession.
A united Cyprus could already be a member of the EU today. Unfortunately, that has not yet happened.
It is our responsibility to encourage the two parts of the island to cooperate.
The regulation on financial support that we are discussing today is the first step.
The second step will be the regulation on special conditions for trade.
The Council should finalise that regulation without delay, firstly, to allow for an improvement in economic conditions of Northern Cyprus; and secondly, to facilitate the rapprochement of the two sides through trade.
This rapprochement can also support change in both parts of the island.
During the times of the German Ostpolitik, we called this concept .
More steps must follow soon.
The ultimate aim must be the reunification of Cyprus.
Â Â  Mr President, until 1974 the city of Famagusta was the centre of economic, social and cultural prosperity for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Since the Turkish invasion 30 years ago, the city has remained sealed off by Turkish troops and inaccessible to its local inhabitants.
It has gradually become a ghost city, with empty streets and derelict buildings.
Amendment 11 aims to help bring this dead city back to life for the benefit of the many thousands of local inhabitants.
The resurrection of the city of Famagusta will also act as a catalyst for the establishment of better and closer relations between the two communities in Cyprus, thus greatly increasing the chances of a speedy, peaceful reunification settlement.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start by echoing previous speakers in extending particular thanks to the two rapporteurs, MrsÂ Rothe and MrÂ Samuelsen, as well as to MrÂ Patten and MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, for their speeches today.
I believe that it is crucial to convince the government of Southern Cyprus that the European Union must deliver on the promises it has made to the north of the island.
Our goal must therefore be to authorise both trade and aid together; if necessary, however, and if there is no alternative, the two aspects should be dealt with separately, so that an end is put to the isolation suffered by the north of the island.
I would also like to take this occasion to call on the government of Southern Cyprus and the Cypriot Members of this House to state clearly, once and for all, whether they genuinely wish to help the north of the island, or whether they will keep seizing every opportunity to throw a spanner in the works.
I am delighted that the Greek Prime Minister, MrÂ Karamanlis, has recently expressed his firm support for Kofi Annanâs Cyprus plan.
The end of this debate has made one thing clear to me.
It is my belief that the people in the south of the island who were in favour of Kofi Annanâs plan have no representative in this House.
I have therefore decided that the role I will play in this debate will be that of a representative of the people in the Greek part of Cyprus who voted for Kofi Annanâs plan.
It is particularly in view of my Turkish origin that I should like to act as a voice for these people.
I hope that we will take this opportunity to do everything in our power to bring about reunification.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it may just be acceptable to regard financial aid to northern Cyprus as a charitable donation.
However, if we regard it as an investment to encourage development, then we are throwing money out of the window.
It is money wasted, because as long as the Turkish occupation of one part of the island, which is now part of the European Union, endures, for just as long as there are Turkish troops in northern Cyprus, there will be no development.
The facts show it to be so and history shows it to be so: there will be no improvement in the economic situation.
Therefore I believe that it would be better to make the Turkish troops withdraw first, and then intervene with financial aid.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the frustration about the Greek Cypriot rejection of the Annan plan is ongoing.
After all, today, every European can see for himself how the Union denies its own principles by giving a non-European country, in this case Turkey, a prospect of joining the EU, while that stateâs armed forces are occupying part of the territory of a current Member State, Cyprus.
That is why it was crucial for the Annan plan to be approved, by hook or by crook, and the Greek Cypriots were intimidated from all quarters in order to accept this half-hearted proposal.
That is also why the Turkish Cypriots are being indulged so much by the European policy makers today.
However, this turns the world on its head.
Without going into exhaustive detail, I should like to remind you briefly of the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan.
Indeed, the Annan plan authorised the Turkish invasion of 1974, as well as the attendant war crimes.
According to that plan, the Turkish occupying forces would be allowed to stay on Cyprus and retain the right to carry out military exercises on Cypriot soil.
The military border would be perpetuated and armed border crossing points would continue to carry out passport control.
The Turkish Cypriots would continue to live under Turkish occupation.
Their poor economic situation is attributable less to an embargo by the Greek population than to the corrupt Turkish economic system .
If the Annan plan had been ratified, the more than one hundred thousand Turkish colonists who, in the wake of the âAttilaâ operation, were forced by their government in Ankara to move to Cyprus in order to continue the ethnic cleansing, would remain on the island.
Financial support to the Turkish Cypriots â who, I sincerely hope, will, before too long, be reunited with the Greek Cypriots in an independent Cyprus without foreign occupation â must therefore go hand in hand with a number of strict conditions, first among them being the removal of Turkish military occupation.
This support should under no circumstances be seen as a reward for a politically correct vote in a referendum.
Â Â  Mr President, the message that should go out from this debate is that not only Parliament but also the Greek Cypriot Members wish for the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community through economic assistance and unhindered trade around the world.
We are satisfied that the rapporteur has introduced a vital amendment, making sure that EU money will not be used in a way that impinges upon individual property rights according to the relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.
I also welcome the fact that the Council appears ready to reach a consensus on the regulation.
I stress the importance of consensus on the issue of trade, without time constraints and on a correct legal basis, as advised by the legal department of the Council.
What is needed is creativity and adherence to the international legal status of the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the Union.
I have perceived during this debate that certain colleagues, in their efforts to help the Turkish Cypriot community, underestimate the importance of the message that the Greek Cypriots are also in favour of economic development for Turkish Cypriots.
This is not a 'zero-sum' game.
Following the last referendum, and with all due respect to the decision of the sovereign people, neither Turkey nor Cyprus is discharged from its responsibilities to continue searching constructively for a mutually agreed solution.
The messages coming from this debate build bridges between the two communities and do not create unnecessary disputes and confrontation between them, and due attention should be paid to them.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we Greek Cypriots are in favour of financial support and assistance for Turkish Cypriots.
They are our compatriots.
The government of the Republic of Cyprus has supported the decision on financial support for Turkish Cypriots from the outset.
However, I should point out that the economic destitution of our compatriots is not due to isolation on our part; it is due to the isolation imposed by 30 years of Turkish military occupation in Cyprus.
I must say that this action is an incidental action and the basic objective of the European Union must be to resolve the Cyprus problem, to bring about full equality, political and other forms of equality, between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in all sectors.
That is our objective.
Now to the Annan plan, which many people have glorified. It was rejected in the Greek Cypriot referendum because, first, it perpetuated the Turkish occupation, the Turkish military presence in Cyprus.
Secondly, we are creating a climate of uncertainty about the future and, thirdly, it had shortcomings in the area of human rights and on the practical side.
We must not forget this.
There are those who are critical of the Greek Cypriot side for its stand; why were they not critical for 30 years and why are they not critical now of what Turkey is doing in Cyprus?
The Turkish occupation, the eviction of Greek Cypriots from their homes and this ongoing situation.
They should demonstrate the same consideration.
In closing, I should like to point out that the reunification of Cyprus must be the objective of all of us.
We have no dispute with the Turkish Cypriots, we have a dispute with Turkey, which is occupying part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, part of European territory, because the Republic of Cyprus is a full member of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to emphasise that Greek Cypriots are in favour of financial support for Turkish Cypriots and that we hope to see the standard of living of Turkish Cypriots raised to our standard of living as soon as possible.
However, it is the way in which this support will be given that I wish to discuss.
That is the matter I wish to address.
I have been fighting on this front for many years, not just recently.
That is why the report by Commissioner Patten is an insult to my intelligence, when it appears that he does not understand where this support will come from; from heading 3, which relates to countries in the European Union, or from heading 7, which relates to candidate countries.
There is a big difference; it is not the projects which will be implemented in occupied Cyprus which are important, it is Cyprus itself.
However, the Commissioner refuses to understand this state of affairs, which is perfectly clear to us, and I am sorry that he makes this distinction.
Â Â  . Mr President, there were one or two points made during the debate which I should address very briefly.
I hope that when these debates are held in future without my attendance they will, if I may say so, have as broad a base as possible in the points of view we hear.
I should like to say to Mr Samuelsen that the Commission would be perfectly content to hold a debate on the Western Balkans in December.
Mr Duff spoke about the trade regulation being done within three months.
Again â speaking for myself â the Commission would be perfectly happy to accommodate that reasonable request.
A couple of other Members suggested that we should concentrate our support on one place: Famugusta.
That would not be sensible.
We have to spread our assistance more generally than that.
I wish to make three other points.
First, on the Agency based in Thessaloniki, I would like without reservation to thank the Greek Government for its hospitality. It provided the facilities we have used in Thessaloniki.
It was an imaginative proposal by the last government, which has been continued by the present one. It has given us a splendid headquarters.
Everybody who has worked in the Agency is grateful for that and certainly, on behalf of the Commission, I am also very grateful.
Second, Mr Lagendijk made the point â although he was too kind to put it this way â that there is a degree of intellectual incoherence, which I accept, between the policy which I have pursued vigorously around the world of deconcentrating our management of assistance and what we have been doing in the Western Balkans, which is to establish an agency rather than simply deconcentrate to our delegations.
I have to say to justify that decision that my main concern â particularly given the position in the Western Balkans and given the position in Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia â the position was so difficult it seemed to me that the most important thing was delivery of assistance.
Since the Agency has been so effective it was not right to dismantle it and I thought it sensible to continue to use it as our main instrument for managing assistance.
So, I plead guilty to a degree of intellectual incoherence, but the record of the Agency has justified it.
Finally, I do not wish to make my last remarks in this Parliament into the beginning of a hot controversy. However, I would just say to the honourable Member who said that he wished Mr Verheugen, my distinguished colleague, had been able to state the advantages of the Annan plan more vigorously, that MrÂ Verheugen would have loved to do so, but when he tried in Cyprus, he was stopped.
That is a matter of record and was not the happiest episode in this tale.
It would have been better all round if during the course of the referendum campaign he had been able to say in Cyprus what he believed the advantages of the Annan plan were.
It might have been that he would have given a more balanced view than some of the letters sent out by the government.
I very much hope that we can have this debate in as calm a way as possible. I hope that all sides of the argument will be heard reasonably.
The one thing I would like to say is that I recognise, as Mr Kasoulides said, that there is a genuine commitment on the part of many honourable Members to the betterment of everyone who lives on the island.
I have no doubt at all about the honourable Member's commitment to that and I hope that we see everybody living a more prosperous, stable and peaceful life on that glorious island in the future.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the Council and Commission statements on climate change.
Â Â  . Mr President, concerning the issue of climate change there are two main areas in which the EU is playing a key role.
The first is the implementation and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
Member States and the Commission are currently preparing the European emissions trading system, which is due to be launched on 1 January 2005.
The second focus of attention is climate policy in the longer term.
In December this year, the Tenth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is due to take place in Buenos Aires.
One of its tasks will be to assess the results of the Convention over the last ten years and future trends.
A very important result so far has been the Kyoto Protocol. But the Protocol is only a first step and CO2 emissions will have to be reduced even more after 2012.
I should like to convey the Council's thanks for the efforts Parliament has made to persuade Russia to commit itself to the Kyoto Protocol.
The European Union welcomed the good news that on 5 November President Putin had signed a bill confirming ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Russian Federation.
That signature clears the way for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force early next year.
Once in force, it will legally oblige countries with binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach these targets by 2012.
The Kyoto Protocol is the main instrument in the global fight against climate change and a good example of the effectiveness of global cooperation.
Leading by example, the European Union has passed legislation.
It has already made these provisions legally binding in the European Union.
The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol shows that the EU was right in its early implementation of the obligations then expected.
In spring 2005, the European Council will adopt a position on the EU's future climate policy.
The Heads of Government will consider mid- to long-term emission reduction strategies and their objectives.
The basic aim of long-term EU climate policy is to limit the rise in temperature to a maximum of 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels.
In preparation for that meeting, the European Commission is currently producing a cost-benefit analysis taking account of both environmental factors and competitiveness.
Action on climate change demands the broadest possible worldwide coalition.
I believe that will only be achieved through a dialogue between the European Union and other countries.
The European Union presidency, in the framework of the troika, is currently implementing action with key countries all over the world regarding the forthcoming Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and early discussions on options for a regime for the period beyond 2012.
Members of the European Parliament can also play a significant part in this process by discussing long-term climate policy with parliamentarians from countries outside the European Union, for example at the forthcoming Tenth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Â Â  . Mr President, by now 189 countries are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and I hope they will all turn up for the Tenth Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires.
This event will also mark the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Russian decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol means that it will now enter into force, and this will give new impetus to the discussions during the conference of the parties in Buenos Aires. The Commission has four main objectives for COP 10, as it is called.
Firstly, to take stock of the work done so far.
Secondly, to explain what the European Union is doing to address climate change.
Thirdly, to advance the discussions on what will happen after 2012. Fourthly, to contribute towards finding solutions for the technical issues on the agenda.
The first thing is to take stock of what many parties have already done to address climate change.
This is also an opportunity, especially for developing countries, to be able to explain that many of them have already taken action and to illustrate the way in which they are the first ones to be affected by climate change.
This is important for the political debate in general.
The second objective is to explain what the European Union is doing through our European Climate Change Programme as well as the emissions trading scheme that will start from January 2005.
The system will also be officially presented to all ministers in an event that we are organising in close cooperation with the Dutch presidency and the Argentine Government.
The third objective will be to begin looking to the future, at the global regime that we will have after 2012, and to have an exchange of views on the post-2012 framework.
Again, this is extremely important in order to involve the developing countries and to show that there is a balance in the kind of actions that we are discussing post-2012.
The fourth and final objective is to resolve some of the very important technical issues that are still on the COP agenda.
In particular, these issues concern topics related to developing countries as well as the balance between adaptation and mitigation.
I understand that several round-table discussions will be organised during COP 10.
The Commission looks forward to working closely with the Members of the European Parliament who will be part of the delegation in Buenos Aires.
We will ensure full briefing and also rapid transmission of information to the Members of the European Parliament and we hope that you can engage in a lot of outreaching activities during COP 10.
Having a strong EU delegation â composed of representatives of all the European institutions at the COP â gives the Union an important opportunity to encourage the rest of the world to take more action now in response to the threat of climate change.
With five years' experience of working with Members of the European Parliament, this has been one of our definite strengths, and the fact that we have held joint press conferences, etc. is a sign of strength and good cooperation.
I hope that we can continue in a good atmosphere and in close cooperation both at COP 10 and in the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to wish Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m every success in her future portfolio.
We have enjoyed working with her over the last five years in the environmental portfolio.
I would like to thank her for her particular contribution.
My good wishes also go to the Dutch presidency as its term comes to an end.
There are those who claim that the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is destined to fail as the rest of the world waits for those nations already taking part to fall short of their obligations and so provide the perfect cover for their decision not to participate in the first place.
At the half-way point to the 2012 deadline set under the first Kyoto commitment period, the world is engaging in rationalisation, hammering nails in the coffin of attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before we even enter the second phase of implementation.
The 'I told you so' mentality is one I suggest we cannot afford.
Failure is relative.
Failure to meet provisional targets â and my own country, Ireland, is currently 16% behind the target set â is very unfortunate.
But failure to act at all would be downright catastrophic.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, an international panel of experts which assesses the scientific, technical, social, and economic aspects of climate change estimates that we need to decrease our emissions of greenhouse gas by 60-80% on 1990 levels in order for our efforts to make an appreciable difference to rising global temperatures.
I know there is debate in the scientific community as to whether the models used by the IPCC stand up, and that debate will continue, but the majority of people accept the IPCC modelling and the projections arising from it.
Critics frequently cite the fact that under Kyoto the earth's temperature would only be 0.15Â°C lower than if we do nothing at all.
Scepticism and climate change are two phenomena that have become so closely interlinked in the global debate on the future of our planet, that we are in danger of losing sight of the very real steps that have been taken, under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, towards setting a framework for future action to control the impact of human activities on the earth.
To focus too closely on the negligible quantitative effect of Kyoto, in terms of immediate results of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, however, is to miss the point.
Kyoto is only a first step towards addressing global warming but it provides a crucial foundation on which future, more comprehensive and effective policies and agreements must be built.
It is a prototype for a much more far-reaching arrangement than the present one.
The value of the Kyoto Protocol is in that it sets a market-based mechanism to translate environmental protection into economic terms.
It puts a tradable price on global warming.
Once properly implemented and extended to include all the other sectors, Kyoto will provide a flexible, market-based mechanism to spread the burden of paying for global warming equitably across all sectors.
It would provide a financial incentive for the development of clean technologies that will safeguard the environmental heritage of future generations.
In conclusion, the main obstacle at this point is diplomatic.
We must engage in a continuing and vigorous dialogue with our transatlantic partners in the USA and with Russia where the very name of Kyoto has become discredited.
Yes, Kyoto has flaws, but only through working together can these shortcomings be ironed out to the benefit of all.
On a European level I welcome the Commission's recent stakeholder consultation and hope that we can make our voice heard at the forthcoming COP 10 conference in which I will be delighted to participate.
It is time to banish the notion that the future of climate change policy is coterminous with the Kyoto Protocol.
The question, and it is an important one, is what comes after Kyoto?
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, we very nearly did not have this debate with you, but with your successor.
In all honesty, I am really pleased that it is you we can talk to today about the EUâs climate policy and its contribution to the climate conference in Buenos Aires in December.
It strikes me as a nice finale that you can pass on this climate dossier in the knowledge that the Kyoto Protocol will enter into effect shortly, now that the Russian State Duma and the Russian Federation Council have ratified it, which they did on 22 and 27 October respectively.
Meanwhile, President Putin has signed the ratification act and we are waiting for the ratification to be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The Kyoto Protocol will be able to enter into effect 90 days later.
My group welcomes President Putinâs decision to join the European Union and the other countries in tackling the greenhouse problem.
Europe and the European Commission have played an important role in achieving this result, and congratulations, also to you, are certainly in order.
The climate policy can rely on immense support in Europe.
Our group is delighted that the European Parliament and the Council of ministers hold on to an ambitious climate policy that aims to fight the greenhouse effect.
Europe has confirmed its pioneering role in respect of the climate conference in Buenos Aires.
I am pleased that Europe has reiterated that support must be provided to developing countries in order to adapt to the effects of climate change.
It is not sufficient to say that we will be taking structural measures which will prove effective in the long term.
Some countries, particularly developing and small ones, are already being faced with the effects of the greenhouse effect, and they need help.
Although my group is satisfied, it does, of course, remain critical.
Pleasing though it is to see Parliament and the Environment Ministers supporting an ambitious climate policy, we should not remain caught in fine rhetoric and good intentions.
We should also bring about concrete measures in order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
As President of the European Union, the Netherlands has a special responsibility to table concrete results.
The presidencyâs ideas in the environmental field sound good but should be translated into results.
That is what the Dutch Presidency will be judged on at the end of the year.
It is in Buenos Aires that it remains to be seen whether our fine words will also be spoken and fulfilled at international level.
In any event, I hope cooperation with both the Dutch Presidency and the European Commission will be excellent during the conference in Buenos Aires.
Â Â  .
Mr President, about two days after the US presidential elections I turned on my radio at home. I heard one of George Bush's climate change advisers telling us, firstly, that climate change was a myth; secondly, that European scientists were all funded by national governments, that none could be trusted and only American scientists were independent; and, thirdly, that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m had admitted that the whole climate change agenda was designed to ensure that European industry was able to catch up and additional burdens were imposed on American industry in order to allow this level playing field to be established.
And all that time I thought the Commissioner was out there trying to save the world!
In yesterday's I saw that one of MrÂ Putin's advisers, whom we have heard from before, is still telling us that it is all a myth and global warming will be a good thing!
It is like old Cold War warriors coming together again, trying to fight in a more globally warmed arena.
It is to the Commissioner's credit that we have come this far, but we have a very long way to go.
We have to ensure not only that we implement Kyoto â which, as we know, will do nothing to combat climate change but will simply slow down the process â but also that we involve developing nations, raise the targets and find ways of changing public policy in ways that are politically acceptable and involve the United States.
I do not know how far we will get down this road.
I hope at least that, in the Commissioner's new role, she will, over the next five years, at least have the opportunity to communicate a message of success.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, the climate conference to take place in December will be a historic one, as now it is a known fact that the Kyoto Protocol is to enter into force.
It should be realised, however, that Kyoto is only the first step on a long road and now is the time to prepare for the next round of reductions in emissions.
We need to involve new countries, such as China and India.
The EU should waste no time in putting forward, first of all, a proposal for its own long-term targets for reductions in emissions and, secondly, its proposal for a model for reductions in emissions internationally.
In order for us to be able to prevent climate change turning into a catastrophe, global emissions must develop a downward trend within not more than twenty years, and the industrialised countries must cut their emissions by at least 60% within approximately 50 years.
This sounds drastic, but we can manage with a gradual change if we act consistently.
By reducing emissions by just under 2% every year we will achieve a 60% reduction in 50 years.
Modern sustainable technology will make that possible.
We need market mechanisms that favour clean technology, such as taxation on energy and emissions trading, but we also need other new measures.
One possibility is a reduction in VAT on energy-efficient equipment on the market.
This way we can achieve surprisingly large reductions in emissions, if consumers always choose the most energy-efficient option when shopping.
In other words, there is still time to prevent a catastrophic change through a gradual series of measures, provided we are determined and consistent, and provided the EU maintains its leading position in international climate policy.
Â Â  Now that the Kyoto Protocol can enter into force, it is important to look forward to what we can do in terms of our work on climate after 2012.
As we all know, the commitments in the Kyoto Protocol are quite inadequate in the longer term.
It is especially important for us to enter into discussions with the big developing countries, such as India and China, about the fact that they too must make binding commitments to reduce their emissions in the future, emissions that are now increasing extremely quickly.
If this is to be possible, I think that it is important to talk in terms of the fair and sustainable use of resources in the long term and that the only fair long-term distribution of the right to release emissions is one that is calculated for each of the worldâs citizens.
That is the fair objective in the very long term.
The American presidential election is, of course, a serious setback for international environmental work, and the United States will probably appear as a global anarchist in the environmental sphere during the next four years too.
We do not have time to wait for the Americans, but we know that the day will come when, for both economic and ecological reasons, they will be forced to commit themselves to this work.
It is therefore important that the work in which they will be welcome to take part be firmly on course.
I should like to use my last few seconds to thank you, Margot, for the work you have done on environmental issues over these five years.
It is not easy to be EU Environment Commissioner.
I am certain that there are opponents both outside and, sometimes perhaps, also within the European Commission, but I am convinced that you have done this work as well as it was humanly possible to, and for that you deserve sincere thanks.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is almost seven years ago that the renowned protocol was drawn up in Kyoto, and thanks to Russiaâs ratifications, it is, at last, set to enter into effect very soon.
That is good news, not only for those â like you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m â who have fought for this protocol, but also for those who experience the effects of climate change on a daily basis.
In any event, it deserves heartfelt congratulations.
Kyoto is a step in the right direction, towards a better environment, but we have a long way to go yet.
I would therefore like to call on the Council and Commission, together with the European Parliament, to demonstrate that the EU not only wants to have a strong economy but also a strong environmental policy.
This protocol still leaves a great deal to be desired; for example, aircraft emissions should be added to it, and the support base could also be further widened.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, your new portfolio might prove useful in this respect.
The EU can commit to this too.
Involving more countries in this protocol also means better control of worldwide emissions.
At present, 55% of the emissions of Annex 1 countries are covered.
