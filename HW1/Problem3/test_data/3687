However, since a new EU body is involved, we must examine the new agreement on cooperation with the Council of Europe to ensure that what appear to be two similar institutions do not compete with each other but cooperate.
I have to say that the agreement was negotiated quickly but well.
We have no great reservations concerning its content, nor could we have.
It establishes a framework for cooperation, provides for regular contacts and, most importantly, creates personal links, since it provides for the Council of Europe to call upon an outside person - and a deputy for that person - sitting on the Agency's management and executive boards.
All of which inclines me to full support for the motion and acceptance of the agreement, which will serve both institutions well.
(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to speak.
The report deals with possible conflicts of interest between the European Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe.
In my view, this issue is secondary.
The real difficulty arises between the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Both these Courts have the authority to act in the area of breaches of human rights and there are some rulings where the two bodies contradict each other.
The majority of these cases relate to Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and concern proceedings on infringements of competition rules, such as the cases involving National Panasonic, Hoechst AG, Niemetz, etc.
Finally, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, endorsed by the European Union, are two similar yet distinct documents.
The European Fundamental Rights Agency's competences focus on monitoring and support.
The Agreement concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which will clarify individual competences, is therefore to be welcomed.
The fact that the Council of Europe will have a representative on the Management Board is also to be welcomed.
As the Agency's competences are limited, I believe that its activities will complement rather than compete with those of the Council of Europe.
In any case, we will have to continue debating this topic in the light of the changes to the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, in recent months, four decisive steps have been taken by the European Union to promote and protect human rights.
Firstly, the special Agency for Fundamental Rights has been set up.
Secondly, a clause on the legally binding force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and a clause on the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 have been included in the Reform Treaty.
Thirdly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been solemnly signed in Parliament today; with its formal proclamation, it becomes part of the European acquis.
A modern code of human rights!
Fourthly, the conclusion - which we are discussing today - of the agreement between the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, signals exactly what the European Union stands for - the promotion of human rights - and shows that this element is fundamental to every modern society, to every modern state.
We see no subordination, no duplication, no replacement of the role of the Council of Europe, which is secure in its place as an international guardian of human rights.
On the contrary, a new phase of cooperation, not antagonism, has been initiated.
I therefore agree with my compatriot, the rapporteur, on everything he has said on this issue, and fully endorse his report, and I congratulate him on this.
I am an honorary member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which I feel to be an honour; but today I also feel great pride and joy because the two institutions, the European Union and the Council of Europe, are inaugurating their cooperation in this area, and I hope this century will earn its place in world history as the century of human rights.
(PL) Madam President, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna is yet another costly institution that, in addition, arrogates to itself the right to monitor and lecture the Member States on compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other matters.
It is hard to resist the impression that European taxpayers' money is being given over to yet another agenda for strengthening the authorities in Brussels and the emerging Eurostate.
The Council of Europe and the OSCE are existing institutions that deal with the same matters at international, not supranational, level.
What we are seeing is a duplication of already existing institutions that increases the powers of the European Union and the EU bureaucracy.
The countries of Europe - including my own country, Poland - are obliged to protect and promote human rights by complying, inter alia, with the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Agency for Fundamental Rights, however, alongside other agencies that are being set up at an impressive rate, is not only a waste of money but a further dubious, not to say harmful, initiative on the part of Brussels.
(RO) Ladies and Gentlemen, this plenary session was marked by various European actions in the field of human rights, as well as by the possibility to achieve their assessment for the year 2007.
At the same time, with the creation of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the decision to conclude a cooperation agreement between the above-mentioned agency and the Council of Europe is part of the European Union's efforts to consolidate its performance and role of human rights promoter, both internally and externally.
I would like to point out two aspects I believe important in this field.
First of all, I welcome the intention to achieve a double objective by this agreement, namely, on the one hand, the efficiency and consolidation of the European policy in the field of human rights and coherence and avoidance of duplication, on the other hand.
This is the only way in which we will be able to continue to promote the respect of the fundamental principles established by the European Convention for Human Rights and supplemented by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by consolidating our own mechanisms for this purpose.
Secondly, I welcome the intention to consolidate cooperation in the specific human rights protection projects launched by the Council of Europe.
This type of interaction will allow us to further contribute to improving the human rights situation, acting in specific cases, both internally and externally.
I would like to draw attention to the fact that such cooperation should be promoted especially in the European countries bordering the European Union, in order to create a true area of democracy at the external border of the Union.
As rapporteur on the Black Sea regional cooperation, I ask the European institutions to support the regional cooperation projects.
I consider the initiative to create a Black Sea Euroregion for promoting democracy at regional level, which was launched by the Council of Europe, a good starting point in this direction and I invite the Commission to manifest its entire support for their success.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Maintenance obligations (debate)
The next item is the report by Genowefa Grabowska, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on international jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations - C6-0079/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the proposed instrument on maintenance obligations seeks to improve the precarious situation of people who depend on maintenance to meet their everyday needs.
In the European Union, where people are increasingly mobile, maintenance creditors - especially children - should not face obstacles to recover money due to them, particularly when the debtor, such as a parent, leaves or has moved abroad.
I would like to thank Ms Grabowska, as rapporteur, for the efforts she has made to give a voice to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations assisting maintenance creditors during the very important public hearing on 11 September.
We generally welcome Ms Grabowska's report, which supports the proposal in its essential elements.
I have just a few remarks on some proposed amendments.
First of all, on the legal basis.
We are of the opinion that the current instrument relates to family law.
However, I understand Parliament's concerns, given the existing legal context.
That is why we have invited the Council, in a communication adopted at the same time as the proposed regulation, to decide - in accordance with Article 67(2) of the Treaty - that the present instrument be adopted according to the codecision procedure.
That is my opinion, and I will continue to ask Council to act on this invitation.
Concerning the other amendments on the rules on applicable law. Last month, negotiations on a worldwide convention on maintenance obligations were finalised successfully at the Hague Conference on Private International Law.
Given the satisfactory results of the Convention and the accompanying protocol on applicable law, the Community and its Member States would like to adhere to those international rules.
Consequently, the rules of the regulation and related amendments proposed should be revised in order to ensure consistency with the international rules.
The report proposes allowing the courts to apply their own law when cases come before them and when this would accelerate the resolution of the dispute.
While we recognise the concern to speed up litigation, we believe that the proposed solution does not allow for sufficient legal certainty, and there is the danger that it would not serve the interest of maintenance creditors, who should be protected by application of the same substantive law, regardless of which court is considering the case.
Finally, Parliament is now voting on its report.
An international legal context has become clear.
I strongly hope this project will be resumed at full speed in 2008.
I very much trust that the Council will give it the highest priority in the coming months.
rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, let me begin by expressing my thanks.
I want to thank the European Commission very much for its excellent cooperation at working level.
I also thank the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the shadow rapporteurs, especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and Diana Wallis, who drafted its opinion, for their truly excellent cooperation.
Mrs Wallis took on the heavy burden of convincing the Commission of the need for amendments to the legal basis.
I should perhaps start with the legal basis, given that the proposed resolution was referred to us under a procedure that is not acceptable to Parliament.
We wanted the regulation to be adopted according to the codecision procedure, rather than the consultation procedure.
I was therefore pleased to hear what the Commissioner told us, and I am aware of the Communication to the Council inviting it to give us that opportunity.
I would add only one thing to what the Commissioner said.
I do not question the fact that the maintenance relationship arises out of family law.
I would argue, however, that, taken as a whole, the maintenance relationship has a mixed character.
The fact that it originates in family law does not mean that it remains within those bounds.
It has consequences for the common market and the economic situation of both parties, i.e. that of the maintenance creditor and that of the debtor.
We are accordingly entitled to extract the maintenance relationship from its origin in family law and associate the execution of maintenance obligations, not with family law, but with areas in which this Parliament holds itself competent, namely the common market, family care and human rights.
In which case, it seems to me, there should be no difficulty in changing the procedure.
I therefore consider that this proposal warrants not only Council's attention but acceptance by Council.
In preparing this regulation we held hearings that were, in truth, one uninterrupted lament.
Women, mainly, told us of the difficult situation in which they find themselves when they try to enforce maintenance payments for children whose other parent lives in a different country and appears not very interested in raising his child or paying for its upbringing.
Many different tricks are employed.
I shall not mention them all but confine myself to one example.
It is enough to change a single letter of ones surname in order to disappear in Europe almost without trace, and the maintenance obligation vanishes along with the debtor.
By means of this regulation we seek to ensure that no maintenance debtor in Europe feels safe in thinking that by leaving the country in which a child remains for whom maintenance is not paid, by moving away into the open European Union in which internal borders have been lifted - especially now when the new Member States will be joining the Schengen area in a few days' time - he can take advantage of a situation that works in favour of a person who does not take responsibility for his family.
Let me mention the two measures in the resolution that seem to me the most important and constitute an innovation.
A maintenance order issued in the state in which the creditor normally resides will not have to be confirmed in the state in which the maintenance debtor is living.
The regulation thus proposes abolishment of the 'exequatur' procedure.
I realise this is something new, but if we want to ensure effective enforcement of maintenance obligations we must take that step.
If we keep 'exequatur', the whole attempt to achieve effective enforcement falls by the wayside.
I realise we shall be respecting all the provisions adopted in the framework of the Hague Convention and Conference, but the international system grinds exceedingly slow, and the ratification of agreements in the sphere of private international law can take years.
The European Union must go forward and ensure that children are provided for when their fathers or mothers forget about them.
This regulation must therefore be implemented quickly for the good of the children.
It not only takes care of the children but also protects the creditor.
Therefore, thanking the Portuguese presidency for the work it put into preparation of the text, I place the matter in the hands of the Slovenian presidency in full confidence that it will see the text through to conclusion and that we shall obtain a good regulation.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very positive statement.
I should also like to thank Ms Grabowska for her wonderful cooperation on this matter.
This is one of those proposals that could make Europe a reality for those we serve.
It could add practical value at difficult times in their lives.
I do not know how many times, as an elected MEP, I have been contacted by constituents who are having difficulties getting maintenance from somebody in another Member State.
All too often, I have been unable to give a practical and positive answer.
With this regulation, I hope that in most circumstances we would be able to do much better.
The proposal potentially allows the EU to go much further than states can through the Hague Conference process, which has already been mentioned.
We should indeed be able to go further.
After all, we have encouraged our citizens to move freely across old national borders within the EU, and should be able to provide an answer, in the form of a good, simple, functioning justice system, when they hit rough times in their marriages or partnerships breaking down.
Above all, we should be able to offer help to children suffering the financial consequences of marriage breakdown.
This proposal would give us a simplified one-step process, instead of the current nightmare of applying in one court and then having to go through more or less the same process of enforcement in a foreign court.
That is too much for people at vulnerable and desperate moments in their lives.
The Legal Affairs Committee has been happy to endorse most of this proposal, whilst trying to make some technical improvements.
In this respect I am very grateful to my colleague, Mr Casini.
However, like the rapporteur, we cannot accept the choice of legal base.
It should have been codecision, not consultation.
I believe the Member States have been entirely unreasonable, both in terms of the content of the legislation, and as regards the implications for our citizens.
I hope they will respond to the Commissioner's appeal.
Speaking on behalf of my Group, we do not want to see the effectiveness of this one-step system undermined.
We must, of course, respect the rights of the defence - the judgement debtor - but this should apply to the originating court.
We should not allow the re-opening of the case in the enforcing court, or we will destroy the very benefits we are seeking to deliver.
We therefore want to see deletion of Article 33(a), and have grave doubts about amendment 61, which still leaves the door open too wide.
Finally, I want to make some comments as a UK Member of this Parliament.
The UK opt-out or failure to opt in to this instrument is bad news for many EU nationals from other Member States now living in the UK, and is also bad news for many Brits whose partners move to another Member State.
Indeed, there are all sorts of permutations where the opt-out will create chaos and confusion.
People will be second-class citizens in respect of the justice system available to them.
However, what I most regret is the failure of the British Government to appreciate the untenable position of British MEPs in these issues.
Should we actually be working on, speaking on - and, more importantly, voting on -proposals on things that, as they currently stand, will have no application to those who elected us?
Others are beginning to question the legitimacy of our position.
These opt-outs are democratically untenable and destructive to the coherence of the EU civil justice system.
Pick-and-mix, opt-in and opt-out merely hits those who are vulnerable and in most need of the law's protection.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Grabowska, on her initiative in raising this issue and on the very positive view she has expressed this evening.
Fellow Members, the round of consultations of the Hague Conference, which began seven years ago, is drawing to a close.
The question arises: what progress has been made on the issue of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments in international private law?
Where is the declaration that the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments is the cornerstone of judicial and police cooperation in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice?
The answer is that no great progress has been made in this direction.
The 2004 Hague Programme has not been promoted to the degree that was needed, despite the efforts and initiatives of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Frattini.
Unfortunately, the misuse of appeals to national sovereignty by some Member States is a hindrance to the harmonisation of the law, not only on substantive matters, but also on questions of procedure.
These general observations do not, of course, negate the value and significance of the proposal we are discussing.
On the contrary, they underline the need to adopt further proposals for Council regulations, covering the whole field of family law: divorce, separation, maintenance and property matters.
Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 on recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility is in need of radical reform and modernisation.
This need is indeed being addressed to a large extent with the proposal for the amending regulation, but unfortunately only on the question of maintenance.
The differences in the substantive law of the Member States, under the vital heading of justice, remain.
There is still a long way to go.
Even so, where there is scope for convergence, this harmonisation of the law should be pushed forward.
The amendments proposed by the European Parliament fill many of the gaps in the proposal and improve its content.
Above all, they overcome many obstacles which hinder the enforcement of maintenance judgments anywhere in the European Union, and they limit the debtor parent's or spouse's scope for evading justice when he or she has moved from one EU Member State to another.
Precisely this point is addressed by the amendment which I have tabled to Article 33a, in which I attempt, firstly, not to leave unlimited scope for non-enforcement of an order on grounds of a change of circumstances and, secondly, to allow latitude for dealing with the situation in this way when there are serious, really serious, pertinent circumstances which give the court precisely this right to revise its opinion.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Genowefa Grabowska, most warmly for the work she has put into the regulation before us and her report.
The splendid result does not surprise me, as Professor Grabowska is one of Poland's leading experts on European law.
Bearing in mind that the number of divorces and separations in the European Union is rising, the problem of legal impediments to the recognition and enforcement of decisions on maintenance obligations is increasingly important.
Furthermore, given the degree of integration of the Member States and the still large number of binding legal sources within the European Union, an advanced legal system is essential.
There is no harmonised system in force in this field at European Union level at the present time.
I am therefore in favour of the regulation, which contains highly pertinent proposals concerning the problems we are discussing.
It should be noted that it is the outcome of a long-term programme of work, the Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union.
I agree that effective enforcement of maintenance obligations will improve the living conditions and education of many children who are first-line maintenance creditors.
That is a very important matter for European socialists.
The proposed regulation not only tackles certain problems of modern society: it can also help improve the operation of the internal market, specifically by removing barriers to the free movement of persons who could suffer as a result of differences in Member States' legislation on the execution of maintenance obligations.
For the good of all citizens of the European Union, we must strive to achieve rapid and, if possible, cost-free execution of maintenance payments.
At present, institutions must sometimes resort to drastic measures to enforce the payment of maintenance, while creditors often live in reduced circumstances.
I also support the idea that court decisions should have the same force as they have in the Member State in which they were issued, without any additional formalities.
Finally, I would stress the need for greater involvement of the European Parliament in the adoption of decisions on matters of such importance for the future functioning of the European Union and the internal market.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the report we are examining is to eliminate most of the obstacles to the recovery of maintenance in Europe, making it possible to establish a legal context in keeping with the legitimate expectations of maintenance creditors.
The most significant starting point is that in the vast majority of cases the maintenance creditor is the weaker party and therefore needs very vigorous protection, and it is evident that the main problem lies in the actual circumstances of maintenance debtors.
However, it is advisable to do at least what is possible, i.e. to eliminate any unnecessary red tape and to make the applicable law certain, to establish a preference for the law of the place of residence of the creditor and to give immediate effect to the legal decision under which maintenance has to be paid, even in countries other than the country in which the decision has been given.
The Committee on Legal Affairs, called upon to give an opinion under the enhanced cooperation procedure on jurisdiction, applicable law and enforcement of decisions in matters relating to maintenance obligations, has played an important role in the drafting of the text, achieving a major compromise agreement between the main political groups, for which I should like publicly to thank Mrs Wallis.
The main aims of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs are to draw up a clear definition of maintenance obligations, extend the scope of application, protect the most vulnerable parties involved and simplify the proposed text.
It has been necessary to draw up an unambiguous definition of maintenance obligations and to include in the scope of the regulation all orders relating to the payment of lump sums.
Particular attention has been paid - as I have said - to the most vulnerable parties and, here, the text of the regulation needs to be further simplified.
In conclusion, as my speaking time has come to a end, I am sure that the PPE-DE Group will give this decision its full support.
(PL) Mr President, the regrettable increase in marital breakdown, coupled with the growing mobility of people living in the European Union, is inevitably leading to an increase in the number of cross-border conflicts concerning maintenance claims.
At the present time, in order to enforce a claim against a maintenance debtor living in another Member State it is necessary to apply to the judiciary of the state in which the decision is to be executed.
Unfortunately, that does not always work, so there is clearly a real need to lay down detailed rules on jurisdiction in regard to maintenance claims.
The purpose of the draft resolution is to reduce the formal requirements for a court decision to be delivered in any Member State and to ensure its effective execution.
Upon entry into force, the new regulation will enable an entitled person to obtain a binding enforcement order anywhere in the European Union.
It will also simplify and unify the enforcement system.
While welcoming the measures adopted by the Hague Conference, I fully agree with the rapporteur that the regulations applying in this matter in the European Union must be more progressive and more rapidly implemented.
The increasing mobility of EU citizens is leading to any increase in the number of marriages in which spouses are of different nationalities and live in different states, or live in a Member State of which neither is a national.
Where an international couple decide to divorce, they may therefore invoke different laws.
The broad subjective and objective scope of the regulation is justified by the frighteningly low rate of obtention of maintenance payments in certain EU Member States.
In my own country, Poland, for example, the figure is just 10%.
The regulation will also enable the mother of an illegitimate child to claim from the child's father payment of the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the costs of her upkeep during childbirth.
At present such a claim is not recognised in many Member States as a claim for maintenance, which makes it considerably more difficult to pursue.
Before my country joined the European Union, more than one thousand claims for maintenance from abroad were lodged in the courts every year.
As a result of the opening of borders, all forecasts predict a drastic rise in the number of such claims, both in Poland and in other countries.
The opening of borders and labour markets may lead some fathers to run away from their maintenance obligations, and it is mainly the children who will suffer.
This we cannot accept.
Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief.
I would like to thank all those who have spoken, the rapporteur and Members who have taken part in this work.
In forthcoming months, we shall, in my view, have three objectives before us and I hope that the Slovenian Presidency will be able to take them forward successfully.
First: to convince the Council that if we feel it is useful to amend a legal base under Article 67 of the Treaty, we do so to give a better democratic basis to an initiative which objectively protects vulnerable groups of people, especially children following the breakdown of the family unit.
The second objective is to ensure that creditors receive the same protection irrespective of the place at which the matter has been brought before the courts: it would be very odd if the so-called lex fori criterion led to a substantial variation in the protection afforded to creditors.
Another essential objective is therefore to try to harmonise the rules.
The third objective, where, in my view, work is needed, is that of actual enforcement: in too many cases we affirm the principle of protection of creditors in family matters, but then we do not ensure that it is enforced, or we allow the substance of the case to be reopened when a payment order should be made.
That does not work in the case of maintenance; were it the case, the measure would be deprived of any meaning.
We have drawn up fairly innovative proposals: temporarily freezing a proportion of the debtor's bank account if the debtor does not want to pay, or a mandatory periodic payment order against the debtor's assets for the sum that the debtor should pay.
As you know, there has been dissent and opposition from the majority of the Member States in the Council because that is what really makes a difference for a regulation: either the measure can be genuinely enforced or it is pointless to continue to affirm the importance of protecting children or separated spouses who are maintenance creditors!
We shall have to work on these three issues in the coming months and, clearly, in this case, more than in others, the Commission and Parliament are in agreement and we shall have to persuade the Council that this is the right road to take.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) For the moment, there is no single European system to acknowledge and enforce the legal obligation to grant maintenance abroad.
The Community provisions in this field are insufficient instruments for pursuing debtors who try to avoid their obligations to pay maintenance.
According to the present regulation, any judgment regarding maintenance given in a Member State must be rapidly and correctly enforced in any other Member State.
Thus has ensured the simplification of citizens' lives, namely the recovery of child maintenance from the parent or other debtors when such persons reside in a different country to the child, implementation of one of the European fundamental rights, the right to private and family life and child protection, homogenization and simplification of the European legal norms on the entire EU territory and construction of the European space of freedom, security, justice and facilitation of internal market operation.
I think that the courts notified should check the independent status and competence of legal consultancies and take into consideration the situation of the parties during the proceedings.
The creditor of the maintenance obligation should benefit from the legal provisions in the country of residence, litigations in this field should be solved less expensively and searching for the most favourable jurisdiction should be avoided.
Ovine and caprine animals: electronic identification (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 as regards the date of introduction of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals - C6-0448/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as we all know, traceability is a key element of ensuring high standards in animal health and food safety.
We have had recent experience with certain diseases in the European Union, such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue, which has once again shown the importance of efficient identification systems.
Individual identification cannot function properly without electronic identification.
The Commission was requested to confirm or amend, in its report, the date of implementation of electronic identification, not to question the principles of the regulation.
That is why it is a technical report on the various methods and technology involved.
The Commission report only focuses on the best way to implement electronic identification.
However, in order to produce a report, we needed data and input from the Member States, and in particular those Member States already working on the system.
The studies and trials necessary for the preparation of the report lasted much longer than was originally foreseen, which explains the delay in the report.
We strongly appreciate and thank Parliament for agreeing to handle this matter as urgent.
That will prevent a situation of legal uncertainty in January 2008.
The report concludes that technical conditions for electronic identification of sheep and goats have been fulfilled, but that Member States need a reasonable time frame to prepare the implementation of electronic identification.
We agree with, and accept, Parliament's position to have a fixed date for introduction of the system.
On the other hand, we cannot accept the other amendments proposed, which would call into question the very principles of the regulation, since the question now is what the actual date of implementation should be.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the speedy work he has done, and Parliament for agreeing to treat this matter as urgent.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kyprianou, we have complied with the request to handle this matter swiftly.
We are dealing here with something urgent, which is precisely why we are still here at this late hour.
The question is, of course, how this urgent situation arose.
You have said something about that.
I had a look through the documentation and came across the very regulation that we want to amend today.
It dates from 17 December 2003.
That regulation prescribes that, with effect from 1 January 2008, 'electronic identification according to the guidelines referred to in paragraph 1 [...] shall be obligatory for all animals'.
There are one or two exemption clauses, which I shall omit, and then it says, 'The Commission shall submit to the Council, by 30 June 2006, a report on the implementation of the electronic identification scheme, accompanied by appropriate proposals, on which the Council shall vote by qualified majority'.
In short, the matter lies very far back in the past.
The Commission's report to the Council was evidently never submitted, and there was no comeback from the Council.
Are you signalling something?
If you did submit the report, all the better, but then there was no response from the Member States.
And then we got into this pickle, realising that the deadline could not be met.
So far, so bad, but then you proposed that, instead of perhaps setting a new deadline, we should leave it to the comitology procedure to set the date.
In other words, the setting of the deadline would be your decision.
We should then have taken all this trouble for nothing, and so the committee decided that the provision on compulsory electronic tagging should enter into force on 31 December 2009 and be applicable from 1 January 2010, two years later than prescribed in the original regulation.
Be that as it may, the important thing is that we have a date.
The committee also said that a report should be submitted on this matter too.
The problem with your proposal, of course, is that you are drawing more and more decision-making into the realm of comitology, just as you did with the old regulation of 17 December 2003, in which the provisions and application arrangements relating to the regime of electronic identification were delegated to the Commission through the comitology procedure.
At that time there was also to be a report to the Council but no report to Parliament.
As a result of this practice of subjecting everything to comitology, Parliament is divested of its decision-making rights and its powers of scrutiny, and so we only discover at some later date that obligations have not been honoured.
If you had not come with these amendments now and requested urgent treatment because you were under pressure to meet the deadline, we should have thought that everything was alright.
But things were not alright!
That must be a warning to us in Parliament not to delegate too much to the Commission but to continue exercising our powers of scrutiny.
Now there have been a couple of amendments.
You said you could not accept them.
The committee stipulated that the rules should be binding.
That, in fact, is also laid down in the basic regulation, which, as we all know, is not being repealed but only amended.
Now there are amendments tabled by you, Mr Stevenson, one of them jointly with Mrs McGuinness, which propose that the system be made voluntary.
Well, if we make it voluntary, we might as well forget the whole thing.
What would then be left to prescribe?
We could resign ourselves to the fact that all cats are grey in the dark.
I therefore believe that we must stick with compulsory rules and that these compulsory rules must include a date and a report to the European Parliament.
It will be a lesson to us that this report has made us stumble more or less by chance across this truly unusual way of proceeding on the part of the Commission and the Council.
I hope, Mr Kyprianou, that I am not being unduly harsh in my criticism, but you can imagine that, as I drafted the report and prepared myself for this evening and consulted the relevant documentation, I had to rub my eyes when I saw all the things that can happen in our European institutions.
Both Parliament and the Commission - and we as individuals too, as far as I am concerned - surely have an interest in ensuring that this sort of thing does not recur and become a habit.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let me start by answering a question that was put to me by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
He was asking why my amendments seek to make this system voluntary.
I can tell Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf very quickly why I seek to make it voluntary.
Last week in my constituency in Scotland, cast ewes - for the non-agricultural people in the Chamber (there are not many people in the Chamber), they are old female sheep - were selling for GBP 2 a head.
A year ago they were selling for GBP 60 a head; this year, GBP 2 a head.
I ask the rapporteur: how is a farmer who is only getting two quid a head for his sheep supposed to fit microchips and buy expensive scanners and readers that can comply with a mandatory electronic ID system?
This is the economic problem.
The original Commission proposal was perfectly correct in seeking stakeholder consultation and in seeking economic-impact cost-benefit analysis.
I have not seen all the figures.
I do not know what the intention would be for the sheep farmers in my constituency.
I have to remind the Members in this House that the UK has the biggest sheep flock in the whole of Europe - by far the biggest.
The impact of this would be catastrophic with the economic situation the way it is.
It would actually mean - if this becomes mandatory and we go by the dates set by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in their vote on Monday night, and we set 31 December 2009 as the mandatory introduction - that a whole group of sheep farmers in Britain will close down and go out of business.
The upland areas and the hills that have been looked after by sheep farmers and grazed by sheep for centuries will go wild and then the public will realise the damage that has been done.
While we are wreaking this damage in a flock that already has the best traceability in Europe - we have absolute guaranteed traceability in the UK at the present time and the sheep farmers cannot understand why we want to impose a new system of electronic identification when they already have high-quality traceability - we are importing sheep meat into the EU from outside, from countries that do not respect our levels of hygiene and welfare and the rigorous regulations that we apply to our sheep farmers.
So, let us have a little bit of sensitivity here.
I hope that when we come to vote on this tomorrow the Members will see the reason why we are asking for a voluntary system and not yet fixing a mandatory date for the introduction of electronic ID.
on behalf of the PSE Group. -(ES) Mr President, I am one who always listens carefully to Mr Stevenson whenever he speaks, and I have been listening to him for several years now, but this speech surprises me, because it is one which would have been better made in 2003 and not 2007, nearly 2008 in fact.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf put it very well: this is a 2004 regulation, we debated it in Parliament in 2003, and the regulation provides that the date of entry into force for the system of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals is to be 1 January 2008.
So, Mr Stevenson - I have no doubt whatever that you have ovine animals in your constituency, as I do myself - the five Member States with the biggest ovine and caprine flocks are, besides your country and mine, France, Italy and Greece.
Well now, these four Member States have undertaken the task, which seems so abhorrent to you, of convincing their farmers to tag ovine and caprine animals, because we were told that the regulation said that electronic identification was going to be obligatory from 1 January 2008.
I, as a Member of this Parliament, entirely understand this.
I also understand that there are Member States - such as yours, which is why I have just been listening to you - which have not fulfilled their duties, and with this in mind, I voluntarily proposed a date - which has moreover been accepted by the Committee on Agriculture - extending that time-limit slightly, but, as you know, whereas they might pay two pounds an animal in your constituency, in mine they only pay one pound.
At this point in time, with animal disease problems being prevalent in Europe, I think that a system such as this provides a guarantee and a way of enhancing the value of what our farmers are producing.
It is an identification system which enables us to know the provenance of any animal transiting Community territory and be assured that it is in good health; it is a guarantee for the consumer and that has to be good for the farmer, because he is going to get more for his meat.
If they are not going to get any more for their meat, that is just where we are now with bluetongue, foot-and-mouth disease and the chikungunya mosquito.
If that is the case then there is no hope for us.
So, please, let us just get to work, let us be coherent and read and examine the regulation referred to by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf -which I would repeat is a 2004 regulation - let us read it carefully, let us recognise that there are a few exceptions in it, but it is not a matter of do-as-you-please, because the date cannot be voluntary.
It cannot be voluntary because we, the Commission and the Council decided that it was obligatory.
In other words, I cannot turn the clock back to three years ago and tell my farmers that all their efforts up until now are completely pointless because the British forgot to ask their farmers to do the same.
Do you understand me?
I am asking you to read my amendment carefully.
My group is definitely not about to question the obligatory nature of the system, because that would create unlawful discrimination between Member States and within the European Union itself, although it would not surprise me - and I am not referring to you, Mr Stevenson - that someone who had the gall to reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights in this House today could display equal or greater gall in rejecting the identification of ovine and caprine animals.
Here we are then: I think we have a regulation, the Commission has made us a reasonable proposal, we have also made a reasonable proposal to the Commission, so let us try to finish this matter this morning without too much damage on either side.
Mr President, I rise very much to support what Mr Stevenson has just said and also very much to support what the Commission is trying to do.
I think we do have to realise the scale of sheep farming and the number of animals involved.
You are talking about 25 million sheep in the UK, 8.5 million in France, 3 million in Ireland and significant numbers in Spain and other countries.
The system has got to be right.
If we are going to introduce an electronic system, it has got to be practical and cost-effective, and farmers have got to be able to use it practically.
As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said, the sheep is an animal that is not of huge value, so all of this is not going to be done by veterinarians.
A lot of this is going to have to be carried out by farmers, and when they come to read those tags, it is has got to be practically done up the side of a mountain in wet conditions, and all sorts of things.
I have seen a lot of these electronic systems work in hotel rooms as you move people through different doorways, and they say there is no collision between the different tags.
You also want a system where, when a lorry-load of sheep drives into a market, in ideal circumstances, you want to be able to electronically check every sheep that is in that lorry.
This is the ideal system.
What I say to you quite clearly is that there is no point in moving forward on electronic tagging until we have got a practical system, cost-effective and ready to use.
Therefore, I think you are absolutely right to say, 'Come back at the end of 2009 and see where we are'.
As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said, let us use this as a voluntary system when Member States are ready, when there is a lot of movement of sheep, and when we have got a system that works.
Please do not bring it in too quickly, before we are ready.
Mr President, once again we are here to debate the tagging of sheep.
All I can say is that it is an awful pity that the Commission did not listen to us way back in the early days when we questioned what they were proposing then and advised them.
I would say to Ms MiguÃ©lez Ramos: yes, we did make these speeches way back at the beginning when there was the discussion on tagging sheep.
But unfortunately what we said was not listened to, even when we said it would be unworkable.
So we did warn you and you would not listen.
The reality is that sheep farmers could never afford the cost of electronic tagging because they are receiving less now for their lambs than they were 20 years ago!
You tell me of any other part of any other business of any other industry that is asked to put out tremendous expenditure and receive less for what they are producing than they did 20 years ago.
I know this is the case from personal experience.
The present system we have is sufficient.
So, let us kick this very much into the long grass for the future.
I can accept coming back and looking at it in 2009.
Maybe, over that period of time, the electronic tagging technology, which at the moment is far too expensive, may, like many other areas of technology, become more affordable with a combination of lower costs and better returns to the sheep producer.
Then we could examine this all over again.
The big challenge to sheep production is to achieve profitability and when that happens we can move forward with confidence.
I must say it was with great interest that I heard Ms MiguÃ©lez Ramos and Mr Stevenson having an exchange of views over sheep because they usually have an exchange of views over fish, which is totally different!
It is probably even more argumentative than over sheep as they are doing tonight.
But for sheep farmers, receiving such small rewards for hard work, as has been outlined by Mr Parish, makes this is a very difficult job.
There are thousands of sheep on the top of mountains for all of the summertime.
You try and catch them; you try and tag them; you try and follow them.
I have to say to the Commissioner: I just wish you would send some of your officials who draw up some of these plans out to these areas and see what the sheep farmers have to put up with, see what they have to go through.
Then you might understand how we feel and why we put forward these views.
Yes, let us do it on a voluntary basis.
Let us do it when we are ready.
Let us move at a proper pace and let us take it at a speed which we can afford.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be very brief, as it is late.
I would like to remind the honourable Members that what we are discussing today is the date of introduction of the system.
A decision was correctly taken to put the system in place, but the date was left open, or rather a date was fixed which, it was decided, we should subsequently amend or confirm.
The data from a number of Member States showed two things.
First of all that implementation was feasible, both technically and economically - as is stated in the report - and also that more time was needed for the Member States to introduce the system, meaning that a more realistic date was needed.
The truth is that the Commission did propose to have this date set at a later stage.
I can assure you there was no intention to circumvent Parliament, and that is precisely why we chose this way of proceeding - having this debate, and not inserting an article in the regulation, which would have allowed us to take a decision with the Council alone.
There was never any intention on the part of the Commission not to include or involve Parliament in these decisions.
The setting of a date was considered to be a technical question.
Since the principle had already been adopted, we thought that this technical question could be adopted through comitology and, to repeat what I said earlier, we have no problem in accepting the amendment setting a specific date, which I believe allows Member States enough time - two years - to prepare.
However, we would be reluctant to agree to voluntary systems, since the regulation concerns traceability, and traceability has to be effective and applied equally in the Member States.
It is also a specific reflection of the animal health situation in the European Union.
One can look at the direct cost of the system as it appears, but, if you take the longer-term benefits of the savings generated by the reduction in losses and animal diseases, we believe it will eventually be of benefit from the economic point of view.
Nevertheless, we are ready to accept the amendment by Parliament, which we believe will also be adopted by the Council next week.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor on a point of order.
rapporteur. - (DE) Allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.
Commissioner Kyprianou, I tabled an amendment providing for certain exceptions, which are not intended to be implemented on a voluntary basis, and indeed the original instrument also allows for a variation, an updating, if it is done in accordance with Article 9(4).
In certain circumstances - and these must not include voluntary arrangements, which would render the whole exercise pointless - it would be possible to give some consideration to ways in which the concerns that my fellow Members have expressed here could be met in practice.
This is only intended as a suggestion and a question to which you might like to give some thought.
That was not a point of order, but would the Commissioner care to answer the question?
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I said, we have a problem accepting amendments that will affect the main principles and aspects of the regulation.
We will look at it again but, nevertheless, this is a concern.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - I do not believe that sufficient information has been provided on the efficiency and effectiveness of electronic identification (EID) for sheep and goats.
Furthermore, I believe that an economic assessment, notably a cost-benefit analysis of the impact on producers, is necessary before fixing a date for the introduction of EID.
I do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of EID, particularly in relation to traceability and disease control, has been assessed.
In Ireland, the sheep sector is melting down, with many farmers exiting the industry and therefore the imposition of these measures and costs on this sector at this time is unwelcome.
If there is a legitimate justification for EID in this sector, stock owners would be responsive and would set about introducing it themselves on a voluntary basis.
If and when this EID scheme is introduced it should take place on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis.
Furthermore, should EID be introduced it should only apply to animals born after a certain date and should not apply to existing stock.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9. a.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order, I rise to inquire about the potential use of Rule 147 of our Rules of Procedure, following the disgraceful events of yesterday where some of our colleagues behaved, frankly, like hooligans.
I would urge the President and the Conference of Presidents to look into this - to take their time and do it properly, but this, surely, is an instance where the imposition of penalties as foreseen under Rule 147 should be, at least, considered.
We revised this rule last year to distinguish very clearly between protests that are measured, that are visual but do not disrupt the sitting, and those sorts of behaviour which actually disrupt the parliamentary sitting.
Yesterday, speakers - including our guest, the Prime Minister of Portugal - were shouted down so that they could not be heard.
That is no way to behave in a pluralist, democratic parliament where we thrive on proper debate, not shouting people down.
I would urge the President to look into this and, perhaps at the January sitting, announce what penalties he intends to impose: at the very least a reprimand, as foreseen, but perhaps some of the more vigorous penalties that are provided for in our Rules of Procedure.
Mr Corbett, leaving aside my personal opinions, where I tend to agree with your feelings and opinion, the problem will certainly be referred to the Bureau under the terms of Rule 147 and I am sure the President will follow it up in accordance with the provisions of Rule 147.
(FR) Mr President, on this matter I totally agree with what Mr Corbett said to us.
I would just like to add that I was there at the sitting this morning, to hear the apology made by the group chairman, Mr Bonde, for what happened yesterday regarding the ushers.
What is unacceptable is that a member of Parliament's staff, who was only doing his duty as the President and Presidency required of him, should be attacked using words or phrases that I will not say were too strong, but frankly crap - excuse the term, but I am just using the same language.
I do not see any official apologies, so we must take the necessary measures to defend Parliament's staff.
That is why I am here this morning.
Thank you, Mr Daul.
I will conclude the requests to speak on this point, which is a procedural matter, by asking Mr Beazley to speak.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
I just wanted to agree wholeheartedly with both Mr Corbett and my group chairman, Mr Daul.
What happened yesterday was utterly inexcusable.
However, I would caution, perhaps, that the Conference of Presidents remembers the - perhaps wise - advice of Mr Cohn-Bendit not to give these people the prominence they seek through their quite unacceptable behaviour.
I was wondering whether, perhaps, the services of Parliament might investigate whether additional facilities for Parliament's crÃšche might be found, so that those suffering from what apparently is described as 'offensive Faragia' syndrome - the symptoms of which are feeling far out and outrageous; it can, in its extreme form, become contagious - but for those who feel obliged to go to this crÃšche, and I propose Mr Farage as its custodian, the only known therapy is for them to march up and down with a placard with single words on it and shout at each other at the top of their voice.
When the fever subsides, they may rest and rejoin the grown-ups.
So, I wish those who held up those absurd posters yesterday and those who behaved appallingly a merry Christmas; if they have time over the yuletide to reflect on their behaviour, they might even think what they would like to do when they grow up.
We will also take account of your suggestion, though personally I have some difficulty imagining these fellow Members in a crÃšche since, in view of the violent tendencies shown by some of them, we could run the risk of a 'Massacre of the Innocents'.
We will act exactly as laid down in Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure and will certainly be consistent with it.

Textiles (debate)
The next item is the debate on:
the oral question to the Commission on the expiry of the Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and China on imports of certain textile and clothing products, by Pedro Guerreiro, Jacky HÃ©nin, Roberto Musacchio, Marco Rizzo, Ilda Figueiredo and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B6-0388/2007);
the oral question to the Commission on textiles by Gianluca Susta, Ignasi Guardans CambÃ³ and Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Robert Sturdy, Tokia SaÃ¯fi, Georgios Papastamkos and Vasco GraÃ§a Moura, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Erika Mann, Glyn Ford, Kader Arif and Elisa Ferreira, on behalf of the PSE Group, Cristiana Muscardini and Eugenijus Maldeikis, on behalf of the UEN Group, Caroline Lucas and Alain Lipietz, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group - B6-0383/2007).
deputising for the author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also speaking on behalf of my colleague Gianluca Susta, the first signatory of the question, who is absent today because of important commitments that have arisen in Italy.
Once again, Parliament wants to tackle the complex situation of the textile industry, asking the Commission for more decisive and appropriate intervention.
The sector employs millions of workers in Europe, and accounts for significant turnover in many countries, making Europe the second largest exporter in the world and therefore making a very important contribution to European exports.
In my opinion, it is wrong to consider it a mature sector, because in many cases there is scope for modernisation through technological innovation and research into new materials, and it has strong links with fashion, styling and other specialities in which many European countries have genuine expertise recognised the world over.
Naturally, this requires substantial support for the sector through industrial policies that put it in the position of being truly capable of facing global competition.
These are also suggestions made by the High Level Group that was set up, and consequently we are asking the Commission just what follow-up and implementation action it has taken.
In the immediate future, the urgent problems concern the measures to be taken for the fateful date of 1 January 2008.
I will mention just three problems: the need for very careful checks: how does the Commission intend to implement the surveillance system to ensure there are effective safeguards; how it will cope with the risk of indirect movements and therefore the problem of twin checking of licences?
Basically, for all instruments that look good on paper, the problem is how to put them into practice.
There is the matter of how to guarantee the authenticity of products and thus the need to keep fighting counterfeiting, piracy and unfair commercial practices, and we hope that the Council - which is not here today - will adopt the 'made in' regulation, which is truly necessary and would be a genuine safeguard measure.
There is the problem of consumer protection, including from the point of view of health and safety.
We should apply the same health and safety standards to imported products that we use for the manufacture of products within the European market.
Finally - and we are directing this to the Commission - there is the problem of willingness to act.
If at the beginning of 2008 there should again be a boom in imports, if there should be peaks again, as happened in the past, we are asking for a genuine willingness to use new instruments and possibly new measures and safeguard clauses.
author. - Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago, following the removal of the quotas, the textile sector experienced a veritable big bang.
To try to cope with the crisis, Commissioner, you were recommending temporary palliative measures with the aim of controlling and restricting imports of some Chinese textiles.
In a few days time, these safeguards will no longer exist and trade in textiles will be subject to joint European Union/Chinese surveillance, which I hope will be attentive and vigilant.
Today, our concern is about the way this system of joint surveillance will be set up.
What guarantees do we have that this twin checking system will be both adequate and effective?
The textiles sector is one that has always been globalist, both in terms of production and consumption, but it is one that has paid the price for globalisation.
However, globalisation can be anticipated and regulated.
For this to happen there needs to be the political will to set up a competitive framework for our European textile industries.
We need to work towards fair and reciprocal conditions of market access.
We need to continue to be fearless in using the instruments at the EU's disposal to defend our trade; being protective is not the same thing as being protectionist.
We need to prioritise the fight against counterfeiting.
The Europe of tomorrow will no longer have any industry if we do not stand up for its intellectual copyrights and expertise.
Having the same rules applied by everyone for everyone is the only way of offering all of the parties concerned a win-win scenario.
I therefore wish for 2008, Mr Mandelson, that together we can consider the textile sector's bright future in a more peaceful climate.
author. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks after the end of negotiations on the Memorandum of Understanding introducing restrictions on imports of Chinese textiles, it is essential that the European Parliament adopts a strong position on the future of its textiles sector, the structures and organisational methods of which are threatened by its sudden entry into competition with China.
The joint resolution we are proposing today asks for a clear commitment from the European Commission and the Member States on several points.
Firstly, for companies and workers in the sector who face major restructuring risks to be fully supported by adequate social measures and by the granting of European funds to support the modernisation of their production facilities.
Next, we need to commit ourselves to improving the competitiveness of the European textiles sector within the more general framework of a strong and ambitious European industrial policy.
This objective cannot be achieved until words turn into actions and until we invest heavily in research and development.
Furthermore, in view of unfair competition from some of our competitors, who base their competitive advantages on social and environmental dumping, or both, Europe needs effective tools to defend itself.
Greater efficiency will not be achieved by means of hurried reform, which will weaken the EU's means of protection, but by the more transparent and predictable use of existing instruments.
Finally, Europe needs to use the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as the foundation for an integrated manufacturing area that makes the most of the proximity of the Mediterranean countries to increase competitiveness in the international textiles market.
The development of the Mediterranean countries with which we want to create a partnership depends on our ability to offer them firm commitments on policies and sectors of common interest.
author. - Mr President, I should like to emphasise that the Greens are very aware that the consequences of a totally liberalised textile and apparel market for EU-based producers is still a very pressing issue, particularly for certain production zones within the EU in which the industry is highly concentrated.
Several hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost since the beginning of 2005, albeit fewer than some of the worst predictions.
The Greens have from the start flagged our concern about the impact of competition on European producers.
I think we need to monitor the situation carefully and be ready to apply import restrictions if import surges in the next year overwhelm the capacity of EU-based apparel industries to adapt, as well, of course, as channelling research and development resources to that sector.
However, we need to be aware that the problem is very much harder for certain poor countries in the South, like Bangladesh and the Philippines, which have been induced by the World Bank and other donors to invest heavily in exporting clothing and apparel products and now find themselves with shrinking export opportunities, a continuous debt burden, no financial means for adjustment of the sector, and misery - especially for millions of women who work for almost nothing in nightshifts in order to undercut the cheapest offer on the market with an even cheaper one.
It is, in fact, that latter perspective that emphasises that in certain sectors, where too many producers produce too many products, some kind of management tools to control supply are necessary and in the interests of the majority.
That is why I urge colleagues to support the amendment that the Greens and Socialists have filed together, which reads: 'Calls on the Commission to evaluate the usefulness of supply-side management tools for the clothing sector, in order to level off global competition and prevent a lowest-common-denominator approach to social and environmental standards.'
A completely liberalised market in sectors characterised by overproduction capacities brings misery to all but a few.
In that respect I think we should use the example of the apparel industry to press for new thinking about the way in which policy ought to regulate markets for the benefit of all.
The reintroduction of some kind of quotas should be considered in this evaluation of supply-side management tools.
Another option mentioned in the joint resolution which deserves a more comprehensive evaluation is the creation of a Euromed production zone of the clothing and apparel industry.
Indeed, that option not only points towards the improvement of opportunities for development in the southern Mediterranean rim states, but also gives opportunities to the southern European textile and apparel producers who would profit from shorter transportation times to EU markets.
It is one of the good examples of how a Euromed economic zone could be sensitively managed without dragging the whole of the Mediterranean region in all-out liberalisation through a free trade agreement.
From my Group's perspective, we regard this proposal as an option in its own right that should be fostered independently of the contested 2010 Euromed free-trade-agreement project, which, according to the sustainability impact assessments done by DG Trade in the Commission, would involve a significant number of quite negative social and environmental consequences.
author. - (PT) We are glad to be having this debate to which my parliamentary group has contributed a great deal.
We hope that the debate will help to protect jobs and the activity of the textile and clothing sector, a strategic sector for the European Union, which has been so little protected and so undervalued.
As regards the questions to the Commission, we have nothing to add; they have been tabled.
As regards the joint motion for a resolution, due to be adopted by the European Parliament today, we should like to point out that, although it contains certain points that might in practice protect and promote the textile and clothing sector in the European Union, we have reservations about some other points.
To give just three examples: the 'Globalisation Adjustment Fund' should not be used as a temporary cushion against the unacceptable social and economic costs of closure and relocation of undertakings, with the consequent destruction of jobs.
That is, we should intervene on the causes, not the effects.
The current liberalisation policies need to be reversed and financial means made available that effectively help to protect jobs, to modernise the sector and also to promote the introduction of other industries, including those linked to textiles and clothing, thus making for industrial diversification in regions where that activity is currently concentrated.
It would not make much sense to urge the European Union to encourage others to review their monetary policies if the EU does not first critically reappraise the strong euro policy and its impact on some EU countries' exports.
Nor would it make sense to call for trade defence instruments in relation to China, whilst simultaneously supporting the setting up of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.
I do not have time in this speech to summarise all our proposals on the European Union's clothing and textile industry.
They are set out in our motion for a resolution.
However, we should like to mention some of the amendments tabled to the joint resolution.
They aim at making up for the lack of any mention of the serious consequences of the liberalisation of the textile and clothing industry at global level, with the closure and relocation of numerous undertakings, in particular to North Africa and Asia, leaving a trail of unemployment and serious socio-economic crises; stressing also that the double-checking 'surveillance system' will serve no purpose unless it prevents any repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005, underscoring the need for new safeguard measures so as to enable employment in, and the business of, the textiles and clothing sector to be safeguarded and promoted in the EU.
The proposals highlight that some countries have adopted safeguard measures applying until the end of 2008 and it is therefore difficult to understand why the EU has not followed suit.
The proposals also express disquiet at the Commission's intentions to review trade defence instruments according to the interests of firms which are relocating their production to countries where, because of the low wages and social and environmental standards, production costs are lower.
They propose that a Community programme should be drawn up for the textiles and clothing sector, and especially for the more disadvantaged regions that depend on it and aid for SMEs.
They are proposals which maintain that a regulatory framework needs to be laid down to penalise company relocations, making public aid to businesses subject to long-term commitments regarding regional development and employment, including the requirement to pay back aid if such conditions are not met.
Finally, they are proposals which call for a stronger role for workers' representatives in company boards and in fundamental organisational decision-making.
They are proposals that we hope will have the support of the European Parliament.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as Members of this House know, back in 2005 the EU and China agreed a memorandum of understanding that included a two-and-a-half-year transition arrangement designed to give some extra breathing space to EU textile producers following the liberalisation of global trade in textiles and clothing.
The arrangement capped growth each year for 10 particularly sensitive textile and clothing products.
These caps expire on 31 December 2007, although the memorandum itself remains valid until the end of 2008, and it commits industry and government on both sides to work for a stable transition to free trade in textiles.
It was always my intention to hold China to that responsibility.
The Commission negotiated with China a double-checking surveillance system for 2008 that will cover eight textile-product categories with particular sensitivities.
What this means is that China will issue an export licence for all exports and, in parallel, the EU licensing offices in the Member States will issue an import licence.
It is a familiar system, and manufacturers, importers and retailers have all welcomed it.
Its value lies in allowing us to monitor textile import patterns and, because imports have to be licensed before they leave the dock in China, it allows us to see likely developments in advance.
I am the first to acknowledge the fact that the textile and clothing industry is going through a long period of structural change.
This started long before the dismantling of quotas.
Successful European companies are not taking the mass producers head on but are investing in technology and in quality.
We remain - it is always worth saying it - the second biggest textile exporter in the world.
We have more fashion and quality brands than the rest of the world put together.
It is a sign of the European textile producers' confidence and resilience that they have not called for quotas to be further extended.
They have argued that their competitiveness depends more now on effective action on counterfeiting and market access in China.
It goes without saying that I intend to throw the entire weight of our trade policy behind these two problems.
On market access, we will be seeking new access for textile goods in the Doha Round and in all our new FTAs.
We have also set up a specific working group for textiles as part of the renewed market access strategy.
Europe is well poised to exploit huge new markets for consumer goods in the emerging economies and we will not simply be sitting back and hoping that these trends go our way.
Counterfeiting is, if anything, an even greater problem.
Protecting trademarks and design rights is absolutely central to the textile industry and I raise these issues with the Chinese in every single meeting I have with them.
We have done some useful collaborative work with the Chinese customs service and trade fair organisers, and the Chinese patent office.
But, on balance, China remains a huge problem for intellectual property rights holders.
The counterfeit markets are cleared out one day and the traders creep back in the next.
As I have said in the past, we have not ruled out the prospect of using the WTO if the situation does not improve.
Ms Toia mentioned the 'Made in' proposal to assist textiles: I made this proposal, I presented it to the Commission, it was agreed by the Commission but it has not been agreed, I am afraid, by the majority of Member States.
In view of this, I cannot press the proposal further or do more than I have done.
Last month, at the EU-China summit in Beijing, I was very careful to pass on some frank messages, and they apply in the textile sector as much as anywhere.
The EU-China trade relationship has been transformed in the last two decades.
Both sides have benefited from it immensely but it has become badly imbalanced.
While China dominates our import markets, our businesses are losing out in China because of counterfeiting and market-access barriers amounting to EUR 55 million a day in lost business opportunities.
Our spiralling trade deficit reflects both these things.
This is not because of a lack of competitiveness by European producers.
We have a surplus in goods trade with the rest of the world and, where we are allowed to compete freely, we are a match for anyone.
This is not the case in China.
Instead of a level playing field, it is seriously tilted against us.
We face trade and investment restrictions, rampant counterfeiting and regulatory barriers in virtually every sector.
China's WTO obligations six years after it became a member are still too often unmet.
I see the textiles problems as emblematic of the broader problems we face in China.
We are China's largest client for clothing and textiles.
We have respected China's comparative advantage in labour and production costs.
We are focusing on our own comparative advantages.
We are moving up the value chain in what we produce.
We expect the same sort of equal opportunity and fair treatment in China's market that Chinese producers receive in ours.
At the recent summit, the Premier of China, Wen Jiabao, appeared to hear and understand our strong concern and offered to create a high-level strategic mechanism with the EU to focus on rebalancing our trade deficit with China.
I welcome this, with one obvious caveat: it is not one more dialogue or one more roadmap we need, it is action - on the ground, in the markets, in the courts, where it matters to European exporters.
And action not just by the Ministry of Commerce but across the board by the regulating agencies and ministries which restrict market access and law enforcement in all parts of China's economy.
The openness of Europe's own markets to China will not be politically sustainable if this action does not occur.
I talk of textiles and clothing products, but also all sectors where Europe has export interests.
The practical delivery of real change by the new high-level trade deficit mechanism, which I and my trade counterpart are charged with designing and launching, will be the definitive test of China's sincerity.
I hope their sincerity matches our own in wishing to resolve the issues before us without resorting to avoidable confrontation.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that I find myself almost speechless for once.
Congratulations!
I think it is exactly what this House wanted to hear and I certainly hope he continues with the points that he has raised today in his negotiations with China.
It is encouraging, and it looks to me as though he has a total and utter grasp of the situation.
He would not expect me to say that, but I am saying it because I think he has done exactly what is wanted.
I would just say one thing, or two or three things, very briefly.
Yesterday, I heard in this House one of the best speeches that I have ever heard any head of state give, and that was by the King of Jordan.
One of the things that he mentioned was the situation with Euromed, which has a specific relevance to textiles and, of course, is very important for the stability of the whole European/Mediterranean region.
Perhaps the Commissioner could just add his comments on that, because it is coming up for negotiations.
I think it is particularly important, particularly as we have Turkey on one side and Morocco on the other; all would be particularly affected by our relationships with China.
Secondly, as one who does not believe in trade defence instruments and believes more in a free market, but in a free and fair market where competition is equal, I am pleased to hear that he is following those lines.
Thirdly, what exactly will happen after the Commission's double checking finishes - I believe the Commissioner said at the end of 2008 - bearing in mind the United States has just put in place very strict import conditions?
Will this mean more products coming on to the European market than we already have?
Finally, Commissioner, may I take this opportunity of wishing yourself, Renate and the rest of your staff a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, what will the year 2008 bring to the textile industry in the European Union?
Certainly nothing good.
China has developed into the most aggressive textile power in the world and in 2006 alone, 50 to 60% of high technology in textiles was bought for China in the ring-spinning, weaving and texturing machine sector.
Capacities are now waiting in the wings.
European retailers and manufacturers are no longer ordering, but are waiting for better offers from China.
Further bankruptcies are imminent.
The European focus on trade will create even bigger problems for us in other sectors, not just in textiles.
The volume of products we are offered will, of course, increase.
The variety of textiles, however, will fall.
If the issue is still to have any meaning, then further restructuring of the industry in the European Union must be flanked and more effectively cushioned in social terms.
Only a very few niche producers will survive.
This development also has an extra dimension, however.
In China, working and pay conditions for textile, garment and leather workers are still abysmal.
European retailers and investors are in addition beating down prices in China.
Alongside all the competitive advantages in China, survival is made more difficult because of the strong European support given to the remaining European textile industry.
A fast buck is always at the expense of the smallest players.
As a trade unionist, I would expect the sports economy staging the Olympics in China to reveal what it is like for the female workforce there.
Today 350 to 400 people already die on a daily basis in China's textile factories.
Up to 100 sustain mutilations to their hands every day.
Nine out of ten Chinese manufacturers violate international labour standards and even labour standards laid down in Chinese legislation!
However, business is going well for us in the retail trade.
As a trade unionist and as Vice-President of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation, I would say to you that it is too late, but not too late for us to take social measures.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I think that the speeches that we are hearing are all along the same lines. There have been very few debates recently in which we have heard people from different sides of the House representing different political sensibilities all talking the same language, with exactly the same objective.
We support free trade, without a doubt, and we support it as a very clear principle.
It is therefore not about creating barriers: it is about ensuring that the rules of the game are the same for everyone and accepting that the unfair competition by China, through imposing restrictions on access to the market and through extremely serious, permanent and systematic infringements of intellectual and industrial property rights, or the lack of controls on imports, or the question of exchange rate differences, which obviously not only affect textiles but also many other spheres of our commercial relationship, and other measures on the part of China are placing the industry in an extremely serious and very delicate situation.
The industry is continuing to exist and defend itself in order to survive and is not asking for protection, as Commissioner Mandelson rightly said in his speech, on which I certainly congratulate him.
It is not asking for barriers, it is asking for the rules of the game to be equal for everyone, and it is asking to be able to play on equal terms.
In fact the situation is changing entirely from the end of the year, and the Commission cannot just note this, observing it as if it was a meteorological phenomenon It has a large number of weapons and tools at its disposal, such as import controls, with which to ensure that the rules of the game are indeed the same, and it can use the defence mechanisms that it has at its disposal.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson, like a British gentleman, wishes to play chess; it is just that his opponent, the Chinese partner, really wants to play another game altogether with totally different rules.
Obviously we can talk here about monitoring, about controls on imports from China, but let us not forget something known as re-export, which is where China sends certain items to, for example, African countries, and those items then come to us as African products, although really they are products made in Chinese factories located in those countries, or actually manufactured in China.

I would like to emphasise something about which too little is said here: the matter of artificial lowering of the value of the Chinese currency.
Obviously this facilitates exports to Europe. This is a serious threat.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Commissioner Mandelson most warmly for his clear arguments.
I had already read about them in detail in the European press.
Now for my contribution.
The future of the European textile sector in the light of China's economic rise is at the forefront of this debate.
Time after time, the Union reveals itself as unable to anticipate China's development adequately.
The reason for this is the Union's inability to develop an unambiguous trade policy.
The European Union is divided into a northern and a southern camp, be it on the subject of quotas for textile products or of the reform of trade defence measures.
It is high time, therefore, that the Member States learned to see beyond their own interests alone.
An initial step in this regard is the recognition by the northern camp that the protection of its own industry against piracy and illegal State aid is not protectionism, and that an effective set of instruments is required for that protection.
The southern camp must realise that China's rise has consequences.
The Union must no longer let itself be caught off guard, as happened in 2005 when the Multifiber Agreement expired.
Europe's industries must seek niche markets in good time.
After all, the options for reintroducing quotas are limited until the end of 2008.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and China set to expire imminently, it seems to me that the questions presented clearly express the valid concerns of industry and those in the sector regarding the impact, in the past and present, of the importing - or rather the massive invasion - of Chinese products into the EU Member States.
On several occasions I have highlighted the fact - and I have not been the only one to do so - that genuine competition and competitiveness for our products in the internal market, more so than in the external market, is assured not only or not so much by a system of quotas, but chiefly by defending the sector from unfair competition.
Such competition is unfair because it is based on vastly lower cost and production conditions.
The added value of Chinese production at that cost is disproportionate, because of well-known production factors that are inconsistent with those on our much more civilised continent.
How can we imagine we can compete with manufacturing where the costs are infinitely lower but where, even in terms of comparative quality, the products are now almost equal to many European products?
I believe there is really only one option open to us, the only thing that can re-establish a bit of what I might call fair trade and sustainable competition: a surveillance system over Chinese imports should be based, in my opinion, on checking that manufacturing conditions are not very different from those our industry has to provide.
We may not be able to demand that labour costs are the same but we can demand that products are definitely made without the use of child labour or in conditions that are shameful or akin to slavery, and that they are made without causing massive damage to the environment, beyond the insufficiently verified environmental safety, consumer safety and certified quality.
A different policy should also be applied to European industries that relocate outside the EU and engage in unfair competition with respect to industries that continue to manufacture within the EU, perhaps through tax measures that counteract the advantage over companies that do not relocate, to achieve a new balance.
To conclude, distribution conditions in Europe should also be monitored more closely, in view of what is certainly going on in Italy at least, where what is actually wholesale marketing masquerades as retail distribution.
(EL) Mr President, we, as the European Union, are being called upon - even now - to redraft our strategy for the important sector of textiles and clothing.
The outlines of an overall European strategy could be drawn as follows: firstly, ensuring improved access for European products to foreign markets, through the greatest possible worldwide convergence of customs duties at low levels; and eliminating customs barriers.
Secondly, achieving effective application of the rules of origin to imports.
Thirdly, giving substantial support, through the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to small and medium-sized enterprises affected by liberalisation.
I think it would also be useful to set up a Community programme to support the sector, especially in the less-favoured regions of the Union.
Fourthly, ensuring that there is an effective way of combating piracy and counterfeiting, given that the textile and clothing sector accounts for more than 50% of the recorded cases.
Fifthly, maintaining and strengthening the trade defence instruments, which are absolutely essential for combating illicit practices which harm competition.
Sixthly, guaranteeing that products imported into the European Union are subject to equivalent safety and consumer protection rules.
As regards China, we express our concern at the application of the double-checking system instead of the extension of quotas to the ten categories of products.
In any case, we ask of the Commission - we ask of you, Commissioner Mandelson - that the system be applied rigorously and effectively.
I also remind you of the 'ultimum remedium' of the safeguards which the European Union is entitled to activate.
To conclude, Mr President, liberalisation of the world trading system does not mean tolerance of unfair competition, illegal trade tactics or, in the end, disruption of the economic and social model.
(ES) Mr President, allow me to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your firmness and on the agreement reached in October with China regarding the system of double control of textile exports to the European Union.
In view of the removal of the quota system, which is concluding this year, the agreement will help, or should help, at least, to guarantee that the transition to a free market throughout 2008 is done correctly.
This is essential for European manufacturing companies, which have already had to deal with huge challenges, as other speakers have said.
The industry and the authorities will have to work together in order to closely monitor the development of trade patterns with China and prevent a repeat of the situation that occurred in 2005.
We do, however, regret the fact that the categories covered by the June 2005 agreement only included eight of the 10 products that were subject to limits until 31 December of this year, and on this point I would like you to clarify what the Commission's strategy is going to be for monitoring the two categories of products that have been excluded from the agreed double control system, which are cotton fabrics and table and kitchen linen.
There is, however, no doubt that in addition to this agreement we will need to continue to act in other areas in order to guarantee that European industry can compete under fair and reciprocal conditions, for example by making progress on the indication of origin marking - although there are the difficulties that you pointed out - or by promoting working, social and environmental conditions in the negotiation of trade agreements.
All the institutions and businesses must focus on R&D, using the wide range of possibilities offered by the Seventh Framework Programme, and we need to anticipate the changes and, at the same time, take into account the effects of restructuring by adopting the social measures needed to support workers.
Finally, I would like to welcome the agreement reached on the occasion of the Tenth Europe-China Summit that you mentioned, through which a high-level working group will be created to tackle key issues such as the trade deficit, difficulties accessing the Chinese market and intellectual property rights.
This is another step in the right direction in terms of improving our relations with China and promoting an advantageous environment for both parties.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is there still a future for the European textile industry?
The answer lies to a great extent with the European Commission.
Last month in Beijing, Commissioner Mandelson denounced the poor safety of Chinese products, the enormous influx of counterfeit goods and the dumping of Chinese export goods.
Quite rightly, he threatened to lodge a complaint with the WTO.
Europe's daily imports from China amount to half a billion euro, and eight out of ten of the counterfeit goods intercepted originate from that country.
As well as from counterfeits, however, the European textile sector is currently suffering from the weakness of the US dollar.
The weak dollar not only mortgages our exports, but also gives an artificial advantage to countries continuing to use the dollar as a currency.
Coincidentally, those countries are situated mainly in Asia, and, not so coincidentally, China is holding on to the dollar.
This is intolerable for the textile sector, which works with large volumes and low profit margins.
Our industry cannot and must not fall victim to a strong European currency.
Hence the need to use the euro more and more in our trade relations.
After all, that was, I thought, one of the reasons for the introduction of our single currency five years ago.
(PT) The consequence of globalisation within the European area is that productive undertakings are the losers and undertakings exporting technology are the winners.
That is all very clearly reflected in internal cohesion.
In the case of the textile industry, the fact that the sector is mainly made up of small and medium-sized enterprises is a disadvantage on the market that represents 6% of total world trade and an estimated turnover of EUR 566 billion.
In addition, many producer regions are suffering the consequences of economic restructuring, so that it is difficult to achieve sustainability in the sector.
European production is forced to compete with that of countries that artificially devalue their currency, do not respect environmental protection rules or bear the costs of environmental protection, that frequently infringe intellectual property rights or, even more seriously, on the social and employment front, apart from having much lower wage costs, do not apply such stringent worker protection measures as Europe does.
It is therefore all the more pressing to make sure that WTO rules are respected and that the Commission is able to monitor imports, not allowing a veil to be artificially drawn over the excesses noted in practice with China as regards textile imports, as has happened in the past.
The Commission must adopt all the measures needed to safeguard the interests of the European Union, including if necessary the imposition of quotas on China, possibly up to the end of 2008, within the WTO legal framework and must also insist upon total respect for the rules of fair play.
European producers lack incentives for research and development and for improving the skills of the labour force, they do not have appropriate access to external markets or an effective means of preventing counterfeiting.
Intellectual property is basic to the added value of the sector and must be defended at all costs in order to encourage production with a high added value.
Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, consumer safety must not be forgotten.
It falls to the Commission to prevent any product that might be harmful to our families from coming into the homes of Europe's citizens.
(EL) Mr President, in Europe, and particularly in Greece, the textile sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Many of these enterprises are developing in the region.
We, as the European Union, have a duty to ensure the viability of the sector within our borders, and to guarantee protection for our businesses against unfair competition and illegal trade.
The European textile sector must become more competitive at international level.
We need to support measures for the modernisation of our enterprises, innovation, research and development.
Of course we must take serious account of the fact that on 1 January 2008 the transition period for quotas on imports of textile products from China ends.
In the wider context, however, and for the sake of European consumers, we shall also have to ensure the enforcement of binding rules on 'made in...' labelling for textile products, and effective application of the surveillance system for imports from third countries.
(FR) Mr President, when I spoke in this chamber on this same subject in July 2005, I said that the lessons we would learn from the textiles crisis would eventually help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy.
I think we have made some progress, but not very much.
Here we are, still demanding more research and development and asking the Commission to make sure that intellectual copyrights are respected.
These are decisive factors but they are not enough.
It makes me think that, instead of being a factor of the growth of trade and economic development, the WTO and its rules act as a brake.
Trade is obviously a source of growth, but in order to be so, it needs to work in both directions.
The textiles issue in fact throws up two fundamental problems: the absence of an EU industrial policy and the question of the European interest.
As regards the European interest, I welcome with some satisfaction the Commission communication entitled 'The European Interest: Succeeding in the age of globalisation', published in early October, which says that we need: 'to have ground rules which do not impinge on our capacity to protect our interests and to safeguard our high product standards relating to health, safety, the environment and consumer protection'.
We will not tolerate third countries that want to operate in the European Union bending the rules applied to the internal market.
Commissioner, let us start by applying these principles to the textile industry.
(NL) Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his clear intervention.
I should like to address two remarks to him, however.
The textile industry is not only important to southern Europe, as Belgium, too, for example, still has a very flourishing textile industry, which provides 25 000 jobs.
Commissioner, the disappearance of quotas for the 10 finished products on 1 January threatens to have serious repercussions again not only for the sectors concerned, but also for upstream businesses.
Taking the example of the jeans sector, if this is swamped with Chinese products, whether or not at dumping prices, the producers of the denim material and of the thread are also directly affected.
Thus, of course, the ramifications are much broader than they seem at first glance.
My second remark, Commissioner, is that the 'monitoring system' currently only monitors the volume of the imported goods.
It would be much more efficient if monitoring were also carried out on the basis of prices - and this a priori, or at the time licences are issued.
Only in this way is a genuinely proactive, preventive approach possible.
Commissioner Mandelson, we should also like you to tell us when the Commission is planning to take action, as this is rather confusing and vague.
In other words, how big do imports from China have to grow and how much do the prices of these imports have to decrease before you actually start to take action?
It strikes us as no more than logical that we obtain some clarity on this, too, in advance.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I find myself in broad agreement with most of the sentiments that have been expressed during this debate.
However, I would at the outset reject Mr Belder's view that we do not have a common trade policy in the EU, and that the Member States are so divided that we cannot pursue a policy on, for example, textiles.
Our experience in textiles demonstrates only too clearly that we do, in fact, have a common trade policy, through which we have been able to bring together Member States with different emphases and different orientations, to weld together their views and to produce a common trade policy in textiles that has been consistently pursued.
There may be differences on the use of trade defence instruments, but through the review and anticipated reform I want to build fresh consensus and solidarity amongst Member States on the use of those trade defence instruments, and notably on their greater use by SMEs, for which I want to bring forward proposals.
Some specific points have been made, for example about the double-checking surveillance which will be in operation in 2008.
The Commission will monitor textile imports from China in as close to real time as possible.
This includes double-checking surveillance and any other monitoring means at the Commission's disposal, such as the TAXUD surveillance, which provides trade data on the basis of actual trade.
In the face of a sudden surge of Chinese textiles, the Commission stands ready to use all the instruments at its disposal, should the situation so require.
However, I would stress that the 2005 deal was a once-and-for-all deal, and the Commission does not intend to make proposals for the extension of the levels agreed.
As such, it is not opposed to more trade, and an increase could be expected.
Should the upsurge, however, take such dimensions that action is justified, this will be based on existing requirements and criteria.
We do rely on the co-responsibility of China for this smooth transition.
China is well aware that it is not in its interests to repeat what happened in 2005.
We also rely on the economic operators' self-interest to avoid a recurrence of 2005.
Textiles are now moving into the same category as any other product, so the usual instruments - including trade defence instruments - apply, with the usual standards.
The issue of EU assistance for the textiles industry has been raised.
Let me make two last points on this.
At the EU level, the Commission has committed over EUR 70 million, for research and development under the sixth framework programme, to textile and clothing projects, while two innovation project proposals have acquired funding within the Europe Innova framework.
As far as the Globalisation Fund is concerned, it is as open to the textile sector as to other sectors.
There have, so far, been eight formal applications for a contribution from the European Globalisation Fund, of which four concern textiles.
None of these textile cases have yet been approved by the budgetary authority.
They are all still being assessed by the Commission services.
Lastly, I turn to the issue of the Euro-Mediterranean, raised by Mr Sturdy.
The Commission has set up a formal Euro-Mediterranean dialogue on the future of the textile and clothing industry, in order to define common strategies towards achieving better competitiveness of the industry in the Euro-Mediterranean zone.
The objective of the dialogue is to bring Euro-Mediterranean countries and candidate countries together, in order to find common solutions for improving their competitiveness.
I look forward to receiving proposals emerging from that dialogue.
I have received six motions for a resolution submitted in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Economic and trade relations with Korea (debate)
The next item is the report by David Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the trade and economic relations with Korea.
rapporteur. - Mr President, this report had to be put together rather quickly, because we anticipated - we even hoped - that the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea might be concluded by the end of this year.
That is clearly not going to be the case but, nevertheless, we are pleased that Parliament is able to report today and we hope, through our report today, that we will be able to influence the Commission's position.
To get to where we are today, some of my colleagues had to work extremely hard, and I would like to thank Christopher Ford from the Trade Committee and Emmanuelle Le Texier from the PSE Group, who worked above and beyond the normal call of duty to get this report prepared in time.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and his services for the good cooperation I have had from the Commission in producing this report, and also the Korean Ambassador, whose assistance enabled me to get an insight into the Korean position on these negotiations.
Historically, free trade agreements between the European Union and Asian countries have been trade-light, despite their name.
I think this could be the exception to the rule.
Korea has shown a willingness and an ability to negotiate a far-reaching and comprehensive bilateral trade agreement.
Korea is a significant player in the region in Asia.
It is now a wealthy country, the 11th largest economy in the world.
Its per capita income is comparable to Spain.
It is an economy that is growing quickly, and trade between our two regions - between Korea and the European Union - reached EUR 60 billion last year.
So it is a deal worth doing, and, if we can get it right, I think it is a win-win situation.
The Korean manufacturing industry, for example, can win through access to European services, enabling Korean manufacturing to expand and to compete more favourably.
We can win, through access to the Korean market for some of our key goods and services.
The timetable, as I mentioned, was originally set for conclusion by the end of this year.
It now realistically looks like May next year will be the earliest negotiations can be concluded, but I am encouraged that, after five rounds of negotiations, talks seem to be getting down to the nitty gritty and seem to be getting serious.
There are clearly still significant gaps between the European Union position on issues like country-of-origin labelling, technical standards for the automobile industry and on tariff concessions for goods.
But the key point is that negotiations are now being conducted at a serious and detailed level.
My main concerns come in the field of, firstly, social and environmental standards.
Even with this delay, the Korean agreement looks like being the first of the new generation of FTAs that we agree.
As such, it can be a template for further FTAs, and I would like to see our ambitions in relation to environmental and social standards raised.
I would like to ensure that there is a dispute settlement mechanism in the Agreement.
I do not believe that we should settle for anything less than the United States have settled for, and they have got a dispute settlement mechanism in their report.
I believe issues like ratification of key ILO conventions and the post-2012 application of any new climate change agreement cannot be left to mere gentlemen's agreements or simply encouraging people to do things.
We have to actually have some mechanism for settling disputes.
I hope the Commission will look at this again.
I also want to argue that the Kaesong Industrial Complex should be looked at sympathetically in relation to such an agreement.
I accept the Commission's approach that, firstly, we have to get the Free Trade Agreement; but if we can get the FTA, before signature we should look at how we can assist South Korea in terms of encouraging North Korea to come into the real world.
The Kaesong Industrial Complex, based in North Korea but run by South Korean companies, is a way of engaging North Korea with the rest of the world, and it is a process that we should be encouraging.
I believe that, through our trade agreement, we can do much to assist South Korea in this process.
It is not just a matter of interest for South Korea but it is a matter of interest for the world.
It makes the world a safer place if North and South Korea can cooperate.
I believe this is an important free trade agreement.
I believe it is one that both the EU and Korea can win if we get the right deal.
I support the Commission's view that we should not rush to a settlement, and that a good settlement is better late than a bad settlement that we get early.
I hope, when Korea changes president at the beginning of next year, that the new president will instruct his administration to work tirelessly to reach this agreement before the summer.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome the excellent and speedy work done by the rapporteur, Mr Martin, and his colleagues and staff.
Together they have produced a comprehensive and balanced report, which I commend.
Parliament's endorsement of this motion for a resolution will send a clear signal of support for the Commission's policy of seeking an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea, as part of the strategy laid out in the Global Europe Communication of October 2006.
The choice of South Korea as partner for this generation of free trade agreements reflects the important economic and political potential of the country, but it is also an acknowledgement of the reality that important barriers exist and persist to stronger economic and trade ties between us.
The motion is timely: free trade negotiations with South Korea were launched in May 2007, and have progressed rapidly so far.
We are ready to work for an early conclusion so long as the substance and quality of the outcome are right.
That is our bottom line and it will remain so.
Our FTA with South Korea should be fully WTO-compatible. That goes without saying.
We seek far-reaching liberalisation in trade in goods and services, as well as in investment.
We are paying special attention to non-tariff barriers and to rules and regulations in key areas, such as intellectual property rights, competition and government procurement.
I fully agree with the importance the report attaches to non-tariff barriers and to effective dispute settlement machinery in this and other aspects of the prospective agreement.
Studies have suggested that, in some sectors in Korea, non-tariff barriers are now more important than the tariffs themselves.
Substantial improvements on these behind-the-border barriers to trade, creating real market access for EU exports to South Korea, will be absolutely key to conclusion of the FTA.
On a few of the specific concerns that have been raised, the question of Kaesong raises complex technical and political questions.
We welcome the amendments proposed in this regard, because they highlight the complexity of the question, which will require careful consideration.
The recognition and promotion of the social and environmental aspects of trade - sustainable development - will be an integral part of the free trade agreement with South Korea.
I agree that effective enforcement of standards is key to securing an ambitious and effective result on sustainable development in this agreement.
However, a cooperative tone can achieve much more in this area than the appearance of coercion.
We expect to cover a greater number of multilateral environmental agreements, and to include issues such as decent work and a stronger commitment to ILO core conventions, and expect to go beyond other recent agreements, such as those covered by the Korea-US FTA.
We will also aim to involve the social partners and civil society in this cooperation.
The sustainability impact assessment has been launched.
The main findings of draft reports in the different phases will be discussed with civil society.
We have set up the SIA to ensure that there will be continuous and rapid feedback into the negotiation process.
This builds on the initial contacts we had with civil society at the start of the negotiations.
We have also worked closely with Parliament.
The cooperation with the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade has been excellent.
I myself, as well as the Director-General, have regularly updated that Committee.
As far as the ratification procedure is concerned, this will depend on the content of the agreement itself, but the Commission is in favour of involving Parliament as much as is possible under the Treaty.
Finally, a possible future FTA covering the bilateral trade relations with South Korea will be part of an overall and coherent framework of EU relations with South Korea.
The existing bilateral framework agreement will continue to govern bilateral cooperation and political dialogue.
To conclude, the goal of this FTA is to complement an ambitious Doha outcome by going deeper and further bilaterally with South Korea.
Past experience shows that such agreements can road test liberalisation solutions and become stepping-stones for the future evolution of the WTO.
An ambitious and comprehensive FTA with South Korea is not just commercially significant, but will also mean an important upgrading of the bilateral EU-Korea relationship.
It is also a recognition of the engagement of the EU on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.
In a wider sense, it is part of our broader commitment to ensuring that EU trade policy in Asia is keeping up with the dramatic development of that region, and securing the benefits in terms of jobs, growth and growing trade for both sides.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy thanks the rapporteur for adopting our proposals.
We think an agreement is reasonable, but would nevertheless point out that there have been considerable sectoral problems with Korea in the past.
I am thinking here of the discussion on dumping prices in the shipbuilding industry in recent years, for instance, where we also had lawsuits.
We wish to ascertain whether these sectoral problems are being resolved in order to ensure that both sides really are opening up and Korea is not the unilateral beneficiary, and that - even when we think of our pharmaceutical industry, the car industry, of the many industrial sectors - reciprocity is guaranteed.
One particular subject was Kaesong.
The Commissioner has just addressed the issue of how to involve these North Korean special zones.
According to what I am hearing, eight other special zones are planned.
In the opinion of the Committee on Industry, international standards must apply here.
We cannot undermine our own free trade agreements in this way.
We therefore ask that this aspect in particular be thoroughly checked.
Otherwise, many thanks - to the Commission, too - for these negotiations!
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to address three aspects.
First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, on behalf of my group.
The report has been written with great care and it actually alludes to all the points that are important and have to be debated.
It also advises on the appropriate caution to be exercised on certain subjects, e.g. in the automotive sector.
In this respect I believe it is an excellent report, which is a good prerequisite and should accordingly be considered by the Commission and the Council.
I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner has responded so meticulously to it.
Secondly, I should like to ask the Commissioner: how will negotiations with Korea generally proceed, in your view?
Negotiations are indeed underway and are at a very difficult stage.
It seemed very much better at the beginning, I believe, than we have thought in the meantime.
Parallel negotiations with all the ASEAN nations are also being added, of course.
These negotiations are also - as far as I have gathered from the Minutes - at a very difficult stage.
What is the Commission's assessment of this?
What influence will our ongoing negotiations with ASEAN have on negotiations with Korea?
My last question to the Commissioner relates to the fact that the Heads of State or Government are just about to sign the Reform Treaty today, 13 December.
Under this Reform Treaty, Parliament will in future have a great deal more influence in the retail sector, for which we in this Parliament have been fighting for a very long time.
I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Mandelson in particular for always having backed this.
My question, however, is this: can you imagine that the Commission will support us when we ask the Council for the right that has already been brought forward under the upcoming free trade agreement and that Parliament will therefore keep the relevant endorsement obligation?
Can we assume that we have you on our side in this, Commissioner?
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would also, on behalf of my group and very formally, like to congratulate the rapporteur David Martin on the excellent quality of the report that he is presenting to the House.
In reality, not all reports are equal.
It is important that, although here we vote on all sorts of documents, we point out when some of them have a content and a solidity that enable them to be examined in detail, and cover all the subjects that are up for discussion.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur and the team that supported him in making this happen.
It is true that we do not talk about Korea very much here; we do not talk about it enough, although it is undoubtedly one of our major commercial allies, and indeed the fourth largest outside of Europe, as the report states.
The European Union is the leading investor in Korea, which is also, undoubtedly, one of the strongest democracies in the whole of that region.
If we consider what I have just said, on the one hand, therefore, and on the other hand the difficulties in the multilateral context and the reality that there are obstacles to accessing the market for European products and services, which are major non-tariff obstacles, it is obvious that this makes it a very clear candidate for a bilateral agreement that has the full support of Parliament.
This agreement, however, needs to be well put together, well negotiated and ambitious.
There are difficulties in very specific areas.
I would highlight the subject of services, which has already been mentioned, and the subject of intellectual piracy, in one of the countries with the greatest Internet penetration in the world, and where, therefore, there are very specific problems resulting from the fact that copyright and rights protecting the audiovisual sphere are not taken seriously.

Finally, on the question of Kaesong: my group is going to support the text as it is in the report; in other words, we recognise and understand the political content of this area between South Korea and North Korea, but we understand that, if free trade with the European Union were simply introduced into this context, it could cause serious problems, and therefore we would not support the simple inclusion of the Kaesong area in a possible agreement with the European Union.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in rising to speak on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in the debate on economic and trade relations between the European Union and Korea, I wish to draw attention to the following matters.
In a situation where Korea has signed a Free Trade Agreement with EFTA and ASEAN and also with the United States, but will not sign such an agreement with the European Union, the competitiveness of European companies taking advantage of duty-free access to the Korean market will decline.
This will have a negative impact on the level of economic growth and the level of employment in EU countries.
Secondly, according to analyses carried out by independent research centres, as a result of the conclusion of a free trade agreement, two thirds of the benefits accruing from such an agreement would go to Korea, and only one third to the European Union.
It is therefore necessary for Korea, in addition to this agreement, to make a commitment to the EU in which Korea undertakes to observe European social standards, and in particular the basic elements linked to decent work, as well as environmental and consumer protection standards.
Thirdly, this approach gives an opportunity to lead on to honest competition between Korean and European companies.
It is only then that Korean companies will include in their manufacturing costs the overall costs of labour, environmental protection and consumer protection, and thus the price of their products will reflect the full manufacturing cost.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr David Martin for his report and by underlining the crucial importance of this dossier.
The EU-Korea Treaty will be the first application of the new EU trade doctrine Global Europe, a doctrine that is highly controversial, not least because it seeks such deep market access conditions through the removal of all kinds of barriers to all-out import penetration, precisely at a time when more and more people are becoming aware that there are very many losers as well as some winners in a completely liberalised global economy.
On the positive side, the report sets out some very good standards for trade and social and environmental fields, which Greens absolutely support, and in that respect I think the report sets a very important precedent for further upcoming parliamentary responses to other free trade agreements, with India and ASEAN, for example.
So we welcome the fact that the report insists that there must be no exceptions to the rule that access to the European market is conditional on compliance with environmental protection standards.
We welcome the fact that it demands that the trade agreement with Korea incorporates binding social and environmental clauses and, to our mind, this by itself makes it difficult to contemplate that the North Korean Kaesong industrial complex would be included within the FTA rules.
Most importantly, it intends to give teeth to those binding clauses by demanding that they are subject to the standard dispute settlement mechanism.
But we do have some serious misgivings about this report as well.
First, there is the demand to scrap all non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade without any attempt at differentiating what really constitutes a legitimate NTB and what does not.
We should not assume that everything that prevents unfettered free trade is an illegitimate obstacle.
There are some very good reasons to qualify trade, especially when public policy wants to put in place controls for social, health or environmental reasons.
We are also opposed to the full introduction of the so-called 'Singapore issues' into the free trade agreement.
Again there are good reasons why total investment freedom or public procurement should remain outside the scope of a trade agreement.
Korea had a devastating experience with the free flow of capital in the late 1990s and they have used sheltered public procurement policies to get back on their feet since then.
Now, it is not up to us to judge whether they should offer those items on their side, but we are allowed to judge for our side, and my Group does not support giving unlimited freedom to foreign investors in Europe or destroying the possibility of engaging in public spending for social goals through specific domestic procurement policies.
(NL) Mr President, South Korea is one of the EU's main trading partners outside Europe, something that is highlighted clearly in this balanced report.
It is a country that arouses sympathy owing to its contiguity with the most backward, most totalitarian communist regime in the world.
Trade relations have grown substantially in recent years, which in itself is a very good thing, but that does not mean there are no problems.
If we conclude a free trade agreement with South Korea, it must be based on complete reciprocity.
South Korea still has far too many tariff and non-tariff barriers for us to really talk of reciprocity.
Europe must insist on the elimination of all these barriers, and must be able to come to agreements that are at least as advantageous as those of the free trade agreement between South Korea and the United States.
(DE) Mr President, as leader of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur specifically and say that I am very happy to back this report.
I should also like to emphasise something that many still do not know: that the Republic of Korea is an important trading partner.
Precisely for this reason it is important that we conclude a free trade agreement. The aim of this agreement must be to achieve fair and equitable trading conditions to our mutual advantage and our mutual benefit.
I can also say that I am pleased that the negotiations have been running substantially better in the fifth round than they did in the fourth round.
I should like to encourage Korea to support EU proposals for the faster and reciprocal abolition of import duties.
The EU's target for this would be 2015.
As we all know, the motor vehicle sector is and remains a challenge in the negotiations.
What we as the European Union expect is that our safety standards are accepted by Korea just as we, too, accept Korea's standards in this sector.
I am optimistic that the barriers in the pharmaceutical products and services sectors, and particularly in the banking and legal advice sectors, can be removed.
With regard to Kaesong, I should like to say that it would be significant for the negotiating partners to find a way of supporting the Kaesong project and other projects, on economic and political grounds, particularly for introducing North Korea to the international community of states.
We are generally on the right track and I hope that there will be a conclusion at the beginning or in the first half of 2008.
(FR) Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Martin for the quality of his report.
When negotiating this future trade agreement with Korea, we would do well to remember that our priority should remain multilateralism, because we know that the excessive proliferation of bilateral agreements is damaging to the regulated multilateral structure that we belong to.
That is why, if we enter a new era of bilateral trade agreements, these should include guarantees and principles, some of which are mentioned in Mr Martin's report.
The future free trade agreement with Korea should be up-to-date and include restrictive environmental and social requirements such as those in the fundamental ILO conventions, which aim to promote proper working conditions.
Moreover, following Parliament's commitment to enable better access to generic medicines, I am delighted that the provisions on public health have been included and that our wish has been respected that any demands that would limit our partners' ability to make use of the flexibilities provided for in the atypical Doha declaration agreement should not be included.
On the other hand, despite its positive points, it is unacceptable that this text makes no reference to the fate of workers in the Kaesong free trade area, as our rapporteur wanted, and I deplore this.
(PL) Mr President, Korea is one of the leading economies in the world, but at the same time it has the greatest difference in income among the OECD states.
Korea is the EU's fourth largest trade partner outside Europe, whereas in 2006 the EU was the largest foreign investor in Korea.
The main problem in our bilateral trade relations is difficulty of access to the market across non-tariff barriers, including a lack of accepted norms and international standards.
A free trade agreement with Korea should include protection for foreign investments, a competition policy, public order transparency and trade facilitation.
We must also bear in mind, though, that this agreement could have a negative impact on the European automobile industry, so the Commission must give careful consideration to the strategy of gradual removal of EU import duties.
First of all, non-tariff barriers on the Korean side must be withdrawn, so that it does not turn out that the sole beneficiary of this cooperation is Korea.
Mr President, I wish to join with the other speakers in congratulating Mr Martin on his report on a free trade agreement with South Korea, which is the EU's fourth largest trading partner outside Europe and the world's eleventh largest economy.
I want to deal briefly with two issues.
Firstly, the opposition of trade union and farmers' groups to the free trade agreement with Korea and, secondly, the case of the industrial zone.
In the first case, we need to place the opposition in perspective.
Thousands demonstrated against the US agreement with Korea and a number of people burnt themselves to death.
Rather than thousands, we have only dozens protesting, possibly because we are attempting to include in our free trade agreement an associated political cooperation agreement - social, political and labour clauses that will help protect labour standards in the south and may well enhance them.
At the same time, we will not have the discussion over rice which Korea had with the United States.
With respect to Kaesong, we are not arguing that this should be included.
We are arguing that we should not automatically exclude it.
That is a rather different position, and I hope that on that basis the Liberals will be able to change the way they vote.
As the former Prime Minister of Jamaica once said, the only thing worse than being exploited is not being exploited.
Some of us had the opportunity to visit Kaesong last month, as part of an EU workshop on economic reform held in North Korea.
I saw thousands of happy North Koreans flooding from the zone, smartly dressed, because they have standards of living six times higher than in the North.
This is an opportunity, politically and economically, to actually change that regime and move things in the right direction.
Kaesong can transform the North and, allowing for the difficulties, should be encouraged and not killed.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me make three brief points.
First of all, on the issue of Kaesong, I think that Mr Ford's formulation - that we should not automatically exclude Kaesong - is the right approach to take.
We in the Commission will be very prudent on this subject, but I think, on that basis, the amendment is probably a worthwhile one.
Secondly, I was asked about the overall prospects for the negotiation.
Well, in this job I have not discovered a trade negotiation that is not in some difficulty.
However, I would say that this negotiation is in less difficulty than some other trade negotiations I could identify.
Lastly, Ms Mann asks whether the European Parliament can obtain rights earlier than the Treaty ratification in respect of this agreement.
When asked about this in a different context, I overstepped my collective Commission responsibility in my enthusiasm, so today I shall be a little bit more careful and simply stress that we will seek to involve Parliament as much as possible.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.

Financial year 2008 as modified by the Council (vote)
- Financial year 2008
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, the second reading budget conciliation between the two arms of the Budgetary Authority was held on 23 November 2007.
Parliament achieved a budget for results on its major objectives: financing for Galileo (EUR 2.4 billion) via a revision of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 200 million); significant further use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 70 million) to finance an increase in the spending on common foreign and security policy (CFSP).
The Committee on Budgets voted its second reading amendments, further to the conciliation outcome, on 29 November 2007.
After the technical check of the figures, a small number of technical adjustments were necessary to ensure full respect of the conciliation outcome of 23 November as regards revised financial framework ceilings and the overall level of payments.
The agreed modifications are the following:
First, in heading 1a, commitment appropriations are adjusted as follows:
Amendment 335:
06 02 09 01 (Galileo Supervisory Authority) to EUR 7 460 000
06 02 09 02 (Galileo Supervisory Authority) to EUR 3 100 000
08 07 01 (Research Cooperation - Transport) to EUR 348 922 000
Amendment 331:
02 02 01 (Competitiveness and Innovation) to EUR 126 300 000
Amendment 69:
06 03 03 (TENs - T) to EUR 955 852 600
Second, in heading 1b, in order to meet the overall level of payments agreed at the conciliation, payment appropriations are modified on lines:
Amendment 27:
04 02 17 (ESF) to EUR 3 823 198 181
Amendment 140:
13 03 16 (ERDF convergence) to EUR 10 606 637 496
Amendment 141:
13 03 18 (ERDF competitiveness) to EUR 2 540 832 078
All these technical adjustments were unanimously approved by the Committee on Budgets on Monday 10 December.
Third, a number of technical/nomenclature changes will be made, mainly as regards pilot projects and preparatory actions.
These changes have been presented to the President of Parliament.
These modifications do not change any figures, nor do they change any MFF classifications.
(The technical adjustments were accepted)
- After the vote:
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I emphasise, before going on to comment on the results of the approval of the European Union budget for 2008, that today is a particularly pleasing day for me, not only as a European, but also as a citizen of Portugal.
I am of course referring to that historic event - the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon - due to take place in just over an hour in my country's capital.
Following the enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States, it is another decisive step in European integration, that will make Europe more democratic, more representative, more flexible and effective in the way it works than it was before.
If I might make a brief and early summing up of the achievements of the Portuguese Presidency, I would point to three important areas of success for the future of the European Union. They are the agreement making it possible for the EU Reform Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, to be signed today, the holding of the EU-Africa Summit and of the EU-Brazil Summit.
To that we might now also add the important agreement we were able to reach on the financing of the strategic Galileo Programme.
Ladies and gentlemen, today we have the second reading of the 2008 budget, the final stage of a long process of negotiation which finally ended very successfully.
I am pleased to report the agreement reached between our two institutions in the concertation meeting on 23 November, that dealt in full with all the budget proposals for 2008 on which we had agreed by that date.
In accordance with the procedures, I must point out that the Council will be able to accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading.
I note, however, that some small adjustments are still needed as regards the classification of expenditure on which the Council reserves its rights.
In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to express once more my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr BÃ¶ge and to the two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€, to my colleagues in the Council, to Commissioner GrybauskaitÃ© and to all those who have helped to bring this very demanding budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion, culminating in Parliament's approval.
Minister, you have uttered, among other things, the sentence I was waiting for.
I therefore note that the budgetary procedure has been completed in accordance with the treaty provisions and the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006.
I also note that, in accordance with Article 13 of the interinstitutional agreement, the Council and Parliament agree to accept the maximum rate of increase of non-compulsory expenditure that comes out of the second reading in Parliament.
Consequently, the budgetary procedure can be declared complete and the budget definitively adopted.
(Applause)
As you know, the President is currently in Lisbon where a small signature ceremony is taking place.
My powers as vice-president end here.
The official signature of the budget for the financial year 2008 will be on Tuesday, 18 December, at the plenary session in Brussels.

Economic and trade relations with Korea (vote)
- Report: David Martin
Voting time
Before starting the votes, Mr Schulz has asked to speak on a point of order.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have this stack of paper in front of me, which gives you an idea of the amount of work we still have to get through this morning.
Some of my fellow Members have nevertheless asked to speak.
I do not wish to start a lengthy debate.
Mr Daul has asked to speak, as has Mrs Muscardini, so I will let them speak for one minute and no more.
(Noise)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I will be very brief.
I was in the chamber at nine o'clock this morning awaiting an apology for the personal attack on the ushers.
As one was not forthcoming I made my statement at nine o'clock this morning, and I am not going to make it again.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been sitting in this Parliament for more than 18 years, and in this Parliament, with my fellow Members, I have always defended human and civil rights and my speeches in the Chamber and questions and motions for resolutions bear witness to this.
I will not take lessons from Mr Schulz because Mr Schulz is not the repository of the truth, either in this Chamber or outside it.
Democracy, Mr President, is a value that must be defended, and this includes showing respect for individuals and groups.
I feel embarrassed for Mr Schulz because he has said things he must feel ashamed of.
The UEN Group is behind all Parliament's officials, and particularly the ushers, who on many occasions this year have tried to defend the right to speech and expression that has so often been denied by a few majority groups in Parliament.
For this reason, Mr President, the UEN supports the ushers, the UEN believes in fundamental rights, and the UEN calls for respect for duties and respect for people.
Mr Schulz, take your own signature off!
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any other group chairmen or women here who would like to speak? I deliberately say 'group chairmen or women' because I am not going to let all 785 members speak on this matter.
I cannot see any group chairmen or women, so this item is closed.
