That would raise two problems: it would reduce the number of work contracts required to comply with the directives, possibly to the advantage of third countries whose existing contracts cannot be reviewed.
It would also allow contracting authorities to operate outside the common rules, with the associated risks.
However, it has been maintained that, even if the thresholds are raised, the number of contracts awarded to European tenderers will not decrease because, below a certain value, it is not economically beneficial for businesses to operate away from their region, still less their country.
A further consideration is the possibility that each Member State and each regional government could apply local rules where the threshold is not reached.
That would mean that the higher the thresholds, the greater the disparities between legislation within the Union. Thus, the rules within the Union would become even less uniform.
In my opinion, whatever the thresholds, we must not allow there to be differing legislation within the Union.
That would shrink, rather than expand the common market; it would also make it possible for individual territorial legislative authorities to restrict access in their regional or national territory purely to local operators.
This should only happen where the matter is not regulated by the directives.
Thus, the general contents of the directives must be included in national or regional legislation as well, and an amendment has been tabled proposing this.
Another major issue is environmental and social concerns.
It has been proposed that the directive should incorporate specific rules governing these areas.
This suggestion has prompted broad, far-reaching debate and could lead to the report being referred back to committee if a position supported by a sufficient majority is not achieved at the vote.
I feel that a law intended to further the internal market' s development in an economic sector and increase competitiveness cannot introduce principles which are not already laid down by the sector' s legislation.
The Commission' s proposal contains sufficient provisions as it is to ensure that all the principles in force on the environment and workers' rights are respected in the drawing up of calls for tender.
This legislation cannot be expanded or altered by means of directives whose scope should be limited to works, supply and service contracts.
The related amendments, adopted, moreover, at the vote by a number of committees delivering opinions and by the committee responsible, seek to introduce new rules.
Were these amendments also to be adopted in plenary, I feel that it would be better to keep the current texts unaltered rather than to have texts which, although more up-to-date, could well mean a step backwards in basic areas.
There is a further issue which these texts cannot disregard but which the Commission has failed to deal with adequately: intellectual services.
The time has come to make a clear distinction between intellectual services and executive services, between design and execution.
This is a difficult concept for certain trade associations to take on board: as they see it, they are defending long-established positions.
However, intellectual activity cannot be considered to be the same as manufacturing something and a company cannot do everything. It cannot carry out both design and execution, except in exceptional cases or where specific technologies are involved.
There are two of reasons for this: works of art are not quantifiable: no two ideas are alike.
The history of Europe as a whole, give or take a century, is full of different kinds of works which have survived the passage of time because of their artistic value.
Not everything, not every service can be compared to a work of art, but the products of the mind cannot be confused with mere execution.
An executing company possesses skills and experience and executive technology and is therefore the most suitable company to design and implement others' ideas on a technical level, but that is all, with a few rare exceptions.
By separating intellectual services from executive services we will be according the professions and the products of the mind their due value.
Joint contract awards, where contracts for executive design alone and execution are awarded together, are appropriate if there are intellectual service providers qualified as such according to the prevailing legislation in the company or attached to it.
These considerations are the basis both for the amendment which makes it possible to award contracts for the design and execution of works either separately or together but requires justification to be produced where mixed contracts are awarded, and for the amendment which clearly defines what is meant by preliminary project paper, final project paper and executive project paper.
Lastly, Mr President, two directives are before Parliament which are essentially similar in that certain specific sectors have been liberalised or will be in the not-too-distant future.
Telecommunications are already considered to have been liberalised and are therefore not being taken into consideration.
The gradual liberalisation of the water, energy and transport sectors, monitored directly by the Commission or, upon request, by the individual States, will allow the second directive to expire without making it necessary to amend the first directive.
Overall, I hope that objective considerations will prompt us to adopt provisions which are specific to the sectors without expanding on them dangerously, provisions which will increasingly further the development of the internal market, which take into account the forthcoming accession to the Union of other countries which have their own traditions and needs, and which will make our rules increasingly uniform rather than fragmented.
Furthermore, I feel we ought to acknowledge that the work carried out by the Commission in its proposal deserves our greatest appreciation.
Lastly, I have to say that I am proud to have helped to develop and, I hope, improve legislation which both contributes to the building of a more united, stronger Europe and also curbs the fraud and malpractice which very often prevail in economics.
Precisely in order to prevent loopholes, it is better for the directives to suffer a setback, should this prove necessary, than to have rules which are too loose.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me take a look at the economic and competitive aspects of public tendering from the point of view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Mr ZappalÃ  has just referred to the fact that, according to the Commission's estimate at any rate, 14% to 15% of the EU's GDP is accounted for by building and supply contracts and contracts to provide services, all granted by the State or by enterprises whose function is to provide services for the general public.
Looked at in terms of actual figures, 15% of the EU's GDP of about EUR 900 billion per annum amounts to EUR 125 to EUR 130 billion, not a small sum by any means.
In this very area of public contracting, though, the internal market has not yet prevailed to any particular degree.
There is a need for change to be brought about here.
The award of contracts across frontiers is still the exception.
Regulations are complex, muddled, rigid, cumbersome and bureaucratic, and the integration of social concerns and environmental issues into procurement practice has not yet been clarified either.
Those, at any rate, are the challenges Parliament itself enumerated in its debates on the Green Paper and the communication from the Commission in 1996 and 1998.
It is for that reason that we must now focus on the economic objectives and those related to competition policy.
Our aim is also to help bring the Internal Market to fruition in this area.
There is a need for clear, transparent rules that do not discriminate against anyone tendering for these contracts.
On the other hand, though, there must also be the guarantee that nobody tendering for a contract can gain unjustifiable advantages for himself.
It must therefore be made clear that standards must be adhered to as laid down by the law on labour, pricing and the environment.
It is for that reason that Mr ZappalÃ  is not quite correct when he argues in his final remarks that the economic aspects should be separated from the others.
You cannot, of course, evade the other standards in order to gain an economic advantage.
That is one of the ground rules that we all share, and it must also be obeyed.
Mr President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has long argued for greater consideration of social and employment standards in public procurement in two ways.
The first is by ensuring that current legal provisions are complied with by all tenderers so as to avoid any unfair competition.
I would ask Members to bear that in mind in the light of what the rapporteur said in his introductory remarks.
We need to note in this respect that it is not a matter of social criteria - putting a question mark over the objective nature of the procurement process - but the very opposite: what matters is to create a level playing field for all those taking part in a procurement procedure.
The second way in which we want social criteria to be taken into account is by enabling contracting authorities to pursue certain social and employment objectives, such as equal opportunities and social inclusion in connection with procurement.
But this is always - again I would stress this in the light of what the rapporteur has said - subject to the strict requirement that it does not distort competition.
This is made plain repeatedly in the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that were in turn inspired by the opinion of the Committee on Employment.
The opinion of the Committee on Employment looked at the different stages of the tendering process and made a number of recommendations for each of those stages.
At the first stage, the need for the inclusion of a reference to the law applicable should become a component of the contract documentation.
Candidates, tenderers in a procedure, should have access to all the information on all social and employment criteria that they should be taking into account.
Article 27 is particularly important in the general directive in that respect.
I would draw Members' attention to Amendment No 129 by Mrs Berger.
It is an excellent amendment, which I hope will be supported by the House.
At the second stage we need to ensure that we have proper compliance with the standards laid down in the first stage and there should be a possibility to exclude people who have not toed the line in the past in relation to those social and employment standards.
Article 46 is particularly important in that respect and I would draw Members' attention to Amendments Nos 82, 86, 87 and 89.
During the selection of candidates and the award of the contract, we need to ensure compliance with legal provisions relating to employment protection and working conditions.
That is Article 53, which has attracted most attention in the discussions inside the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I would draw Members' attention in that respect to Amendments Nos 134 and 140.
I sincerely hope we can reach agreement on one of those amendments in our vote tomorrow.
Finally, there needs to be an adequate review procedure to ensure that these criteria are applied in the execution of the contract.
Amendment No 108, among others, is important in that respect.
I would draw attention to one final amendment, which is important.
It was highlighted in the opinion of the Committee on Employment and relates to sheltered employment.
Amendment No 36 gives Member States the possibility to reserve certain contracts for sheltered employment schemes or sheltered workshops where the majority of workers in those schemes or workshops are people with disabilities.
This is a longstanding issue in some Member States, in particular my own.
I hope this amendment can be adopted tomorrow and we get a clear reference to this in the directive for the future.
That is the main gist of the opinion of the Committee on Employment.
These concerns are all reflected in the amendments to be considered tomorrow.
I hope they will command the support of the House.
Mr President, the environment can of course be protected in a number of ways.
Here in the European Parliament, we try to do this in mainly two ways. Either we try, by means of directives and regulations, to ban or limit environmentally damaging activities; or we try, by means of directives and regulations, to encourage private individuals, companies and public authorities voluntarily to act in ways that reduce damage to the environment.
I should like to say to Mr ZappalÃ  that the time is quite simply past when purely economic criteria could be considered and that the EC Treaty now in actual fact obliges us to take account of social and environmental, as well as economic, factors.
The two draft procurement directives must therefore make it possible for local authorities, county councils and state authorities to procure goods and services in such a way that there are minimal strains upon the environment.
I think the Commission' s proposal is odd in as much as it makes environmentally friendly procurement of this kind impossible.
In the two opinions for which I have been draftsman in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have clearly incorporated the opportunity for taking account of the environment in procurement.
These opinions were adopted in their entirety without any changes whatsoever, meaning that there had been a very strong and clear input from the Committee on the Environment.
I have also been glad to note that the majority of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment have been adopted by the committee responsible.
There are nonetheless a couple of points on which the committee responsible has arrived at odd results. This is above all the case with the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts.
Article 53 of this has to be changed so that it is significantly easier to take account of the environment in awarding contracts. In the second directive of the two - namely the proposal for a directive coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors -the same change is not, however, made to Article 54, which is of course identical to Article 53 in the directive first referred to.
I presume this is an oversight, but I want in any case to draw attention to this and call upon everyone to vote in favour of Amendment No 140 to the report on the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts.
These changes are significant.
The two directives ought, as I said, to tally with one another.
If the wording, 'the most economically advantageous tender for the contracting authorities' remains in place, it means that the contracting authorities do not need to take account of the environment or of life cycles and the interests of society in a broader perspective.
It is therefore very important that we should in actual fact change this wording so that it agrees with that in the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts.
These criteria do in fact form part of the Sixth Environment Programme. They form part of the integrated product policy, and the rules must also of course promote, among many other things, sustainable development in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I cannot fathom the incomprehensible impairment of the existing directive by the Commission, which believes that adopting, for example, a life cycle perspective as an evaluation criterion is not permitted.
However, this issue has been subject to legal proceedings . The Advocate-General has clearly come out in favour of its being my and the Committee on the Environment' s view that is correct, and not that put forward by the Commission.
I am also extremely pleased about the changes made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because sustainable development involves having to take account of economic, social and environmental criteria.
I therefore hope that we shall vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens and the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Mr President, I too would like to start by saying something about the question of whether economic legislation is in some way neutral and capable of being separated from other aspects.
We have an example in the field of the so-called Utilities Directive where legislation can achieve widely different effects whilst appearing to be neutral.
If we say that the Directive applies to operations in municipal hands but not to those that are contracted out, we have then made enterprises with the same purpose subject to completely different legal regulations, and the effects are not neutral.
It was for this reason that a large and cross-party majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which does not otherwise have a reputation for particular concern for social and environmental matters, was prepared to take up these aspects in its proposals.
I would like to take this opportunity to describe some of them clearly, as we did not just have discussions, but also incorporated into the present proposal significant results from the Industry Committee and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Our most important proposal is that, in addition to the provisions of social security and labour law, collective agreements between employers and trade unions - as our proposal still terms them - should also be adhered to at the place of performance.
I believe that the Industry Committee, in order to exclude the possibility of misunderstandings, might also find the formulation "generalised collective agreements" acceptable, especially as the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market opens the door to other misunderstandings.
We must in any case make one thing clear, and I say this with reference to the Member State from which I come. We cannot have elements of the political spectrum there fomenting fears for the labour market on the grounds of the forthcoming eastward enlargement, while some of us in this House are engaged in opening the doors and thus possibly justifying their fears.
We must not leave ourselves open to that reproach.
I also welcome the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s acceptance of our demand that enterprises be liable to exclusion from the tendering procedure if they fail to comply with the provisions of the law on tariffs and other social security and labour law in the State of establishment or another affected country.
We have incorporated in the Utilities Directive and in the draft under consideration today two important items of potential significance to municipal enterprises, one stating that associated or joint companies with at least a 50% average share in turnover shall be excluded from the scope of the Directive.
That is in the text as well.
The other states that the supply of energy and fuel shall be excluded from the scope of this Directive, thus maintaining the current status quo against the background of the varying states of liberalisation prevailing in the European Union, and avoiding the situation I described at the beginning of my speech in which operations belonging to municipalities are treated differently from contracted-out enterprises.
We are also in favour of postal services being covered by this Directive - not all kinds of postal service though, but only those for which there is as yet no free competition.
If my observation on the subject of tariffs is also included in the final vote, and if the points on which I have enlarged are taken into account, then that is a result with which I think the Industry Committee will be very satisfied.
Mr President, I would like to comment on the second proposal for a directive and I shall also take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election.
I would like to inform the House that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously adopted the opinion for which I am rapporteur on 12 June 2001.
This unanimous vote is important, in that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fully acknowledged that the procedures on public contracts were instruments falling under the sustainable development strategy and that the environment should be integrated across all the European Union' s policies, as advocated by the Treaty.
Within this framework, the relevant authorities, which have political responsibility, must be permitted to draw up environmental as well as social criteria that they intend to use in awarding public contracts, whilst, of course, respecting the principle of non-discrimination.
To avoid repeating what other speakers have already said, I would like to draw attention to two points.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposed simplifying the award procedures, firstly by doubling the thresholds above which the directive applies for public contracts and, secondly, it is also proposing to give special protection to small and medium-sized companies by stipulating that the contracting authorities have the power to decide that 15% of the total number of contracts that they award can be granted to small and medium-sized firms.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are no doubt of the fundamental opinion that environmental and social security policy matters should actually be governed by environmental and social security law respectively.
There are, though, exceptions to every rule.
Not, of course, being unacquainted with the ways of the world, we are aware that we cannot carry on this debate on these new proposals by the Commission for a directive on the award of public contracts without taking their social and environmental aspects into account to some degree.
It is therefore quite clear to us that social and environmental considerations of course play a part in this decision, but we are making a very clear distinction.
We are of the opinion that, in the European internal market, the conditions for all who participate in this Internal Market should be equal.
The key phrase 'level playing field' was mentioned by an earlier speaker.
Such a 'level playing field' is of course guaranteed only when the criteria we are trying to add on alongside the economic criteria are already a component part of the tendering conditions and are not introduced or implemented only later, when the tendering process has been completed and discussion has moved on to the award.
This has been the reason why, in the debate so far, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has always taken the view that, in so far as such criteria are also to be taken into account, they should be so under the heading of the tendering conditions and not left to be dealt with when the contract is awarded.
I would therefore like to make it clear that Article 53, which was constantly being addressed and represented one of the main points of discussion and dispute, refers to the award.
That is why the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats will take a restrictive approach when the amendments to Article 53 are voted on.
We want Article 53, as proposed by the Commission, amended as little as possible.
Only then can we guarantee that the possibility of manipulation does not eventually arise, with the authorities that invite the tenders ending up able to use, as it were, criteria introduced into the discussion retrospectively to come to decisions that have quite different backgrounds from those under discussion here and which are informed by objective criteria.
I see this as a quite crucial difference, one that needs to be brought out in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and that has perhaps not yet become completely clear in the Groups.
If I may say just one thing more, we are also opposed to incorporating conditions in the Directive that will in fact end up bringing the internal market to a standstill and causing it to fail, just as we are opposed to leaving those who will later transpose the Directive into national legislation free to include such conditions.
For example, in Germany, my homeland, a so-called 'tariff fidelity law' is under discussion, which will in fact - and I share Mr Kuhne's view on this - mean that tendering will not be on the basis of the generalised collective agreements - which are like laws that one must obey - but rather on the basis of tariff agreements, ranging from regional down to in-house, a condition that will make it possible to put a contract out to tender in such a way that only one enterprise ends up being able to participate in the process.
That smashes the Internal Market to bits.
Such a thing is an absurdity, and one we are not prepared to go along with.
We will therefore vote against such a possibility' s being opened up by means of amendments.
It is, however, very much my view that what Mr Kuhne said on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, namely that there should be no going beyond what is generally binding, is something that could certainly meet with support from me or from the Group I belong to.
My Group has not yet come to a final decision on the threshold values.
We will be doing that in our group meeting before the vote, as there are differing views among us on the subject.
I would, though, like to point out that Mr ZappalÃ  has made a very interesting proposal. I refer to Amendment No 147 which is by way of a compromise in the event of an increase in the threshold values being decided on and is designed to ensure that the fundamental principles of this Directive apply to all contracts awarded under this threshold as well.
One could say at this point that this goes without saying, but the proposal includes a significant innovation, which I think would be a real step forward for the internal market - the justiciability of what we are doing here, and the justiciability of the tendering procedure.
That is at present not guaranteed in all the Member States under the threshold.
I believe that, if this were to be possible, it would represent real progress.
In particular, I ask the Commission to reconsider their attitude towards Amendment No 147 and to inform Parliament tomorrow of whether they might give this Amendment their approval, because I think this could be a genuine compromise on the issue of threshold values.
Finally, I would like to thank most warmly the rapporteurs, principally Mr ZappalÃ .
This is one of this House's most problematic legislative proposals, and you have so far piloted us through its depths and shallows very well.
For that you have my gratitude.
Mr President, let me also congratulate you on your election.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on behalf of my group and thanking him and all the draftsmen of the consulting committees' opinions for the enormous work involved in this report.
We have already been occupying ourselves for a long time with these two draft Directives from the Commission, a good year and a half in fact.
We had a public hearing on this subject a year ago.
I think the intensive discussions and the highly laborious vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it high time that we complete the first reading with the plenary vote tomorrow - which I hope will actually take place.
The many amendments that we have had to deal with in Committee and, to some extent, still have to deal with in tomorrow's plenary session, do not mean that we were not in agreement with the Commission's basic premises.
The consolidation of the previous Directives, and their harmonisation and modernisation, is certainly a very important step.
As far as my group is concerned, in addition to a number of other important topics, some of which have already been addressed, there is a central issue on which we cannot agree with the Commission.
I refer to the new criteria for the awarding of contracts, where the Commission is attempting very substantial changes in content in comparison with the former legal position, and what it is consolidating is not only current legislation.
The Commission's proposal dramatically restricts the room for manoeuvre which was formerly provided for and which is still current law, and does so above all at the expense of qualitative criteria, notably those to do with social security, the environment and health.
In its two interpretative statements, the Commission has itself shown how this room for manoeuvre and rearrangement can today be used without discrimination.
The European Court of Justice, too, has handed down a very good and reliable interpretation of current law in indicative orders and particularly now in the final plea in the Helsinki case.
The Commission appears to find the current legal position unacceptable for political reasons, and it is therefore to undergo massive alteration.
A number of Members will probably be very confused at this point, as much of what the Commission thankfully sets out in its two interpretative statements will, by reason of the new legal position it has outlined, no longer be feasible if we do not vote any amendments to it tomorrow.
Principals, such as municipalities for example, may now only think, in purely egotistical terms, of the immediate benefit to themselves.
The economic advantage must unambiguously be the principal's.
In Austria we call this the 'Florian principle' according to which it is better to let your neighbour's house burn down than your own.
It means that factors occurring to the detriment and cost of another local or regional authority must no longer be taken into account when awarding a contract.
The Commission also wants to prohibit the imposition of criteria relating to the manufacture of a product.
This makes illegal, for example, an invitation to tender that specifies wood products from sustainable forestry or foodstuffs that are grown organically or derived from species-friendly animal husbandry and represents discrimination against conventional providers.
This not only undermines the objectives of the Treaty, for example the integration of environmental protection into all spheres of policy, and also a policy of sustainable development, it also restricts the autonomy and democracy of cities, municipalities, regions and federal territories.
We are then using EU law to prohibit a democratically elected institution such as a city or a municipality from deciding to introduce, or continue with, an environmentally friendly purchasing policy.
I do not believe that this will enhance the European Union's popularity among its citizens.
It is also, indeed, the perspective of Europe's cities and municipalities that leads to a majority of our Group' s advocating the raising of the threshold.
Even in a small community like my own, in a country in which the climate means that building is very expensive, even the mere building of a school goes above the threshold.
The costs of putting the work out to tender are significantly greater.
Yet this amount cannot be cut back because it is still too low to attract tenders from other countries.
It has already been emphasised that the rules of the Internal Market also apply below the threshold values.
I would like, in my concluding remarks, to appeal to the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats to change the position they adopted in committee on tendering conditions, even if only on a few points.
We have brought in differing split votes on my Amendments Nos 134 and 110.
I think, then, that it must be possible on this basis to further improve these points in the Commission's text.
Mr President, it is good that we are holding this debate at a busy time in the House and that we are not just engaging in legal hair-splitting, for the directives on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts are among the most important methods we have for preventing administrative corruption in the most effective way.
We are talking about the most hated and most loved directives which have consequences quite far afield in the national administrations in various parts of the EU.
During the hearing in the committee, I and many others besides me became concerned that so few cross-border offers are made. I think that the most important thing today, following this debate and reading, is that we obtain directives that operate as well as possible, together with an important follow-up mechanism.
There is a lot left to be desired.
A lot has already been said about environmental issues, but I think it is important for us to note that, on environmental issues, we must give public authorities the same opportunity we require the most progressive companies to exercise.
Why should it not be possible to compete in this area within the public sector, just as it is within the private sector?
The Commission says that as much value for money as possible must be obtained.
I want to say, however, that, in this context, it is quite often a question of self-governing local authorities which operate in such a way that, if a mistake is made and people are not satisfied, the latter can replace the decision makers.
The decision-makers want to see good environmental decisions made by their local authorities.
I also think there is something extremely seductive about the argument that, since we have adopted directives on how, for example, we are to promote the use of renewable energy, we should also have procurement directives that encourage such use.
It is a familiar argument, but one worth mentioning.
I share the assessment which says that the Commission' s approach in the proposal is rigid in relation to prevailing legal practice.
There is, however, a difference between the environmental and the 'social' issues.
The basic conditions we have when it comes to environmental issues are relatively uniform, but we have extremely different directives where social issues are concerned.
It is interesting to note that so many of those who have talked about social issues come from Germany.
I come from a small EU country where my experience has shown that, precisely with reference to 'collective agreements' , it has been extremely difficult for Finnish companies to enter the German, and also the Swedish, construction markets.
That is why it is important for us not to adopt provisions that are ambiguous.
The basic conditions are not uniform when it comes to social issues.
We do not know which regulations are to be complied with in this area.
I still hope, however, to be able to send an important signal on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Reform Party, to the effect that if the proposals for increased threshold values are adopted, we shall not be able to support the proposals because, in our view, they limit this area of application still more.
We have said in many contexts that we cannot support these proposals because the whole purpose and whole issue then become meaningless.
That is why I want to appeal to my fellow MEPs concerning this issue.
Finally, I wish to point out that the one compromise amendment that has been tabled is not, in the light of many countries' practice, in actual fact a genuine compromise amendment.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on your election, by a large majority, as Vice-President.
I shall describe a case which relates to these Directives, and which concerns my home city of Helsinki.
Some time ago the Helsinki public transport corporation, being the public procurement authority, put out to public tender certain bus routes and set criteria stipulating inter alia that the buses to be procured were to have the lowest possible emissions; in other words, that they had to be environmentally-friendly.
And so the City of Helsinki consequently opted to procure buses which run on natural gas and whose emissions are very low.
A competing bidder was not satisfied with this, but appealed to the national court, claiming inter alia that the City of Helsinki had selected a bid which was not the most advantageous one economically, in other words it was not the cheapest.
The advocate-general of the European Court of Justice has recently issued his opinion on this matter, which may be adopted as the judgment of the Court.
In fact the opinion of the advocate-general supports very strongly the view of the City of Helsinki that a public procurement authority should have the right to set environmentally-friendly criteria which it will use in its competitive tender, and also to select products in compliance with this.
It is interesting that the position of the advocate-general is precisely the same as that of the Commission's Directorate-General which is responsible for environmental matters, and different from that of the Directorate-General which is responsible for the internal market.
Now I would also like to draw the attention of Commissioner Bolkestein to this decision, which may well in fact become final; we do not of course know this as yet.
These Directives are of great economic significance: our obligation is to enable the rules of the game to be as transparent and straightforward as possible, and competitive tenders to be as open as possible, and also to ensure that public authorities are able to promote solutions which are environmentally friendly and also socially favourable.
To my esteemed and dear colleague Astrid Thors I would like to say that of course social legislation is different in the different countries, but perhaps this is the precise reason why we should also permit a public authority to comply with its own social criteria, and why we should find sustainable compromises between the political groups in these questions.
Mr Vice-President, I would also like to congratulate you on your election.
Like my fellow Members, who have underlined that this was a report of titanic proportions, requiring a great deal of work, I would like to use my two minutes' speaking time to try to put forward what I personally believe to be the essential points, bearing in mind those involved, particularly the local and regional authorities and the citizens.
In my view, the ZappalÃ  report, which was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, improves on the Commission' s original proposal for a directive.
On the pretext of simplifying and updating the existing legislation, the Commission' s proposal does indeed propose to make the regulations uniform, but the main way, if not the only way, it achieves this is through liberalisation and this is something I cannot accept.
Thus, when it comes to using prices as a criterion for awarding contracts, the lowest price is favoured over social and environmental criteria.
I believe therefore, as do other Members, that the stakes are very high.
Given their activity, public authorities should favour employment and sustainable development but decisions are instead based on financial criteria alone.
However, in March 2000, the European Trade Union Confederation pointed out how much importance the Community regime for public contracts placed upon the concept of price, to the detriment of social and territorial cohesion, equality and employment.
As I said, the ZappalÃ  report improves on the Commission' s directive, particularly by raising the thresholds on opening up public procurement contracts by 50% and also by taking into greater consideration the social and environmental criteria.
If adopted in its current form, I think it might represent an improvement on the current situation.
Despite this, it is essentially the approach of liberalisation that is favoured.
In a communication of 15 October 2001, the Commission was forced to put forward the option of integrating social and environmental aspects into procedures for the award of public contracts.
However, this communication is not legally binding in character.
We must therefore go further and approach it in a different way; this is the sense of the amendments tabled by my group.
Within the award criteria, employment, the environment and town planning must be put on the same footing as economic cost.
Of course, my group' s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee' s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow.
Mr President, I too join my colleagues in congratulating you on your re-election as Vice-President.
I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur and all the draftsmen on their work on what may appear to be a very simple topic but, when you get into the detail and analysis of it, proves extremely difficult.
Rather than repeating what has been said already, I would like to deal with three particular points.
Firstly, with regard to raising the limits on when tenders have to be put out for consultation, looking for the 50% increase is important because it has already been proven that the present limits do not allow for greater cross-border interaction between companies and between companies and agencies.
This is because the contract limit is too small and the economic reality underlying this is that to move your operation into another Member State requires extra money and a more valuable contract to make such a move profitable.
There is no point in saying that we should be spending public money merely to prop up a failing or ageing system.
We should be using the money properly - of course to increase infrastructure, to provide better services and to increase local employment as much as possible - but it should not be used merely as a substitute for private and other investments or for other initiatives to create local employment.
The second area, concerning environmental considerations, is another very important question. It is one in which each and every one of us would agree that certain minimum standards have to be laid down.
We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that we put in place proper controls and mechanisms to guarantee that what we pass on to future generations is in a better condition than that in which we received it.
However, that should not be used as an obstacle or a block to development.
There is a happy medium and a balance between both, which must be maintained.
My third point concerns social obligations, and in particular I agree fully with the Members who said that there must be a social return for the contracting authority and its area from the awarding of the contract.
However, it should not be used to prevent the contracts from going ahead or as an extra bureaucratic layer to be put in place to prevent the best possible price from being brought forward.
My last point concerning the qualitative selection criteria.
Of course we must have protections in place to ensure that those who are guilty of wrongdoing, fraud, racketeering and of interfering with Community assets and finances should be excluded from public contracts.
However, I have one concern with regard to the question of a judgment that is not yet final: we are acting as judge and jury in denying somebody a right to be an applicant for a tender without having a final decision or analysis made as to whether that person is guilty of a crime or not.
This is something we must be very careful of.
In conclusion, it is about time that these directives were brought together, that the texts were clarified and that greater certainty was put into the legislative framework under which people have to operate.
But, most importantly of all, it must be seen as a move towards guaranteeing better public services for all people.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your re-election as Vice-President of this Parliament.
The Commission proposes to consolidate and modernise the present procurement directives.
This is with good reason, for they are too complex and too bureaucratic for contracting authorities and industry alike.
Can we realise political ambitions via the public procurement procedures?
This question seems to be at the heart of the long-term discussion on this topic.
Via Amendment No 98, this report wishes to add both social and environmental criteria to the assessment of the most favourable tenderer.
Environmental criteria - a European area of policy par excellence - can be measured objectively by means of management standards and can therefore easily be deployed in practice.
However, we believe that it would be taking matters too far to prescribe at European level that national bodies must take account of social criteria in their assessment.
Social policy is to be established nationally, and that is how it should continue to be.
Furthermore, this amendment would make the procedure considerably more complex, both for the contracting authorities and the tenderers.
It could lead to all kinds of new points of contention and differences in interpretation.
This is why the directive would become just as difficult to implement as the current one.
We wholeheartedly support the exclusion of economic operators that have been convicted of offences.
In my country, there are currently various criminal cases pending against building contractors, and it seems as if fraud is becoming a widespread phenomenon.
This text drives the message home to industry: you do not mess with public money.
Mr President, these two directives are important when it comes to creating an internal market that operates well.
Procurement in the EU accounts for EUR 1.5 billion per year, EUR 40 million of it in Sweden alone.
The figures show the importance of clear and simple ground rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises must be able to compete on equal terms.
If the EU is to become the world' s most competitive market by 2010, small and medium-sized companies need to be given a boost and the conditions under which they operate made easier for them.
It is important to maintain the threshold values in order to obtain solutions that favour consumers and stimulate competition.
In that way, we can increase the number of purchases and create the basic conditions for a European procurement market.
It would prevent protectionist behaviour in national markets and - something which is not to be sniffed at - make it easier for politicians to be thrifty with people' s taxes.
Clear rules must also apply to environmental and social considerations.
The two directives we are debating today are financial directives.
If and when account is to be taken of environmental and social factors, this should happen when the procurement criteria are established.
In that way, the rules for those who submit offers will become clear, and they will know what prior conditions apply to procurement.
It is the tenderer with the financially most advantageous offer to whom the contract must be awarded.
I also wish to agree completely with what Mrs Thors said about her experience of small countries engaging with the German market.
I have the same experience where my own country is concerned.
Nonetheless, I also want fully to acknowledge my country' s extreme uncompetitiveness in the construction sphere, something which also leads to our having high housing costs.
Our goal must be to raise the quality and reduce the costs of cross-border procurement by simplifying it and making it more efficient and widespread.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on your election.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of laws are like our favourite clothes.
If we do not look after them, they rapidly become unsightly and end up being unusable.
They no longer fulfil their purpose.
So it is only a good thing that the Commission has taken in hand the law on the award of public contracts, which dates back to the Seventies, and that we are now engaged in doing justice to the requirements of modern times and of the Internal Market with two directives.
A certain amount has already been said about the modernisation of the directives on the award of public contracts, and I do not need to add anything to that.
I would, though, like to sound a clear warning that we may be improving the law on the award of public contracts in technical terms and making it more manageable, but at the same time causing its substance to deteriorate.
That is what the Commission intends with its proposed text, in which the smoothly functioning internal market and competition sweep all before them.
People's justifiable desires and interests are neglected.
That is something this Parliament must not permit.
Our duty is not to any old mechanism or economic ideology.
Our duty is to the citizens of Europe and their needs, and we are, moreover, obliged to see to it that their taxes are not squandered.
A well-functioning internal market can help in this if it adheres to people-friendly standards.
Public contracts cannot, then, simply be awarded to the lowest bidder.
Social requirements must, as criteria, be no less decisive than consideration for people's health and careful treatment of the environment.
That is why there are amendments tabled by my group, and, in my view, if they are not adopted, it will be impossible to vote for the Directive on the award of public contracts.
Let me give an example. It is, of course, obvious that contractors must abide by regulations on industrial safety and working conditions as well as by all the other collective and individual provisions of labour law.
This also includes adherence to the wage agreements in force where the principal is located.
Without that, we easily end up in a spiral of discrimination and wages dumping at the expense of many workers' families.
Competition in the internal market must not be allowed to be like that.
Competition must not be pursued at the expense of the environment, and so it is perfectly clear that public principals must require the maintenance of high environmental standards.
Let me close with a word on the threshold values for European tendering.
Since the existing threshold values have demonstrably failed to bring about any increase in cross-frontier exchange in the sphere of public contracting, we need have no qualms about raising them.
Speaking personally, I have no problem with the idea of doubling them.
Raised thresholds deter unjustifiably high expenditure on smaller projects, promote greater flexibility in the planning and realisation of manageable projects and contribute to the careful use of money raised from tax.
The public will thank us if we do not oblige their mayors to throw the money out of the window with both hands.
I would like to apologise to Mr ZappalÃ  and also to the Commissioner for the fact that I cannot stay to the end; a party of visitors has been waiting for me since four o'clock, and I really must get to them, although I would actually have liked to stay to hear the Commissioner's reply.
Mr President, at the heart of this debate is the theme of protecting the public interest in contracts awarded by public authorities.
It is also, in the context of the internal market, about encouraging cross-border tendering and working: 15% of EU GDP - that is an important input in achieving public policy aims.
We should be looking to achieve best value for our citizens and a transparent process for those tendering.
But best value can never be based on purely financial criteria.
Price alone can never be a complete measure of what is in the public interest, of what is the most advantageous offer.
I remember, as the member of a local authority, seeing a council waste time, effort and money trying to unscramble a valuable school meals contract that proved to be totally unsatisfactory.
Yes, the price was right, but only the lawyers won.
The goals pursued by public authorities are justifiably, in the public interest, a mixture that includes environmental and social goals.
As long as the playing field is level and the procedure is absolutely transparent, such goals and choices can and should be valid, as the ECJ has recently confirmed.
Such choices, indeed, are a valid and intrinsic part of local political life.
Mr President, it is a happy coincidence that you have taken the chair this afternoon for it permits me to say with what pride it is that I share with you a constituency under our present electoral arrangements as a fellow Member for Scotland.
You have brought credit on our constituency in the dignified and splendid way you have conducted yourself over recent weeks and we are very pleased with that.
In that constituency, as you well know, it is not taken for granted that what is publicly provided or done is bad and only what is privately done is good.
Nor does the Commission take that view.
But, as Mrs Wallis has just said, this debate focuses on the very question of what decisions are properly taken by the public authorities, by democratic procedures on the basis of public choice, and what must then reasonably be left to the market to deal with.
It is crucial for that dividing line to be got right.
Mrs Hautala asked a question which the Commissioner must answer when replying to this debate today.
It is a question which can also be addressed to Mr ZappalÃ , who says that we should only take economic conditions into account, not, for example, environmental or social ones.
If Helsinki or Edinburgh became seriously polluted with diesel fumes, that would give rise to costs.
Somebody would have to pay to clean them up eventually.
To say that is a non-economic cost is simply an odd kind of economics.
So we turn the thing round: we ask who shall decide if the streets of Helsinki or the streets of Edinburgh need environmentally friendly and sustainable buses?
Who can best take that decision?
Is it best taken in Brussels?
Is it best taken in Strasbourg by this Parliament?
Is it best taken in London?
No, it is best taken in Edinburgh or in Helsinki.
We need a decision of that kind to be taken locally.
Of course, we do not want that decision to lead to unfair consequences.
It must be open and transparent.
Who can come and bid for this contract and on what terms can they obtain it?
That is fine, but do not exclude the local authority, the people of a region, from saying themselves what standards they demand of those who serve them.
If that is to be ruled out by European law, Europe will not grow in popularity among its citizens.
We must have this kind of clear responsibility for the public good taken by public authorities.
I would like to hear the Commission's reply to that point.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s proposal for a directive and the report adopted by the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
However, we need amendments that include social and environmental requirements and equal treatment requirements in procedures.
The amendments I have tabled seek to strengthen the role of awarding authorities in monitoring the quality of the tenderers and I would stress the importance of assessing the environmental impact of public and private projects.
I would also stress the need to exclude from award procedures people condemned for crimes such as money laundering, fraud and racketeering.
I want to emphasise this in this House too, for I am sad to say that my country, Italy, is still troubled by the Mafia and, contrary to what the Italian cabinet minister, Mr Lunardi, said, complicity with the Mafia is totally unacceptable.
Mr President, may I too offer my congratulations to you on your election as first Vice-President.
I should like to provide a different perspective on the debate this afternoon.
In this debate we have not heard from the people who are now supplying public authorities across the European Union as a result of the tremendous progress that has been made in opening up public contracting all over the European Union.
So far we have heard nothing this afternoon about the people who are driving the economy forward because they are getting open access to tenders, cheaply and readily available by electronic means.
That applies to businesses, organisations, service providers, manufacturers, contractors all over the European Union.
A few weeks ago I went to see one of those companies in my constituency.
It employs 80 people. Every morning it logs on to the Official Journal.
Five or six tenders are listed there, all for the United Kingdom.
This company does not at the moment have export ambitions but the Official Journal gives it cheap, ready access to customers in public authorities to a standard format.
It fulfils and puts in tenders for them every week.
In this perspective I want to look at the balance between economic, environmental and social issues.
That company in the Black Country in the United Kingdom employs 80 people, that is 80 much-needed jobs, and it complies with every single social requirement in United Kingdom law.
It complies with all the environmental rules in United Kingdom law.
It is perfectly entitled to apply for a contract.
Why should that be otherwise?
Why should it have to do anything else?
This is primarily an economic instrument.
That is what it was designed to be to begin with.
We may want to add to its social burdens - and plenty of colleagues over there would like to do that.
We will have many more debates with Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and other colleagues about adding to the requirements to improve the safety and health of their workers.
That is fine.
If companies comply with that, they should be entitled to apply for contracts.
I want to pick up on Mr MacCormick's points, because methinks he protests too much.
On the question of the Helsinki bus contract, surely it was up to the Helsinki authorities to decide, before they put the contract out to tender, what was the optimum and most environmentally friendly bus that they wanted?
It is not part of public contract to require the bus manufacturers to do an environmental appraisal for Helsinki before they then submit the contract.
If the Helsinki authorities had said that they wanted 100 buses powered by natural gas and that is the contract, then fine, if that is what they want to do.
But it should be done on an open and consistent basis.
Finally, I want to turn to this question of thresholds.
This seems to be the most extraordinary debate.
I particularly refer to one of the opinions from EMAC, in which our colleague, who unfortunately is not here, said he wanted to simplify matters by raising thresholds but at the same time he wanted to allocate 15% of contracts to SMEs.
Does he think that by removing a substantial number of contracts from the public procurement regime, by raising thresholds, he is going to improve the situation for SMEs?
What sort of world are we living in?
This is an area where we want SMEs to compete.
We want local authorities to put in contracts on a consistent open basis that will give our citizens value for money.
We want to oblige them to do that.
Just because they find it difficult, because they think it costs them money - probably because they do not want to comply with all the requirements - they want more discretion to give contracts not on an open basis.
That is what raising this public threshold is all about.
We should not do it.
It will undermine the value of a system that is working well already.
That is what we should be looking at: improvement, not destruction.
Mr President, I too have companies in my constituency that are benefiting from this public procurement regime.
Indeed they are benefiting from providing euro slot machines for public authorities even though Britain is not in the euro zone.
There are lots of opportunities here.
But I want to direct some very pertinent questions to the Commissioner and I hope he will answer those questions in his response.
Commissioner, we need some clarification regarding thresholds, as Mr Harbour has indicated.
I would genuinely like to know what would be the effect on the public procurement market if thresholds were to be increased, and particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises and on consumers.
I would also like to know, as regards our international obligations under the WTO general procurement agreement with third countries, whether it would be the case, as has been established by Commission services, that the US and Japan would actually be favoured contractors and that our EU suppliers would lose out because we would be operating two distinctly different regimes.
I should like to raise questions on the social criteria.
Members have already stressed the compatibility of incorporating strong social progress criteria in award procedures while respecting the principles of competition law and of equal treatment and non-discrimination.
It ought to be possible to combine economic reform and competition policy with strong and sound social justice and social progress principles.
I cannot understand why, if we have a system of transparency and open competition, how we cannot prevent that from being used as a protectionist smoke screen in the publication of tenders.
Why has the Commission not incorporated the full force of good practice from European case law into the body of this directive to ensure that we guarantee the highest social and economic standards in public procurement?
Surely we owe that to our public authorities, to our consumers and indeed to our businesses.
Why has the Commission gone down the route of a voluntary approach?
I hope the Commission will accept the amendments mentioned by my colleague, Mr Hughes, to allow for reserve contracts for sheltered employment schemes.
I hope it will respect Parliament's wishes for a strong line to be taken in this directive, ensuring compliance with core labour standards and permitting the exclusion of those in breach of those standards.
Mr President, my warmest congratulations on your election.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report has far more impact than would appear at first sight.
Annually, thousands of contracts are awarded by public, often regional or local, governments.
At the moment, public procurement is said to account for approximately 14% of the entire European GDP.
However, existing legislation is too complicated and complex, as a result of which, to date, this market segment has been far too much hidden from the benefits of the internal market.
The current report, therefore, cannot afford to miss its target, namely the simplification of legislation and greater opportunities for European procurement procedures.
For these reasons, inter alia, I am opposed to raising the thresholds too high, as a result of which a meagre 8 to 12% of all procurements in the European Union would fall within the scope of this regulation.
In addition, the introduction of social and environmental criteria must be handled with care.
Too many conditions that are too wordy once again make matters much more difficult, both for our towns and municipalities and for our SMEs.
We must realise that they will bear the brunt of this European legislation.
We must bring them closer to Europe and get them to spread the European message.
This is certainly not achieved by issuing an unhealthy number of rules and regulations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my heartfelt thanks and respect are owed to the rapporteur, who has drafted this material with much energy, discipline and intelligence.
I admire him most of all for not losing his Roman cheerfulness despite what was at times a very difficult process.
Many thanks also to my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where we had what I think was one of our most interesting debates to date.
The discussions in this House have also shown that views on threshold values and social standards cut across Group lines, and we can look forward to tomorrow's vote with great excitement.
I see a requirement for the new Directives to be progressive, fair and functional.
We support the modernisation proposed by the Commission, for example with regard to the introduction of electronic auctions and the electronic submission of tenders.
What greatly worries me, though, is that on one point the Directive is not being made fairer.
I am referring here to the issue of social and environmental standards.
It is for the benefit of the other members of my group that I would like to expressly reiterate that the issue is not, for us, that social and environmental criteria have no part to play in the procedure whereby contracts are awarded.
No!
Mr Hager has shown that very clearly. These standards must be laid down in the description of the product.
We want to avoid the situation where, when the contract is awarded at the end of the process and the tenders have been compared and it is clear that tender no. 1 is the best in economic terms, no.
2 is worse, no.
3 is even worse than that and no. 4 is the worst of all, there is then another assessment which establishes that one firm is more socially responsible because it employs more disabled people and another more ecological because it has a waste management system, whereupon it is decided, despite the fact that there was another tender which was better in economic terms, to award the contract to the more expensive firm after all.
That is the situation we want to avoid, for it would run counter to the internal market.
That is why this is such an important point for us, and a Directive with standards of that sort would basically be no use to us anymore.
Mr President, may I offer you my congratulations and best wishes; I know that you will continue to be as efficient as ever in the performance of your duties.
The battle for social and environmental criteria, which was won mainly thanks to the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, proves that the European Parliament still basically supports the European social model and sustainable development, which is the only way to make Europe competitive in a global environment.
The amendments to the social and environmental criteria, which have to be evaluated in tandem, do not impose any new obligations or costs on companies; they merely state the obvious, i.e. that we need to respect the acquis communautaire when it comes to protecting work and the environment.
In the same vein, the position taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that contracts could contain terms to encourage the recruitment of minorities or excluded persons and combat employment, should be adopted unanimously.
Now it has been agreed that employment policy needs to be mainstreamed, adopting this position would confirm that we believe and mean what we say.
I am also encouraged by the new paragraph in Article 7 calling not just for a legal framework for protecting work to be defined, but for it to be aligned with Convention No. 94 of the International Labour Organisation and the directive on the secondment of employees.
Meeting minimum labour standards in international conventions is one of the fundamental obligations of the developed countries in the European Union.
Another question which we addressed was the question of thresholds.
I think that, in doing away with thresholds, we really have warded off the danger of excluding small and medium-sized enterprises from the market, which is, of course, what would happen if they had to compete, with the complex procedures in the directive, with large companies at Community level.
This amendment therefore helps employment and helps companies to remain viable.
Finally, I call on the Commission to include other means in procurement by electronic means, not just the electronic auctions which are held on the market.
By which I mean certain models of public procurement, such as electronic catalogues, electronic government purchasing methods and a series of corresponding electronic means used by companies.
Mr President, procurement policy is a very important means of leading social development in the direction of sustainability.
Local authorities and state organisations must therefore naturally be entitled to take account of the environment, the working environment and social goals when they procure goods and services.
This is a right, Mr Harbour, and not a duty, even if you repeatedly try to present it as such.
It is a right that local authorities must be given, with due attention having to be paid, of course, to ensuring that there will be no question of a distortion of competition.
The EU has, of course, some splendid objectives in both the environmental and social areas but, if we do not integrate these objectives into all EU legislation, then little progress will be made and we shall not get anywhere.
The public sector must be able to make environmental demands of the products it purchases, and it is particularly important to emphasise in this connection that it must be able to impose requirements upon such products throughout their whole life cycles.
It is surprising that the EU' s own eco-label has been given so insignificant a place in the Commission' s proposal and, when the public sector prepares technical specifications, it must naturally be able to refer to the EU' s own eco-label.
By means of a number of amendments, we have tried to integrate social and environmental considerations. I hope that, this time round, the Commission will take a positive view of this.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , for the considerable amount of work he had done on this most complicated and important issue, as many Members have said this afternoon.
In May 2000, the Commission adopted two proposed directives designed to simplify and modernise Community public procurement rules.
Those proposals contain significant new developments to adapt the directives to modern procurement requirements.
In the interest of simplification, the Commission has proposed a recasting of four existing directives merged into two new ones.
I note that Parliament has taken advantage of this recasting of the four directives to question the Community acquis in areas where the Commission has not proposed any changes.
I refer here in particular to the amendments raising the thresholds, which will significantly reduce the directives' scope, above all - may I say to Mrs McCarthy - with respect to small and medium enterprises.
If those proposals were to be adopted, the Commission would have to give serious thought as to whether the proposal should be retained at all.
Many of the amendments put forward will help make an important contribution to better procurement and are to be welcomed.
The Commission supports those amendments which add to the simplification and modernisation process. They are Amendments: Nos 1, 3, 167, 141, 4, 13, 16, 17, 24, 28, 34, 36, 174, 40, 50, 128, 53, 79, 80, 85, 88, 97, 109 - to the extent that it concerns production processes - and 112.
The Commission can also accept the substance of a number of amendments, subject to some drafting changes, namely Amendments Nos 2, 10, 42 in part, 45, 46, 47, 123, 52 in part, 93 and 95 in part, 109, 110 and 154 concerning the extent to which environmental considerations can be taken into account at different stages of an award procedure.
Similarly, Amendments Nos 11, 15, 48 in part, 51, 129, 52, 86, 87, 124, 89, 100 in part, 110 and 164 concerning the need to ensure that tenderers comply with employment law, can be included in the directive in an appropriate form.
That is also partially the case for Amendment No 163 concerning information on sub-contracting.
Various amendments designed to address the increasing centralisation of procurement are also acceptable, subject to some redrafting, namely Amendments Nos 5, 6, 20 in part, 126, 21, 41, 168, 172 in part and 175.
In a similar vein, Amendment No 38 concerning consortia formed by contracting authorities and Amendments Nos 39 and 40 are also acceptable.
A number of amendments add to the broad range of electronic means available to contracting authorities, namely Amendments Nos 23, 54 and 65 concerning reverse electronic auctions, as well as Amendments Nos 74 and 104, which deal with the integrity and confidentiality of data supplied by operators.
Concerning confidentiality of data, part of Amendment No 31 can be accepted, though Amendment No 77 would then be superfluous and would have to be rejected.
Various amendments concerning the competitive dialogue, in particular as regards payment of participants, can be taken into account, more specifically Amendments Nos 9, 56, 57 in part, 58 in part, 137 in part, and 138.
Various amendments which I would describe as explanatory and which deal with a range of subjects are also acceptable, namely Amendments Nos 7, 125 in part, 18, 142, 26, 30, 35, 46 in part, 70, 113, 114, 121, 132, 153, 169, 170 and 171.
Subject to drafting changes, the substance of Amendment No 147 concerning the applicability of the Treaty below the thresholds is also acceptable, if placed in a recital.
On the other hand, the Commission has no alternative but to reject amendments which call into question the Community acquis, detract from modernisation of the directives or make the regime more complex.
Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following amendments:
Amendments to raise the directives' thresholds - as I said earlier - by 50%, the effect of which would be to remove from the scope of the directives a large number of contracts currently covered, namely Amendments Nos 32, 33, 67, 130, 101, 105 and 106.
The unfortunate consequences of these amendments are not alleviated by Amendment No 147, however good its intentions.
In fact, the raison d'Ãªtre of the directives is not in itself sufficient without the detailed procedural rules of the directives to guarantee uniform and legally certain application and to safeguard the rights of economic operators through efficient remedies.
Amendments introducing new exceptions to the scope of the directives without appropriate justification, the effect of which would be to remove a number of public contracts from Community competition, namely Amendments Nos 37, 38 in part, 122, 136, 150 and 157.
Amendments which undermine the very objective of public procurement rules, which is to ensure that public purchasers do not allow their decision to be influenced by non-economic considerations, namely Amendments Nos 12, 14, 98, 134, 140 and 166 concerning award criteria which allow for the possibility of using non-economic - and in particular social and environmental - criteria.
Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement, namely Amendments Nos 70 in part, 73, 75, 102, 103, 115, 117 and 131.
Amendments imposing disproportionate requirements on SMEs through the regulation of subcontracting and other requirements, namely Amendments 42, 48 in part, 49, 76, 100 in part, 116, 133, 152 and 159.
Amendments which reduce transparency in calls for competition, in particular Amendments Nos 62, 68 and 78, and which extend the scope to negotiate, namely Amendments Nos 57, part of 61, 66 and 151.
Amendments which restrict the use of framework agreements with no apparent justification, namely Amendments Nos 25, 27, 135, 139, 63, 64 and 158.
Amendments introducing environmental considerations into award procedures in a manner incompatible with the directives, namely the part of Amendment No 45 concerning eco-labels, No 92 concerning the selection stage and No 109 regarding the definition of technical specifications and their compatibility with the environment.
Amendments which are not compatible with the flexible nature of the competitive dialogue, in particular Amendments Nos 55, 58 in part, 59, 60 and 160.
Amendments containing additional cases where persons convicted of certain offences would face mandatory exclusion; in the proposed mechanism, only those cases subject to criminal sanctions in all Member States should be included.
It is not, therefore, possible to take account of some of these cases, namely Amendments Nos 81, 82 and 83.
On the other hand, some of these cases are already covered by the optional exclusions contained in Article 46(2).
Amendments Nos 84 and 90 should also be rejected, since they could lead to a situation where it is not possible to contract with a company which is trying to re-establish itself financially.
Amendments which are superfluous or likely significantly to change the effect of other provisions in the directives without good reason, namely Amendments Nos 8, 19, 20 in part, 22, 29, 30 in part, 43, 127, 44, 45 in part, 55, 59, 60, 69, 70 in part, 71, 72, 94, 96, 108, 111, 143, 156, 162, 172 in part and 173.
Amendments which, without justification, detract from the powers delegated by the legislator to the Commission under existing law, namely Amendment No 107.
The last category of amendments not acceptable to the Commission as regards the first proposal are those amendments which remove clarificatory changes designed to create greater legal security, namely Amendment No 99 on the weighting of award criteria, Amendment No 100 on abnormally low tenders as a result of State aid, Amendments Nos 144, 145, 146, 148 and 149 modifying the definition of works contracts, and Amendment No 161 on the principles governing time limits.
That is it as far as the first directive is concerned.
As regards the second directive, the so-called Utilities Directive, it is the second proposal adopted by the Commission in May 2000.
Besides the objectives of simplification and modernisation, which I just mentioned, this second proposal is particularly aimed at reviewing the scope of the directive in the light of ongoing or future liberalisation of the sectors concerned.
This proposal is also a recasting of the existing texts, with the proposed changes incorporated in a single text.
I can only repeat the misgivings caused, in particular, by the proposed amendments concerning the threshold values.
Many of the amendments put forward will help make an important contribution to better procurement and are therefore to be welcomed.
The Commission supports the amendments consistent with the line it has taken, such as Amendments Nos 2, 7, 21, 37, 43, 47, 95, 111 and 116.
The Commission can also - although somewhat reluctantly - accept Amendment No 29, given the large consensus on this amendment in both Parliament and Council.
Subject to drafting changes the Commission can equally accept the substance of a large number of amendments:
Amendments Nos 3, 18, 34 in part, 35, 36, 38, 40, 64, 87, 89, 92, 96, 99, 101, 118 and 119 concerning technical specifications, the possibility of taking environmental concerns into account at various stages of an award procedure and means of proving technical and financial capacity.
Amendments Nos 4, 9, 44 in part, 56, 90 in part, 93, 97 in part, and 108 in part concerning observance of other legislation, in particular social legislation, clauses relating to the execution of contracts and provisions concerning sub-contracting.
Amendments Nos 57, 59, 60 and 109 concerning exclusion criteria are acceptable in part to the extent that obligatory exclusions are limited to contracting entities which are public authorities and that the list of grounds for obligatory exclusion corresponds to that provided for under the Public Sector Directive.
Amendments Nos 66 in part, 67, 68, and 69 regarding simplification of the provisions on mentioning the relative weighting of award criteria.
Amendment No 70, depending on language versions as changes are not required for certain of them, concerning abnormally low tenders.
Amendment No 76 on the coal and solid fuel sector is acceptable to the extent that it requires voluntary application of Directive 94/22 to be taken into account for the purposes of Article 29, however without such voluntary application being associated with any legal presumption.
Amendments Nos 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, and 86 concerning increased transparency on remedies.
Subject to acceptance of the substance of the Commission's proposal on Article 29 the Commission could also support Amendments Nos 13 and 16 concerning transferral of entities offering postal services from the Public Sector Directive to the Utilities Directive.
The objective of allowing economic exploitation of coal-generated heat at the heart of Amendment No 15 will be taken into account through the acceptance of Amendment No 29.
As drafted the amendment is not acceptable as it would have quite different effects from those intended.
Concerning the issue of contracts awarded between related entities, Amendment No 27 is acceptable in part, as far as the possibilities of awarding service contracts to newly created, affiliated undertakings and of awards of certain service contracts to a joint venture are concerned.
Amendments Nos 51 and 75 concerning preservation of confidentiality in respect of information forwarded by electronic means are acceptable.
Various amendments which I would describe as clarificatory and which deal with a range of subjects are also acceptable, namely Amendments Nos 22, 30, 53, 113 in part, and 117.
On the other hand the Commission has no alternative but to reject amendments which question the Community acquis, and which detract from modernisation of the directives or make the regime more complex.
Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following:
Amendments to raise the directive's thresholds by approximately 50%, the effect of which would be to remove from the scope of the directive a large number of contracts currently covered or otherwise greatly reduce transparency; namely Amendments Nos 20, 46, 72, 102, 105 and 107.
Amendments introducing new exceptions to the scope of the directives without appropriate justification, the effect of which would be to remove a number of contracts from Community competition; namely Amendments Nos 6, 19, 24, 25, 26, parts of 27, 28, 45 and 84.
Amendments which would substantially change the conditions provided for in Article 29 and Annex X for the Commission to grant legally binding exemptions in the case of liberalisation having resulted in effective competition or which would create inconsistencies between this directive and other Community legislation: Amendments Nos 31, 58, 76 insofar as its inclusion in Annex X would create a legal presumption, and 77.
Those amendments which undermine the very objective of public procurement rules, which is to ensure that public purchasers do not allow their decision to be influenced by non-economic considerations; namely Amendments Nos 8, 17, 65, 94, 104, 110 and 122 concerning award criteria which allow for the possibility of using non-economic criteria, in particular social or environmental criteria.
Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement; namely Amendments Nos 49, 50, 73, 74 and 103.
Amendments imposing disproportionate requirements on SMEs through regulation of subcontracting, in Amendments Nos 32, 41, 42, and amendments introducing social considerations into award procedures in a manner incompatible with the directive, namely Amendments Nos 33, 55, 62, 63, 71 and 88.
Amendments on technical specifications either introducing environmental considerations in a manner incompatible with the directives or introducing improper requirements concerning equivalence of technical solutions; namely Amendment No 34 for the part concerning eco-labels, 36 for the part concerning costs, 39, 91, 98 and 100.
Amendments which are not compatible with the flexible nature of this directive, which is applicable to both public and private commercial entities, and amendments transferring provisions from the public sector directive without good reasons, namely Amendments Nos 10, 11, 52, 54, parts of 59, parts of 60 and Amendment No 61.
Amendments which are superfluous, would create significant legal uncertainty or are likely significantly to change the effect of other provisions in the directives without good reason; namely Amendments Nos 1, 5, 12, 14, 23, 48, parts of Amendment No 66 on the weighting of award criteria, 106, 112, 114, 115, 120, 121, 123 and 124.
In my reply to Parliament and in view of the fact that Parliament deserves to have the opinion of the Commission on all the amendments which have been tabled, I see that I have been speaking for 24 minutes.
I have some replies to question put to me during the debate but I fear that would take me far beyond the time allotted so I really am in your hands as to what you want me to do.
May I suggest that I try to briefly answer the various questions that have been put and if you think I am speaking too long, please tell me so.
Thank you for your comprehensive explanation.
Perhaps you could offer us the answer in writing but summarise the main points.
In reply to Mr ZappalÃ , I should like to say that the current definition of works contracts explicitly provides that such contracts may be for the sole construction or cover of both design and construction.
To change that approach would in particular prevent or, at the very least, greatly hamper use of turnkey projects, public/private partnerships, works concessions and competitive dialogues.
The Commission is, therefore, opposed to imposing a separation between the design and the execution of works.
In reply to Mrs SchÃ¶rling, the Commission has proposed including as possible award criterion the environmental characteristics of a product or service, provided that they present an advantage to the contracting authority.
That criterion allows a public purchaser to evaluate the intrinsic qualities of the product or service and to award contracts to the most economically advantageous tender.
The proposed amendments go further, in allowing more general environmental considerations such as the long-term effects on the environment of the products or services purchased to be taken into account at the award stage.
Such considerations are not measurable; they cannot assist in an evaluation of the intrinsic qualities of the product or services and are therefore inappropriate at the award stage.
In reply to Mr Rapkay and Mr Hughes, the purpose of the public procurement directives is to coordinate the procedures for the award of contracts and not to state which obligations - social or otherwise - private contractors must comply with once a contract is awarded.
Contractors are in any event required to comply with all applicable laws and obligations, whether social in nature or not.
However, the Commission is willing to state in the recitals of the directives that tenderers must comply with applicable social rules, including collective agreements of general application in performing public procurement contracts.
The Commission also agrees that contracting authorities should be required to state in the contract documents the body from which information on applicable social obligations can be obtained.
In reply to Mrs Hautala, I should like to say that regarding the preliminary reference currently before the Court of Justice, the Commission has taken note of the conclusions of the Advocate-General.
However, those conclusions cannot prejudge the judgment itself.
In addition, having regard to the content of the communication on the environment and public contracts, the Commission - as it explained at the time of the Court hearing - does not see an obstacle to the emissions criterion being taken into account where this involves - as the case of the city of Helsinki has shown - an external cost to the purchaser itself.
The Commission will, therefore, wait for the Court's ruling and reconsider interpretation in the light of the judgment and, if necessary, will consider revising its position on the amendments from the European Parliament.
I should like to reply to Mr Lehne but, as he has left the Chamber, I shall skip that part of my reply.
Commissioner, it is true that Mr Lehne is not here, but please feel free to respond anyway.
Your responses will then be conveyed to Mr Lehne.
This is a broad debate which reaches much further than the people involved.
Mr President, the Commission is always pleased to assist Members of Parliament in forming their opinions.
May I therefore say that if Mr Lehne had been present I would have said the following - and I am, of course, willing say it even though Mr Lehne is not here.
Mr Lehne stated that social and environmental clauses must be introduced in the tender documents themselves and should not influence the choice at the award stage.
Therefore, I would support his view that Article 53 on award criteria should not be modified.
Such considerations may be taken into account at the appropriate stage, either in the tender documents or in the contractual clauses.
I cannot support Amendment No 147 by Mr ZappalÃ , since it will not provide any legal certainty to economic operators.
May I end my reply to Parliament here and conclude by saying that there is now a real need to ensure that our public procurement rules remain relevant to increasingly sophisticated procurement requirements.
That is why Parliament and the Council must now press ahead to ensure that these directives are adopted at the earliest opportunity.
Mr President, I am sorry for having spoken for fully half an hour, but I feel that Parliament is entitled to a complete response to the many amendments tabled.
The Commission awaits the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, in view of the importance of the matter, I would just like to ask the Commissioner to clarify something.
In any case, I would like to thank him for all his comments, which were certainly important from my point of view, although I do maintain - and I will do so tomorrow - that Parliament should have the autonomy to decide on a political basis rather than on the basis of other factors.
However, his response regarding Amendment No 147 does not make sense at all: while the Commission is against raising the thresholds - which, as was said during the hearings, meetings and debates within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I believe is because it wants the directives on works contracts to be applied as widely as possible - according to what the Commissioner has just said, raising the thresholds would actually reduce the number of works contracts.
Now then, Amendment No 147 seeks specifically to open up works contracts to competition, and I cannot understand why the Commission is opposed to this.
I would be grateful to the Commissioner if, either now or later in private, by some means or other, he could explain to me what part of Amendment No 147 is unacceptable.
It is important, Mr President, for this is no trivial matter.
I repeat, if it is not appropriate to do so now because it is time to suspend our work or move on to something else, I am quite prepared, if the Commissioner agrees, even to meet him afterwards so that he can explain to me what is wrong with Amendment No 147, which, as I see it, ensures that absolutely all works contracts, of whatever type, can be governed by European legislation.
Mr President, I shall try to be brief.
Until 1971 the only rules and principles applicable to public procurement were those enshrined in the Treaty itself, and in particular the provisions of Articles 28 and 49.
However, experience has shown that the genuine opening up of markets and the creation of a real and efficient internal market required that those rules and principles be clarified through detailed provisions coordinating national procedures.
To revert to the legal situation of the 1970s - and this would be the result of the proposal just made and enshrined in Amendment No 147 - is not acceptable, especially in a proposal aimed at modernising the legislation.
Moreover, to do so would also deprive economic operators of one of the most important advances in the field of public procurement, namely the possibility of enforcing their rights through efficient legal remedies guaranteed through the two specific directives which govern remedies in respect of contracts falling within the scope of the public procurement directives.
Therefore, the introduction of Amendment No 147 simply does not make the amendments aimed at raising thresholds throughout the directive acceptable.
There is still some misunderstanding.
I believe we can find a bilateral means of solving this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Ozone in ambient air
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0454/2001) by Mr Davies, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to ozone in ambient air [PE-CONS 3658/2001 - C5-0524/2001 - 1999/0068(COD)]
Mr President, I had not followed the last report in any detail but if Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is in the same sort of mood as Commissioner Bolkestein, I am glad I am not tabling any amendments today.
On a complete change of note, a few weeks ago I was reading to my daughter, Kate, from A Christmas Carol by the 19th-century British author Charles Dickens.
Scrooge sat in his counting house, he wrote.
"The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air."
It must be a great cause for cheer in European cities today that we no longer have to breathe that "palpable brown air".
It is a sign of environmental progress and achievement that air quality now is better than it has been for centuries.
But there is more yet to be done, and in its Clean Air for Europe programme the Commission has identified particulates and ozone as two priorities for action.
Ozone pollution contributes to the premature death of tens of thousands of people each year; it causes breathing difficulties, coughs, headaches and eye irritation.
The World Health Organisation has not been able to identify a threshold below which there are no effects.
It can also damage vegetation, reduce crop yields and stunt the growth of forests and, like acid rain, it can eat into and destroy the fabric of buildings and works of art.
And so we have this draft directive to address the problem.
It started out as a remarkably weak proposal, the key element of which was to set targets for 2010 for the maximum number of exceedances above WHO guidelines, but these targets would not have been binding on Member States.
It also called for the preparation of short-term action plans to deal with acute problems and for more public information and health alerts.
During the course of the past two years, Parliament has been able to use its codecision powers to give this legislation some teeth.
We have strengthened the public's right to information.
We have made it easier for recalcitrant countries to be named and shamed into improving their performance.
We have ensured that damage to materials is included amongst the criteria for consideration.
We have re-emphasised our wish to see long-term reductions in ozone levels achieved by 2020 in line with the National Emissions Ceilings Directive proposals.
But above all, we have addressed the issue of the non-binding short-term targets.
Instead of Member States having to work to achieve these "as far as possible", which was the original proposal, we have insisted that effective measures shall be taken unless the targets cannot be achieved by "proportionate measures".
I want to emphasise that we agreed this wording because both the Commission and our own legal services advised us that it would make the provisions of the directive enforceable and that Member States could be taken to the European Court of Justice if they failed to take such measures.
In other words, we have used our codecision powers to transform a statement of good intent into a legally binding commitment.
Even so, the European Environmental Bureau has criticised us, asking: "Why do we need a directive at all if the 2010 targets are not fully binding?"
But this misunderstands the nature of ozone pollution.
It is hugely transboundary.
While peak exceedances are falling across Europe, the average level is continuing to rise, almost certainly as a result of pollution generated far from our shores.
I do not believe that Spain, or Italy, or Germany, or any of us should face the prospect of legal sanctions because they are being polluted from China.
That would not be fair and it would not be realistic.
I want Member States here to be required to do all that they can realistically to meet the targets, no more and no less.
I think that "palpable brown air" gave a lot of character to the story of Scrooge.
But it is not appropriate now.
Perhaps I will ask my daughter, Kate, if she will write a 21st-century version featuring clean air.
However, with the assistance of the Commission and the last Belgian Presidency, Parliament has been able in the meantime to use its negotiating powers to turn a simple wish list into a requirement for our various governments to take action which will significantly improve air quality across Europe.
We have secured greater changes and a more ambitious directive than we could reasonably have expected when the draft was first proposed.
We can be proud of what we have achieved.
Mr President, the directive on ozone in ambient air is intended to provide a response to the problem of tropospheric ozone produced and trapped in the air around the earth' s surface which, as we all know, has damaging effects on both human health and on the planet' s vegetation, ecosystems and on the environment as a whole.
The concentration of ozone, as we know, is due to the accumulation in the atmosphere of precursor agents, but there is no easy solution, of course, to eradicating them, because these precursor agents sometimes act to reduce ozone in the atmosphere.
Various measurements taken at national level have shown that, in climatic conditions such as high luminosity and a stable atmosphere, reducing the precursor agents does not produce the desired effect of reducing the concentration of ozone.
In fact, it does the complete opposite.
Therefore, the solution to the problem of ozone concentration is extremely complex and simply shutting off the sources that generate precursor agents is not an appropriate measure. An example of this would be closing down a factory chimney that emits smoke, which is a precursor agent of ozone, into the atmosphere.
The rapporteur and various members of the Committee on the Environment - including myself - have been working intensely for almost two years to both improve the Commission' s proposal, which was undoubtedly necessary, and also to achieve a balanced proposal that would ensure maximum compliance by the Member States.
Lastly, in October, a joint text was produced, which was then approved by the Conciliation Committee.
I should like to emphasise a very positive aspect of the proposal that has been adopted, which is the combination of long-term objectives with a short-term approach to these high-risk situations, and all the measures designed to ensure rigorous control and monitoring of ozone levels in the atmosphere in all Member States.
I also think it is important to apply the principle of transparency where information is concerned, since the population must be more and better informed about the incidences of ozone levels in the atmosphere.
Another important aspect is the consideration of meteorological conditions and comparisons between the various Member States, which must lead to information being provided so that we can monitor developments in this issue in the various Member States.
This directive represents a major step in the right direction, providing a balanced approach to the problem of contamination and, together with the directive on national emission ceilings, we feel that these will genuinely prove to be very important tools with which we can address environmental problems and especially the problem of contamination in a cross-functional way.
Mr President, thank you first of all to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and Mr Davies for the good work they have done on this matter.
Specifically where ozone is concerned, we are of course in an odd situation.
High up in the atmosphere, the ozone layer is too thin, which causes problems, including health problems. Down here on earth, on the other hand, the concentration is, of course, far too strong.
I think, however, that we have obtained a good result from the conciliation negotiations and, in actual fact, probably a better result than many of us had dared to hope for when we listened to some of the Member States' negative attitudes towards solving the air quality problem with which we are concerned here.
Together with the Directive on National Emission Ceilings, for which Mrs Myller, here beside me, was rapporteur, this directive makes an important contribution to securing a lower concentration of ozone in Europe and, especially, in the large cities of Europe.
I think it is good that we have been given a starting point in the form of the WHO' s assessments of the existing risks to health and to the environment.
We have got some partial goals established, or target values for 2010, and these must be met.
However, it is naturally cause for concern that, for many years, we shall be obliged to accept that the WHO' s thresholds are being exceeded to a certain extent on a certain number of days per year.
I therefore think it good that we also obtained agreement to there having to be some more long-term objectives, in terms of which the WHO' s target values must be complied with.
What was agreed was not quite so precise as we should have liked here in Parliament.
A reference point was set for 2020.
Many of us should have liked to have seen 2020 become a more definite deadline for meeting the WHO' s recommendations.
I also believe it is good that the Member States should not only be obliged to prepare practical programmes for achieving the targets, but that obligations should also be imposed in terms of informing people about the programmes that are being prepared and about the results - both positive and negative - that are obtained, just as we have acquired a number of rules as to when people are to be notified that there are problems with the unduly strong concentration of ozone - both people in general and people belonging to groups which are especially sensitive to problems in this area.
Finally, I would say that I also think it is good that we have got the candidate countries on board so that they can be involved early on.
We can of course now look forward to the directive' s coming into force before the first candidate countries accede to the EU so that, even at the time of their accession, they will have to comply with the obligations imposed by the directive upon existing Member States.
I hope that, by means of this directive, we can prevent and reduce the harmful effects of the unduly high concentrations of ozone upon people' s health and upon vegetation and that today might prove to have been a good day for future air quality in Europe.
Mr President, I am of course very pleased that we are now approaching the time when we can adopt the Directive on ozone in ambient air.
Thanks to this directive, we shall be able to protect vegetation and people' s health from the damaging effects of unduly high concentrations of ozone, except in those cases where that cannot be brought about by proportionate measures.
I therefore warmly welcome the Conciliation Committee' s joint draft from 11 November 2001.
As has already been pointed out, the directive has been improved on essential points in the process from common position to final directive.
It has become clearer and more consistent, and that has been possible thanks to the high quality of the European Parliament' s proposal and of the successful negotiations during the conciliation.
I wish quite simply to take the opportunity of conveying my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Davies, and all the members of the Conciliation Committee.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Sixth Community Environment Action Programme
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0456/2001) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme [11076/1/2001 - C5-0434/2001 - 2001/0029(COD)].
Mr President, with regard to the Sixth Environment Action Programme I would first of all like to offer thanks to the 'shadow rapporteurs' of the various Parliamentary groups for their fine cooperation.
This cooperation with the 'shadow rapporteurs' has meant that the voting agenda, at least, looks very different than in the first reading: we have concentrated exclusively on the most important amendments.
I hope that this fine cooperation will also continue in the voting tomorrow.
The Commission, too, has been a good cooperation partner: we have held a great many discussions.
Our special thanks go to Sweden, which acted as President during the first reading.
The main objective of the programme, of course, is to integrate environmental policy with the other sectors of policy.
In this respect this forms a continuation to the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, but in the course of this integration we must attain concrete objectives and actual results, and then we will also need structural amendments, for example to the Commission's own actions.
The objective of integration is of course that the environmental aspect be taken into consideration in the various policy sectors themselves.
Special emphasis must be given to the areas of energy policy, transport policy, agriculture and fishing, since these are the most difficult areas from the point of view of the environment.
The future agricultural reform must take steps in the direction of more sustainable procedures, and the new instruments for improving the state of the environment must incorporate a clear focusing of the EU's aid policy on the environmental aspect.
The conflict which presently reigns over subsidies from the environmental point of view must be eliminated.
An inventory should be established of environmentally-damaging subsidies, and these must be phased out by 2010 at the latest.
Money, incidentally, can act as a fine consultant, and in this spirit environmentally-related and energy taxes (for example) must also be developed.
I am also very pleased that here in Parliament we have been able to give very broad approval to the idea that environmentally-related taxation needs to be developed also at EU level.
Qualitative and quantitative objectives, and timetables, must be set for the most important environmental problems.
This has been a very contentious question: the Commission has not supported this, and the Council also has doubts.
My own opinion is that in this type of programme it is very important to understand those requirements which are to be placed on decision-making from the environmental point of view.
By setting objectives and by dividing them sensibly over time periods, we will make it possible for political decision-makers to understand, at any given future stage, what sort of decisions must be made in the situation at hand.
In my opinion these objectives are required, in particular, as instruments for directing policy.
The Commission proposes thematic strategies, which will subsequently guide the environmental policy of the future.
The Commission suggests six; Parliament has added an urban thematic initiative, and this has been very largely approved.
The thematic strategies must be approved using the codecision procedure.
In my opinion this is quite self-evident, since it is through these strategies that we will be directing environmental policy in its crucial aspects.
As I stated, there are very few amendments; but I would like to say a few words about one of them.
This is the amendment by the European Liberal and Democratic Party group concerning rejection of the common position.
In my opinion this will not be of any benefit to this matter, nor do I understand its content; it is only by improving the common position that we will bring about improvements in European environmental policy.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, for having, at first reading, voiced the concerns of the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions.
Given the daily practice of this Committee, these could only be concerns relating compliance with this legislation, as raised in some of the rapporteur' s amendments and compromise amendments.
All policies should be integrated into environmental policy - as stated in some of the amendments - and public participation and information is necessary - also as stated in some of the amendments.
I am not hiding the fact that, as a citizen of a small mining region in Asturias - and I am speaking here in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group - that I have some problems with the amendment on imposing a time limit on subsidies for projects that could damage the environment.
I do not have a problem with it in general terms, but specifically with regard to the fact that, in the region in which I live, more than 30 000 jobs have been lost as a direct result of restructuring.
For this reason I do not agree with these amendments.
However, we completely agree with the rest of them.
We also agree with some of our fellow Members - and I am sure that my colleague Jonas SjÃ¶stedt would support me here - that this latest proposal is not the one put forward by the European Parliament.
This is a proposal that was debated, on which agreements were reached between all of the groups and between the rapporteur and the Commission and the Council to arrive at this latest proposal that we have here.
For this reason, I also agree with the rapporteur that we cannot accept, and shall reject, the amendment from the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform party that suggests rejecting the proposal.
The proposal is highly important, Mr President.
The Fifth Community Environment Action Programme has come to an end.
The European Union needs a clearly defined strategy with commitments and specific timetables for the next few years and it seems to me that this is potentially a clearly defined proposal with commitments and a specific timetable, which, indeed, we have a great need to implement.
Mr President, I am pleased to say that, at this second reading, the parties have worked to bring their positions closer together.
And although the Council and the Commission have made an effort to accept the many amendments from our first reading, I think that we can now say that it is Parliament that has made the effort to try to find, and reach agreement on, common positions.
In this regard, the role of Mrs Myller deserves a special mention.
We think that this is a reasonable programme that allows the Commission to work, makes it possible to legislate and allows States to be flexible within viable programmes, and for this reason we feel that we must support it.
This is an appropriate framework for combining the development of European communities in a pivotal policy of sustainable development and I think that it is up to the task.
If carried out in this way, it should be clear in conciliation that certain areas are subject to the principle of subsidiarity.
I would also like to talk about principles.
The desire to see all methods used everywhere and to implement a uniform policy in all States runs counter to the principle of sustainability and belongs to the globalist mindset.
It is very easy to attack globalisation when talking about the economy yet not to want to call imposing the same rules on the whole world globalisation.
Social principles, technological viability and the context in which methods are applied are all of great importance to sustainability; the first principle of sustainability is to know how to combine general principles with the imposed rules to suit the needs of each community, each location, each climate and each context.
We must be sufficiently generous of spirit to give those in government the freedom to impose their own rules, something that we shall also continue to do, and to adapt them as they see fit.
Furthermore, we support a scientific policy and feel that the function of the Popular Party and of Parliament, in this case, is to support the Council and the Commission because codecision is not only Parliament' s right, but also a responsibility that should be used to help governments.
For this reason, for example, we respect the dates of all these agreements that the Commission and the Council are to conclude with other European countries.
We need to be serious in this regard and support this policy that has required such efforts to produce.
We support the thematic strategies and a more scientific policy precisely because this means adapting to the current state of affairs, adapting to the situation of a particular State, sector and to the issue at hand.
We have to assess whether suitably adapted and applicable technologies exist, for in many instances, due to the climate, particular conditions, or size of a company, for example, technologies can differ. The results, however, should be the same.
Therefore, we support the scientific nature and the study of the economic and social impacts that the programme will have, because without social principles, there can be no sustainability.
For this very reason we are not in favour of simply revising subsidies, that is to say, of a target date being fixed whatever the subsidy may be, and this is particularly the case for specific sectors that have had to close due to measures dictated by the Commission, which has imposed laws upon them - such as in the coal sector, for example - that are now facing the problem of some criteria being applied more strictly than others.
Let us first define the criteria for negative subsidies and take account of the fact that five years is not a sufficient amount of time for a generation to recover nor for certain deprived areas to regenerate.
Moreover, we reject the principle of substitution, because it offers no guarantees to industry, to the citizens, or to society, and lends itself to a very free interpretation by certain sectors, countries, civil servants or experts which may lead to the establishment of measures that are damaging to society and that have no legal guarantee. And the principle of legal guarantee is inherent to the Rule of Law.
I hope that this scheme of management can be implemented.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Myller who, for a long time now, has had the task of working on this action programme and has fought resolutely to enable us to get it into order.
It is splendid to know that we are at last at the stage at which we are to adopt a position on the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
In view of this, it is not perhaps so surprising that many of us wish, and had wished, that the programme might have been better and feel disappointed that it is not as good as we would have liked.
At the same time, we perhaps also feel some kind of frustration concerning the unfair distribution of power we sometimes seem to perceive between the institutions, and wish in some way to express this specifically in the case of the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
I should therefore like to see liberals and others who are reflecting along these lines pull themselves together and rise above their own frustrations.
Let us differentiate between policy and processes and do what we have a mandate for. Let us do it well and take the institutional and constitutional battle elsewhere and not where the Sixth Environment Action Programme is at issue.
Let us see what kind of thing the Sixth Environment Action Programme is and see what we are to use it for, namely as a guiding star in all EU policy -environmental and otherwise- and as a lynchpin of the entire sustainable development strategy with which we shall travel together to Johannesburg in September of this year.
There is no reason for rejecting this document.
We must adopt it today.
Regarding Mrs Myller' s reference to the common environment tax, I would make a point of mentioning recent reports in Sweden to the effect that the dramatic fall in the quantities of climate-changing gases is due precisely to the carbon dioxide tax.
This further supports the case for our having to continue the fight, together with the Commission, to ensure that the Council is convinced that now is the time for us to introduce a common environment tax, especially where carbon dioxide is concerned.
Mr President, we held our first debate on the Commission' s Sixth Community Environment Action Programme in May last year.
At the time, the Commission proposal came under heavy attack from us as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
In our view, the programme was far too broad and showed a serious lack of priorities.
At the same time, we wondered whether a ten-year plan was really, in fact, outdated.
We are now eight months further on, and have had input from the Commission, the Council and Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Any satisfaction or progress?
No, unfortunately, neither.
The proposal, as it was presented at the time, has since been cut down to the bone.
The position of the Council of Ministers is deeply disappointing on all fronts.
Last time, I used the image of a Christmas tree, trimmed with a multitude of proposals, which devalued the entire text.
The current plan has more in common with an empty box than a Christmas tree.
The form is just about presentable, but is very much lacking in content.
I can tell you straight away who is not to blame for this.
Our rapporteur, Mrs Myller, has done sterling work, and the Commissioner has made every effort to tighten up the plan and take the wishes of this House more into consideration.
However, it is the Council that has frustrated every substantial improvement to the proposal.
It is staggering to realise that when we, as Parliament, vote on the plan' s current version, we shall in fact be back to square one, and this after two years of hard graft on the part of the Commission and Parliament.
Can this be justified to the European citizen?
They set great store by the environment.
It is now the Council that has destroyed all the good work that has been done.
So what should have been done instead?
According to my group, the priorities that are completely lacking in the plan are climate change, energy, waste and bio-diversity.
In addition, the plan should have been much more concise and should have been characterised by far more cohesion and vision.
In our view, the Council is best summed up as an emperor without clothes.
He may seem unremarkable at first glance, but fails the test upon further inspection.
This is not a strategy, it is even less than existing policy in a pleasant format.
It therefore constitutes a step back, and we propose to reject the present proposal in its entirety.
Mr President, those who work on environmental issues and on a variety of measures, programmes, conventions, items of legislation etc are often surprised and impatient at how slow the process is and at how difficult it is to specify in concrete terms how objectives in terms of protecting the environment and public health are to be formulated and implemented. That is also how it has been with the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
First of all, it was not certain that we should obtain any action programme at all.
When we then saw the Commission' s proposal, we thought that it was extremely vague and lacked both qualitative and quantitative objectives and timetables. An environment action programme must naturally establish environmental objectives if there is to be any point at all in having a programme.
Mrs Myller, as rapporteur, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have genuinely tried to improve the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
I wish to thank the rapporteur for this and also thank other fellow MEPs for their valuable cooperation.
When we are now about to adopt a view on the Council' s position at second reading, we see that the Council has in fact introduced a very great many of Parliament' s amendments. When it comes to specifying deadlines etc, things are still extremely sluggish, however.
We must now take the opportunity of changing this by voting in favour of the committee' s amendments and the compromise amendments tabled by quite a few political groups.
The programme' s overarching aim is to decouple, for example, environmental pressures from economic growth.
Up until now, the improvements that have been made have been offset by increased production and consumption.
Another general principle is to supply the basis and the priorities for sustainable development and to apply the precautionary and substitution principles.
So that it is possible to do this, I should like to recommend all MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment No 44, which of course requires it to be discovered by no later than 2003 which forms of EU aid run directly counter to our aims, that is to say have a negative effect on the environment, and requires the year to be established by which this aid must be abolished.
Where chemicals and pesticides are concerned, I think that all the amendments tabled on this issue are sound.
The chemicals organisations' umbrella organisation, CEFIC, has taken the view that the amendments are not in accordance with the report on chemicals strategy.
I maintain that this view has just been plucked out of thin air. It is sad that such an incomplete and one-sided analysis has been carried out.
As rapporteur for the White Paper, I can assure you that these amendments are sound and that they strengthen the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
When it comes to the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, we should, in common with Mrs HulthÃ©n, have liked the programme to have been more vigorous and have liked to get more measures through.
The proposal is not now to be altered, however.
There is so much we must do and agree upon within these institutions. That is why I would definitely wish to reject the ELDR' s proposal and call upon everyone to vote in favour of the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the compromise amendments that have been tabled.
Mr President, I must first address the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to reject the common position.
That is a proposal which we cannot support.
We think it would be irresponsible not to take a decision on the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
I too should have liked the proposal to have gone much further. The original proposal was extremely weak and also vague.
The fact is, however, that some of what Parliament contributed has been incorporated into the joint proposal. We shall therefore have the opportunity tomorrow to introduce a great many of the quantitative objectives and timetables we actually want to see.
We must not pass up that opportunity.
We must put this proposal in its context.
During the period that this environment action programme is to apply, the European Union will be enlarged through the accession of a large number of new countries.
There is a danger of this causing a number of problems in terms of environmental work too.
There is a danger of the work' s losing momentum, and it may become more difficult to push through new environmental laws.
It would not be particularly wise to do without environment action programmes at such a stage.
So that environmental work does not lose momentum, it is no doubt desirable to have a programme with timetables and practical objectives to adhere to when enlargement takes place.
My group will vote in favour both of the committee' s proposal and of all the compromise amendments we arrived at in these negotiations.
We do not think the situation is perfect, but we think it is acceptable.
I wish particularly to mention Amendment No 10, which I think is important.
This concerns the European Investment Bank.
There were quite a lot of MEPs who voted against this amendment in the committee.
I find that incomprehensible because it is an amendment which goes to the very heart of integrating environmental considerations into other policy areas, something that the European Investment Bank has not been successful at doing.
What is required of the bank, namely that it take account of the environment, ought to be self-evident.
That is why it is so important for them to receive the clear message that they too are not exempt from what is required.
The same applies to chemicals policy, where we want to see strict wordings.
Mr President, not for the first time in this House I have the opportunity to express concern with regard to the safety of nuclear installations, and in particular those with an established record of poor management, since they put the lives and health of millions of citizens at risk.
Such is the case with the British government's nuclear installation at Sellafield.
This is not just my view: the litany of management blunders and serious technical defects is a matter of public record, which has been exposed, despite efforts to keep it secret.
It is inconceivable that the British Government should set out to justify not only the continuity of Sellafield in its present dangerous condition, but also wish to add further to its operations by commissioning the MOX processing facility.
Because of its closer proximity to Ireland than to most parts of the British mainland, the Irish Government has again raised serious objections to the continued operation of this dangerous plant.
Records in this House will show that on a previous occasion I called on the Commission to exercise its powers under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to verification of nuclear installations at Sellafield.
In reply to queries from my political group, the Commission recently confirmed that the last time it undertook such an audit was in 1993, nearly a decade ago.
Bearing in mind the number of times that this matter has been raised in the House by all political groups, how can the Commission possibly justify its silence and inactivity on a matter of such serious public concern?
I call on the Commission to immediately initiate an examination of all activities on the Cumbria site and ask the Commissioner to give assurance to that effect in his reply.
Mr President, by bringing together several sectoral directives such as those on climate change and waste management, the Commission is seeking to launch an innovative programme to improve the environment.
The end result is a real labyrinth that is incomprehensible to the citizen.
However, the Council has again adopted a more realistic position by not setting a binding timetable or target.
So what does the rapporteur want?
Is it realistic, for instance, to incorporate the substitution principle, which currently has no political or legal definition?
There are also issues surrounding environmental crime, environmentally related taxes and legislation on environmental responsibility.
We should also be in step with the resolution that was adopted last November relating to chemicals.
These issues, which are crucial for our economy, cannot be dealt with hurriedly within the framework of this report.
I am also concerned by the emphasis placed on biodiversity, with the headache involved in setting up the Natura 2000 network, both in France and elsewhere.
The approach to this subject is not correct either and there are alternatives.
We shall therefore vote in favour of rejecting the amendment as a whole.
Let us remain realistic and pragmatic.
Let us go back to the main aims of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, namely to ensure a high level of protection, taking into account the subsidiarity principle and diversity in the various regions of the Community.
To do this, in my view, is already a fair challenge.
Mr President, I hope we can get agreement on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, preferably without going into conciliation.
I would like, on behalf of the committee, to thank Mrs MÃŒller for the immense amount of work she has put into this report.
I underline my support for the amount of work she has done because I actually disagree with many of the conclusions she has come to.
Nevertheless, we have dealt with this matter so extensively that we will probably not gain anything by extending the process to the full beauties of late-night conciliation in Brussels.
The amendments tabled by the committee and the rapporteur do not really add up to anything of substance and, where they do, the results would probably be to damage the chances of success of the Environmental Action Programme.
I draw your attention to Amendment No 11, which is already out of date.
I would criticise, as Mr BerniÃ© has done, the reliance of the rapporteur to a considerable extent on jargon.
Old war horses are trotted out again and given one more exhausted run around the course.
The chemical industry is focused on as the villain of the piece and the substitution principle makes a well-earned reappearance in the amendments that the committee has asked the House to consider.
The assumption of at least Amendment No 1 - and to some extent Amendment No 30 - is that the substitution principle exists as a fully worked-out concept.
It does not.
It is an amalgam of assumptions and suspicions fudged together by the green movement as a universal panacea.
The amendments talk of this as a fully worked-out policy, but we should at least be consistent.
The SchÃ¶rling report, which we voted on a few months ago, called on the Commission to produce a definition of the substitution policy principle, so we can hardly deal with it now as though it really is in existence.
Do we need a Sixth Environmental Action Programme?
I do not share the cynicism and despair of some in the ELDR Group.
Some sort of route map or check list is helpful and desirable.
The Commission probably built on previous mistakes by attaching so much weight to the idea of a programme.
The poor Commissioner wanted a slim programme and has ended up with a fatty!
I also regret - and she may regret - the submission of the programme to full codecision because that has certainly lengthened the process without adding to the substance.
The best part of the Environmental Action Programme for me is the concentration on better implementation.
In the old days we wanted an action programme in order to put pressure on the Council to agree to legislation.
Now the trouble is that the Council does agree to legislation and then does very little about it.
Without better implementation we are deceiving the people of Europe into believing that things are getting better and better, in the words of the old Labour Party advertisement.
Just as at home in UK things are not getting better and better, the words remain easy to say but they are often not followed by action and it is up to us to see that they are.
Mr President, I have a speech here, but I must admit that Mrs Jackson has rather distracted me into thinking about how things get better and better after you reach a certain age.
Clearly Mrs Jackson has reached that certain age and she now thinks everything in the past better than it is now.
Like Mrs Jackson, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her good work.
This document is worth voting for, but it would be more worthwhile voting for if it contained a few more of Parliament's amendments.
In the field of chemicals policy, the field of preserving biodiversity, climate change, transport and the protection of air and water quality, there are clear and worthwhile proposals that could be built upon in the conciliation process.
In the field of fiscal policy, there are some serious and sensible suggestions in Parliament's amendments.
However, the setting at the moment of any kind of European-wide environmental taxes must be better thought out.
At the moment it is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a whole series of very different nuts, with what I would guess would be very limited success.
We must now as a Parliament unite and tomorrow morning take the next step into conciliation, where we are going to have to work together with a view to achieving a common viewpoint to the way in which we are going to protect the environment of our common European home and preserve it for future generations.
I look forward to taking that step tomorrow morning and to the Christian Democrats helping us to do so.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Myller.
She managed to get an excellent report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I have to be honest. The Council proposal is weak, lacks any imagination, any specific goals and is a welter of words.
My criticism is also levelled at the four Green Ministers who may have promised progress, but who failed to deliver.
Neither can the proposal as it now stands be used as propaganda material for young people, as Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m stated.
This is why it should be binned, and the large majority of my group will support the amendment of the Liberals to reject the common position.
It is the political choice of the two large groups, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
If they vote against and reject the amendment, they too will be responsible for this weak and empty concoction.
Needless to say, the Greens will support all amendments to improve the proposal.
A one per cent reduction in greenhouse gases annually, certification of wood, sustainably-produced and otherwise, the amendment to which the GUE made reference, the European Investment Bank, the chemicals policy along with the substitution principle. Mrs Jackson, I have to get this off my chest.
These are not the inspired ramblings of a Green mind, they are existing policy in Denmark and Sweden, and even the new Danish government, that is from the right-wing school of thought, has no intention of changing this policy.
The amendments, which include a legal framework for voluntary agreements between industry and the European Commission, are all sound, but I have very little hope that they will obtain the required 314 votes.
This means that, ultimately, the officials of the European Commission will get their way, the same officials who proposed the policy not to present a Sixth Environmental Action Programme under any circumstances.
This is why this is a defeat for politics and for European environmental policy.
And the key culprit is the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, prompted by certain officials from the European Commission.
But it is still not too late.
Tomorrow, we will vote, and I hope that maybe some of the Christian-Democrats will see sense and will be prepared to vote for a number of sensible amendments, so that maybe we will end up with a conciliation procedure, which will have some substance at least and which will not merely be a welter of words.
Mr President, ever since the 70s, we, in the European Parliament, have been in the habit of using environmental action programmes to give direction to environmental policy.
This was very relevant in those days, for we had to start more or less from scratch.
A great deal was subsequently achieved, but I am now increasingly feeling uncomfortable.
The evaluation of the Fifth EAP has clearly shown that we are up a blind alley.
Partly because many Member States have failed to implement environmental legislation, the objectives of the Fifth EAP have not been achieved.
Since we are unable to draft a programme that adds value to what we are already doing in the environmental sphere, I wonder whether we should continue drafting environmental action programmes.
I will for this reason support Mr Maaten' s amendment to reject the Council' s common position.
This is no reflection on the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, or the Commissioner, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, but is about the Council' s role.
Let us now focus on the actual implementation of the Fifth EAP.
What will matter most are the implementation of, and compliance with, current environmental legislation, especially in the light of enlargement.
Mr President, presenting a common position for second reading could be seen as a purely technical, tactical move to bring us closer to implementing the decisions.
However, in this debate, as many other speakers have said too, a number of key points still have to be defined.
Indeed, although the Council has incorporated most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, the Sixth Framework Programme lacks specific working time frames and its strategic objectives need to be defined in more practical terms.
We must not forget that this programme will have to operate over a decade or so, and so an approximate work schedule and poorly defined aims are completely unacceptable.
In particular, the European Parliament' s latest amendments call for more decisive, tougher action against the danger of pesticides - this applies both to the present Member States and those waiting to join the Union - again, there must be a substantial effort to combat the greenhouse effect, the increasing sound pollution that pursues us all the time, wherever we go, the too frequent environmental disasters caused by human negligence, disasters for which it is becoming increasingly difficult to find out who is responsible.
Lastly, once again, the European Parliament' s amendments seek to make some of the proposals already mentioned practical reality. I just want to summarise them under at least four basic headings, four areas which have been defined as priorities: climate change, biodiversity, the connection between the environment and human health, and waste disposal.
These issues are so vitally important that anything less than total precision and total responsibility on our part would be absolutely unacceptable, and we cannot put off dealing with them to a later date as the Council seems to want to do.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, and also the shadow rapporteurs, especially our group's own, for the work done on this report.
I consider neither the Commission's proposal nor the report presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be worthless.
I do not, therefore, quite understand the proposal by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens that the proposal and the common position should be rejected in their entirety.
Another reason why I do not understand it is that, if I understand rightly, the Member States' environment ministers are not exclusively Christian Democrats but, rather, primarily Greens and also liberal Social Democrats and members of our family of parties.
To be sure, we often have to criticise and improve what the Council submits to us but, in view of this political constellation, it is somewhat problematic to say that it is all nonsense.
Despite our criticisms, we have to improve on the Council's proposal without completely rejecting it.
In particular, I would call upon us to produce some stringent wording concerning subsidies that have harmful effects on the environment.
The Council's wording strikes me as too weak.
I believe that, whenever it is said that the protection of the environment costs money, one has first to bear in mind that, of course, the destruction of the environment and its consequences cost money, and that it is even worse when the destruction of the environment is being subsidised - in other words, when money is being paid out for it.
There are possibilities there for very effective savings.
I therefore emphatically support the idea of reducing subsidies.
The Committee has now decided on 2005 as a deadline.
A lot of people have problems with that, and not only in our group.
That is why there are various proposals for compromise.
I believe, though, that we must, whatever happens, agree on an amendment that is more stringent than what the Council has decided on.
We should also not put other economic instruments, such as a fiscal reform, to one side, but should follow them through at a European level.
Mr President, honourable Members, it is an exciting journey that is being undertaken with a proposal for a new Environment Action Programme.
It has been extremely instructive.
Clearly, a certain comfort has sometimes been found in the fact that you have, at all events, had kind and friendly things to say about both myself and the skilful rapporteur.
Possibly we should have talked rather more about what was expected from the Sixth Environment Action Programme as early as when you questioned me. We perhaps should have straightened this out at an earlier stage, for I can see that this debate embraces many incompatible and rather contradictory desires.
We appreciate that a programme may be needed that extends over a longer period because environmental problems often arise after a certain number of years. We also need a longer planning period if the measures we take are to be the right ones.
On the other hand, we should of course very much like to draw up practical measures and objectives because it is in that way that we can put pressure on the Member States.
We cannot, however, just come up with credible objectives for a ten-year period.
The programme states the overarching objectives, and it is of course extremely important for us to know that this is the direction in which we must be moving.
At the same time, we are concerned here with a programme of action and of measures to be taken, and that is what we have aimed at.
We must state how we intend to set about achieving the objectives, while the practical objectives and deadlines must be incorporated into, respectively, the thematic strategy and the various draft laws and other proposals we submit during this ten-year period.
The idea behind the programme was not, then, just to continue with the same thing and add a long list of legislative proposals to those which were already in the Fifth Action Programme and which, moreover, as Mrs Jackson quite correctly said, fail very often to be implemented properly.
That is something we must get to grips with.
It is, however, also important to emphasise what we in actual fact agree about, that is to say the overall structure and the priorities.
It is a question of daring to say that these four issues are the most important. It is also a question of the underlying principles that are to govern environmental policy during this ten-tear period and of the need to consult widely and to have broad participation in decision-making on environmental issues.
We agree on which issues are to be highlighted: climate change, the natural environment and bio-diversity, health and environmental measures, and the issues of how we use our natural resources and dispose of waste.
We also agree that current legislation is to be fully implemented in practice, that environmental considerations are to be integrated into all other policy areas and that legislators, decision makers and the general public must have access to adequate information.
The strategy for the next ten years is in actual fact based upon the Fifth Environment Action Programme, which has been developed by means of a description of how environmental policy and its challenges have altered.
Current patterns of life and consumption, the way in which goods are produced and the way in which we live and operate as private individuals affect environmental problems.
The environmental action programme is challenging.
I am aware of the fact and accept responsibility for it.
Even though there has been some tough criticism, I believe it is right to dare to tackle something new and try to find a new structure.
For me, it was important to design an environment action programme which everyone, and not only the experts, can follow and assess when new proposals are made and initiatives presented, as was the case for example with the recent climate package.
That is why I do not of course agree with rejecting the Council' s common position.
Now that we have carried out all this work, we ought surely to try to complete it and help each other as far as possible.
In principle, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy offers its unqualified support for the general approach to developing future environmental policy that forms part of the Council' s common position.
Of relevance here too are the requirements that policy must be based upon participation and dialogue and upon the best possible scientific findings that are available.
That means that we must be very thorough in analysing the problems we face, together with possible solutions, at the same time as studying current research and making use of indicators etc. In that way, we shall create policy through solid work, and that will be in accordance with the strategic orientation of this programme.
It also means, as I said, that it is meaningless to introduce objectives and guidelines into the programme more or less arbitrarily.
At the same time, I want to avoid possible misunderstandings and explain clearly that I do of course support the use of clear objectives and deadlines.
Moreover, our proposals will include these, and they must be discussed in both Parliament and the Council.
The few overarching objectives the programme now contains are generally known, and so they should be.
I am also, of course, able to approve the additional objectives proposed by the Commission in its communication on sustainable development prior to the Gothenburg Summit, that is to say Amendments Nos 11, 15, 16 and 27. That is, however, on condition that they faithfully reflect our communication.
I cannot approve the incorporation of other objectives into the programme, as has been done in Amendments Nos 17, 24, 25, 26, 34 and 42.
It is also gratifying that the committee supports the idea of, and proposal for, thematic strategies, together with the proposed content of these.
The committee has added a proposal on the urban environment.
This is to be found in Amendments Nos 32 and 33, which are acceptable overall.
We thus have a stable platform for future work and cooperation.
The problem is that the proposal that the strategies should be ready to implement within three years is in conflict with the requirement for best scientific findings and for broadly based consultation and participation.
We should also remember that we have seven thematic strategies to deal with.
In the light, too, of Amendment No 12, requiring all thematic strategies to be subject to the co-decision procedure, this means that the Commission must present all the thematic strategies by no later than the end of the year so that there is time for the co-decision procedure.
We can perhaps meet the deadline for some isolated thematic strategy, but scarcely for all of them.
That is why I would call upon the European Parliament not to push this issue too hard.
Give us an opportunity to develop the strategies and to put forward a package of measures that is best suited to the current problems.
We cannot therefore approve Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 41, but I shall keep the European parliament informed of our work on the thematic strategies, and we shall submit oral reports each year in order to fulfil the requirement in Amendment No 14.
I must inform Parliament that I am opposed to most of the amendments concerning chemicals.
The problem with these is that there is no agreed definition of the principle of indemnification. We should therefore examine this carefully before we make it legally binding.
Naturally, I believe it has its part to play, but before we make it legally binding we must arrive at a definition which is tenable.
Regarding the proposal that the REACH Register should include all existing substances and that all products, unlike substances and preparations, should be labelled, all I can say is that it would be practically impossible.
We are nonetheless able in principle to approve Amendment No 31 on the coordination of the work involving chemicals and pesticides, even if there is already such coordination.
Regarding the issue of voluntary commitments and agreements, we see these as part of an advantageous mix of various political tools including, for example, legal and financial tools.
According to the OECD, there are more than 300 agreements in the Member States of the Community.
They differ considerably from one another, depending upon how flexibly they are adapted to different situations and objectives.
The Commission plans to submit a communication examining the potential of such tools.
It is too early to determine what the agreements under the programme will look like, and we cannot therefore approve Amendments Nos 9 and 40.
There is general support from the Commission regarding quite a number of other issues, for example sustainable development and integration, measures affecting tax rates at Community level, environmental crimes etc.
In addition to those I mentioned earlier, the Commission is able to support Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 21, 39 and 45, together with parts of Amendments Nos 43, 46 and 47.
I cannot however accept the other amendments tabled.
We are close to reaching an agreement on the Environment Action Programme for the next ten years. Mrs Myller' s efforts as rapporteur at this second reading have been much appreciated.
No repetition of the debate is required because her amendments have been carefully selected, something which bodes well for the next step in the procedure.
I hope that, on the basis of the amendments supported by the Commission, the Council will adopt a positive approach to Parliament's opinion so that those of us in the Commission, the Council and Parliament, in conjunction with other interested parties, can together continue with our work on conserving and improving our environment.
Thank you for an interesting debate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Integrated product policy
The next item is the report (A5-0419/2001) by Mrs GarcÃ­a-Orcoyen Tormo on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission Green Paper on integrated product policy [COM(2001) 68 - C5-0259/2001 - 2001/2117(COS)]
Mr President, I must confess I was pleased to see you come in, because I was practically under the impression that I was going to be the only person in the Chamber.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner, who, after a hard day, is here with us this evening.
The Green Paper on an integrated product policy should, in my opinion, be the framework for the formulation of a series of guidelines and proposals that will enable both producers and consumers to make full use of the instruments and opportunities offered by the market to be able to make it function in a way that is better adapted to the practice of sustainable development.
This new approach needs to be an improvement on the traditional approach that the European Union has been following up to now, which is essentially based on encouraging environmental improvement in the production sector through standards that establish limits for pollution and also through voluntary instruments that promote the differentiation of companies and products that incorporate environmental improvements.
We have to admit, with regard to these voluntary methods, which have been implemented since the early nineties, such as the co-determination regulation, European eco-audits and the ecolabel, that these have not been as successful as had been hoped and, above all, have not been implemented in a similar fashion in all Member States.
Only 3 200 companies throughout Europe have obtained EMAS certification and only 350 products from 70 companies have these European 'ecolabels' .
In my opinion, the main cause of this situation lies in the rigidity of the system and the still weak consumer demand for 'green' products.
The Commission, aware of this problem, has presented this Green Paper on integrated product policy, with varying degrees of wisdom and balance.
It has been widely discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but I, naturally, maintain that the Commission has shown considerable dedication to the matter.
Various mechanisms have been proposed with the aim of stimulating the necessary environmental improvement of products and their consumption.
The proposal contains a series of suggestions that would facilitate the implementation of different policies and market instruments that go further than those that focus exclusively on the environment and that, I think, will make it easier for a future White Paper to be more detailed and better developed.
We are faced with the need to adopt a decisive approach to stimulate environmental improvement in the EU market, which will allow products to be given prices that are fairer from an environmental point of view, to stimulate demand that is more appropriate and to make the use of instruments for clean production more widespread.
Furthermore, I believe that this approach will give greater impetus to the integration of environmental policy in other areas, such as the economic or social areas, and with this we will be better able to fulfil the mandates of Cardiff and Gothenburg.
Though the amendments that Parliament has tabled, it has brought a greater degree of precision and clarity to the Commission proposal with regard to the orientation of the IPP and also to the role of each of the actors - companies, public authorities and consumers - and has given very clear consideration to the issue of shared responsibility without this involving a decrease in producers' responsibility, but instead taking into account and also putting an emphasis on the responsibility of both public authorities and consumers.
Public authorities, for example, can provide a very important boost for a more environmentally friendly market though public procurement.
They can also point out useful market instruments to put the IPP into practice: economic instruments, such as tax incentives, for example.
Similarly, the Parliament text highlights the importance of an improved and enhanced eco-label, the need to improve European standardisation processes, the need to set parameters and indicators that are simple to apply and similar in all Member States for the lifecycle of products, not forgetting the need not to endanger free competition in the market or in European companies.
The text also highlights the crucial role of information, which should be clearer, more truthful and easy to understand.
I think that I have accounted for the majority of amendments tabled in Plenary.
I have accepted them and I have only rejected those that I feel do not fit into the framework or context of a Green Paper.
In my opinion, this is a good proposal that deserves all our support.
Mr President, while there are certainly elements worthy of praise in the Green Paper, overall we are left with the impression of a lost political opportunity.
The Commission has strong institutional powers, which it could use to actively drive the IPP process.
Too often we are left with the impression of a Commission that is a spectator rather than a powerful actor.
We also need more joined-up thinking, more explicit connections between the IPP project, the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and the Strategy for Sustainable Development.
We would like to see those links made much more explicit.
To summarise a number of the other concerns raised by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we believe that the strategy tends to rely too heavily on voluntary agreements.
They clearly have a role to play, but they are not a substitute for regulation; they should be seen as complementary to it.
At the very least we need very clear benchmarks, objectives and timetables for any voluntary agreements so that we can ensure that they are working.
The Green Paper also focuses almost exclusively on products rather than services and therefore misses another whole raft of potential opportunities to green an increasingly large area of our economies.
Perhaps one of the major shortcomings of the Paper is its insufficient awareness of the broader international trade context, under which, unfortunately, some of its proposals would have questionable legality.
The effectiveness of the IPP strategy will be severely curtailed unless the Commission explicitly recognises the reforms that would be needed to the World Trade Organisation in particular, to enable its measures to be set out.
Similarly, with respect to public procurement, greening public procurement is vitally important but there are currently obstacles in achieving that which should have been acknowledged more explicitly in the Paper, along with strategies to address the problem.
It is very significant that in its opinion the Committee of the Regions specifically refers to the restricted scope of local and regional authorities for action when it comes to green procurement and notes that legal action has already been taken against a number of towns and cities which have tried to implement a green procurement policy.
Those are the kinds of areas that need to be changed.
We look forward to an ambitious new White Paper in the near future.
Mr President, this report walks a tightrope between the need to increase production of consumer goods and services and environmental protection requirements.
