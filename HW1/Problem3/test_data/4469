So the perception that many have that the Arab world is not ready for democracy is undermined by the United Nationsâ own reports.
I hope, therefore, that the Council and Commission can, as it were, put our money where our mouth is, and redirect some of the enormous funds available for good governance, the development of civil society, democracy and the rule of law, which, in the external field â the responsibility of Commissioners Patten and Nielson â amounts to EUR 1.9 billion a year.
By contrast, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights â a rather smaller fund aimed at the ex-Soviet Bloc â which I had the honour to set up a few years ago, amounts to only EUR 106 million.
That is an indication of the distortion in spending which we need to address, and in particular the priorities with which I hope the European Parliament will play some part in helping the Commission in the coming years.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish sincerely to thank MrÂ Laschet for a well-written and important report that is politically well balanced and forward-looking.
I shall concentrate on four points.
The first concerns Amendment NoÂ 6 by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself. It has also been supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The European Parliament â[c]onsiders that the elaboration of the common foreign and security policy towards the UN should be characterised by the participation and joint influence of all the European Unionâs Member Statesâ. If we have a common foreign and security policy, it cannot be devised solely by the major powers: Germany, France and perhaps also Great Britain.
All the Member States must feel they are participating in this area.
The smaller Member States must not be confronted by a , with a common foreign and security policy having come about because the larger countries have already adopted positions. Otherwise, there is no common foreign and security policy.
Regarding paragraph 19, I would, secondly, emphasise the value of depriving countries that systematically infringe human rights of their right to vote in the UN Commission on Human Rights until such breaches cease.
This must be pursued in a UN context.
The third point I wish to emphasise concerns the UN Security Council.
The EU should make better use of the two votes that EU Member States, namely Great Britain and France, now already, in actual fact, possess in the Security Council.
We must not therefore weaken the EUâs current 40% representation in the UN Security Council.
I should now like to address MrÂ Patten regarding Amendment NoÂ 8, also supported by the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group.
We support Costa Ricaâs initiative and the UN General Assemblyâs decision to work on a corresponding convention in 2004 on banning human cloning.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is splendid, and it is even more splendid that we will, in a few minutes, be able to welcome the current Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan.
I would of course like to take this moment to recall that there have already been three UN Secretaries-General who hailed from Europe: Trygve Lie, Dag HammarskjÃ¶ldand Kurt Waldheim, and that Europe is home to two permanent UN offices, in Geneva and Vienna.
This means that we share responsibility to a large extent.
Not only do we have claims upon each other, but we also have to take joint action and support each other.
The most recent UN Secretary-General to come from Europe, Kurt Waldheim, wrote this in his book âDie Antwortâ: âI have to concede that the UN, notwithstanding all our efforts and our unquestionable sincerity, has not yet managed to break with the political habits and attitudes of past centuries and to come to terms with the new realities with which we have to live.
Its capacity for effective action is limited by its own faults.
The charge is laid against us that it produces more rhetoric than action, that it is ineffective and is often ignored, and that the system under which every state has a vote allows the developing world to dominate the decision-making process, in that the number of votes bears no relation to the capacity to act.â
The same could also be said of the European Union; both of us are in need of reform.
The two of us have a great deal in common.
Success is dependent on political will and the determination of the Member States.
It depends on acceptance and implementation â of Community law in one case, and of the United Nations Charter in the other.
It is dependent upon multilateral cooperation, global responsibility and upon our thinking along Community-oriented lines rather than nationalistically.
We can make our contribution if France and England leave the Security Council and the EU joins it; we would thereby be reforming the EU and our own Common Foreign and Security Policy, and forcing through a reform of the UN Security Council.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the report is a positive response from Parliament to the Commissionâs outline of relations between the EU and the United Nations.
We support this, although we would like to underline a number of specific aspects.
First of all, and certainly not in contravention of the report, we should like to emphasise the institutional reforms that are necessary.
We must be able to reform the Security Council.
It must be possible for Africa, Asia and Latin America to be permanent members.
After all, it is not acceptable that only the rich and the rich countries in the world should have the final word, while two thirds of the world population live in poverty.
Secondly, the veto system must be reviewed and may only be used when peace is under threat â under real threat â and in the event of aggression.
Thirdly, the European Union must acquire full membership in the Security Council and in the General Assembly.
It is because we would like to see effective multilateralism that we believe it necessary that the United Nations be effectively organised and enabled to take decisions effectively.
This has not always been the case in the past, and the global repercussions are tragic.
I would remind you of the ineffective mandates that are sometimes given to soldiers who have to act on behalf of the United Nations in peace operations.
Their mandate is so inflexible that it renders them non-operational.
I would remind you of the tragedy in Rwanda, of which Kofi Annan recently reminded us.
Fortunately, things went more smoothly in Congo, but we hope that the United Nations will, in future, work more transparently and, above all, more democratically.
Â Â  . Mr President, this morningâs debate has made clear the Parliamentâs strong interest in enhancing the European Unionâs engagement with the United Nations.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, are to be commended on the production of this report.
I fully subscribe to the statement in the report that 'the success of global governance, in the face of the challenges posed by growing globalisation and interdependence, can only be based on an effective and fair multilateral system unequivocally anchored in the United Nations'.
The Council is firmly and formally committed to effective multilateralism in its external action.
A rules-based international order with the United Nations at its heart is a central element of the European Security Strategy, which the European Council adopted in December 2003.
I can assure you that Council, under the Irish presidency, is determined to work towards a more effective collective response to todayâs threats.
We are all keenly aware that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are threats that present serious challenges, but global stability is also threatened by endemic poverty and lack of development, as well as the scourge of HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases.
These are hugely destabilising factors that will literally destroy the prospects of many countries if they are not effectively remedied.
Yesterday I told Secretary-General Annan that, in implementing the European Security Strategy, the European Union will work particularly closely with the UN to enhance mutual cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management.
We agreed that we would work closely on devising better planning and best-practice models for conflict prevention and post-conflict peace building.
We will base this on both our organisations' experiences in these policy areas.
This will involve working together on the practical implementation of the Joint Declaration on EU-UN Cooperation in Crisis Management signed late in 2003.
We also discussed how best to build on the successful deployment in 2003 of Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Before this presidency ends we are aiming to have up to 1500 military personnel available to be deployed as an EU rapid reaction capability at the disposal of the Secretary-General for crisis management operations.
Mr Annan is very supportive of this valuable resource becoming available as soon as possible.
I assured the Secretary-General that the European Union was fully behind his efforts to find â to use his words â a credible and convincing collective answer to the challenges of our time.
The Union will therefore support the work of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.
I believe that the European Union can make an important contribution to this highly relevant debate.
The presidency appreciates the enthusiastic support of the Commission in this endeavour and the work presently under way.
The Secretary-General has made clear his view that any changes must be a means to an end, not an end in themselves.
The United Nations must show, in practical and concrete ways, that it is capable of fulfilling the first purpose laid down in the Charter, which is to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace.
Developing our rapid reaction capability in the coming months will be a demonstration of this Union's willingness to contribute and to assist the UN in this important area of activity.
Todayâs debate is timely.
Given the challenges to the multilateral system that Secretary-General Annan has placed in the spotlight in such a determined way â including last Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos â the central thrust of this report, which reaffirms support for a strong, reformed UN at the centre of the multilateral system, is very welcome.
This confirms that the Secretary-General, the Council, and the Commission have the support of the peopleâs representatives in Parliament in this endeavour.
The report clearly articulates the need for the European Union to 'punch its weight' at the United Nations.
European Union Member States are, collectively, major financial contributors to the United Nations, contributing almost 40% of its budget.
The European Union will, as the report notes, represent some 450 million people from 1 May 2004.
The Council agrees fully that the EU needs to develop a commensurate political profile.
The general thrust of the report strengthens the Council in its engagement with the United Nations.
I wish to assure you that one of the aims of the Irish presidency is to make the EU more focused, more flexible and more responsive at the United Nations.
I am determined that we will devote more effort to engaging with our international partners on these important questions, in the interests of both the UN and the EU.
Effective multilateralism will be a subject of discussion at all our summits with strategic partners during this presidency.
Todayâs discussion has highlighted a number of varied and interesting points which reflect the scope, detail and ambition of the report.
We have read and heard many proposals, some of which can be endorsed immediately.
Some others, it would be fair to say, will need to be discussed over time.
The proposal that the presidency inform the Parliament of the content of the EU Priorities for each UN General Assembly session seems an excellent idea, and the Council will act on this.
The proposal for exchanges of views between high-level UN officials and the committees of the Parliament is also to be commended.
The question of EU representation at the United Nations will certainly need to be addressed in the light of the final outcome of the negotiations on the Constitution, which will confer a legal personality on the European Union.
Some of the issues raised are much more complex, and merit careful consideration.
I wish to commend the ambition of the report for the range of proposals that it contains concerning the activity of the Parliament in relation to the various funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations.
No doubt this is work that the committee concerned and the Parliament will advance over time.
I have also noted carefully what was said regarding the representation of the EU in the Security Council.
Clearly, this is not an issue that can be easily resolved at the moment.
It must be kept under review as our common policies develop over time.
Likewise, the issue of the reform of the Security Council is not one that can be easily resolved.
The High-Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General will address this question, among others.
We are all aware of the difficulties and problems encountered by advocates of institutional reform in the UN.
The necessary consensus remains difficult to develop.
This, however, must not deflect us from the essential task of making the Security Council, and the multilateral system as a whole, more effective in meeting the challenges of todayâs world.
Again, let me reiterate my appreciation of this initiative.
It has provided a stimulus for the ongoing discussion of the EUâs support for the UN and the Parliamentâs role in that regard.
I can assure you that the Council is firmly aware of the issues that are addressed in it, and of the issues that have been raised here today.
â Thank you, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 10.30 a.m.(1)
Â Â  â The Laschet report on the relations between the European Union and the UN has been tabled with great ceremony and to underline its importance it has been linked with the award of the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan.
It actually seeks to establish a âStateless diplomacyâ supported by a network of organisations over which national democracies have little control.
The declared intentions (in essence, a commitment to multilateralism, respect for human rights, peacekeeping and nature conservation) appear to be excellent.
But how is democratic control to be exerted?
In fact, the Laschet report seeks primarily to limit the Member Statesâ scope for action at the UN and to replace them with the European Union, controlled by the European Parliament, which is taking advantage of this to raise its status.
This is tantamount to saying, however, that we prefer âdemocracies that are low on substanceâ, like the European democracy, to really meaningful national democracies.
In particular, the Laschet report welcomes the reforms that the European Constitution would bring if it were adopted, including specifically legal personality for the Union and a European minister for foreign affairs, which would enable this programme to become a reality.
That is one further reason to reject both the Constitution and the Laschet report.
Â Â  â Yes to a more active role for the EU within the UN, as recommended by the report.
âMultilateralism (which) remains the best way to achieve global peace and securityâ, is indeed one way of guaranteeing that we avoid the supremacy of one superpower.
But the objectives that are set out disregard reality and current dangers.
Declarations of intent are no longer enough: poverty eradication, human development, conflict prevention and peacekeeping all require a degree of financial and political investment that is equal to these challenges.
Following the armed intervention and occupation of Iraq by the United States and the suppression â to the point of extinction? â of the Palestinian people, the spirit that prevailed when the United Nations was created and the principles underlying the Charter are more than ever being ridden over roughshod and even trampled underfoot by certain countries.
Now more than ever we need to defend international law and champion the right of nations to self-determination with renewed vigour and that means taking action.
The United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara, for example, including holding a referendum on self-determination, must be implemented, regardless of any further shilly-shallying by the Moroccan Government.
Proper sanctions must also be applied in cases where human rights are violated or the environment is damaged.
Â Â  The UN peace missions in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Liberia, together with the reconstruction of Afghanistan, as well as the humanitarian work for children and the fight against hunger and diseases all indicate that the UN continues to play an essential role in establishing peace and security.
I therefore join Kofi Annan in his call for a radical reform of the UN.
At present, this organisation is far too bureaucratic and not in tune with the geopolitical realities of the 21st century.
The EU which, together with its Member States, accounts for nearly 50% of the UN budget, should take the lead in this reform.
It is essential in this respect that the EU should be able to speak with one voice in the Security Council.
All credit to the EU for continuing to encourage the UN to face up to its responsibilities with regard to conflict prevention and maintaining the peace.
It should not, however, be mere lip service.
For hazardous operations in Africa, we are forced to call upon badly equipped and unmotivated troops from Bangladesh, Pakistan or India.
Sometimes, this creates more problems than it solves.
Why can the EU as such not deploy more troops under the UN flag with a UN mandate?
I therefore call for a European Union which decisively takes the lead in the reform of the United Nations, not only with fine declarations and symbolic contributions, but, above all, with concrete commitments and actual solidarity at the coalface.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have been told by those of my colleagues who understand Italian that, on paragraph 35 of the UN report, you said â, which apparently means ârejectedâ.
That paragraph was, however, adopted by an overwhelming majority of the House, including the Socialists, and we ask you to amend your lists accordingly.
Â Â  Mr President, it was made clear during yesterdayâs debate that there are certain parts of this report, which expressly refer to OLAF, which are being removed from it on the recommendation of the Legal Services since they are not admissible, and these parts are therefore not being voted on.
(1)
Â Â  â Mr President, given the late hour, the fact that we are behind schedule and the difficulty that Members are going to have negotiating the traffic to reach the airport, there is a danger that there will not be enough of us left to vote on the last reports on the agenda.
In agreement with the rapporteur, MrÂ ZappalÃ , our group proposes that the vote on this report be postponed and that it be put to the vote as the first item of voting time on the Wednesday of the next Strasbourg part-session.
Â Â  Mr President, I would request on behalf of the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists that, given the time, the vote be postponed until the next part-session in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, I know that many Members have very important commitments back in their constituencies and regions, and maybe even more important appointments back at the airport.
However, we have been waiting for a number of reports, especially the ZappalÃ  report, to come to the floor of this House for a reasonable period of time now.
We all have our voting lists in front of us, we were sent here to vote on these issues, so can we now get on with it?
It seems that we are putting things off for no reason whatsoever.
Â Â  â Mr President, as my groupâs shadow rapporteur, I would nevertheless like further reassurance that this is only about deferring the vote, and that the agreements reached between the groups will be unaffected and will not again be rescinded.
Â Â  â Mr President, this part contradicts a resolution already adopted by this House on the liberal professions.
I therefore ask that it be amended along the lines we have already agreed to, so that the oral amendment would read: âConsiders that the Commission should not only take account of the market situation in applying the provisions of competition law to the liberal professions, but must also bear in mind the social aspects and tasks in the public interest.
Calls therefore on the Commission to allow associations of the liberal professions the discretion to take measures to permit them to perform their functions correctly.â
Â Â  â MrÂ President, when I was a law student, my tutors, among them my father, taught me the fundamental distinction that German philosophy draws between â the world as it should be â and â the world as it really is.
This morning, in adopting this resolution on relations between the European Union and the United Nations, it is quite possible that Parliament has indeed perceived the world as it should be.
Unfortunately, there is no doubt that the resolution does not take sufficient account of the world as it really is, for better or for worse.
In particular, it would be a loss to the world and Europe if we were, without any guarantees, to relinquish the United Kingdomâs status as a permanent member and even more so if we were to relinquish that of France.
That is why I voted against.
Â Â  We oppose what are termed binding international treaties governing companiesâ activities.
On this point, we cannot support the present report.
We instead recommend that companies operate in accordance with responsibly designed voluntary codes of conduct.
Â Â  .â I voted against the Laschet report on the draft European Constitution, which has not yet been adopted, in order to highlight the Brussels institutionsâ long-standing foreign policy ambitions, which involve making the European Union into a fully-fledged international actor âas soon as its legal personality is recognised by the Constitutionâ (paragraph 10), which amounts to making it an international partner equivalent to a state and with all the characteristics of one, including even permanent membership of the UN.
I might add that, to all outward appearances, todayâs ceremony resembled a mutual support pact between institutions seeking to confer legitimacy upon each other.
Although the Laschet report does of course steer clear of going into detail about what would become of the seats held by France and the United Kingdom on the Security Council, it is clear that the system proposed by the report would logically result in their abolition.
Whilst the draft European constitution does not declare that Europe should have one single representative on the international stage, it does put in place all the legal preconditions for it.
It follows that it is grossly hypocritical to support this Constitution whilst, at the same time, claiming that France will remain a permanent member of the UN.
Â Â  . The European Parliament has adopted an own-initiative resolution on relations between the EU and the UN, containing key aspects that I believe to be extremely dangerous.
This applies in particular when it views the EU as a political-military bloc, on the basis of the false assumption that the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ has already been approved and ratified.
The report even goes as far as to expand on the supranational nature of the constitution in important aspects â in some places, as a matter of fact, appearing to be totally blind to the reality of the situation.
One example of this is the position adopted by the major powers at the Brussels Summit.
This proposal represents a clear attack on each countryâs sovereignty in its international relations.
The resolution even takes the view that âwhenever an EU statement is presented on behalf of the European Union or the European Community, EU Member States should refrain from making their national statements, which should only be envisaged on an exceptional basis and justified in advance to the EU Presidencyâ.
Although this resolution deals with serious issues facing humankind, it does not address them seriously and although it focuses on aspects of power, it advocates creating political and military blocs in a framework of an enhanced multilateral system, strengthening the role of the Security Council and attaching less priority to the role of the UN General Assembly.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party fully supports UN reform, including added permanent places in the Security Council for the African, Asian and Latin American groupings.
But we differ with this resolution in relation to an EU seat and changes to the veto system.
These we believe to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, and could risk less rather than more references to the UN itself.
All of us want a strong United Nations.
Â Â  â The Laschet report purports to be a plea for multilateralism in international relations.
It considers that the UN should take centre stage in achieving this objective, with the European Union playing an enhanced role within it.
But the method advocated to achieve these high-minded wishes is flawed.
For the report, a more effective UN means an enlarged Security Council, minor restrictions on the right to veto decisions and more means of intervention, including the military option.
As with Europe, an attempt is being made to embroil us in an institutional debate so that we forget the underlying problem: the fact that it is free competition above all else that determines the European Unionâs policy; the fact that the major powers assume the right to decide unilaterally what merits or does not merit economic or military intervention on the part of the UN.
The fight against terrorism is thus seen as a top priority, whereas the fight against the greenhouse effect, AIDS or poverty is mere formality.
The UN imposed sanctions on Iraq, but is leaving the Palestinians, Chechens and so many others to their own devices.
Finally, this report is written as if the European Constitution had been ratified and claims that a European minister for foreign affairs will be able to represent a European consensus on international issues.
This is irresponsible.
For all of these reasons, we voted against the report.
Â Â  â Whenever Parliament tables a report on the Unionâs external policy, the federalist majority in this House cannot resist the temptation of adding points that are completely irrelevant and that, ultimately, detract from the overall work that has been done.
Although we fully agree with the rapporteur on certain points, in particular on consolidating relations between the UNâs internal bodies, it is inconceivable that âthe participation of the European Union as a full member in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the UNâ would be accepted or, along the same lines, that âthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union whose functions are laid down in the Draft European Constitution should occupy the seat proposed âŠ for the EUâ.
Although it is interesting to note that such proposals reveal the true nature of the federalist project, because they assume, by definition, that the Union will become a State, it is also quite clear that they are the product of pure fantasy.
One single observation suffices to show how inappropriate this idea is: what would the Union representative have proposed during the Iraq crisis, an issue on which the Union itself was split as never before?
Â Â  . The main aim of this report is to strengthen the European Unionâs positions in the United Nations.
It presents a set of proposals for the institutional reform of the UN and reiterates the desire to develop and promote democratic values and respect for human rights.
I must, however, disagree with some of the points it makes.
Firstly, we have paragraphs in which the rapporteur appears to forget the fact that no European Constitution has been approved, and that all we have is a Draft Constitutional Treaty!
Next, the European Union has no legal personality or Minister for Foreign Affairs.
We are then presented with the impractical idea of enlarging the United Nations Security Council, giving the EU a seat, without considering the more than likely opposition of the other countries that have places on the Security Council, or the fact that it would be hard to persuade France and the United Kingdom to give up their seats.
The suggestion to abolish the simple right of veto is also entirely inappropriate.
In summary, I voted in favour of the report because of the fundamental underlying ideas, but I rejected part of recital G and items 5, 6, 11, 18, 33 and 35.
As regards the amendments that have been tabled, one that I felt it was crucial to support is NoÂ 8, which reiterates the idea of a universal ban on human cloning.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1734/94 on financial and technical cooperation with the Occupied Territories (West Bank and Gaza), but we believe that matters must be carefully followed up with a view to making it clear that appropriated EU funds will not be used for purposes other than those intended, for example for propaganda activities not designed to promote peace.
Â Â  . This report is intended to support the first proposal for a regulation that has been presented on financial and technical support for the Occupied Territories.
This means that the few amendments that have been tabled are confined to clarifying the content of the provisions.
The reportâs aim is merely to improve and provide legal clarification of the Commission text, from a technical point of view.
This is a subject area on which I believe there is broad consensus.
The aim is to provide assistance in cases of occupation, not only to States and regions, but also to local authorities, regional organisations, public agencies, local or traditional communities, organisations supporting business, private operators, cooperatives, mutual societies, associations, foundations and non-governmental organisations.
I give this proposal my unreserved support.
Incidentally, at its meeting of 12Â January 2004, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy unanimously adopted this draft legislative resolution.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . The âInternational Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agricultureâ is an important legally binding agreement which establishes a global framework for the sustainable conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.
I believe this to be an important new element in the multilateral system.
It is through such Treaties that we can ensure that all countries and all people have fair access to the worldâs resources which rightly belong to all humanity.
I support the amendment adopted by the Environment Committee, which we supported in the Agriculture Committee.
The basic principle as far as I am concerned, however, is that farmersâ and growersâ rights must be preserved.
They must remain free to grow crops which have been traditionally grown, without having to pay royalties.
Â Â  . Although the analysis of the Commission proposal carried out by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy led to only one amendment, the proposal is of enormous importance in the field of plant genetics.
This subject, which has been under discussion for a long time, was covered by the 2001 International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.
The purpose of this proposal for a Council decision is thus to ratify, on behalf of the Community, the aforementioned International Treaty.
The importance of adopting the report is reflected in the fact that 33 countries out of the 40 signatories have already ratified the International Treaty, which covers 35 food crops and 29 forages and establishes a legally binding framework for the sustainable conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.
Another clear indication of the reportâs importance is that it won the unanimous vote of the specialised parliamentary committee.
The intended aim is to allow access to these resources for all contracting parties, sharing the commercial and other benefits accruing from this access.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, the main issue at stake in the vote on the Fava and Sanders-ten Holte reports on the single European sky is to adopt rules on the organisation and use of European airspace with the aim of improving the operational capabilities, safety and punctuality of the air navigation services that are provided on a daily basis to thousands of consumers, including most of the Members of this Parliament.
The interinstitutional agreement that has been reached demonstrates that it was possible not only to improve the legal framework whilst respecting the Treaties, but also to accept the rights of Member States to exercise their sovereignty over airspace above their territories, to safeguard existing international agreements â such as the agreement, for example, that gives Portugal control over air traffic in the North Atlantic â to define, in agreement with the Member States involved, the flight information areas, known as âfunctional blocksâ, and to appoint the bodies that provide air navigation services.
Account was thus taken of the safety interests of air operations, the most important of all being: greater cooperation and technical interoperability, coordination with the military air authorities and the sovereign rights of the Member States in the field of air navigation.
I could only vote in favour of this convergence of views, which enabled such broad agreement to be reached between the unions and the operators, the national authorities and the Commission and between the Council and the European Parliament.
Â Â  â I support the purpose of the Single European Sky, which is to improve traffic flow and air traffic management alongside air safety.
However, we find the agreement reached in conciliation on the Single Sky unsatisfactory in several respects.
For example, the compromise that has been reached on civil-military cooperation is problematic.
Do I need to remind you that this is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity?
Military issues do not fall within the remit of the EU but of the Member States, which have their own defence policies and international obligations.
The Member States should be free to organise their rights over their airspace as they see fit.
As for creating and modifying functional blocks of airspace, I am delighted that this will be the responsibility of the Member States concerned with Eurocontrol providing technical support.
It is important that the Member States retain their right to make the final decision.
Let us bear in mind that the Single European Sky must not be detrimental to civil navigation as a public service or to the safety of European airspace.
Safety must not be sacrificed to an ever increasing quest for profits.
Â Â  â We are not entirely satisfied with the results of the conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the Single European Sky.
The texts put to the vote are nothing more than compromises between a liberal philosophy and safety requirements, with no mention of the prospect of a Single European Sky organised and controlled by European public services.
From the outset, we have supported and reported on the action taken by the European unions, who have tirelessly defended the general interest against these moves to transform the sky into a commodity.
By mobilising their forces and working with conviction, they had the principle of the non-separation of technical services accepted and ensured that the States retained responsibility for the functional blocks of airspace.
Finally, they obtained a commitment from the Commission to publish a review of the directive in five yearsâ time.
Without these concessions from the Council things would have been much worse.
However, in the light of the liberalisation of the other transport sectors, we remain very concerned about the future of public authority control over this sector, which is subject to fierce competition.
Moreover, the agreement leaves the Member States free to decide whether to entrust air traffic control to a public service or a private company.
Because of these concerns, we did not vote in favour of the results of the conciliation procedure.
Â Â  . Whilst I fully agree with the aims of the proposals we are now looking at, which are to reduce delays in European air transport through the more efficient use of Member Statesâ airspace and to maintain high levels of safety, I do have concerns that I have always voiced about the content of these proposals.
In this context I wish to refer to three crucial points in the agreement that has just been concluded: the decision that functional blocks will fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States, which cannot be changed by the European Union, the recognition that more efficient use of airspace depends on closer cooperation between civil and military organisations and the right of each Member State to have total freedom in appointing the service provider, under the auspices of the national supervisory authorities and without having to defer to any other body.
Â Â  . I voted in favour because I believe that implementing an effective common policy for air transport needs to be strengthened by current safety standards and the overall efficiency of air traffic in Europe in general.
In fact, without any real guarantees for the regularity and security of air transport services at European level, there will be no genuinely free movement of goods, people and services as enshrined in the Treaties.
Capacities must be improved so that they meet the needs of all airspace users and flight delays must be minimised.
These points further justify my position.
I welcome the realism that marks the joint text, because it finally provides some real progress from the Commissionâs initial proposals, which placed excessive limits on the sovereign power of States over their airspace and led to some confusion between issues relating to the common transport policy and those of a military nature.
On this matter, prudence dictates that national competences should be respected unreservedly, as should the international agreements that govern them, leaving any closer cooperation to the Member Statesâ discretion and supervision.
I therefore believe we would be justified in adopting safeguards that will enable each Member State to implement the necessary measures to protect key interests in the field of security and defence policy.
Â Â  . The proposal reached in conciliation answers some of the concerns we raised at the beginning of the process, such as that of sovereignty over airspace, since it was laid down that functional blocks will be defined by agreement between Member States.
In the event of a dispute, States will be able to appeal to the Single Sky Committee, and abide by its opinion, although the report could have gone further in clarifying the rules and principles that must be taken into account.
At the military level, consideration was given to the need for closer cooperation between civil and military authorities whilst respecting national competences.
Portugalâs control over the Santa Maria Flight Information Region (conferred by the International Civil Aviation Organisation) was also safeguarded.
It was also determined that the provision of air traffic services is related to the exercise of public authority prerogatives not of an economic nature, justifying the application of the competition rules as set out in the Treaty and that each Member State can, within its own airspace, appoint the service provider, be it public or private.
Nevertheless, there are some aspects that we proposed but were not accepted.
Hence our abstention from the vote.
Â Â  . What was really at stake in the vote on the Fava and Sanders-ten Holte reports on the single European sky was the adoption of rules on the framework and organisation of European airspace, aimed at enhancing the operational capability, safety and punctuality of the air navigation services provided daily to millions of consumers.
The interinstitutional agreement that was reached shows that it was possible to improve this regulatory framework, in accordance with the Treaties; to acknowledge the rights of Member States to exercise their sovereignty over the airspace above their territories; to safeguard existing international agreements, such as the agreement in force that gives Portugal (through its control centre on Santa Maria, in the Azores) control over North Atlantic air traffic; to establish flight information regions, known as functional airspace blocks, by means of agreement with the Member States concerned; and to license air navigation service providers.
Most importantly, emphasis was also placed on safety considerations, with increased technical cooperation and interoperability, coordination with the military aviation authorities and the sovereign rights of Member States in the sphere of air navigation.
I voted in favour and naturally welcome the meeting of minds that made it possible to âŠ
Â Â  . â The draft joint regulation currently before us has, out of the entire legislative package on the Single European Sky, given rise to more doubts at first reading than any other.
This regulation contains a separation of functions between national supervisory authorities and service providers, which will enable the various authorities to opt for the service provider of their choice, under a non-discriminatory system of charging.
Although it is acknowledged that the services in question are clearly of public interest, this option is extended to operators in the private sector too.
In its proposals, the Commission considered and addressed airspace management as if it were like any other economic service, comparable to the liberalised telecommunications or transport services markets, under the supervision of a European regulator.
The text that has been agreed on steers clear of this approach, because it not only expressly states that each Member State can, within its own airspace, designate a service provider of its choice â under the auspices of national supervisory authorities and without deferring to other bodies â as a means of protecting total freedom for the ways and means of achieving this.
I therefore voted in favour.
I would also highlight the introduction of the concept of âexperience in the fieldâ as a criterion for selecting organisations recognised by the national authorities, with mutual recognition of licences and the development of training programmes for controllers.
â Although the need for airspace to be delineated, regulated and strategically managed at European level is not in question, we must, at the very least, be cautious in this context about adopting functional airspace blocks (to replace the current flight information regions, where this is justified) that do not correspond to national borders.
It should be recalled that the Commissionâs original proposals completely ignored the unique and vital nature of the services in question and their relationship with the exercise of Member Statesâ public powers.
Nevertheless, the text now before us remedies these shortcomings by giving the Member States exclusive competence for delineating the functional blocks in question â since these cannot be changed by the EU â and acknowledges the need to ensure that minimum public interest requirements are met.
These will enable the best use to be made of airspace, taking account of air traffic flows and giving the various authorities the option to select a service provider of their own choosing.
I therefore voted in favour.
I share the rapporteurâs position on the need, in pursuing a common transport policy, for measures to be adopted on systems, components and procedures that will facilitate real interoperability of the European air traffic management network.
In fact, unless there is some harmonisation and standardisation of operational rules, on procedures and equipment â thereby ensuring complementarity and consistency for rules and standards â it will be hard to establish a network that actually benefits all Member States.
The low level of integration of national air traffic management systems and the slow rate of introducing the operational and technological standards necessary to obtain the sought-after additional capacity are the result of the fragmentation of the systems market and of the consequent lack of industrial cooperation.
This has led to unnecessary delays in developing and implementing new technologies and to a slow pace for introducing the means and concepts necessary for a much-needed increase in operational capacity.
I would emphasise that this interpretation does not mean sticking to uniform approaches; instead, it expresses the view that measures must be confined to what is strictly necessary to ensuring the desired interoperability.
I must also issue a warning about the risk of business concentration that adopting these measures could entail and I believe that, rightly ...
Â Â  . The aim of the proposal for a directive of 12Â July 2002 on public contracts is to open up public markets and to establish a European internal market in the sector, in line with the objectives of the âLisbon Strategyâ.
The award of public contracts generates a significant market that is highly tempting for the private sector.
It also constitutes an important instrument of economic policy with a potential socio-economic impact.
Once again, in the name of transparency, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, and with public companies at a disadvantage, the decisive factor in awarding contracts is price.
This leaves the markets wide open for foreign companies to come in, which may lead to job losses, undermine regional development and adversely affect national economies.
In Portugal, for example, there is a danger that more companies may go the way of the former Sorefame and the Viana do Castelo naval yards.
This instrument could, however, have introduced other criteria for awarding contracts and in so doing could have provided targeted support for certain countries or regions to pursue economic, social and environmental objectives chosen by individual countries.
In this regard, while we welcome recent decisions made by the Court of Justice, conferring on the contracting authority the right to select its criteria, the framework remains very limited.
We therefore voted against the common position of Parliament and the Council.
Â Â  . The aim of both proposals for directives, one general and the other sectoral, is to replace the four existing texts in order to simplify and modernise EU provisions relating to the award of public contracts.
This is something I naturally welcome.
The new provisions must ensure that the internal market works better and must ensure greater transparency in the awarding of contracts.
I therefore welcome the outcome finally achieved in Conciliation, particularly on the final point on which there was still a difference of opinion: defining criteria for awarding contracts.
The system has improved substantially and has become easier to understand, thereby facilitating the free movement of goods relating to public supply contracts, freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services relating to the award of public service contracts and of public works contracts in Member States by the State, regional and local authorities and other public bodies.
I also endorse the proposal to encourage the use of electronic signatures as a way of guaranteeing and reinforcing the confidentiality of proposals.
Lastly, I welcome the call, also agreed in Conciliation, for Member States to guarantee that these directives can be implemented using mechanisms that are effective, accessible and transparent.
Â Â  . The aim of the reform of legislation currently before us on public contracts in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors is to open up markets and to establish a genuine internal European market in these sectors.
The Commissionâs proposal for a directive of 12Â July 2002 complements the ongoing process of liberalisation in the energy, postal services and transport sectors, in line with the aims and targets set out in the âLisbon Strategyâ.
It also advocates opening up water management to the private sector.
In this regard, public contracts stand in stark contrast to public service supply and, in the case of water, their purpose is to guarantee a legal framework for awarding contracts to private firms, which is current practice in various local authorities in Portugal.
It is odd, to say the least, that in the report on services of general interest in the last plenary session, Parliament displayed its opposition to opening up the water supply market, while here it tacitly accepts such a move.
We therefore voted against the common position of the Council and Parliament, although we do acknowledge some improvements on the original proposal.
Â Â  â Two pieces of Community legislation are being amended today: one on the procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts and the other on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.
We find these changes, which are based on the principles of free competition in an open market, worrying, coming as they do at a time when France is moving towards greater decentralisation and is engaging in a national review of public procurement.
We want to ensure that the public services concerned continue to cover the same geographical area and provide the same services.
We are therefore voting against these two directives.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group voted against this agreement.
We agree that some good things were agreed in the review of the packaging directive.
However, there is a major problem in that the agreement itself violates the spirit of the landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice, in procedural terms both in terms of the substance and the letter of the European Treaties.
In February, the European Court of Justice ruled that waste incineration in municipal waste incinerators could not be counted as a form of recovery, even if energy was generated as a result.
The Council, however, instead of increasing recycling or environmentally sound recovery to meet the recovery target, insisted on putting incineration on an equal footing with recovery, contrary to the ECJ ruling.
Although this issue was not a subject for conciliation as no parliamentary amendment to the Councilâs common position had been adopted, by bringing it into the conciliation process the Council violated Article 251(4) of the EC Treaty.
My Group very much disagrees with the procedure and the result of the conciliation.
We also find it very alarming that incineration, which we consider detrimental to the environment, has actually now been included as something to aim for.
Â Â  . I commend the rapporteur for her excellent work on this crucial report.
I fully support the aims of the Commission proposal in this area.
We are all agreed that our consumer society is producing far too much waste packaging material and that various measures are needed to reduce the quantities.
Recycling clearly has a major role to play in this process.
Indeed, this strategy ties in well with the priorities of the Irish presidency in the environment area, recently outlined in Parliament by Minister Cullen.
I am pleased that the final agreement allows Ireland sufficient time to put the necessary infrastructure in place to deal with this important legislation.
As an island nation with a relatively small population, we have some very obvious disadvantages compared to our continental neighbours.
Our location puts us at considerable distance from the main recycling markets and there are extra shipping costs involved.
I am satisfied that the derogation secured by Ireland to the end of 2011 will afford us the opportunity to implement this directive in a meaningful way.
In conclusion, I also support other measures which seek to reduce packaging waste, such as targeted taxation suggested by the Irish presidency, for example to deal with fast-food packaging.
Â Â  . I endorse this report, which addresses a question that is crucial in terms of its impact on the lives of EU citizens.
The purpose of approving a new legal instrument, a directive, is to reduce the amount of packaging and other polluting waste products, by setting out a series of bolder objectives than those provided in the previous directive, which is still in force today.
The most significant moves are to raise the compulsory minimum level of recycling of packaging waste from 25% to 55% by 2008 and to provide a series of specific actions aimed at recovering and recycling the various materials commonly used in the manufacture of packaging.
I endorse the idea that return, collection and recovery systems in Member States must be open to all interested parties and must avoid discrimination against imported products and against heavier materials.
While I understand that, in the absence of adequate infrastructure, the targets that have been set are utterly unrealistic, I am bitterly disappointed that as far as my country is concerned, along with Greece and Ireland, the implementation of this new directive has been postponed until the end of 2011.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it is part of the European Parliamentâs legislative activities in the Community to undertake the difficult and sensitive role of controller of the executive authority in all of its forms.
When carrying out its tasks, it has to assess the gravity of the lapses that inevitably occur at any time and in any place as a result of human nature; it has to be conscientious in exercising control but must do so without stifling initiatives and, above all, it should act in the general interest and avoid taking sides.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament has not managed to comply with these rules, neither in the Eurostat affair nor in respect of the Committee of the Regions.
That is why I voted against.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to explain why our group, the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has abstained on Amendment No 1 in Mr Casacaâs report.
The word âabstentionâ is reminiscent of certain expressions commonly used in surveys such as âdo not know, no commentâ and, in this case, we believe that we Members of this Parliament do not yet know either the magnitude of the facts, in relation to Eurostat, or the possible responsibilities stemming from them.
And âno commentâ, in the sense that OLAF, a body responsible for combating fraud, has not provided this Parliament or any of its committees with adequate information in this regard, which could provide a detailed and complete picture of the situation.
Under these circumstances, a vote in favour of the amendment would imply that we had full knowledge of the facts and that as a result we were passing judgment in terms of certain responsibilities.
A vote against would also mean having knowledge of the facts and drawing a line under the issue as if it had already finished, without clarifying responsibilities.
It was therefore better to await any news which may arrive from OLAF.
I cannot end without saying that we believe Parliament has shown incoherence this morning, and the majority has rejected the individual responsibility of Commissioners, immediately after an individualised reference, which, in our opinion, is unfair, since it is untimely, partial and hasty.
We trust that OLAF will soon provide the information we need in order to issue a reasoned judgment.
Â Â  We believe that what is termed the Eurostat affair has revealed that reforms are required within the Commission regarding the control and monitoring of the EU authoritiesâ activities.
We believe, however, that to demand Commissioner Solbesâ resignation would be too far-reaching and not very constructive.
The Commission has acknowledged that mistakes have been made and, in our opinion, it is now up to the Commission, together with other institutions, to find models for a more effective and more transparent system of internal control.
If the Commission does not present a better system, a debate can begin about not granting discharge for 2002.
Â Â  .â I entirely endorse the Casaca report, which states that, at the time that Parliament gave discharge in respect of the budget for the 2001 financial year, it had not been made aware of certain important items of information, particularly on the Eurostat affair.
Like Mr Casaca, I denounce the Commissionâs withholding of information, its âculture of secrecy, complexity and lack of clarityâ, and the Commissionersâ failure to face up to their political responsibilities (paragraph 24).
It is necessary, though, to take this argument to its logical conclusion by also stating what has brought about this culture of opaqueness bordering on arrogance: it is a consequence of the privileged position accorded to the Commission among the institutions, and of the sense of superiority which follows from it, and it is this sense of superiority that it is desired to bolster by means of the European Constitution.
The Casaca report also highlights two other intolerable states of affairs.
The first of these is the Commissionersâ lack of any clear and effective authority over their directors-general (paragraph 29), which means that the Commissionâs departments have become fiefdoms in the true sense of the word.
There is also the Commissionâs consistent refusal to investigate the real ownership of companies applying for contracts and grants from the Commission, especially when there are strong suspicions that Commission officials are their true owners (paragraph 47).
Â Â  . This report concentrates mainly on the Eurostat case and the irregularities that have been detected since 1999.
Let us not forget that Eurostat has been reaping the consequences of the Commissionâs policy of outsourcing services, which has led to irregularities, fraud, nepotism and cronyism.
It is also true that services carried out by private firms have been of a lower quality than the Commissionâs internal services.
We welcome the proposals to keep Eurostat services in-house and to review current contracts.
As for relations between Eurostat and National Statistics Services, we must not overlook issues of data protection regarding information passed between administrations.
The recent case undermines the credibility of the Commissionâs administrative reform and shows the way in which internal information structures become corrupted, in which the prevailing culture of secrecy has given rise to âfinancial envelope systemsâ in Eurostat and in which the information and communication systems within the Commission have managed to remain oblique.
Consequently, we regret the fact that the President of the Commission did not propose structural changes to relations between Commissioners and directorates-general, that he did not reach any conclusions regarding the Commissionersâ political responsibilities and that he did not condemn Mr Solbes Mira, the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, for not acting sooner, in the face of mounting evidence of irregular financial management.
Â Â  I chose to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 13 to 17 and, in that way, went against the line taken by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
The reason for this is that these amendments are keenly critical of the serious irregularities at Eurostat.
I also voted in favour of Amendment NoÂ 21 which regrets the fact that Commissioner Solbes Mira, the Commissioner directly responsible for Eurostatâs administration, did not act sooner in response to the unsatisfactory state of affairs and that he did not accept political responsibility.
I also supported Amendment NoÂ 1, expressing the view that the accountability of the Commission would be strengthened in the future if the Commissioners accepted that they had individual political responsibility for their departments.
The report as such was constructive, however, and I therefore voted for it in the final vote.
The report was adopted by 467 votes in favour, with 11 votes against and 9 abstentions.
Â Â  .Satellite navigation is a particularly important space application with many uses: in shipping, in aircraft navigation, even in search and rescue operations.
The development of the Galileo satellite navigation system by the EU would be a contribution to mankind if, despite assurances that it is a purely non-military system, there was not every indication that the European imperialists also intend it to be used for military purposes, within the framework of their ambition to share the role of global policeman with the USA.
Among other things in yesterday's debate, Commissioner De Palacio mentioned that the system will have, over and above the signals to which everyone will have access, some signal to which only the states will have access.
Although the report by Mr Pietrasanta has several positive points in comparison with previous reports on this matter, it leaves a number of questions on military use unanswered.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote.
Â Â  I voted against the resolution on European Space Policy as all amendments concerning the need to guarantee the peaceful use of outer-space were not carried.
This illustrates the real intentions lying behind the desire for an EU space policy - it is driven by the desire to establish the EU as a military superpower.
The inclusion of China in EU space policy, and Galileo in particular, is not acceptable until China becomes a fully democratic state and recognises basic human rights.
Galileo was sold to the European Parliament as a civil project, and that is what it should remain.
This is one of the main arguments in favour of a European satellite system given that the American GPS system is a military project which the US Government can jam at any moment.
With the inclusion of the fifth application - the Public Regulated Service or PRS - it is impossible to guarantee that this encrypted signal, which is reserved for the State, will not be used for military purposes.
Given its future military application and China's inclusion in the project I voted against the report.
Â Â  . As stated in the Commissionâs original proposal, this technology has clear strategic importance and may also generate significant economic benefits.
The current systems in the US (GPS) and Russia (GLONASS) are both financed and run by the military, which means that signals may be interrupted or tampered with at any moment in order to protect the national interest.
Galileo straightaway has the distinction of being a strictly civilian project, and so it must remain.
It is, moreover, increasingly seen as an important means of protecting nature and of managing and conserving natural resources.
We are already seeing its uses in agriculture and in civil defence (helping to select crops or predicting natural disasters).
Other areas such as air, sea and river transport will benefit enormously from the emergence of this European technology.
I welcome the fact that the project is on schedule, and the fact that EGNOS, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service â a system intended to strengthen the GPS signal, especially in civil aviation â is expected to be fully operational by April 2004.
I should lastly like to underline the need to ensure that it remains free or almost free for users of basic services ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the European Parliamentâs adoption today of the new resolution on the Draft European Constitution is a tacit recognition that it was wrong to ask the Italian Presidency to achieve the impossible, which is what it did in the proposal that we adopted in December.
The European Parliament would grow in stature if it were to acknowledge this explicitly, but no one is perfect.
It also goes without saying that the European Parliament should at least examine the written results of the Naples Conclave before expressing an opinion on their value, which it has just done, because these written results were submitted to the Heads of State or Government by the Italian Presidency.
I deplore the fact that in almost two months, Parliament still has not considered doing so.
Having said this, the Draft Constitution remains a bad and dangerous initiative and I still do not see any reason therefore to hope that it will be adopted at either Easter or Trinity.
That is why I voted against.
Â Â  Mr President, I also voted against this resolution.
It is not in the interests of European citizens or in the interests of the European Union as whole.
It is regrettable that there is such a mad rush to finalise this by May.
It is completely unacceptable.
The Convention was not set up specifically to draft a constitution for Europe.
Something like this needs a lot more time.
There needs to be a lot more consultation with the public in general: that is why I voted against it.
It is also regrettable if the Irish presidency is being forced and pressurised into finding some agreement on this during its term of office.
It is wrong to imply that somehow the Irish presidency may be a failure if this issue does not go through.
There is plenty of time: we have years to go in relation to this.
Let the ten new countries in and let them find their feet first before we start rushing into further European integration.
Â Â  .â In its resolution on the Irish presidencyâs programme, Parliament is attempting to rush the IGCâs negotiations by demanding that it finalise a text for the Constitution before 1 May 2004, which is the date of enlargement.
I did not vote in favour of this demand, as the Member States must be allowed time to see precisely where this bad document would take them.
The Councilâs statements, however, have shown us that it has had a sudden attack of the scruples over the plan for a single statute for MEPs.
I can do no other than take satisfaction in this, having for years been a constant opponent of this plan for reasons that can all be found in my previous interventions, notably those on 17 December of last year.
The Council, which had for years turned a deaf ear to these arguments, has suddenly started to listen to them as the elections draw near.
Whereas, until now, it appeared to entertain the idea of making MEPs financially independent of their countries, the prospect of the votersâ dissatisfaction with this improper inducement has brought it to its senses.
I conclude that this is much the same thing as is happening with the draft European Constitution.
Elections are the beginning of wisdom.
Â Â  . Pressure aimed at forcing through the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ is coming from all sides; from government representatives â special mention here goes to France and Germany â from the Commission, Parliament, and from the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations in Europe (UNICE), which has reaffirmed its eagerness for âurgent agreement on the EU draft Constitutionâ.
In light of the first ministerial-level meeting of the Irish Presidency, which centred on what should be done in the near future â and in which, according to the minutes..., the proposal of the âEuropean Constitutionâ as a basis for negotiation drafted by the âConventionâ and the desire to reach agreement before Parliamentary elections in June will have been reaffirmed â Parliament once again welcomes such an approach and urges reaching agreement by 1Â May.
The forces and interests behind the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ â namely, major capital and the most powerful countries in the EU â have once again begun to mobilise.
All of which vindicates those of us who have been the first to denounce the real motives and the real dangers of the âEuropean Constitutionâ and the first to call for it to be rejected out of hand.
Â Â  . The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs clearly endorses the aims of competition policy, namely to establish free, competitive and open markets, and to promote the completion of the internal market.
Stressing the primacy of competition over other considerations, be they economic, social or environmental, results in policies aimed at liberalising and deregulating the markets, in addition to a fundamental bias against State intervention in the economy, especially through State aid.
This proposal welcomes the 32nd Report on Competition Policy; it endeavours to reduce the procedures for monitoring company mergers; it endeavours to impose stricter controls on State aid, and indeed fights to reduce this type of aid; it welcomes the opening up of the gas and electricity markets; it foments mistrust of publicly owned companies; it calls for the media sector to be open and competitive and calls for overcompensations in public service broadcasting to be monitored; it seeks to create a new institutional chamber to speed up the processes of competition policy; it seeks to hold periodic calls for tender to award contracts for services of general interest.
This is why we voted against the resolution.
Â Â  â This resolution is a veritable eulogy of the globalist policy of free trade that is decimating our industry and our jobs and as such is an insult to the men and women who, each day, pay the highest possible price for the consequences of this ultra-liberal European economic policy, from which only a handful of faceless and stateless shareholders benefit.
Entrusted to European civil servants who kowtow to the powerful lobbies emerging in Brussels, European competition policy is the main vector for ultra-liberal globalisation in our countries.
Bureaucratic control of cartels, abuses of dominant position and concentrations; strict supervision of public aids disbursed to companies in difficulty; submission of public services to market rule; dismantling of customs protection which, in the past, safeguarded our economic interests: the record of the European Commission and its accomplices is absolutely disastrous.
As someone who comes from a region of France that has fallen victim to this absurd policy, I know what all of this neglect has cost the French in terms of relocation, a decline in industrial activity (textiles, steel and agri-food), the destruction of SMEs and, of course, in terms of unemployment, insecurity and poverty.
That is why, contrary to the representatives of the bankruptcy association sitting on the right and left of this House, I categorically reject this text.
Â Â  Mr President, the link between the common foreign and security policy and space policy is very clear, both in the Commission's White Paper and in the resolution.
A lot of people think this is quite acceptable, but I do not think it is acceptable that the European Union should want to be a military super power.
To be a credible military super power, of course, it needs a space policy.
The Galileo technology is a very precise type of technology which will be used for military means.
There are a lot more important areas into which EU resources could be going, rather than this: it is clearly in the interests of the military.
It is completely unacceptable that the space policy and EU resources should be funding and facilitating military expansion or the development of new military weapons.
But is it right that European taxpayersâ money should be going into something like this when people all over Europe are crying out for essential social needs?
Such huge resources are being poured into this and it is not acceptable.
That is why I do not support it.
Â Â  .The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution on space policy in accordance with everything I said in my position yesterday and, furthermore, because the amendments which we proposed against the use of space for military purposes and to serve defence and security policy were not accepted.
We condemn the position of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (including New Democracy) which voted almost in its entirety against the amendments, as well as the stand taken by the socialist group (including PASOK) which, while voting in favour of the amendment which accepted the principle of the use of space solely for peaceful purposes, at the same time voted against an identical amendment opposing the use of space for military activities!
We believe that this inconstant behaviour is not the result of a split personality.
It is simply an artifice, an attempt to muddy the waters, an alibi to cover their all-round support for the militarisation of the European Union and the militarisation of space.
Â Â  We have today voted in favour of the present resolution on EU space policy, just as we previously supported the own-initiative report on the Commissionâs Green Paper on European space policy on 9Â October 2003 and the report on Europe and space on 17Â January 2002.
We would however emphasise that the EUâs commitment to the area of space policy should be based upon the agreement between the EC and the European Space Agency (ESA) from 2003 and be limited to the competence the EU now has in the area of space research.
We reject an increased EU competence planned to be included in the treaty for establishing a European Constitution.
European industrial cooperation in the area of space should mainly be conducted on an intergovernmental basis in accordance with the Convention for the establishment of a European Space Agency.
Â Â  . I feel that it is very important that cooperation should be extended between EU Member States and other European States that have a formidable tradition in research in this field, such as Russia, and countries further afield, in order to harness the potential for space exploration for peaceful purposes.
This will make a significant contribution towards addressing the serious problems and meeting the urgent needs faced by the human race.
I therefore deplore the fact that most Members of this House voted against the proposals for amendments tabled by my group, which sought to ensure that âspace must be used solely for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of the entire human raceâ and which vehemently oppose âany use of space for developing or supporting military activitiesâ.
We are equally appalled that this House has called on the EU to make âa significant financial commitment that specifically provides for developing space-based research into global securityâ, acknowledging the contribution that the âspace policy could make to Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policyâ and calling for defence-related companies to coordinate programmes in order to achieve this objective.
Space policy would thus become part of the framework of the militarisation of space, something that I find deeply worrying.
I therefore voted against.
Â Â  â As usual, the European Parliament has debated the future of an industrial sector without considering the workers who keep it going, if only in a secondary role.
For us, it is not a question of knowing whether that sector is competitive or not compared with products from elsewhere, and even less of advising the owners of the companies concerned how to become more competitive.
Whether the textiles industry is competitive or not, it is deplorable that 850Â 000 jobs should have been axed!
We are opposing this text, not because the textiles industry needs to be protected, but because its workers do, in the same way that we need to protect workers in other sectors, such as aeronautics or information technology, which are laying off just as many staff because they need to modernise.
We are against the stupid market economy and against competition, for which the company owners and shareholders make the workers pay the full cost.
In this competitive environment, it is not only the workers in poor countries, exploited and forced to earn low salaries, who lose out, but also the workers in the so-called rich countries, who are thrown out onto the streets by their employers.
All the more reason why we are against workers in different countries being forced to compete against each other.
Â Â  . I am delighted that the EP resolution before us includes two of my proposals, which I consider to be important means of supporting the textiles and clothing sector in the EU and in Portugal.
The first of these is to create a specific Community programme for the sector â with appropriate support mechanisms â especially for less favoured regions that depend on the sector, aimed at boosting research, innovation, vocational training and SMEs.
The second is to set up a Community programme to stimulate brand creation and to encourage product promotion further afield, such as at international trade fairs.
I regret the fact, however, that other proposals were not accepted, such as the need for a genuine action plan that is specific, cohesive and clear, with regard to instruments, financial means and a timetable; the need for a production chain mentality; and the need for a sectoral approach in negotiations with the WTO, so that the sector does not simply become a bargaining chip.
I also deplore the fact that the liberalisation approach has not been called into question and I am gravely concerned about the risks of relocation in the sector.
A thorough evaluation must be carried out into the impact of unbridled liberalisation in the sector, especially now that the Textiles and Clothing Agreement has come to an end and that China has joined the WTO.
Â Â  I take note of the Commission Communication on the future of the textiles and clothing sector in the European Union.
I cannot but support the parliamentary resolution on this issue.
Faced with the challenges and dangers represented by the end of quotas on imports, the recent entry of China into the WTO, âimminentâ completion of the Doha round and the enlargement of the European Union, it is our duty to act to protect this sector.
We can only encourage the measures that seek to favour new information and communication technologies and training.
Adaptability is essential in this sector where methods change so much.
It is an essential competitive advantage faced with imports from Asia.
Research is, of course, equally essential.
All this is not, however, enough to preserve a viable textile sector in Europe because China is also committed to research and to products with a high added value and never has any difficulty in quickly copying our innovations.
This is why I particularly support the amendments calling for real support for the European textile and clothing sector and of the regions that are home to it through a specific Community programme.
Â Â  . I welcome and endorse the motion for a resolution on the future of the European textiles and clothing sector.
After the impending enlargement and liberalisation, I sincerely hope that the recommendations contained in this proposal do not turn out to be mere declarations of good intent and are in fact translated into visible, concrete action.
This is the only way in which jobs can be guaranteed in the sector and in which we can safeguard what remains of Europeâs textiles and clothing industry.
The unilateral abolition of import quotas, set for 1Â January 2005, places the textiles industries of EU Member States on an unequal footing compared with other producers around the world.
International trade will only be free, fair and equal if some measure of reciprocity can be guaranteed.
The EU and its Member States must establish support programmes and incentives for SMEs, so as to stimulate investment in research and development.
I also welcome the greater emphasis that will be placed on problems related to protecting intellectual and industrial property, and most importantly on the fight against counterfeiting.
I feel that greater attention should be paid to the case of China.
Specific measures must be taken to combat Chinaâs hegemony in the textiles and clothing sector.
Only high quality production will give the European industry competitive clout in the current context, given ...
Â Â  That concludes the vote.(2)
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  Mr Secretary-General, President-in-Office of the Council, High Representative, Commissioners, colleagues and distinguished guests, it is a great pleasure for me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to welcome here today the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan.
I would also like to welcome the previous Sakharov Prize laureates who join us today: the President of East Timor, Mr Xanana GusmÃ£o; the President of Kosovo, Mr Ibrahim Rugova; from China, Mr Wei Jingsheng; from Algeria, Ms Salima Ghezali; from Spain, representatives of Â¡Basta Ya!; and from Angola, Dom Zacharias Kamwenho.

Allow me also to recall some laureates who are absent: her continuing fight for freedom and democracy in her own country prevents Aung San Suu Kyi from joining us; from Turkey, Leyla Zana sends greetings of support and solidarity; in Cuba and not free to attend, Oswaldo PayÃ¡ sends his greetings.

This is an important occasion for the European Parliament, both symbolic and solemn.
Symbolic, because today affords us, the European Parliament and the United Nations, an opportunity to mark and to celebrate the values and the public purpose that we share and hold in common.
Ours is a Union based on values of pluralist democracy, respect for the rule of law, the promotion of individual and minority rights, solidarity, sustainability, open economy and respect for cultural diversity.
Arguably, our European Union is the most successful conflict resolution process the world has seen and we are proud of that.
This House strongly believes in the value and worth of the United Nations and its Charter, and in multilateralism.
We are resolved to make our positive contribution to ensure that, in meeting the challenges and duties of the 21st century, multilateralism can and shall be effective.
We support the fight against global terrorism, but we also insist on recognising the duty to fight against global poverty.
As regards weapons of mass destruction, we stand firmly on the side of non-proliferation, but our instinctive European response is for engagement and not for isolation.
We have a responsibility to the security of our citizens in the Union to ensure that our borders are not porous or open to international trafficking and crime, and yet we also have a duty before humanity not to be a 'fortress Europe'.
Let me tell you, Mr Secretary-General, that as Europeans, our Union and its Member States are proud to be the largest donor community of untied development assistance, humanitarian aid and food aid in the world.
We are proud of what we do, but we accept that we could and should do more.
We in the Parliament are proud of our commitment in this Union to the politics of sustainability â locally and globally â not least in our constant promotion of the Kyoto Protocol.
Our belief in the rule of law has galvanised this House into being one of the earliest, most consistent and most vocal supporters of the International Criminal Court.
I can tell you, Mr Secretary-General, that we should prefer the due process of the International Criminal Court, any day, to the absence of due process in Guantanamo Bay.
Our pledge to you today, Mr Secretary-General, is for Europe, in all of its manifestations, to be a reliable regional partner for the United Nations and what it stands for.
Of course, today sees us gathered here, not just for its symbolic value, but also for a solemn purpose.
On 19Â August 2003, in Baghdad, terrorism reached a new low, when 22 of your colleagues paid the ultimate price in the service of peace and international humanity.
Joining us today â and I would ask those who can to stand and be recognised â are the relatives of some of those who paid that price, and some of the survivors.
I should like to welcome to our Chamber Mrs Annie de Mello, widow of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and her son Mr Laurent de Mello; Ms Rula Al-Farra, sister of Ms Reham Al-Farra; and Mr LuÃ­s MartÃ­n-Oar and his wife.
As I remarked, we are also joined today by a number of those who survived that vicious assault: Ms Nada Al-Nashif, Mrs Mona Rishmawi and Professor Gil Loescher, you are also very welcome here today.
You honour us with your presence today.
Permit me to say to all of you that we know we cannot compensate your loss, but I hope you now understand that we have felt it.
Finally, Mr Secretary-General â and this is why we are solemnly gathered here today â I should like to say to you on behalf of this Parliament that for defending freedom and for promoting the values we have in common, it is my privilege to award to you, the United Nations, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for that very kind introduction.
Members of the European Parliament, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen and dear friends, I am deeply touched that you have honoured my friend and colleague, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and the many other UN staff who lost their lives in working for peace in the world.
I am proud to accept the Sakharov prize in memory of them.
This prize for freedom of thought is not only a worthy recognition of the ultimate sacrifice that they made in the cause of peace.
It is also a welcome acknowledgement of the kinds of people they were.
The brave men and women we lost in Baghdad on 19 August â UN staff and others â were free spirits and free thinkers and also soldiers of humanity and of peace.
Earlier, President Cox and I met some of the survivors of the attack and family members of those who were killed or injured.
They are with us in the Chamber now.
I thank them for joining us today and I accept this prize in their name too.
I also thank you, President Cox, and all of you, as Members of the European Parliament, for inviting these special people to share this occasion.
It is a gesture that speaks volumes about the solidarity of the European Union with the United Nations.
Like many who survived the blast, the United Nations itself carries deep wounds.
But our determination is stronger than ever, and we value the solidarity of friends like you.
You showed your commitment this morning, when you adopted a resolution to strengthen the EUâs political and financial support for the United Nations.
In its long history, Europe has seen more than its fair share of war, tyranny and terrible suffering.
But Europeans have replaced that with a future of hope.
You have pursued the path of peace through multilateralism.
And today, the European Union is a shining light of tolerance, human rights, and international cooperation.
After 1 May this year, that light will shine even brighter.
When you enlarge to 25 Member States, you will cross a divide between east and west that once seemed unbridgeable.
Enlargement is the greatest force for peace on the European continent.
The hope for further enlargement in years to come promises to build other bridges of cooperation and understanding â including between the West and Islam, and between peoples who have fought each other in bloody wars.
As time goes by, the continent is also experiencing an enlargement of what it means to be European.
I look forward to the day when Europe rejoices as much in diversity within States as it does in diversity between them.
Many of your societies are already very diverse.
But all of your societies â and many others around the world too â will become more diverse in the decades to come.
This is the inevitable result of the movement of people across international borders.
That movement is not going to stop.
As an international community, we need to manage the movement of people across borders far better than we do ...
... not just for the sake of those who move, but for the sake of the countries they leave behind and those they travel through and those they migrate to.
People migrate today for the same reasons that tens of millions of Europeans once left your shores â they flee war or oppression, or they leave in search of a better life in a new land.
Those who are forced out of their homes â the refugees who flee in fear for their safety â are our collective legal and moral responsibility.
We have an agreed legal framework for their protection â the 1951 Refugee Convention.
However, when refugees cannot seek asylum because of offshore barriers, or are detained for excessive periods in unsatisfactory conditions, or are refused entry because of restrictive interpretations of the Convention, the asylum system is broken and the promise of the Convention is broken too.
Your asylum system needs the resources to process claims fairly, quickly, and openly so that refugees are protected and solutions found for them.
European States need to move towards a system of joint processing and sharing of responsibilities.
Along with others, the EU must also help strengthen the capacity of poor countries to provide protection and solutions for refugees.
After all, seven out of ten refugees seek refuge in developing countries, where resources are far more stretched and human rights standards more uneven.
If we ignore this fact, there is a missing link in our approach to refugees â as Professor Gil Loescher, who survived the Baghdad blast and is with us here today, has rightly pointed out.
Most immigrants are not refugees.
We call them voluntary migrants â and some of them truly are.
However, many leave their home countries not because they really want to, but because they see no future at home.
It is our shared duty to do what we can to ensure that there are more opportunities in developing countries.
If we truly forge a global partnership for development, in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, we will do a lot to reduce the incentive for people to leave.
Your asylum systems are overburdened precisely because many people who feel they must leave see no other channel through which to migrate.
Many others try more desperate and clandestine measures, and are sometimes injured or even killed â suffocating in trucks, drowning at sea, or perishing in the undercarriage of aircraft.
The lucky ones who get in often find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, and alienated from society.
Some resort to people smugglers to assist their journey.
Others fall victim to traffickers â especially women, who are forced into prostitution in a modern form of sex slavery, and become acutely vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.
This silent human rights crisis shames our world.
It also generates billions of dollars for shadowy networks of organised criminals, who subvert the rule of law in all societies where they operate.
It is the sovereign right of all states to decide which voluntary migrants they will accept, and on what terms.
But we cannot simply close our doors, or shut our eyes to this human tragedy.
The situation is all the more tragic given that many States which close their doors actually immigrants.
Here in Europe, your birth rates and death rates have dropped dramatically.
Your populations are getting smaller and growing older.
Without immigration, the population of the soon-to-be 25 Member States of the EU â 452 million in 2000 â would drop to under 400 million people by 2050.
Some states â such as Italy, Austria, Germany and Greece â would see their populations drop by around a quarter.
That would mean that one in three Italians, for example, would be over the age of 65 â nearly double the proportion today.
Were this to happen, jobs would go unfilled and services undelivered.
Your economies would shrink and your societies could stagnate.
Many other countries â from Japan, to the Russian Federation, to South Korea â face the same problem.
There is no simple solution to this problem.
But immigration is inevitably an important part of the solution.
I would therefore encourage European states to open up greater avenues for legal migration ...
... for skilled and unskilled workers, for family reunification and economic improvement, for temporary and permanent migrants.
Poor countries reap benefits from migration too â through remittances.
The amounts which migrant workers send back to their countries of origin are growing fast.
In 2002, in formal remittances alone, migrants from developing countries sent back at least USD 88 billion to their countries of origin â that is 54% more than the USD 57 billion those same countries received in overseas development assistance.
Do not get me wrong, I do not pretend that migration is without problems.
Immigrants bring to their host communities different cultures and customs, different languages and religions. This is a source of enrichment, but it can be a source of discomfort â and even of division and alienation.
The challenge of integration is real.
Almost every large new immigrant group has been reviled to some degree in the early days of its establishment.
The experience of some immigrants today is reminiscent of the hostility that the Huguenots once faced in England, as did the Germans, the Italians and the Irish in the United States, and the Chinese in Australia.
But the longer perspective is almost always far more positive.
Integration is a two-way street.
Immigrants must adjust to their new societies â and societies must adjust too.
The word 'integrate' literally means 'to make whole'.
That is the imperative for Europe today.
Integration of the immigrants who have become permanent members of European society is essential for their productivity and human dignity.
It is also essential for the functioning of healthy, humane democracies.
They cannot extract the labour of immigrants and ignore other aspects of their humanity.
The great Swiss writer Max Frisch said of the European 'guest worker programmes' of the 1960s: 'We wanted workers, but we got people'.
Acknowledging and responding to that reality is one of your central challenges â a reality that is reflected in the United Nations Migrant Workers Convention, which I urge European states, and indeed all states, to sign and ratify.
Migration can also cause challenges for the countries migrants leave behind.
Yes, they may gain remittances.
However, if they lose contact with their diasporas, they can lose some of their best and brightest talent.
This opens up new vistas for international cooperation.
After all, just as developing countries often want to attract emigrants back home, developed countries often have an interest in immigrants returning home after a period of time.
International cooperation on this and other issues is key to managing migration better.
In the effort to build better international cooperation, you in the European Union should be where you belong â in the lead.
You have already given more thought than most regions to this issue â and the Tampere framework is a basis on which to forge a common European policy.
Combating illegal immigration should be part of a much broader agenda â an agenda to harness the benefits of immigration, rather than vainly trying to stop it.
But sometimes, the breadth of the agenda has been lost amidst shrill debates about clamping down on illegal immigration â as though that were the major purpose of migration policy.
The public has been fed images of a flood of unwelcome entrants, and of threats to their societies and identities.
In the process, immigrants have sometimes been stigmatised, vilified, even de-humanised.
In the process, an essential truth has also been lost. The vast majority of immigrants are industrious, courageous and determined.
They do not want a free ride. They want a fair opportunity.
They are not criminals or terrorists. They are law-abiding.
They do not want to live apart. They want to integrate, while retaining their identity.
Only through cooperation â bilateral, regional and global â can we build the partnerships between receiver and sender countries that are in the interests of both; explore innovations to make migration a driver for development; fight smugglers and traffickers effectively and agree on common standards for the treatment of immigrants and the management of migration.
That is why I am particularly glad that, last month, the Global Commission on International Migration was established.
The Commission is itself a welcome instance of North-South cooperation, co-chaired by distinguished public figures from Sweden and South Africa.
I thank all states who are supporting this vital work and I hope it will help promote greater public understanding. Above all, I hope it will win broad acceptance for a better normative and institutional framework for managing migration at the global level â a framework that has human rights at its centre.
But the most essential ingredient of all is leadership.
You, as Members of the European Parliament, have a vital role to play in providing that leadership.
The message is clear.
Migrants need Europe, but Europe also needs migrants.
A closed Europe would be a meaner, poorer, weaker, older Europe.
An open Europe will be a fairer, richer, stronger, younger Europe â provided you manage migration well.
We must not minimise the difficulties that migration can bring.
But let us also rejoice in the enormous contribution that migrants have made in science, academia, sports, the arts, and government â including some of you as Members of this Parliament.
And let us remember that, without migrants, many health systems would be short-staffed; many parents would not have the home help they need to pursue careers; many jobs that provide services and generate revenue would go unfilled and many societies would age and shrink.
Migrants are part of the solution, not part of the problem.
They should not be made the scapegoats for a vast array of social ills.
The European Unionâs anthem, Beethovenâs 'Ode to Joy', speaks of the day when all humans will become brothers.
If Sergio Vieira de Mello were with us today â and, indeed, if Andrei Sakharov were too â they would say to you what I say to you: the people who move across borders today, in search of a better life for themselves and their families, are our brothers and our sisters too. Let us treat them that way.
In that spirit, in all our common endeavours, let the European Union and the United Nations be beacons of hope for a better future for all mankind.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is a signal honour to take part in this sitting of the European Parliament for the award of the 2003 Sakharov prize to Secretary-General Annan and the entire United Nations staff, and to commemorate in particular Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello and the many other UN officials who lost their lives in the performance of their duties.
I can think of no more appropriate designation of a prize for freedom of thought than the name of Andrei Sakharov. And I can think of no more fitting recipient of this prize than Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues.
The enduring value of the Sakharov prize is that it evokes continually the memory and example of an outstanding human rights advocate who lived and worked in circumstances where such advocacy was considered an act of dissidence.
This prize in his name sends out every year a clear signal of support from Europe to those who are struggling for peace and human rights, often in the face of significant hostility and in conditions of personal risk.
I believe therefore that the Parliament has made a wise and kind choice in reflecting on and commemorating the enormous sacrifices made by UN personnel in the cause of peace and justice.
On 19 August 2003 we were all horrified at the appalling attack on the lives of UN personnel in their headquarters in Baghdad.
Those who carried out this attack struck a violent and cowardly blow at the people best placed and most committed to bringing relief to the Iraqi people.
The loss of Sergio Vieira de Mello was a cause of particular sadness.
In my own country, as in many others, the outstanding work done by Mr Vieira de Mello on behalf of the UN, especially in Timor Leste, was widely known and enormously regarded.
I know that he would have made an enormous contribution as High Commissioner for Human Rights.
UN personnel throughout the world perform heroic and often unheralded work.
It is in many ways a pity that the prevailing image of the UN derives so much from the moments of vertiginous political drama in and around the chamber of the Security Council.
This image misses the depth of the commitment of many unknown UN officials throughout the world, acting as peacekeepers, providing assistance to refugees, developing human rights capacity, coordinating emergency humanitarian assistance and protecting the rights of women and the marginalised.
The Millennium Summit Declaration referred to the United Nations as âthe common house of the entire human familyâ.
UN staff, in their daily working lives, demonstrate the truth of this description.
We are indebted to Secretary-General Annan on many levels and for many things.
This morning, of course, I would draw attention to the courage and the clarity with which he has addressed the challenges facing the multilateral system and role that migration policy can play in it.
At the General Assembly last September the Secretary-General characterised the position to which the UN had come as âa fork in the roadâ.
And as recently as last weekend at the World Economic Forum the Secretary-General noted that the conduct of international politics had become less favourable to the maintenance of a stable, equitable and rule-based international order and that the role of the UN itself and the system of collective security were under serious strain.
It is because of the urgency of this threat that the Council has recommitted itself to effective multilateralism.
A stronger, international society, a rules-based international order and strong international institutions are critically important EU objectives.
Central to this is the EU support for a strengthened UN.
Intensified and effective cooperation between the EU and the UN is a central priority for this presidency.
It is imperative that the UN be given the means to meet successfully the many and varied challenges of today.
As the Secretary-General said in his report last year on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, human rights are universal principles, but inspiring as those principles are, they do not implement themselves.
The multilateral system embodied in the UN Charter is the only way that human rights and humanitarian law can be effectively defended.
It provides the only real means of addressing the varied threats of today: terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, poverty, hunger and disease; together with new, or rather growing, challenges such as migration â to which the Secretary-General has made particular reference today.
It is only through being multilateralist that effective action can be taken to meet the Millennium Development Goals, for example, so that the glaring inequalities and unremitting human suffering which in turn create and foster so many threats to peace and security can be meaningfully addressed.
It is entirely in character that the Secretary-General did not use this occasion to indulge the plaudits that inevitably and rightly come with prestigious prizes such as this.
Instead he has chosen to direct our attention to the challenges of a major pressing issue, that of migration.
This is an issue with which my own country has endured historical experience accumulated through generations who migrated from Ireland and made lives for themselves abroad.
It is now an issue of major global significance which needs to be put higher up the international agenda.
Globalisation has given rise to an unprecedented movement of people, in turn giving rise to unparalleled challenges.
Like the Secretary-General I welcome the establishment last month of the Global Commission on International Migration.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Lubbers attended the informal meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Dublin on Thursday last, at which there was a constructive discussion of proposed European asylum and migration legislation.
This was very useful and we look forward to building on this valuable dialogue with such an important partner, the United Nations.
In October 1999 the European Council in Tampere agreed on the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the EU, firmly rooted in our shared commitment to human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law.
This freedom is not the exclusive preserve of the Unionâs own citizens. It must also be available to those whose circumstances lead them justifiably to seek access to our territory.
In its proposals and actions on immigration and asylum, the Union is committed to taking account of both the humanitarian and economic aspects and to ensuring full respect for the human rights-based principles enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and other international norms.
We must confront this challenge with effective action based on our ambition in 1999 to complete this agenda by the middle of this year.
For the European Union, the United Nations is more than a political affiliation.
As the Nobel Committee stated in awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Kofi Annan and the United Nations staff in 2001, it granted the prize âto proclaim that the only negotiable route to global peace and cooperation goes by way of the United Nationsâ.
We are deeply grateful therefore to the Secretary-General for his ceaseless work in defending the multilateral system.
We wish to record our deep appreciation of the UN staff all over the world serving the cause of peace and justice, human rights and development.
And we remember those among the UN staff who have given their lives in this cause.
Therefore, Mr. President, let me join you in commending the award of the Sakharov Prize to the United Nations Secretary-General and his staff.
Â Â  .
Mr President, it is, on behalf of the Commission, a particular pleasure to be able to say a few words today as the Secretary-General receives the Sakharov Prize on behalf of the United Nations. It is a particular pleasure because it is extremely difficult to recall another occasion on which the aims of an award and its recipient have cohered so perfectly.
Checking the statute of the prize, I found that it can be awarded for particular achievement in any of four fields: defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, safeguarding the rights of minorities, respect for international law, and the development of democracy and the implementation of the rule of law. By my reckoning, that means we should today be awarding the prize four times over.
It is being given, of course, in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, and his life exemplified those values.
Its barbaric curtailment leaves the world a good deal poorer.
Sergio Vieira de Mello was an extraordinary man.
I was privileged to see his work at first hand, in Hong Kong, in Kosovo and in East Timor.
He was gallant, he was wise, he was dashing, he was principled and he was immensely effective.
We are very fortunate that the UN is blessed with other, equally talented individuals, and is led by one as well.
Kofi Annan has made an immense contribution to furthering the effectiveness of the UN â and its constituent parts â where it matters: on the ground, across the globe.
Under his authority, both in overseeing its peacekeeping operations, and subsequently as Secretary-General, the UN has brought protection, comfort and hope to millions.
The Secretary-General has done this in the face of unprecedented challenges to the authority and even the fundamental rationale of the organisation.
He has consistently risen to and overcome those challenges, unflinching and with his dignity wholly intact.
Right from the start, with the renewal of the United Nations plan for reform, through the review of peacekeeping operations, the Millennium Report, the call to action on HIV/AIDS and the establishment of the current Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, the Secretary-General has ensured that our collective focus is in the right place at the right time.
He does so once again today with his words on our obligation to develop a viable humane approach to asylum and immigration.
I make this point as one, like many in this House, who is a descendant of migrants â in my case, of those who fled from the famine and hunger in Ireland in the 19th century to which the Minister referred.
The Secretary-General has reinvigorated the staple work of the UN institutions, the work that is done by those all-too-frequently unsung heroes: promoting economic development, feeding the hungry and educating the world.
And he has ensured that this work responds flexibly to challenges never imagined by the founders of the UN: political challenges, military challenges, even medical challenges.
I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that the Secretary-Generalâs personality and wisdom exemplify all our warmest and highest aspirations for the institution that he leads, the institution which he has served with such distinction for so many years.
Like all Members here today, I salute the UN and I salute the Secretary-General with admiration and humility.
I also commend his speech and the sentiments which underpinned it to the elected members of this Parliament and to those who elect them.
I hope that in the months ahead these are arguments that we hear put with compassion and commitment to those who will, I trust, be doing their democratic duty.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Secretary-General Annan, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr High Representative, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is a significant day in the history of the European Parliament, and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, extends a very warm welcome to you, Mr Annan.
When, in the Conference of Presidents and in this House, we voted that you should receive the Sakharov Prize for 2003, we did so gladly and not merely as a matter of political judgment.
Now, as we offer you our heartfelt gratitude, we remember SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello and the many who were killed by a murderous terrorist act in Baghdad, we remember the many who have laid down their lives in the service of the United Nations, and, to those members of their families who are here today, we extend our sympathy and express our solidarity.
Those who work for the United Nations dedicate themselves to human rights and democracy, and so it is only right that the Sakharov Prize should be awarded to the United Nations.
Today, we remember Andrei Sakharov, whose great intellectual and moral strength can be felt to this day by those who visit his simple grave in the Novodevichy cemetery outside Moscow, and our desire is that the Russian people may follow his example; that, in Russia and around the world, people may bring to life the ideals of Andrei Sakharov, that great physicist, philosopher and campaigner for human rights.
Today, our thoughts are also with his widow, Yelena Bonner, who shared decades of exile with him and to whom our group awarded the Schuman Medal, and today we greet her in her simple and modest home in Moscowâs Ulitsa Skalova.
We would have been glad of the presence of the Sakharov Prize laureates Leyla Zana und Oswaldo JosÃ© Paya SardiÃ±as, who, along with others, are unable to be with us today.
Andrei Sakharov once said that the most important voice is the one that cannot be heard, and my hope for the people of Cuba is that they may be enabled to speak clearly.
Although, Mr Secretary-General, there is much that could be said about immigration, which involves integration, we share the same values of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, so, all things considered, we are taking the same road, and I hope that you will, as Secretary-General, see the day when the European Union, with a seat of its own, can defend these values in the Security Council and in the United Nations.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that it is a great honour to receive the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, today.
My group had the honour of nominating the Secretary-General for the Sakharov Prize, and I would like to thank the other political groups for having ensured an overwhelming majority in Parliament in order to express a common will to acknowledge the difficult and heroic work of the United Nations and to encourage it to persevere in the noble cause of world peace and stability.
My group does not just wish to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello and the other victims of an heroic struggle, but also to acknowledge the efforts of many United Nations officials and chiefs who are continuing their work, and I would like to mention two symbolic names, those of Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei, who have done important work in favour of peace and the reduction of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Over the last two years we have not just seen terrorist attacks which have led to the deaths of many innocent people, but also an unprecedented assault on the international institutions, in particular the UN.
Therefore, Secretary-General, I would like to reaffirm the importance of solidarity and close cooperation between peoples and nations.
In this regard, you have given us a lesson today on the importance of migrations, and I would say, on behalf of my group, that we thank you for this brave and committed speech because we are living in a world in which globalisation applies to capital, to services and to products; but ...
... is not applied to people.
Taking from your speech the elements which need to be carried out in the European Union, I would also like to offer you our cooperation in the work you have begun on the reform of the United Nations, with a view to ensuring that the UN, together with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the International Labour Organisation, can work together.
I believe this is a common cause which both the European Union and the United Nations must work on.
In summary, Mr President, I would also like to say that we are clearly committed to multilateralism as opposed to unilateralism, to preventive action rather than pre-emptive attacks, and that it must not be said that the United Nations is incapable: Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Guatemala, Kosovo, Timor, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Congo demonstrate that the United Nations is necessary and important and is a legitimate and noble cause and that we must support its efforts.
Â Â  Secretary-General, Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House echo your words on immigration.
We recognise the value that immigrants bring to Europe and we understand that closing Europe's front door will only drive the desperate to seek access through the back.
Many of us were migrants once upon a time and we know how ill it behoves our generation to shut the gates of mercy on mankind.
A Europe of security and justice for all is a Europe that extends those rights to those who justly seek a new life here.
Like you, we recognise the political challenge that implies.
Your words today remind us of the power of the United Nations to transcend the parochial in us all.
The United Nations has a precious power to speak for us all.
That is why my Group wishes to see the return of the United Nations to Iraq as soon as the security situation allows.
Credible and legitimate democratic government in Iraq is not possible without the presence of the United Nations.
We want a political settlement in Iraq that guarantees the highest standards of civil and political rights for all Iraqis.
The United Nations was founded by the same generation who founded this European Union â âto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankindâ.
Like this Union it believes that the closer we sit at the table of peace and prosperity, the slower we will be to reach for the tools of war.
It is a sorry testament to a stubborn world that the UN still seems such an unlikely experiment in international governance.
Winston Churchill once said that the UN is designed not to take us to heaven, but to save us from hell.
In order to do that better the UN must reform.
As its largest contributors, the EU and its Member States have not only the weight to insist on reform but the responsibility to do so.
A mature Europe would find the political will to put behind it an institutional settlement at the UN that leaves power where it lay in 1945.
A mature Europe would insist on a permanent membership that reflected the realities of the 21st century.
It would accept that the current veto is a tool of obstruction, a privilege that can no longer be justified.
Finally, Secretary-General, on behalf of the Liberal Group allow me to pay tribute to the members of your organisation who will not see you take this prize in their name today.
Your staff who lost their lives with Sergio Vieira de Mello â including Fiona Watson who was known to me â died defending a vision of national renewal in Iraq that is now our duty.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Secretary-General, thank you for your magnificent speech, which was very apt and brought each country face to face with its responsibilities.
We are honoured to have you with us in this House â your presence here is highly symbolic â and in our turn we too welcome, with respect and sympathy, the family and friends of MrÂ Vieira de Mello and the other victims of the dreadful terrorist attack in Baghdad.
One year ago, Secretary-General, almost to the day, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of the mission of the United Nations inspectors in Iraq.
Many of us still wanted to believe that it was possible to avoid the war, which we sensed would cause great devastation.
In the period that followed, it became apparent that what was happening in the United Nations reflected world public opinion as never before.
The public took to the streets in their millions to demonstrate, while in the Security Council the majority of the Member States resisted and did battle.
On all sides the goal was the same: to try to prevent a bloody, destabilising and irresponsible conflict.
Rarely has the UN been able to be as faithful as it was in those days to the first words of the Charter, âWe the Peoples of the United Nationsâ.
We did not succeed, but the lesson was learnt.
A particular idea of how the world should be organised was, admittedly, seriously flouted by a coalition of States, but since then it has, however, been spectacularly validated by the collective experience, to the point that the former gung-ho warriors are now appealing to the UN.
This idea is firstly that war is certainly no way to resolve the worldâs problems.
Secondly, it is that no nation, even a hyper-power, can ignore the global challenges facing the international community.
Finally, it is that there is more to building a world of peace than taking action against terrorist networks.
If, to our dismay, the tragic deadlock in the Middle East should persist â 13 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Gaza by the occupying army and 10 Israelis have just lost their lives this morning in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem; this is the kind of thing that must stop at all costs â should the Iraqi occupation, the war in Chechnya and the dreadful conflicts in Africa continue; should the peace plans such as the one for Western Sahara remain unimplemented; should there continue to be humiliation and despair nourished by social and cultural divides and should violations of human rights continue to mar the world, it is probable that, in the future, the world will not be safe and no one will enjoy a peaceful life.
It is in all our interests to be aware of this and we all have a responsibility to create a new order.
That, Secretary-General, is how we understand the particular tribute that we are paying to you and, through you, to the countless others who embody the universal values symbolised by your organisation.
Â Â  â Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen, I confess that when I was listening to you, Secretary-General, another great speech was resounding in my ears, the speech by Martin Luther King, who once declaimed in New York: âI have a dreamâ.
And listening to you, I had a dream too, a dream that your words on immigration were echoed by all of the Members of this House and did not remain yours alone.
I had a dream that all of the Heads of Government who say that they admire you, admired what you have just said and your lucid words on immigration.
I had a dream that finally the peoples listening to you admired your speech and your lucid and humanist views on immigration.
Because, ladies and gentlemen, there is no point in giving MrÂ Kofi Annan a standing ovation if, in our day-to-day work, in our resolutions, in our laws and in our countries, we do exactly the opposite of what he is asking us.
And that is why, with admiration and joy â even if I admit that our group was sceptical about your being awarded this Sakharov Prize, because we wanted it to go to a man or woman from Iran or Chechnya who is fighting for their freedom â and, because you have demonstrated such clear-mindedness here, I am asking you, as a Sakharov Prize laureate, to ensure that the Turkish Government frees Leila Zana, to ensure that the Cuban Government lets this Sakharov Prize winner go and, above all, you are asked to ensure that the UN takes an initiative to enable the Jewish people, who had to emigrate from Europe because they were threatened with annihilation, to live in peace and to enable the Palestinian people, who have the right to a State, to live in peace.
It is this idea, this strength and your lucidity that inspire me to salute you as the laureate of the Sakharov Prize.
Â Â  â Secretary-General, Presidents, our support for the choice made by the United Nations, of you and your colleagues, foremost among them Sergio Vieira de Mello, is testimony to the confidence that we have in you and the high regard in which we hold you.
We also wanted to thank you for the work that you do at the head of this organisation and for helping to restore and reinforce its prestige.
For all of this, we thank you.
Of course, in choosing you we also chose your colleagues, all of those who paid with their lives to fulfil their chosen role in the service of the most just and noble of causes.
To the families of those who are no longer with us, we wish to convey our solidarity and pay our respects, and our thoughts and good wishes also go to all of those who were injured and continue to endure physical suffering.
You have just spoken about the problems of immigration, Secretary-General.
You were right to do so.
Of course, this is the utopia that will help the world to move forward and we are all aware of this.
If you believe, however, that the problems associated with immigration will be resolved solely by ensuring that the developed countries open their borders, you are mistaken.
Obviously this is necessary, but it is not the answer to the problem.
I should have liked, Secretary-General â but probably this was implicit in your comments â to hear you condemn the economic consequences of globalisation and the imbalance that this creates between developed and developing countries.
I should also have liked, Secretary-General, to hear you express the wish that developed countries would increase their aid, because the only way â or at least the main and most pressing way â to resolve the problem is firstly to give all of those who are suffering in developing countries the means to live a normal life.
And that is why I regret the fact that the developed countries are all so reticent and overcautious in this regard.
At one time, General De Gaulle said that if all of us had devoted 1% of GDP to this problem it would have been to a large extent resolved.
Well, it is not too late to do so.
And as well as applauding you, as you so richly deserve, perhaps all of those who are here, and in particular those who hold office through their parties in the governments of Western Europe, might be inspired to act on these resolutions.
Â Â  Secretary-General, every year, 17 million hectares of tropical forest are lost.
We are destroying the planetâs biodiversity at the same rate at which the dinosaurs were wiped out.
There are more than 110 million active mines, distributed among 70 countries.
In ten years, two million children have been killed in wars or by landmines.
Every day, 8Â 000 young people are infected with HIV.
More than four million young people have died of AIDS.
Thirteen million have lost their mothers or both parents, but 95% of them live in Africa, so it is not, of course, really our problem.
Or is it?
When I was young, I dreamed of working for the UN and of being able to play my part in uniting the nations of the world in peace and cooperation.
I am therefore very happy that, in the Conference of Presidents, I was able to register my groupâs unanimous support for the UN, because never before have there been so many innocent and poverty-stricken children who need a helping-hand from ourselves in our cosy little corner of the rich part of the world.
We who sit in Parliament may disagree about a lot, but we can all agree in paying tribute to you as Secretary-General of our common, worldwide organisation, the UN.
No one can suspect the UNâs blue berets of having any remit other than peace.
I therefore hope that the UN can be given a common and permanent military force to deploy once all peaceful means have been exhausted.
You must not only be secretary of a Security Council whose members are in disagreement.
You must also be general of a reformed and dynamic UN.
In war, you must be commander-in-chief of all the generals, for, without UN permission, it should again be prohibited to go to war.
It perhaps sounds naive, but it is still my dream that there will one day be so many naive people in the world that we shall not permit the destruction of our planet and the killing of innocent children through landmines, famine or HIV.
We would do well to transfer a couple of hundred euros in aid from each EU cow to those whose need is greater, namely citizens who today have to place their children in something that is not a bed, following something that is not a meal and perhaps with an illness that makes life before death all too short.
Thank you, Mr Kofi Annan, for doing more than ourselves to engage with the most important matters in the world, and thank you for your moving speech.
Â Â  â Secretary-General, on behalf of the Italian Radical Party Members, I should like, first and foremost, to echo the tributes paid to the memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello and all of those who perished with him.
Secretary-General, we welcome your call for a Europe that is more open to immigration by men and women who have fled their countries in a bid to escape poverty and very often dictatorship.
In welcoming them, we need to tackle the root causes that drive them to leave their countries.
With this in mind, we very much appreciated your spelling out an idea several months ago that is both simple and revolutionary.
âDemocracy and human rights, though distinct concepts, are closely interlinked.
Democracy, as a human right in itself, is implied in ArticleÂ 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but it only functions in its fullest sense when other human rights are respected.â
We wholeheartedly agree with you, Secretary-General: democracy is a universal value to which every human being has a right and this is the challenge that we need to take up in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere.
Secretary-General, in this connection, before concluding, allow me to mention the issue of the appointment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
As you know, on the initiative of the Italian Presidency a European candidate has been put forward, a Member of this Parliament.
This candidate has the support of the President of the European Commission and of key figures from all of the Unionâs institutions as well as from other countries and regional groups.
The fact that we have put forward a candidate signals Europeâs commitment to promoting and strengthening human rights, the rule of law and democracy wherever they are violated.
Secretary-General, I would venture to hope that you will select this candidate.
Â Â  . â Mr President, speaking on behalf of our committee, I too would like to express our congratulations to Mr Annan, and to all those who, in the United Nations, work for democracy, peace and freedom, and our appreciation for all those who have made such great sacrifices for them.
I also regret the fact that domestic political circumstances prevent the laureates from Cuba, Burma and Turkey from being with us today.
What we have to do, I believe, is to advance democracy and freedom throughout the world, for human rights on the one hand, and peace on the other, are dependent on them.
Democracy and freedom are the pillars without which no improvement is sustainable.
In the brief conversation that the Bureau of the Foreign Affairs Committee was able to have with you earlier, it became even clearer to us that the European Parliament and the European Union really can work together on joint projects, and that we can cooperate very closely where policy matters and budgetary resources are concerned, as well as in many other areas â be it on issues connected with the supply of water, with education in the developing world, infrastructure measures or the fight against epidemics.
I believe that, if we succeed in this way in raising standards in the worldâs less-favoured areas, we will also be creating the right conditions for peace, freedom and human rights, and it is for that reason that we need to cooperate in this area.
The same is the case with political objectives and problem-solving, whether this be in the Middle East or in Cyprus.
While I have to say that I listened to what you had to say about migration with a great deal of admiration, I would also like to point out at the same time that migration is an admission of failure, for we should deal with problems where people actually live; that is where we have to start.
Â Â  On behalf of Parliament I should like to thank the Council for being present here today and also the Commission, the High Representative and the laureates of the Sakharov Prize.
I should also like to thank the relatives of the victims of the attack and the survivors for their very special presence here today.
And most of all, Secretary-General, I thank you for being here and for the appeal to conscience which you launched in our House today.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 29 January 2004.(1)
Â Â  The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 5 February 2004 has been distributed.
I have not received any requests for changes to the agenda for Monday.
Â Â  Mr President, as rapporteur for the own-initiative report on Directive 93/104/EC on the organisation of working time, I would request that the vote take place on Wednesday rather than tomorrow, since negotiations are being held between various parliamentary groups and they asked me a moment ago if we could do this.
If possible, therefore, we would like to be able to continue working tomorrow and vote on the report on Wednesday.
Â Â  Mr President, I support this proposal because it gives us a chance to find a solution to this very cumbersome dossier.
As regards the oral questions on nuclear disarmament, I have received a request from the Verts/ALE Group to wind up the debate with a motion for a resolution which could be put to the vote at the next sitting in Brussels.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the aim of the resolution is to prepare the guidelines before the conference to revise the Treaty of Non-Proliferation.
Traditionally, we conclude such debates with a resolution; it therefore seemed right to do so in this case too, even though the resolution will be put to the vote during the next sitting.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe that this is one of the most important policy issues currently under consideration and discussion in the sphere of international politics.
We frequently adopt resolutions that I do not believe are quite as significant as this, so we are very much in favour of there being a resolution to wind up this debate.
Â Â  Does anyone wish to speak against the request?
Â Â  Mr President, my Group is against a resolution.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, it has recently been brought to my attention that the Maltese Labour Party has submitted up to 1 600 petitions to the Constitutional Court in Malta, the effect of which is to disbar Maltese citizens temporarily abroad for work or study from voting in the coming European elections.
Should this be the case, this seems to be against the letter and the spirit of both EU law and convention, in that many of these nationals are outside of their home territory for perfectly legitimate reasons.
If this is true, this seems to be behaviour that is not consistent with the democratic process which this House would accept as the norm for a country which is shortly to become a Member State of the European Union.
I ask you therefore to investigate whether an attempt is being made to gerrymander the electoral process in Malta and to report back to this House with your findings.
Â Â  I shall indeed enquire into the matter and report back to you, Mr Bradbourn.
Â Â  Mr President, everybody in this House is concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia, and the visit of the President of Colombia, MrÂ Uribe, gives this House the opportunity to make plain our concerns about that situation.
I rise specifically, Mr President, to ask you to raise with Mr Uribe, the President-in-Office and the Commission the question of support for a proposed conference on humanitarian rights later this year.
It has been proposed by the umbrella organisation â an alliance of 115 NGOs and civil organisations in Colombia â which is seeking to engage the civilian population in finding solutions to the 40 years of conflict.
Mr President, I will send you the details of this proposal and ask you to consider them and to raise this matter with President Uribe when you meet him.
Â Â  I would welcome your note on the matter.
Exceptionally, President Uribe will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy during the working day tomorrow.
There will be a direct opportunity for members of that committee to bring issues to his attention.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to protest at the leniency shown by President Musharraf of Pakistan to the television confession of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan.
This House has criticised Pakistan's exports of nuclear technology in the past and received condemnation from its government for doing so.
It is extraordinary that the sale of such dangerous WMD know-how to regimes as brutal as North Korea results in a presidential pardon and the right to keep the illegally acquired payments.
It smacks of a public scapegoating exercise in the face of embarrassing evidence of official covert support by the government.
Secondly, I would like to send my condolences to the people of Moscow for the recent atrocious suicide bomb attack on their metro, which resulted in at least 39 deaths and 150 casualties, with everything pointing to Chechen terrorists organised by a Saudi al-Qa'ida follower.
I ask those in this House who proclaim the glory of the Chechen freedom fighters how they account for the murder of innocent Muscovites?
Â Â  MrÂ President, in a few daysâ time it will be the 20th anniversary of the adoption by the European Parliament of the Draft Treaty Establishing the European Union, created and proposed by Altiero Spinelli.
The Conference of Presidents called on the political groups to look into the possibilities for celebrating both this anniversary and the 25th anniversary of the death of Jean Monnet, one of the greatest creators of European integration.
I would, however, like to draw your attention, MrÂ President, to the dissimilar nature of these two anniversaries.
Celebrating the anniversary of the Spinelli draft means not so much paying homage to Altiero Spinelli himself, as appreciating the far-sightedness of the European Parliament that, 20 years ago, drew up and proposed the first treaty of a constitutional nature, something which it makes sense to stress today in the light of our renewed commitment to ensure that Europe is in fact finally given a Constitution.
Â Â  As you correctly observed, MrÂ Napolitano, your suggestion was discussed by the Conference of Presidents.
It was decided that, in the last parliamentary session in May, we should observe a number of those anniversaries.
However, with regard to the specific observation you made about the Spinelli report and the leadership of the European Parliament, I will be happy to mark that day by making a declaration on behalf of this House, in line with your preference and your suggestion to the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  MrÂ President, referring back to what MrÂ Napolitano said, frankly it seems to me that your reply had very little substance to it; what we need here is, instead, much more than that.
This is not about commemorating Altiero Spinelli, but rather about seizing the opportunity of this important and historic date, which calls for a special sitting and not for one among many celebrations.
It would also be the opportunity to take a much bigger and more important step: let the European Parliament do as much as it did then, with Spinelli: that is to say, in order to promote the European Constitution, immediately adopt the text that resulted from the Convention, so concluding an act which, even without legal value, would have a huge political value.
This is what I ask of you, MrÂ President: that the European Parliament have the courage, twenty years on, to implement the same initiatives.
I call on you and on the chairmen of the political groups, above all those who refer to the European idea, to do this.
I hope that they are true to their tradition.
Â Â  â Mr President, I just wanted to raise something briefly.
A report by me on industrial associations has been put on this weekâs agenda, without my knowledge, and, above all, also contrary to everything agreed by Parliament with the authorities here.
I learned of this when someone from in London phoned me about it.
On being asked how this could come to pass, the Parliament office responsible stated that it had been done with the groupsâ agreement.
When I asked them, I was told it was the Parliamentary services that had done it.
This does not show this House in a very favourable light.
I now note â with gratitude, of course â that the reportâs arrival will be subject to the rapporteurâs agreement, as certain groups are aware that it is the subject of important negotiations that are still in progress.
In practice, though, it would have been nice for this to have been done a bit more transparently and efficiently.
Â Â  I will get back to you on the detail when I have had a chance to study the matter.
Â Â  Mr President, Portuguese newspapers have recently reported appalling cases of mistreatment, abuse and even slavery, to which Portuguese workers have been subjected in various EU countries, such as France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
The Portuguese newspaper this morning ran a story entitled âMore Portuguese citizens ill-treated in the Netherlandsâ, which stated that the Dutch authorities had been informed of the situation.
According to the story, however, the reports from that country are marked by unprecedented abuse perpetrated against Portuguese workers.
There are accounts of mistreatment of workers in some companies in the Netherlands, or at the hands of gangmasters; workers are denied the most basic of rights, such as sufficient food to eat and accommodation fit for human habitation; real organised networks are said to be operating in various countries to recruit workers, which is absolutely scandalous.
Immediate action must be taken, Mr President, to put an end to this state of affairs.
I request, Mr President, that the Commission and the Council be notified and that immediate action be taken to eradicate the problem of these appalling attacks on workersâ rights and on human rights in general.
Â Â  I would like you to send to my office copies of the material you referred to.
I will indeed take up the matter, as you suggest.
Mr Martin, the report for which you are rapporteur was placed on the agenda following the normal procedures.
However, having learned of your difficulties as regards its scheduling and in deference to you as rapporteur, it has been withdrawn from the agenda.
Â Â  â Mr President, I apologise for bringing this issue up again; I have so far heard that only in the original language.
I would just like to reiterate that there was a clear agreement with the Parliamentary services that this report would not be put on the agenda until March or April.
I then learned from in London that it was given a slot in February.
Only then did I say, âplease, not yet!â
This is where you must not confuse cause and effect!
Â Â  The Conference of Presidents will decide when it returns to the agenda, but it is not on the agenda now.
That is the answer to your question.
Â Â  Mr President, last week the Commission ruled against the level of assistance being given by the Charleroi airport authorities to a certain airline.
Not only do I sympathise with the public authorities responsible for Charleroi, I admire them for trying to take action to stimulate much-needed economic growth and jobs, in the light of declining traditional industries.
The benefits of low-cost air travel have been felt over a much wider area than just around Charleroi.
For example, the route from Glasgow-Prestwick to Charleroi is the only air link from the west of Scotland, a very populous area, to the capital of Europe area.
While I recognise that the Commission sees fit to implement state aid regulations in certain ways, what about the consumers?
I hope that the Commission will not be over-enthusiastic and end up disadvantaging consumers, including many groups who wish â and need â to visit our headquarters and the other European institutions to learn more about how Europe actually works.
Â Â  MrÂ President, 25 years ago, the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded, leading to the violent infringement of human rights and, in particular, the violation of womenâs rights.
The question is, whether we are now seeing the start of a similar development in occupied Iraq.
On 29 December, a number of rulings concerning divorces, marriages and children etc. were replaced by Sharia law in the otherwise secular state of Iraq.
Now, I hear that the leader of the Organisation of Women's Freedom in Iraqis under violent attack from Islamic groups. Her name is Yamha Mohammed.
I should very much like to ask you to protest, on behalf of Parliament, against the attacks on womenâs rights that are now gathering speed in Iraq, and also to protest to the occupying forces, that is to say the alliance of so-called volunteers, against this development.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to raise the issue of the visit by the Colombian President, Mr Uribe, to this Parliament.
My Group was not in favour of this invitation, and, as I understand it, neither was the ELDR Group nor the GUE/NGL Group.
It is unfortunate that the PSE Group did not support us on this.
There is a great danger that President Uribe will use this as a propaganda stunt to give the impression at international level that everything is fine.
You only have to look at the UN reports on Bogota, whenever they are published, to find accounts of gross human rights violations.
The recently introduced legislation, in particular the anti-terrorist statute which was adopted in December, gives judicial powers to the armed forces.
This is another area of grave concern.
This Parliament has to be very careful that it does not allow President Uribe to use this opportunity as a propaganda stunt, to give an impression that somehow the human rights situation in Colombia is improving.
We know from the grassroots organisations on the ground that this is far from the truth.
That false message must not be allowed to be sent out from this Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a disgrace for the European Parliament to receive the president of Colombia, Ãlvaro Uribe VÃ©lez, tomorrow with honours.
It is a disgrace for the socialists who made the proposal and for everyone who accepted it.
Mr Uribe and his government, with the support of the USA, are responsible for the death of thousands of trade union farmers and other grass-roots fighters.
They refuse ethnic reconciliation, they show contempt for the numerous recommendations of the UN Commission on Human Rights and they seek to suppress grass-roots dissatisfaction with military means.
Mr Uribe's presence here shows that the European Union is moving towards getting involved in the âColumbiaâ plan, through which the USA intervenes cruelly in this country, in an aim to achieve general control over the area.
We condemn all external intervention and call for all governments to stand by the side of the grass-roots forces in Columbia so that the bloodshed and the activities of the paramilitary forces stop, peace is protected and human rights are respected.
We express the undivided solidarity of the Communist Party of Greece with the Columbian people who, we are sure, will win in the end.
Â Â  â Mr President, what I have to say has to do with the safety of MEPs and the measures taken by Parliament to that end.
On 19Â January, I left the Parliament building in Brussels around 8 p.m. by the exit onto the Wiertzstraat, going towards the rue de Wavre.
Barely 100 metres from the Parliament building, having halted at a red light, I heard an enormous bang and the passenger-side window of my car was smashed in.
My handbag, which had been on the floor, was snatched.
I can assure you that a ladyâs handbag contains everything imaginable â cards, passport, and so on. Such a thing can of course happen anywhere, but I find it an extraordinarily serious matter that it should happen so close to the Parliament building.
What I find incomprehensible is that this happens time and time again; I could name more than one other Dutch lady MEP to whom it has happened.
I came back to the Parliament building, where I had a very kind reception; about that I have no complaints.
The security guards came when called but â you are probably not aware of this â I could not make a phone call outside Belgium.
I could not, therefore, make a call to block my credit cards, and I think that you will understand why that was my first concern.
The police were then called and I was able to go with them to the police station, albeit only by following them in my damaged car.
I managed to get to the police station, where there was an officer who spoke Flemish, but not the sort that has any similarity with Dutch.
He was a kind man, and there was nothing wrong with him, but it all got very involved.
As I of course had nothing left on me â no money, no driving licence â I was told that I would be given an escort to , but that was not forthcoming.
It was at around midnight that I got to my hotel, where I was dealt with more efficiently.
I have sustained enormous loss, and I now want to ask you to ensure first of all that, in any such situation an international call can be made from the exits to the Parliament building if an MEP wishes to do so, and that assistance is available in getting to the police station, for I could have been a Dane with absolutely no knowledge of Dutch or a citizen of any other country.
It would of course also be very useful if money were available to make it possible to take a taxi.
Moreover, I think it is of the utmost importance that there should be better security protection for MEPs.
As I have just said, the loss is enormous.
I will not say how much is involved, but I expect Parliament to see to it that I am fully reimbursed.
Â Â  I did not wish to interrupt you, MrsÂ Sanders-ten Holte, because of the personal nature of the attack you mentioned and for which, I am sure, you have the complete sympathy of Members of the House.
I shall ask Parliament's security services to draw up a report on this for us and for the Bureau to see what general lessons we could learn as regards some of your suggestions.
We are also in ongoing discussions with the Belgian authorities regarding security in Brussels.
I would add that, so far, these have not resulted in a satisfactory or sufficient response as regards the requirements of this House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like very briefly to go back over the resignation of MrÂ David Kay, the US official in charge of finding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, possessed, it would seem, by that countryâs government.
I would also like to go back over the statements made by the British specialist, Mr Kelly, which were followed by his suspicious death.
Finally, I would like to go back over a recent admission by President Bush, this Sunday, in an interview broadcast by NBC, stating that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime did not, in all likelihood, possess weapons of mass destruction, but that the war was nonetheless justifiable because, if they did not have weapons of mass destruction, it could perhaps have been possible for them to obtain them one day.
I believe that we should be concerned about this because it clearly means two things.
First of all, MrÂ Bush and MrÂ Blair lied in a cynical and serious way.
Then, a population has been starved for ten years under a false pretext, a war was launched under a false pretext and a State has been destroyed, also under a false pretext, with the backing of a number of governments of the European Union, which is an extremely serious fact.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express my disgust and anger at the despicable anti-communist resolution adopted by the recent 16th conference of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which likens the barbaric, monstrous Nazi-fascism to communism and calls for a new witch-hunt to begin of the members and cadres of the communist parties who remain faithful to their high ideals.
The Group of the European People's Party abuses and insults the memory of the millions of communists who gave their very lives to deliver mankind from the Nazi monster.
At the same time, it shows that it supports, or even dictates the primitive anti-communism and blatant violations of human rights which prevail in the former socialist candidate countries.
It revives a spirit of vindictiveness which only presages hardships for our peoples.
We do not forget that the persecution of communists has always been followed by the persecution of every progressive perception.
The peoples do not forget that Hitler also started persecutions with the communists.
With this disgraceful and extremely dangerous resolution, the Group of the European People's Party really is seeking to stop the workers' fight against reactionary, anti-grass roots policies.
They want to strike the pioneers of this fight, the communists who remain faithful to their ideals, because the followers are their friends and protÃ©gÃ©es.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago, 19 Chinese people lost their lives in Morecambe Bay in the north-west of England.
They were cockle picking on the sands, the tide came in and they were all drowned.
Would you agree with me that this tragedy, whilst clearly on British soil â or in British waters â is equally a European or international issue, and that we must work together to counter the international people-smuggling gangs that were exploiting these poor people who were being paid as little as one pound per day for their work?
Furthermore, this case once again highlights the clear need to establish an effective and efficient common European system for asylum and the same for immigration, including legal migration, as a matter of urgency.
It is clear that what is a United Kingdom tragedy one day could easily occur in another country's territory on another day.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise in response to the outrageous comments just made by Mr Gollnisch, who implied that David Kelly, and I quote: 'died in suspect circumstances', and that Tony Blair lied.
The recent judicial inquiry has looked at all the facts surrounding these tragic circumstances and concluded quite clearly that there were no suspect circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Kelly, as he implied, and that Mr Blair did not lie to the House of Commons on this matter.
Whatever one's view of the Iraqi conflict â and there are different views in this House, in my country, and indeed in my party, and I have my own view on this â it is essential that we debate this matter based on the facts, not on fiction.
Â Â  The fact is that I am now the one with the microphone that works!
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the complete disarray regarding free movement of citizens from the new Member States.
It now seems â but it is by no means certain â that, with a mere 11 weeks to go until 1Â May, 13 Member States will take advantage of the facility to put obstacles in the way of free movement.
This has led to a spotlight on the two remaining statesÂ â Ireland and the United KingdomÂ â and to hysterical press reactions about being swamped by benefit tourists.
I hold no brief for the way the British press is reacting, nor for the rather uncertain reaction of the United Kingdom Government, but I believe that the original decision to allow full free movement was and is economically, politically and morally right.
Commission forecasts show that maybe every year there would have been one mobile worker from the East for every 1000 inhabitants in the West, if it had been shared among all states.
There may have been some justification for special measures in border areas, but the way this panic has spread and infected most Member States is shameful.
It treats the new Member State citizens as second class, contrary to all the promises they were given, and it displays â as on so many other issues such as Iraq, the Constitution and the budget â a depressing lack of EU solidarity.
Could you at least raise this with the Commission and Member States in the Council to try and make the transitional periods as brief as possible?
Â Â  Mr President, the Commission's decision concerning the commercial arrangements which Ryanair has with Charleroi airport is very misjudged.
It flies in the face of economic reason and is a serious blow to the development of the low-cost airline industry in Europe.
Ryanair has developed Charleroi airport from being a deserted field to catering for over two million passengers a year.
Low-cost air travel is supported by the citizens of Europe.
The European Commission has yet to explain clearly what it intends to do to support low-cost air travel in Europe in the future.
The problem now is the lack of clarity regarding state aid for regional airports in Europe.
There is now great uncertainty from the perspective of regional airports across the length and breadth of the European Union with regard to how we are going to develop the low cost-airline industry in the future.
The Commission judgment was simply wrong and the Commission has yet to explain the future policy direction for the low-cost airline sector in Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, both I and my colleague Mr Claeys put ourselves electronically on the speakersâ list this morning for one minute each and it now appears that we are not on it.
Â Â  I will ask the services to check on that, but I have been operating on a 'catch-the-eye' system. I do not have a list in front of me.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have an electronic attestation on my computer to the effect that I am registered.
Â Â  I should like to recall to colleagues that we open with a system of 'catch-the-eye'.
I do not know what the meaning is of an 'electronic communication', but, for future reference, wave your hands and I will try to accommodate you.
Â Â  â Mr President, in preparation for the Chinese presidentâs visit to France, the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, has come to Brussels to ask for the lifting of the arms embargo on China.
The fact is that France is dreaming about concluding lucrative contracts with Beijing, which will push up its arms industryâs turnover, and so the Chinese president received an imperial welcome in France.
Nothing was said about human rights; Tibet is being oppressed, but it would appear that the French president does not even know where it is.
When you have the opportunity to sell some of your friend Monsieur Dassaultâs Mirage jet fighters, you prefer not to think about a few boring old monks.
Jacques Chirac, who can wax so lyrical about tolerance in his own country, evidently did not have the time to read the reports of the various human rights organisations, which, year in and year out, detail the Chinese offences: censorship, arbitrary arrests, overcrowded prisons, re-education camps and the absence of free expression of opinion.
Jacques Chirac even managed to describe the forthcoming referendum in Taiwan as an act of aggression against China.
That the European Union has no option but to do business with China is something we have to be able to accept, but supplying weapons is a completely different matter.
We are therefore in full agreement with Mr Watsonâs statement that this arms embargo is one of the last means available to the European Union, whereby it can force the Communist dictatorship in China to respect human rights.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0040/2004) by Giorgos Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the role and methods of credit rating agencies (2003/2081(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the report I have the honour of presenting is an own-initiative report on credit rating agencies, which are business organisations of good standing in the markets.
However, their reputation has been shaken somewhat by the recent spate of financial scandals, starting with Enron and ending with Parmalat.
The Parmalat fraud is especially relevant as it concerns bondholders: precisely the section of the market that rating agencies are supposed to protect.
Until a few days before the crash of these companies, they were unable to do anything about protecting the public.
These failures have prompted debates in the United States, investigations in the US Congress, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the International Organization of Securities Commission and other international fora.
There is a specific European angle on this matter.
Rating agencies that are one hundred years old in the United States are relative newcomers in Europe.
In some cases they have given indications of not understanding European business mentality.
They have created friction, especially in Germany.
The other point of special European interest is the inevitable remark that whatever the nature of the regulation of the agencies â however mild and indirect â it has its seat exclusively in the United States, in the form of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The fact that nothing similar exists in Europe makes for an unbalanced transatlantic relationship which might become troublesome if it is not redressed in time.
These considerations prompted the original proposal of the report in favour of the formation of a European registration authority to be considered by the Commission, an authority to which agencies would report on their activities and with which they could establish a regulatory dialogue, a dialogue of equals based on the European Security Ratings Committee, on topics of mutual interest â excluding, of course, any intervention in the substance of the opinions issued by the agencies.
It is interesting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently expressed interest in making contact with the CSR on this matter.
The majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs found this proposal too and recommended re-examining the whole area of operations of rating agencies without including in their recommendation anything as specific as the creation of a European registration authority.
With all due respect for the majority opinion of my colleagues, I beg to differ for two reasons.
Firstly, because a regulatory authority operates in the United States and, secondly, because â as I have already said â the lack of a corresponding authority in Europe creates a potentially harmful imbalance.
I have therefore asked my political group to help me out by resubmitting the proposal for a European registration agency in the form of an amendment, and I urge all colleagues who originally may have differed on this point to think again.
