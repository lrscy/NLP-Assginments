Politics is not about finality and eternal truths â the process of German reunification has taught us that.
It is about constantly evolving processes, which can be mapped out to some extent in advance but which require a pro-active and very level-headed approach at every stage.
In this critical situation, the EU has an obligation, together with the United Nations, to be a reliable partner for the Republic of Cyprus, but also for the two communities, in resolving the conflict.
Not only Cyprus, but Europe as a whole will be the winner if we manage to heal this wound.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do indeed face a situation which is not only difficult but also very sad.
For years, we have argued here in this House that we could not let a Turkish nationalist position prevent Cyprus's accession to the European Union.
We were always resolute in our position.
However, this has led us into a trap which the Greens warned about years ago.
We asked what guarantees there were that, with a radical change on the Turkish side, the guaranteed accession of Greek Cyprus would not take place at the expense of the northern part of the island.
This debate has always been neglected in this House, and we are paying a high price for this neglect today.
The situation is irreversible, and when they vote in the referendum, the Greek Cypriots will not be deciding their own future.
They will decide on the future of the Turkish Cypriot community in the northern part of the island.
The Greek Cypriots are already about to join the European Union.
And then you talk about the plan.
MrÂ Modrow, please think about it for a moment: the situation is like the Sudeten Germans saying: âWe refuse to let the Czech Republic join the European Union until our claims in the Czech Republic have been settled.â
This House made it clear that that is unacceptable.
As a left-winger, please convey that message to the Greek Cypriots as well.
This is an historic plan.
On the left and the right, up and down, we are always saying that the UN should do this and the UN should do that âŠ Now, the UN has decided.
Of course a plan is a plan; it does not reflect the Greek Cypriot or the Turkish Cypriot position.
This UN plan is an attempt to remove the last barbed wire border from the EU.
What is our response?
The sophists â for we are dealing with Greeks here â are back in power; they say, âYes, it is moving in the right direction, but it could be betterâ.
Yes, the world could be a better place, I admit that.
The world could be a much better place, and even if the Greens secure an absolute majority in Europe âŠ
âŠ the world will not become a better place!
You see, you were too quick off the mark again, but I know what I am saying.
I am convinced that the message we must send out is this.
If there is a 'no' vote in the south and a 'yes' in the north, the European Union should open political relations with the north.
As a first step, we must lobby for the lifting of the embargo against the north of the island.
The citizens in the north should not be held hostage by the south.
We cannot allow that on grounds of political decency.
Then we will see what happens.
One thing is certain, however: there is not a 'possible' UN plan: this is the only one.
There is not a 'possible' future: this is the only one.
Very many of you are religious.
I believe in miracles.
I believe in the miracle that the people in the southern part of the island really will prove to be more intelligent than their self-appointed leaders, including the Green parties in Cyprus.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Europe had the idea of holding out to Turkey the prospect of accession to the European Union in Helsinki without making it an essential requirement that that country put an immediate and unconditional end to the illegal occupation of northern Cyprus shows almost criminal frivolity on the part of the European Council.
In Cyprus, Europe is going ahead and putting on ice the sacred principle of the free movement of persons on which our Union has been based for decades.
I can only sympathise, then, with the intransigent position of the Greek Cypriots and their President, MrÂ Papadopoulos, who reject the UN Secretary-Generalâs half-hearted compromise, and in three daysâ time will be voting ânoâ in the referendum on the reunification of their island.
This is not reunification, however, as the Turkish occupation would continue.
The military border would remain, the hundred-thousand Turkish settlers would be allowed to stay in Cyprus, the Turkish army would stay, and Cypriots would not enjoy the same rights as other EU citizens, as their property rights and right to do business would be restricted.
In short, the Annan Plan perpetuates and legalises the Turkish occupation.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to pledge my wholehearted support to the Greek Cypriots and reiterate that, as far as we are concerned, Islamic Turkey must never join the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the exceptionally gloomy statement by CommissionerÂ Verheugen is particularly shocking to us all in view of the fact that we are on the point of reaching a solution, by means of the Annan Plan.
We had previously thought that the slogan âthe solution is not a solutionâ could be attributed solely to MrÂ Denktash.
We now see, however, that this slogan is also used by the President of the Greek Republic of Cyprus. That is of course unacceptable.
Personal interviews with MrÂ Papadopoulos, along with other indications, have always given me the unpleasant feeling that we were being deceived, that the Republic of Cyprus lacked the genuine will to do its utmost to reach a solution for Cyprus.
Yet the assumption that the Republic would do its utmost to arrive at a solution and that it would not fail in this formed the basis for that countryâs accession to the European Union.
There appears to be the presumption that it is also possible to trick oneâs way into membership of the European Union.
That is unacceptable.
We also heard just now that matters falling within the Copenhagen political criteria, in particular, such as freedom of the press and access to the media, are closed off not only to our CommissionerÂ Verheugen and to foreigners, but also to national opposition parties.
When this happens in other countries we take umbrage and tell them that we are breaking off negotiations with them, as we did with Romania, for example.
We are thus now on the threshold of the membership of a new Member State that has achieved this by deception.
In my opinion, we cannot accept this on any account, indicating as it does a lack of respect for the European Union.
We have also experienced this in the past with Slovakia, which told us that we were interfering in its internal affairs.
Yet membership of the European Union means becoming heavily involved in each otherâs internal affairs.
This particularly goes for matters of the Copenhagen political criteria, and particularly for matters relating to the willingness to cooperate with the European Union in good faith for the purposes of reaching a solution capable of being of extremely great benefit to the inhabitants of both the northern and the southern parts.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May.
We always hoped that the accession process could serve as a catalyst to end the division of Cyprus.
In three days' time, the Cypriots themselves must decide whether they wish to live in a unified state after almost 30 years of division, and whether after almost 30 years, they wish to join the European Union as a unified state.
Since the Green Line was opened for Cypriots on 23 April last year, we have seen very clearly that Cypriots from both communities are willing and able to coexist peacefully.
The Annan Plan which will be voted on by both communities on 24 April is a compromise between the wishes and legitimate demands of both sides.
The plan may not be totally balanced; perhaps it does have weaknesses as regards the power of central government, and perhaps the guarantees for the implementation of individual measures are not clear enough.
Are these doubts really a reason to reject the plan?
Are the undoubted weaknesses an adequate reason to reject the opportunities that the proposal offers?
My twenty years of experience in working towards a solution for Cyprus, for its accession and for unity, tell me that the opportunities far outweigh the risks.
We are not the ones who have to decide on 24 April.
Even if we hope for a positive outcome, we will accept the democratic decision of the people of Cyprus.
What the European Parliament can say with certainty, however, is that this year is 2004, not 1964 or 1974.
A united Cyprus will become a Member State of the European Union, and as a Member State, it will not only enjoy the full protection afforded by membership.
It will also see that the responsibility of the European Union as a whole for ensuring the successful implementation of the Annan Plan guarantees this opportunity for peaceful coexistence.
Today, the European Parliament will commit itself to monitoring the entire implementation process through its committee work.
We are currently witnessing many fears, especially on the part of Greek Cypriots who look back at the past.
However, looking forward to the future is the better option.
Turkey in 2004 is a country with a European perspective.
It is no longer the Turkey of 1974.
The Turkish Cypriots showed back in December that they have largely thrown off the legacy of Rauf Denktash.
New opportunities are unlikely to present themselves soon.
The only alternative to the plan is the ongoing and entrenched division of the island.
This plan offers an opportunity and should not be gambled away due to false or inadequate information.
As Members of the European Parliament, we are today sending a message to our soon-to-be fellow citizens in the European Union.
Statements by a European Commissioner, by the European Parliament or by individual Members do not constitute interference in Cyprus's domestic affairs or pressure from outside.
They are well-intentioned advice.
They are information which is being passed around within the family in which we must shape Europe's future from 1 May.
I hope that accession day on 1 May will be a genuine celebration of reunification in Cyprus â the unification of all Cypriots with almost 450 million people in the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner said that he felt cheated by the Government of Cyprus.
He was too polite.
His good faith has been betrayed, as has that of our rapporteur, Mr Poos.
Under international law, the entire island of Cyprus will join the European Union on 1 May, regardless of the result of the referendum, and Turkish Cypriots will become EU citizens.
However, if the Greek Cypriots reject the Annan Plan, Turkish Cypriots will be EU citizens who are denied recognition and representation and who are being kept impoverished by economic sanctions applied by the EU.
Turkish Cypriots are trapped in a pincer: they are threatened on the one hand by Turkish settlers and on the other by the economic strength of the Greek Cypriots.
They have been poorly led for years.
However, the tide has now turned and if they vote 'yes' in Saturday's referendum, they will have done everything that we and the UN have asked of them.
Under such circumstances it would be completely unacceptable for economic sanctions to be maintained.
We cannot persecute our own citizens.
The presidency and the Commission, with the UN, must take steps to lift their burden through the means of transport and trade, and must do so without delay.
Â Â  â Mr President, allow me to say something different from what we have heard so far.
I think that a distorted picture has been given.
The majority of political forces in both Greece and Cyprus consider that the Annan plan may help to resolve the Cyprus problem, especially with the prospect of the integration of a united Cyprus into the European Union.
That is the truth of the matter.
A distorted picture is being given.
There is the question of how one part of public opinion is taking this affair on board, how it feels.
There is a problem there, a huge problem from the past, as to whether this plan can really be applied absolutely in time, fully and reliably to all the details, which are particularly complicated and particularly difficult.
We have a lot of experience here of violated agreements.
Instead, therefore, of looking for some sort of miracle, as my friend Mr Cohn-Bendit suggests, let us do what we can.
Let us desist from exaggerations, insults and criticism of one another.
What we can do is to call for there to be now a serious and reliable guarantee from the UN and from the European Union that the entire Annan plan, as it stands, will be applied to the end and there will be no tricks and circumventions after one year or after eight months or two years.
Let us call for that.
It is the only thing we can do now, before the referendum.
We will see to the rest later.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, two peoples and two cultures living in one country is often a delicate matter.
Reason is required, but feelings also come into play.
The Annan Plan is a good plan, but it is a solution born of reason.
Yet Cypriots choose not only with their minds, but also with their hearts.
Thirty years of occupation is a long time.
I heard a Turkish Cypriot girl being interviewed on the radio.
She said that, in her youth, she thought that only men lived on the other side.
We are asking Cypriots to say âyesâ to the Annan Plan, as we are confident that it will bring them peace, reconciliation and prospects.
However, does the population have sufficient trust in the countries that are to ensure the implementation of that plan, for example?
Have Turkey, Greece and the United Kingdom not had their own agendas all along in the history of Cyprus?
Has sufficient work been done on trust between human beings in those thirty years?
We are calling for Cypriots to vote âyesâ, but let us remember, with a view to the accession of some Balkan states, that it is important to win the trust of the population.
I have just heard MrÂ Verheugen saying that it is we who are organising the accession of Cyprus to the EU, but Greece that must enable unity in that country.
I find that rather shocking: where is the people of Cyprus in all of this?
Well, that people will have its say.
We are calling on it to say âyesâ, but equally, if it does not yet have sufficient trust to do so, we must further build this trust and ensure that the unification process is a success, and that what is not possible today is possible tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, our position, in a word, as President Karamanlis of Greece has also described it and as my friend Mr Brok described it a short while ago, is that the positive elements of the yes vote outweigh the negative elements, especially when the yes vote to the reunification of Cyprus is considered from the European perspective, in other words that Cyprus will be a member of the European Union.
Nonetheless, the question is: how can we help the yes vote, how can we try to bring about a yes vote in the referendum?
If we are to do this, however, we need to understand why the no vote had and has such resonance among the Cypriots.
Let me give you some examples.
Why would the thousands of refuges vote yes when their future looks uncertain, when they will not all return to their family homes and they will not all acquire their property, while at the same time they will also be deprived of the basic human right of the judicial protection of the European Court of Human Rights?
Similarly, maintaining Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union, under a regime of guarantees by third countries, one of which is not even a member of the Union, goes against the principles of the European Union and weakens the development of the European security and defence policy, quite apart from the fact that the permanent presence of Greek and Turkish troops on the island goes against the principle of demilitarisation which is established in the plan.
I could expand on numerous other reasons which constitute the causes for the resonance of the no vote among Greek Cypriots.
If, therefore, we want to promote the yes vote, we need to recognise and note some of these causes in the text on which we vote, even though these are wish lists, while at the same time demonstrating that European reality also means the European Parliament, where human rights held, hold and will hold a central position.
We are therefore trying, with this text, to impart the idea that there will be, as Mr Papayannakis said, guarantees on security issues for the application of the plan and that we shall lend our ear here to human rights issues.
Only thus can we convince of the importance of the yes vote, based henceforth on the European perspective.
That is why I call on us to ensure that we vote for certain amendments which improve the text and show that the European Parliament is here to support the yes vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I should like to say that I am sorry that Commissioner Verheugen has left.
Obviously he had some other pressing business.
I endorse everything Commissioner Verheugen said and I share his disappointment on this issue, because he really was one of the protagonists, who worked very hard to bring things to maturity, to the point at which we can initiate material reconciliation between the Greeks and Turks in Cyprus.
When I was young, I suffered in my own country from the suppression of the freedom of the press and I feel pain and shame that today Greeks seeking their freedom are depriving Commissioner Verheugen of the right to address them and try to persuade them of what he considers to be right, he who fought so hard for things to reach a satisfactory situation.
We want a yes vote.
Politicians in Greece, all of them, have said that they want a yes vote, with Mr Papandreou leading the way.
We want the guarantees heard here to be given with emphasis, but the greatest guarantee lies in changing the global situation.
The Cypriots divided because they were divided by a now bankrupt colonial regime, because they were divided by the cold war.
These no longer exist.
The European Union has refuted all this and is inviting them into its fold so that they can live differently.
Not in order to keep them divided.
The greatest guarantee is within and they must bring it forth from within themselves.
I shall end by reminding my compatriots in Cyprus of the words of the great Greek politician Eleftherios Venizelos, who said that the every nation seals its own fate and that whatever it does on its own whim is one less thing for its enemy to do.
Â Â  Mr President, I understand why Commissioner Verheugen feels cheated on the 1999 deal that the Greek Cypriot Government would facilitate a settlement if accession were unconditional.
My own view in 1999 that accession was not feasible without unification.
We should have kept both sides guessing in order to keep up the pressure.
I was criticised for that view and accused of bias.
However, it looks as if communication with Turkish Cypriots â convincing them that Europe is friendly and welcoming â has paid off.
That kind of effort has also been undertaken by the European Commission in the face of legalistic objections.
The EU institutions have perhaps let down the Greek Cypriots by failing sufficiently to challenge their version of history or to encourage them to realise that a compromise would be necessary â not a return to the pre-1974 situation.
This House bears some of that responsibility.
Mr Poos calls on Cypriots to leave nationalism at the door.
I welcome that call.
I just wish it had been made consistently on both communities over the last five years.
If indeed the north votes 'yes' and the south 'no', the status quo cannot endure and a new assessment will be needed.
Ways will have to be found to bring Turkish Cypriots out of their political and economic isolation.
For instance, we must drop the requirement for Cypriots to have Greek mother tongue in order to be officials in the EU institutions.
There must be a European Parliament delegation to Northern Cyprus.
I am getting ahead of myself.
I still hope very much that Greek Cypriots, as well as Turkish Cypriots, will vote 'yes' on Saturday.
The World Bank predicts a huge growth spurt of 5% per annum if they do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, first I wish to express the full support of the Communist Party of Greece for the unsubmissive Cypriot people who, unlike the European Union, do not throw UN resolutions on the Turkish invasion and occupation into the waste-paper basket.
As I followed the debate, I remembered the words of the poet: how often came my enemies dressed as friends.
Indeed, some people in Cyprus trusted the European Union.
They believed that the much vaunted acquis communautairewould result in the resolution of the problem.
It turned out that the acquis communautairewas a deception, a rag bag of no value, while erstwhile friends are now pressuring, coercing and threatening, including you, Mr President, and Mr Verheugen, who is showing his disdain for us by his absence.
It is unacceptable and wrong of Mr Verheugen to accuse the President of Cyprus of deceiving him.
MrÂ Papadopoulos and the Greek-Cypriot leadership never promised to accept any monster cobbled together by the UN Secretary General.
What is the Commissioner afraid of?
The obligations which derive from the fact that one part of a Member State of the European Union will be under the occupation of a candidate country?
Who does the Annan plan serve?
The Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots or more general imperialist plans?
What sort of state is it that will operate as an umbrella for two practically independent states, which will even be able to send representatives to European Councils and diplomatic missions, two states which will need special agreements in order to regulate their relations, while being at the mercy of the guarantor powers and foreign courts?
How secure will the Cypriots feel without their own army, but with the military presence of Turkey, Greece, the United Kingdom, perhaps even ÎÎÎ€Î?
How do you judge the fact that the military agreements between the occupying regime and Turkey are being converted into primary Community law?
How do you judge the fact that Cyprus is obliged to support the candidature of Turkey under any circumstances?
Leave at long last the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to assess the situation, to take a decision on the basis of their own interests.
Respect their history, respect their dignity, shake off the arrogance and haughtiness of the suzerain!
Â Â  Mr President, as a friend of the large Cypriot community which I represent in London, I have always supported peaceful reunification of Cyprus.
However, I have never underestimated the practical and political difficulties created over the 30 post-invasion years in which Turkey has moved 120Â 000 mainland settlers into the north, when they do not share the common historical heritage of the island and generally do not speak English or Greek, previously the bicommunal languages.
The Annan III Plan has gone a long way towards settling differences in a fair way.
However, I have received hundreds of e-mails from my Greek Cypriot constituents who are concerned that this plan offers no guarantees on Turkish implementation of troop withdrawal and territorial and property restitution.
It is interesting that even the Greek Cypriots â the lucky ones who have been promised the return of their homes â seem to oppose the plan.
They also object to mainland settlers being granted citizenship, as this would appear to reward the aggressor and violate the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit the settlement of outside populations by the occupying power.
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has rejected the proposals and called for a 'no' vote by the Greek Cypriot community.
I personally believe it is best for outsiders, including Members of this House, not to put any pressure on a referendum process as this would be perceived as interference in Cyprus's sovereign affairs.
Furthermore, if both communities do not give their free consent and the arrangements break down in the future, blame will be apportioned to the players who leaned on the Cypriot people to get a 'yes' vote.
The British Government is prepared to cede some of the sovereign base territory surplus to its needs, if this will help.
I, like many of my colleagues, wish the referendum process well and will support the outcome of the vote on the 24 April, whichever way it goes.
Â Â  â Mr President, in three days the referendum will be held in Cyprus on whether or not to accept the Annan plan.
A yes or a no vote in the referendum will not be two sides of the same coin; it will be different sides of different coins.
The next day will not be the same as the previous day.
Today's debate confirms the vital role of the European Parliament in this entire lengthy development of hope on the Cypriot question and the exceptionally positive role of Commissioner Verheugen, of Mr Poos, and of all sides of the European Union in general.
Now is the time for responsibility on the part of all the political leaders in Cyprus, of both the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots, in Greece and Turkey and in the entire European Union.
The party to which I belong, PASOK, and its President, Georgos Papandreou, are and have been protagonists throughout developments in Cyprus as regards the resolution of the problem and its integration into the European Union.
It is the time of truth.
We must all respond to the challenges of history, by looking the dilemma straight in the eye and responding responsibly and positively.
A yes vote, with all the concerns but which operates in the new environment of the European Union, opens a window to the future and to hope.
A no vote requires an answer.
In all events, the answer will be given by the Cypriot people.
The European Parliament and the European Union give both their support and their capabilities as security guarantees of the full exploitation of all aspects of the Annan plan.
We must ask the same of the UN.
Our resolution today reflects precisely this perspective.
I, as a Greek MEP, whose first contact with politics and political awareness was in the demonstrations and fights of the Cypriots to escape English colonialism and then in all the dramatic events in Cyprus, consider that a yes vote will result in an historic balance with prospects for a positive, historic reconciliation, in which everyone can trust in a positive future of prosperity and security for all, Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and the area in general.
I should like to finish with an ancient Greek motto: time waits for no man.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish I could also say Commissioner but Mr Verheugen has left us very early and I am sorry about that, nearly all the political parties in Greece and the most important parties in Cyprus have come out in favour of the Annan plan.
However, they share the concerns and doubts of the Cypriot people, who are not following the parties in this instance.
The negative reaction which has developed in Cyprus is due, I think, to extreme pressure of time, which has not allowed the people to be informed calmly and analytically.
But how could they be informed within a fortnight of the submission of the last Annan plan?
They could not.
On the contrary, the inciting of passions and misinformation have prevailed, thereby exacerbating fears and doubts.
If the referendum were postponed, as proposed, then the people could be informed more calmly and more substantially and, at the same time, clear and persuasive guarantees could be given that the full text of the plan and the agreement would be respected and would not again be violated by some of the guarantor powers.
Because that is where the problem lies, with the guarantor powers.
It was they who caused most of the disasters in Cyprus.
These guarantees must also be given by the Security Council and by the European Union and by the European Parliament which, with its resolution, improved by the amendments proposed by the PPE-DE, the socialist party and MrÂ Papayannakis, will, I think, strengthen the tendency and desire of the Cypriots to say yes.
The European Parliament must not appear to be exerting pressure.
Blackmail, with threats of sanctions, which have, unfortunately, also come from official lips, have incited the negative stand of an uninformed and terrified people.
That is why, in addition to security guarantees, the prospect of a second referendum must be left open after the referendum in three days' time, which looks like being a no vote.
Better informed Cypriots and stronger security guarantees could change the climate and thus, in two or three months' time, bring in a positive result, for which there is a great deal of hope.
I do not understand why repeating a referendum, which other Member States of the European Union are allowed to do if there is a no vote, as happened in your country, Mr President, should not also be allowed for the Cypriots.
Please vote for my amendments, which make the European Parliament resolution encouraging, reassuring and friendly towards the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots and will, I am sure, encourage them to give a more positive response to the Annan plan.
Â Â  We thought the Nice Treaty was so good we should vote on it twice!
Â Â  â Mr President, without doubt there are practical problems with the Annan plan.
It does not put both sides on an equal footing and it makes provision for painfully long transitional periods for transposing the acquis communautaire.
Nonetheless, we unreservedly support the Poos motion and its constructive proposals, because on the basis of the resolution, first, the illegal Turkish occupation is removed from the northern part, further colonisation is prohibited, certain Greek lands are returned and a number of refugees can return.
This positive position depends, as has been emphasised numerous times today, on a strict system of guarantees of respect for the entire Annan plan.
Secondly, it also depends on an express declaration that we agree in advance to respect any result, as the President-in-Office of the Council wisely emphasised here today.
Â Â  â Mr President, first I should like to congratulate Mr Poos on his work, Mrs Mechtild Rothe on her efforts all these years as Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, MrÂ Oostlander, Mr Brok who is not here and, of course, Commissioner Verheugen, who unfortunately had to leave.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that we are at the moment holding a general political debate on the prevailing climate in the run up to the referendum on Saturday rather than on the content of the Annan plan, because a debate on the content of this plan, despite the fact that its positive points far outnumber its negative points, could turn into a detailed debate lasting several hours.
The positions of my fellow Members and of the Commissioner and the President-in-Office, and all the disappointments expressed in this House about the climate prevailing at the moment in Cyprus, bring me to the conclusion that, apart from the yes or no vote which has been debated closely here too, we should also hold an analytical debate on the proposal by the speaker of the Cypriot parliament, Dimitris Christofias, to postpone the referenda, especially in that postponement would need to be accompanied, on the one hand, by the clarification of certain points in the plan which are creating problems, such as security issues â I would ask Mr Patten to convey to Mr Verheugen the question of primary law and of people taking recourse to the courts â and, on the other hand, by work being carried out in the Security Council on the new resolution we want, which will include guarantees.
I think that these two poles will certainly help to reverse the climate.
Finally, I want to finish by saying that, of course, an opinion needs to be expressed and this opinion of the European Parliament is being expressed through the resolution tabled by Mr Poos, together of course with all the amendments which have been proposed.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their contributions.
Mr President, you and I both come from a divided island and we understand something of the passion that a debate of this nature will engender on the island of Cyprus.
We also understand that conflict which is rooted in history and ingrained for generations is not easy to resolve.
However, we also understand, as practical political people, that every now and again â perhaps once in a generation, or even more rarely than that â an opportunity comes to really change things.
The agreement produced by Kofi Annan offers such an opportunity.
As I said earlier, this is a decision for the people of Cyprus â both North and South.
It is their decision, their decision alone and we will respect that decision.
In short, I can only repeat what the President-in-Office of the Council, the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, said last night.
I should first point out that we need to weigh our words very carefully, as we can all understand the hurt and concerns involved and need to be very careful that nothing is said or done in the next 72 hours to make a grim situation worse.
Last night Mr Ahern summarised the position of the European Council as follows: 'These are crucial days for Cyprus and for its people.
On Saturday the people of the island â North and South â will vote in referenda on the plan for a settlement presented by the United Nations Secretary-General.
Through their patient and determined efforts in cooperation with the parties, the Secretary-General and his hard-working team have created a unique and historic opportunity for a settlement of the Cyprus problem.
In his report to the United Nations Security Council, which was released yesterday, Kofi Annan stated clearly that the plan is the only available, the only foreseeable route for the reunification of Cyprus.
The decision now rests with the people of Cyprus and is for them alone, freely exercising their democratic rights.
The people of Cyprus know that the strong preference of the European Council is for the accession of a united Cyprus to the Union on 1 May.
The European Union is ready to accommodate the terms of the settlement in line with the principles on which this Union is founded.
As President of the European Council over the past few months I have had discussions on Cyprus with political leaders across Europe.'
And this is the important point, Mr President: 'It is only right to say that the view of the overwhelming majority is that the proposed settlement would be good for both communities in Cyprus and good for the European Union'.
Those are the views of the President-in-Office of the European Council and of the vast majority of the democratically elected leaders of the Member States of the European Union.
I said at the outset that we need to weigh our words carefully.
We do not want to cause any difficulties or be seen to be intruding in decisions that are ultimately decisions for the people of Cyprus.
We wish the people of Cyprus well in the remaining hours before they make their decision and hope that it will be the decision that best serves the people of the island of Cyprus as a whole â both North and South.
Â Â  . I should just like to say one or two words about this subject, which is not my normal beat.
Firstly, I should like to apologise, on behalf of Commissioner Verheugen, that he had to leave before the end of the debate.
He had another extremely important engagement, and this debate was scheduled to have ended a good deal earlier.
However, I understand why the debate has run on so long: it arouses considerable passions and great interest in all parts of the House.
We were questioned about what would happen if there was a 'no' vote on the Greek side of the island and a 'yes' vote among the Turkish community.
I should underline that the Commission has already announced that we will soon be putting forward proposals to assist the Turkish community in that unhappy eventuality, which we still hope will not happen.
Clearly we cannot allow the Turkish community to be punished economically and socially because of decisions made by others, so we would have to try to find a solution to the problem of Turkish economic isolation as effectively and rapidly as we could.
I should like to speak briefly about the 1999 Helsinki European Council â the first European Council that I attended.
As I recall, we always knew that the policy we endorsed then had about it an element of risk.
It does not come as a surprise.
We thought it was important to try to decouple the Cyprus conflict from the integration of central and eastern Europe into the European Union.
I believe we made the right decision then and I believe it was the right way to proceed.
But against that background, and in the light of some of the things Commissioner Verheugen said, you will understand why it is not just the Commissioner who feels very strongly that we have been badly let down in the last few days and weeks.
It is a sentiment that is strongly held within the Commission and one that is held way beyond the Commission.
I still hope that we will not be let down.
However, one cannot ignore the fact that there is that sense that we have been cheated.
Â Â  I have received one motion for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure(2).
The debate is closed.
Â Â  With regard to the referendums in Cyprus, Parliamentâs primary objective should be to apply to itself the principles which it is shouting from the rooftops: observance of human rights and respect for democracy.
On the first point, the Annan plan raises fundamental objections.
How could the European Parliament endorse a proposed settlement which denies refugees the right to recover the property taken from them, which constitutes a permanent restriction on peopleâs freedom of movement and establishment, which perpetuates the presence of occupying troops and which does not provide any recourse against violations of human rights before the Strasbourg Court?
On the second point, Parliament must not go along with the scandalous pressure being piled onto the Greek Cypriots by both the United States and the European Commission â and in particular by Commissioner Verheugen, one of the keenest advocates of Turkeyâs accession to the European Union.
The rule of democracy means that the decision of the people must be respected, especially if expressed in the most undeniable way in this respect: a referendum.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  . Mr President, following the targeted killing of the new Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi, the President of the Council issued a statement on 18 April expressing his deep concern at the ongoing and seemingly endless cycle of retaliatory violence involving Palestinian groups and the Israeli authorities and defence forces.
The statement condemned both the assassination of the Hamas leader and the suicide bombing at the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip which took place on the same day.
The statement went on to say that such violence should end immediately and pointed to the self-evident futility of such violence, either as a means of freeing Palestinians from occupation or bringing long-term peace and security to the people of Israel.
The President of the Council once again reminded the Israeli Government that extrajudicial killings are contrary to international law and pointed out that respect for international law should mark an immediate distinction between democratically elected governments and terrorist groups.
Meanwhile, at the conclusion of the foreign ministers' informal meeting in Tullamore on 17 April, the President of the Council issued an important statement on behalf of his colleagues concerning the current situation in the Middle East.
The EU foreign ministers reaffirmed certain basic principles of European policy towards any settlement in the Middle East conflict, including its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution agreed between the parties.
This would result in a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian state, existing side by side and in peace with an Israel living within recognised and secure boundaries.
The ministers reaffirmed that the roadmap represented the only route to achieving such an outcome.
The Union is determined to pursue vigorously the course set out in the roadmap and calls on both sides to fulfil their obligations under the roadmap.
The established position of the European Union, restated by the European Council of 25 and 26 March, is that the Union will not recognise any change in the pre-1967 borders, other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.
The Union has emphasised that no declared views on the possible shape of the final settlement can pre-empt the negotiations of that settlement.
Ministers pointed out that the refugee question, and the manner in which the right to return may be realised, are also final status issues.
The roadmap states that a final and comprehensive permanent status agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must include an agreed, just, fair and realistic solution to this question.
In this context, the Union has noted President Bush's reaffirmation of the United States' commitment to the roadmap and to a negotiated settlement.
The Union emphasises the principle, shared by President Bush, that final status issues are a matter of negotiation and agreement between the parties themselves and that they must not be prejudiced.
Ministers also agreed with the President of the United States that secure and recognised borders should emerge from negotiations between the parties in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 242 and UN Resolution 338.
These and other relevant Security Council Resolutions must form the basis for a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.
In other words the conflict will not be sorted out by unilateral action.
The prospect of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is welcome.
The European Council has stated that such a withdrawal should represent a significant step towards the implementation of the roadmap, provide that it is carried out in accordance with certain conditions.
This is an opportunity which the international community, led by the Quartet, should seize.
The proposed withdrawal should be properly orchestrated with the international community, so as to ensure that an orderly situation in Gaza results, which would permit the maintenance of security as well as the rehabilitation and the reconstruction that is so urgently needed in that area.
The Union urges all parties urgently to undertake preparations towards that end.
On this basis the European Union is ready to support the Palestinian authority in taking responsibility for law and order, as well as to continue the Union's existing aid to the Palestinian authority and to examine possible future needs that may arise in the context of a new situation in Gaza.
Ministers also stressed the need to avoid a political vacuum and the dangers that it would involve in the interim period between now and the beginnings of any withdrawal.
They recalled that there are a number of measures which need to be adopted in the period immediately ahead in the political, security and humanitarian spheres in order to prevent further deterioration and in order to resume progress.
An end to violence and terrorism, as well as the resumption of the ceasefire embracing all of the parties and all of the groups, is essential.
Both sides need to resume negotiations on the peace process without further delay.
We all know from past experience and from history that resolution to difficult and complex issues invariably comes through negotiation, and in fact only comes through negotiation.
A just, lasting and a comprehensive peace must meet the legitimate aspirations of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people and must include Lebanon and Syria.
All states in the region must exert every effort to promote peace and to combat terrorism.
The European Union looks forward to the forthcoming meeting of the Quartet at principles level.
The Quartet should play an active role in pursuing the goal of a comprehensive regional peace and encourage the parties to move ahead vigorously on the basis of the principles outlined above.
The ministers will have a further discussion on the Middle East process at the meetings of the Council on Monday.
They will consider the position to be taken by the European Union at the meeting of the Quartet, which will take place in New York on 4 May.
I hope that I have succeeded in giving the Members a clear impression of how actively focused this presidency remains when it comes to the very difficult situation in the Middle East.
We will, by the same token, listen with great attention to the views of Parliament on this important issue at this time.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not wish to repeat or intend to repeat what the presidency has just said about recent discussions on the Middle East by the Council or how it has reacted to the statement made by President Bush in Washington last week after his meeting with Prime Minister Sharon.
The statement surprised many people, whether understandably or not, and one cannot disguise the fact that it seems to have caused great concern in the Arab world.
Some have subsequently argued that it should not have done so.
They have said that it offers a way into the implementation of that roadmap, rather than a tearing-up of the roadmap.
They have argued that we should seek out the positive, like the promised and welcomed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, rather than focus on the negative.
So be it.
I do not seek to second-guess the doubtless well-intentioned interpretations of others or to undermine efforts to make the most of the present, exceptionally difficult, situation.
Some of course always see a glass as half full when others believe it is half empty.
Others find it rather challenging to believe that a glass is half full when they cannot see very much liquid in the glass at all.
I guess that like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder.
I do not wish to dwell on those matters.
I will just make five points which we must address if we are to draw anything positive from the present grim situation.
First, as the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the European Council has said again and again, a final settlement can only be achieved as a result of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, resulting in two viable sovereign and independent states based on the borders of 1967, perhaps amended by agreement, living side by side in peace and security as laid out, for example, in the roadmap.
This has been the main thread of European thinking, from Venice in 1980 to Berlin in 1999, to Seville in 2002 and right up to the latest European Council conclusions of last month.
It is not surprising that we have agreed with what for 37 years has been the consistent American position, that settlements beyond the 1967 borders are illegal and represent 'obstacles to peace'.
We all know what the ingredients for a final settlement will be.
They are contained in the Mitchell report and in subsequent documents, including the Arab League peace initiative of 2002.
They are also in the roadmap that has been endorsed by the international community.
A settlement does not await some heavenly insight.
It awaits the exercise of political will by both sides â Israeli and Palestinian.
It is in my judgment a tragedy that the courageous proposals of the representatives of civil society who negotiated the Geneva initiative do not seem to be shared by the political leadership in their communities.
Second, we deplore the violence which postpones reconciliation and any chance whatsoever of peace.
We have always deplored without reservation and condemned with all our strength the suicide bombings that take innocent lives and the dark propaganda that clouds the minds of so many.
We are also profoundly critical of heavy-handed military retaliation which destroys lives, homes and livelihoods, the sort of retaliation which increases extremism and does not increase security.
We believe that targeted assassinations are wrong, illegal and counter-productive.
One of the Palestinian politicians whom I most admire, a voice of sanity and reason, referred recently to the deafening sound of war drums on both sides and to the bitter fact that both communities seem to be locked in an embrace in which all that seems to matter is causing pain to the other side.
There is plenty of pain on offer, but not much promise of peace.
Third, whatever the criticisms of the European approach to the dispute, we can say that we have sustained, throughout the weeks, months and years of bloodshed and hopelessness, institutions which can one day form the basis for a reformed Palestinian Government.
That has been the policy of the European Council, endorsed by this Parliament.
We have been congratulated for what we have done by, among others, the World Bank.
Only recently I received a letter from the Palestinian Finance Minister, Salam Fayad, which noted that with the help of the European Union the Palestinian Authority has now delivered on all of the reform commitments it had made to the Palestinian Legislative Council a year and a half ago.
There is now a high degree of accountability, with transparent budget procedures.
There are no more cash payments to Palestinian security personnel, whose salaries are now transferred through bank accounts.
We have been encouraged, in private, to do more â to give more help.
We have been criticised in public for doing anything at all.
Some have argued that there could actually be a no more serious accusation than that the attempt to promote reform and sustain some sort of life in Palestine has bankrolled terrorism.
Parliament has held its own inquiry into these matters and OLAF has investigated these allegations.
I have no more to say on the subject, save to pay tribute to my officials who have tried to implement a difficult policy honestly, transparently and with integrity.
When I look at what has happened in the last few years I can see all too little else that has achieved as much as they have.
Turning to the future, it is said by some â perhaps a trifle glibly â that after the promised withdrawal we will rebuild Gaza and try to create the foundations for a new Palestine.
What they presumably have in mind is a Palestine which is genuinely viable, not a collection of isolated bantustans divided by tanks, settlements and walls.
We are certainly prepared to continue our humanitarian assistance and to support the rebuilding of the infrastructure of those areas from which the Israeli defence forces withdraw.
But I have to say that this time we should seek certain guarantees from the Israeli defence forces that they will not destroy again what we build.
They should take into account the five points made by the European Council of 25 and 26 March, notably, the anchoring of the withdrawal within the roadmap and the facilitation of economic life in the territory that the Israeli defence forces leave.
It was the World Bank that noted that the biggest obstacle to economic revival is lack of access and a lack of sufficient freedom of movement of persons and goods.
Access to the outside world is essential for reviving the Palestinian economy.
We should also seek to ensure that humanitarian assistance can be provided as it would be elsewhere.
At present it costs more to provide the assistance than in most other places because of the behaviour and activities of the security forces.
If we are to find a way back into implementation of the roadmap then we need to discuss very carefully with the Israeli Government the terms of withdrawal and see how we can associate the management of the withdrawal with the objectives of the roadmap.
Our aim must be that Israelis recognise again the Palestinian Authority as their partner in the peace process.
The objective should be to hand over Gaza and parts of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority, not to Hamas, and to ensure that the handover takes place in an orderly fashion, not in a way that leads to more chaos and more violence.
Finally, there are still â thank heaven â some moderates in Palestine, Israel and the Arab world.
I ask this question as quietly and diplomatically as I can: how much support are we giving those moderates today?
If we are not prepared to be courageous for moderation, how can we expect them to be?
It is not hyperbolic to say that the outlook today in the region is more worrying than it has been for some time.
It certainly seems to me a good deal more disturbing than it looked, for example, at the beginning of last year when we were being told that the road to peace in the Middle East lay in the military liberation of Baghdad and the installation of democracy in Iraq.
Maybe one day Iraq will be stable and democratic and maybe it will be a beacon for other countries in the region.
How could one hope for anything else?
Whatever one's views about the past, what else is there to work for?
However, if we are to have any chance of achieving that outcome and of encouraging modernisation and democracy in the whole region, then we have to avoid words and policies that alienate large parts of the Islamic world and threaten the very clash of civilisations which all sane men and women should want to avoid at all costs.
It has been a deeply depressing feature of my five years as a Commissioner that the world I look out onto today seems to be far more dangerous than it was in 1999.
We must always try to work for a better world and not throw in our hand in introverted despair.
Today, among other things, we must see what we can rescue from what is left of the Middle East peace process.
It is not a very encouraging prospect, but what alternative is there?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I think the start of the Commissioner's speech has made it clear that recent events require some interpretation.
Do we regard the course set out in the roadmap as dead and buried following the meeting between Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush, or should we see new opportunities that can be exploited over the coming days, weeks and months?
I must admit that the Irish Presidency's initial reaction tends towards the first position, whereas the stance adopted by a number of foreign ministers in their statements leaned towards the second.
I myself endorse the position adopted by the foreign ministers, including the German foreign minister, who said that this initiative brings movement into the process which we should now exploit.
Despite all the scepticism that we might feel at the proposed withdrawal from Gaza that was outlined to us yesterday and again today by the two representatives of the Geneva initiative, the European Union should bring its influence to bear on the parties to the conflict, especially Israel, and make it clear that this withdrawal must be the first stage in its withdrawal from all the occupied territories.
In that sense, the withdrawal is the right move.
That being the case, a Prime Minister who is affiliated to the right wing in Israel and who may soon be responsible for ejecting settlers from their homes in Gaza by force needs a broader framework in which to explain his position.
If the withdrawal from Gaza is indeed successful and the orderly handover to the Palestinian authority takes place as demanded yet again by the Commissioner a few moments ago, and if many of the homes currently being used are then offered to people from Gaza, and if the infrastructure is not dismantled but handed over to the Palestinian authority, this may well offer a fresh opportunity for peace.
If we take the attitude that the whole thing is pointless and doomed to failure, we will have no chance of influencing the process.
However, if we see this as a positive opportunity and work within it, I believe that the roadmap can be revitalised.
Reading the US President's letter to the Israeli Prime Minister carefully, we see that the Israelis are also expected to play their part.
The President himself refers to UN Security Council Resolution 242.
The President himself also says that only negotiations can ultimately produce a solution.
We should emphasise these passages of his letter in our further positions on this conflict.
Let me make a second point.
I believe that it is indeed the case that a solution to this conflict, which is not restricted solely to Gaza, can only be successful over the long term within two viable and independent states.
The Commissioner also referred to the work of this Parliament in relation to the deployment of European funds.
We have adopted two reports on this issue, a majority and a minority report, but there was 80% agreement on the findings.
One of these findings can be shared with the House today: the accusation that the European Union has funded terrorism cannot be proven and is untenable.
On the issue of whether the decision to provide direct financial assistance was right or wrong, we can adopt various positions.
However, the decision was taken by the foreign ministers, not the Commissioner.
The Commission has done its utmost to contribute to the reform of the Palestinian authority.
It has been at pains to exercise control over the use of European funds, and we can confirm today that the situation in the Palestinian authority has indeed improved compared with three years ago.
We must thank the Commission and Commissioner Patten for their work on this issue, notwithstanding the divergent political views on whether the decision was right or wrong.
Â Â  Mr President, paragraph 51 of this Parliamentâs recent Resolution on the results of the European Council states that âwithout strong pressure on the two sides, the Road Map will remain ineffectiveâ.
Naturally, I believe that the Road Map is still ineffective and I wonder what has happened to the pressure on Israel.
Parliament also calls on âthe United States Administration to assume their responsibility vis-Ã -vis the present crisisâ.
In my opinion, that government has not only failed to assume its responsibilities, but has given in to the Israeli Government.
Powellâs comments of last Thursday are, in my view, a mixture of absurd wishful thinking and cynicism, when he said that the meeting between Bush and Sharon has produced positive results for the Palestinians and their aspirations for a State.
This is demonstrated by the fact that the minister without portfolio of the Israeli Government, Gideon Ezra, stated on Friday that Powellâs comments, intended to soften Bushâs pro-Israeli tone, do not reflect the opinion of Bush himself.
Parliamentâs Resolution also calls for both parties âto make a serious effort to resume genuine negotiationsâ.
In my opinion, the Palestinian National Authority has been waiting for months for the resumption of those negotiations, but it is clear that Israel does not want to negotiate with the Palestinian National Authority and is prepared at this point, with the full support of Bush, to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza outside the framework of the Road Map.
It has become sufficiently clear, in my view, that it is not a question of Gaza first and West Bank second, but of Gaza only.
Following so many events we should remember another two paragraphs of our Resolution; paragraph 48, included following the killing of Sheikh Yassin, which: âcalls on the Council and the Commission to consider acting in full compliance with Article 2 of the Association Agreement with Israel should the policy of extrajudicial killings continueâ.
Well, the extra-judicial executions are continuing, most recently of Abdel Aziz Rantisi.
I therefore believe that Parliament must reiterate its request to the Council and the Commission.
Also, finally, in paragraph 49 Parliament âasks the Council to invite the Member States in the UN Security Council immediately to table a proposal for an international peacekeeping force at the 1967 borders, with the mandate to protect both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples from terrorist attacks, military incursions and interventionsâ.
We must also reiterate that demand.
Â Â  Mr President, after President Bush's endorsement of Mr Sharon's prejudgment of final status negotiations â ruling himself out as an even-handed peacebroker â it is easy to be discouraged about the prospects for the coexistence of a secure Israel and a viable Palestinian state, but that is the only real solution via the roadmap.
It may well be that Israel keeping some key West Bank settlements and Palestinians accepting that the return of refugees will be to a Palestinian state â with which I personally agree â would indeed be part of an eventual negotiated settlement.
The Quartet, with EU leadership, must disprove, however, Mr Sharon's claim that his plan constitutes a critical blow to Palestinian hopes of statehood.
I am absolutely committed to the existence of Israel as a Jewish homeland and state â though one in which Arab Israelis have full, equal rights â and Israel's right to live in peace and security within recognised boundaries.
My dismay at the occupation is not only about the misery of ordinary Palestinians but also how the role of colonial occupier is damaging Israel's integrity and its commitment to the rule of law.
I condemn all terrorism against Israel and I do not see suicide bombers as purely the product of desperation among Palestinians â real though that desperation is.
There is also exploitation of young people and a despicable culture of martyrdom in a perversion of Islam.
The wall or fence might be capable of justification if it were on the Green Line â but it is not.
The Bush-Sharon policy of military defeat will not ensure Israel's security.
Hamas is a dangerous and uncompromising organisation dedicated to Israel's destruction, but the recent illegal assassinations of its leaders simply create more bitterness and recruits for terrorism.
I am deeply worried about the rising incidence of anti-Semitism in Europe and take a strong interest in combating it, as well as other kinds of racial and religious prejudice.
The delay by the EU Monitoring Centre in producing timely work on the threat to Europe's Jewish communities naturally fed suspicions about bias.
We need renewed vigour in exposing and rooting out anti-Semitism and in establishing the dividing line between legitimate criticism of the policies of the Israeli Government and the demonisation of Jews.
I understand the shock that Israelis must have felt at the poll last year that said that 59% of Europeans considered Israel a threat to world peace.
I believe that many respondents read that question as being about the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, but it was deeply unhelpful to pose it in that way.
However, the result was a wake-up call.
We need a more intense EU-Israel dialogue.
That is why I personally oppose any calls in the European Parliament to boycott Israel, and calls for cutting academic links are completely counterproductive.
I have equally resisted moves to eliminate EU funding for the Palestinian Authority.
I welcome the fact that it is Palestinians themselves calling for a clean-up of corruption, but Israel needs a negotiating partner and the sub-Saharan poverty level of Palestinians would be even greater without EU support.
Finally, it is unworthy of Israel and its tradition of justice to persecute Mordechai Vanunu in a vindictive manner after his release.
He has served his sentence and he should now be free.
Â Â  MrÂ President, today, Mordechai Vanunu is to be released.
He is one of the heroes of our time, the man who confirmed that Israel has significant stocks of nuclear weapons that could turn the whole of the Middle East into a nuclear desert.
For this achievement in the service of peace, his reward was to be kidnapped by the State of Israel and sentenced to 18 yearsâ imprisonment.
The surrounding world largely forgot him.
Israel is allowed to possess its nuclear weapons in peace, while Arab and Muslim states that attempt to obtain protection for themselves against the threat of Israelâs nuclear weapons are bombed to smithereens and destroyed.
Why does the world community not intervene in regard to Israeli nuclear weapons?
Why does the same not happen to Dimona as happened to Ossirak?
The unbalanced approach on the part of the world community is one of the reasons for the despair that now prevails in the Middle East, a feeling confirmed here in Parliament yesterday by two of the areaâs foremost peace campaigners, Abraham Burg and Yassir Rabo.
In , Egyptâs President Mubarak stated that hatred of the United States in the Arab world has never at any time been as strong as it is today.
The United States backs Israel 100%.
For that reason, the United States cannot bring about peace on its own.
A better balance is needed, and the EU could bring this about by backing the Palestinians as strongly as the United States backs Israel.
The EU could translate its words into deeds and implement Parliamentâs call for the association agreement with Israel to be suspended.
The EU could despatch troops to protect Palestinian areas.
The EU could demand that Israel dismantle its stocks of nuclear weapons.
The EU could issue an invitation to Vanunu and grant him asylum in the EU country of his choosing.
The EU could go still further.
Some years ago, I met Shimon Perez.
He proposed that both Israel and Palestine should be offered EU membership, on condition that they had achieved a stable peace.
Clearly, the EU has an attraction beyond its borders that it does not always have among its own Member States.
Let us make use of the fact.
Offer EU membership to Palestine and Israel as a reward for achieving a definitive peace.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as Vice-Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, I feel vicarious shame for the unilateral policy of Prime Minister Sharon, who is adding more and more fuel to the fire in the Middle East; indeed, throughout the world, as this is not a case of an isolated conflict; quite the reverse.
The illegal executions of Hamas leaders will have a boomerang effect, and new leaders are always waiting in the wings.
Sharon is only able to do this because of the unconditional support he obtains from PresidentÂ Bush.
Things agreed in Washington are an affront to its partners in the Quartet, and the EU in particular.
To my knowledge, the European Union has not been consulted once.
We, the European Parliament, must demand that Javier Solana puts his foot down in his dealings with the Quartet.
If the USA now wants support for Iraq, it must in turn come up with support for an international force in the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal, and in the West Bank as the following step.
Solana could also put the Geneva Accord on the table.
After all, Colin Powell has approved this, and it has his support.
This must also be clarified.
Avraham Burg, who was present in this House yesterday, once said that the roadmap had to be produced in Geneva.
I think that, as a signal to the Palestinian people, we can demand an increase in the humanitarian aid we give to this impoverished people.
Â Â  Mr President, one thing I would like to emphasise in the few seconds that I have here today is that the European Union must be more forceful in its presentation of its position vis-Ã -vis the Middle East.
It must make clear to Israel, to the Palestinians and indeed to the United States that we are serious about finding a solution.
For that to happen, the international community, via the Quartet, has to act as an even-handed broker for peace.
It is deeply regrettable that the United States administration, for purely electoral reasons, has decided to ditch the roadmap.
We have to try and revive that, insofar as we can, and I wish the presidency luck with its efforts to achieve that over the next few weeks.
However, we have one weapon in our hands which we have consistently refused to use or even to threaten to use, and that is the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel.
What other weapon do we have in order to pressurise Israel to take its responsibilities seriously in that region?
There is no other way in my view that we can bring the Israelis to the negotiating table in a serious frame of mind.
Certainly the decision of the US Government last week to play to the Sharon government has not resulted in the ending of its assassination policy.
It has not resulted in the ending of its 'apartheid wall' policy or of its policy of strengthening settlements in the West Bank, all of which is a recipe for continued pain and disaster in the Middle East.
Â Â  . I should like to thank all Members for their contributions to what has been a very important debate.
I listened to the weariness in Commissioner Patten's voice when he was speaking.
It is a weariness shared by us all in that we have to return the same issue over and over again.
It saddens me to note that, in the three short weeks since we last debated this issue, the situation has become worse, not better.
We are all depressed by the endlessly grim sequence of events in the region.
This debate, however, gives us an opportunity to continue to remind all of the players and parties in the Middle East â to take up the point made by Mr De Rossa in his final contribution â that people must behave even-handedly and within the acceptable limits of international law.
We should also take the opportunity to remind other parties that there is no alternative to full and impartial negotiation of a two-state solution, that this solution should result in a viable, contiguous and sovereign, independent Palestinian state, and that the roadmap is the only available way of achieving that.
If I correctly heard Mr Laschet, he raised two points.
First, I believe he suggested that the presidency views the roadmap as somehow dead.
That is emphatically not the case.
That is certainly not the view of this presidency.
We have said time and again that the roadmap is the only viable way out of the current morass.
Mr Laschet also seemed to suggest that we see no opportunity for movement arising from the Israeli plans for withdrawal from Gaza.
That does not accurately reflect either the presidency's position or the position I stated at Tullamore.
I reject the notion that European Union Member States are in any way disunited on the matter.
There is absolute agreement within the Union on this.
The Council of Ministers made that clear.
The important, substantial and final statement unanimously agreed by the 25 ministers last weekend makes the position very clear.
Questions arise as to whether the roadmap is dead.
The roadmap remains the only framework; it is the only option available.
There is nothing else available.
That point has to be made clear.
I am confident that not only is the roadmap as valid and as centrally relevant now as it was when it was first put in place, but its relevance, importance and significance must also continue to be reiterated, particularly when the Quartet meets â probably in New York on 4 May.
The question was raised as to the plans to dismantle the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip.
Again, the foreign ministers and the general affairs ministers made it clear that there are five elements in this area: first, withdrawal in Gaza must take place within the context of the roadmap; second, it must be seen as a step towards a two-state solution; third, it must not involve the transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; fourth, there must be an organised and negotiated handover to the Palestinian Authority; fifth, Israel must facilitate the humanitarian reconstruction of Gaza, in which the European Union has invested very heavily.
The issue of anti-Semitism was raised.
The ongoing difficulties in the region must never be allowed to become the basis for anti-Semitism to raise its head in Europe again.
I agree with Baroness Ludford on that particular point.
Her point has been taken.
Last autumn the European Union took an unprecedented initiative at the UN General Assembly in proposing a stand-alone resolution condemning all manifestations of anti-Semitism.
At the OSCE conference that will take place in Berlin on 28 and 29 April the Union will play its full and appropriate part in addressing and condemning this appalling phenomenon.
Mr De Rossa has said a great deal on this issue with which I agree wholeheartedly.
The European Union must be an even-handed player.
Mr De Rossa is absolutely consistent and right about that.
He is also right about the need for all the players to take a balanced view.
However, I am not so sure that he was correct when he suggested that suspension of the Association Agreement is an appropriate tool.
Suspension is not on the agenda at the moment.
Consensus within the Union would be required for such a step.
Those arguing that such an action should take place would have to consider the undesirable consequences arising from it.
Article 2 of the Agreement reinforces obligations already incumbent on the signatories in respect of human rights.
Perhaps we should emphasise that responsibility.
Meetings of the Association Council with Israel provide the European Union with an opportunity to emphasise our concerns â and those stated so many times by Mr De Rossa â to the Israeli authorities.
It is better to have a channel to do that.
It would be wrong to let the debate pass without mentioning suicide bombings and terrorist attacks against Israel.
The Israeli viewpoint, all too often, is that we are not mindful of their concerns.
That is not the case.
Suicide and terrorist attacks against civilian targets are condemned.
They are an abomination. We all condemn them.
Suicide bombings advance no legitimate agenda and can only do damage to the interests of the Palestinian people as well as causing further untold mayhem, damage and suffering to the Israeli people, which has suffered far too much in the past.
We have to be even-handed in this.
I believe that Europe is even-handed in this.
I agree with Commissioner Patten that, if Europe yet again rebuilds what has been put in place to support the Palestinian people, the least we can expect is that the Israeli authorities should support, respect and protect that infrastructure.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, the transatlantic relationship is a co-element in Ireland's presidency programme and we are working very hard to reaffirm the strength, depth and the significance of that relationship, which will come as no surprise to anybody.
Politically and economically the European Union and the United States have never been more interdependent.
While it is not possible to be in full agreement on all issues â friends very seldom are, and a sign of mature friendship is that they can differ even on significant issues â it is important that any differences that exist are managed in a way which avoids damaging the overall relationship.
We all know that the European Union and US relationship has been through a difficult period, not least over the policy on Iraq.
There have been tensions and disagreements both across the Atlantic and indeed within Europe.
It is good to remind ourselves from time to time that nobody has an absolute monopoly on wisdom.
Similarly, on the way forward in the Middle East there have been differences in approach between the United States and the European Union.
We are nonetheless prepared to keep working on the basis of the roadmap, including through the mechanism of the Quartet.
For too long now, a negative image of the transatlantic relationship has been portrayed in certain circles and media.
It often seems to be an iron law of the media that disagreement is more noteworthy than agreement.
I suppose, in a sense, it is easy to see how disagreement makes good news â or certainly good copy.
It is important, therefore, that we, as elected representatives, should inform our citizens that, overall, the transatlantic relationship is extremely productive and remains positive.
In January the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, said in this Parliament â and we should remind ourselves of his words â that 'the world is a better and a safer place when the European Union and the United States work together, when they pool their considerable energy and resources to achieve our shared goals based on our shared values.'
The Irish presidency is focusing on pragmatic cooperation with our US partners and pragmatism, rather than ideology, should inform our approach.
We are trying to work closely together on many foreign policy areas, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, Afghanistan, the Middle East and the western Balkans â to single out just a few of the dossiers in which we have a common interest and to single out just a few of the areas where we are working closely together.
We will not agree on all those areas, but at least we are working along similar lines.
On economic and trade issues in particular, it is important to put any transatlantic differences into perspective.
Ireland, during its presidency, is seeking to focus on the positive economic agenda between the United States and the European Union, while effectively managing the small number of outstanding disputes which account for slightly less than 3% or of our overall trade policies.
I want to take this opportunity to address one particular point of immediate concern in terms of our relationship with the United States.
I followed very closely the debate in this Parliament on the international agreement with the United States on the transfer of passenger information.
I am conscious of the concerns that have been raised, including the concerns about the need to protect citizens' rights to privacy and to redress in the event of error.
I fully understand the point made by Members that it important to have a way of addressing errors in the PNR area.
I am also conscious of the need to address the very real concerns that exist in the US about the terrorist threat.
This time last week I was in New York and, for the very first time, went to the scene of the horror at the World Trade Center.
I have been in New York four times since 9/11 and I have always avoided going down there, because I, as we all did, watched what happened on the television, and I did not wish to see the pain.
So I understand in that context why the United States and why certain factions of people within the United States see the need to adopt a very stringent role and attitude in their response to terrorism and, in particular, why they are concerned about this issue.
Let me make myself clear: I believe that the Commission has worked long and hard to ensure that the draft agreement strikes a balance between the rightful concerns to protect personal privacy and the need to increase security in the air for all passengers across the Atlantic.
I accept and respect that not all Members of this House think that the balance has been properly struck.
However, I would make the point to them that the Commission has to be commended for its work.
MrÂ Watson mentioned another agreement and said that this is an agreement which may be the best-worst solution, but it is the solution that is available.
He was talking about Cyprus.
These words may well apply also to the agreement on which this House will vote shortly.
I believe the Commission has done as well as it could be expected to do and that the agreement on offer is the best we are going to get; certainly much better than we will get if we enter into some form of stasis and stand-off situation with the US authorities on this in the next few hours, because in reality they will take the decisions that they believe are necessary for their security.
I do not believe that if a European citizen on holiday in Florida has to queue for 18 or 19 hours in the heat of the day waiting for clearance they will thank any of us if we take an ill-informed decision.
That is not to say that I do not respect the views of Members â of course I do.
I have listened and I have read a great deal of the correspondence that has been exchanged over the last 48 hours here.
I have discussed the issue and my concerns with Members.
I understand fully and I appreciate the concerns.
Of course people want to protect civil liberties but we also want to protect the reality and the reality is that if we make the wrong decision very few people in Europe will be thanking us in a month's time.
Having said that, I respect any decision that this Parliament makes.
The deal which has been worked out by the Commission is a necessary one.
In the circumstances it is a good deal.
The status quo is unsustainable.
Failure to support the draft agreement opens the way to uncertainty, particularly uncertainty for the airline industry.
It will be detrimental to the interests and the needs of passengers.
That is the important point.
I accept the concerns and the anxiety that we should have safeguards, certainly that there should be a finality on information that is transferred, but we need to take practical political decisions.
We are politicians in a political assembly and we should take decisions.
A balanced deal and the opportunity to work and put in place a good and balanced deal as soon as possible are things that we should all work for.
The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Brian Cowen, led the European Union Troika for the successful EU-US ministerial meeting in Washington on 1 March.
It met with US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and with the National Security Adviser, Condoleeza Rice.
Their discussions were extensive and frank and they covered a range of international issues of shared concern.
In fact anybody who knows Minister Cowen will know that any discussion he enters into is usually frank, vigorous and to the point.
It is in the same spirit of partnership that the Taoiseach looks forward to welcoming President Bush to Ireland for the US-EU summit in June, a summit meeting which I know will bring added value to the relationship.
It is a summit which has been criticised in some places, but the reality of it is that the United States exists and Europe exists and it would be foolhardy in the extreme if we did not continue to debate and discuss our relationship.
The other vital pillar of the transatlantic relationship is of course the European Union's close and productive relationship with Canada.
In fact when we talk about the transatlantic relationship we all too often forget that reality.
From our shared history and from our shared values, from political pluralism and democracy and the rule of law, as well as on human rights, there was so much evidence of our firm attachment to the United Nations and to multilateralism.
Europe and Canada have a great deal in common and the relationship between Europe and Canada is a close one.
It is a productive relationship and it is one that requires recognition by both sides from time to time.
It is in this context that the very successful EU-Canada summit in Ottawa on 18 March saw the launch of two major new initiatives â the EU-Canada Partnership Agenda and the framework of a new bilateral trade and investment enhancement agreement.
The summit in Ottawa also gave a chance for the President of the Council and Prime Minister Martin to lead their EU and Canadian teams in wide-ranging discussions on major international issues, including looking at ways to promote effective global governance through revitalised international institutions.
I should say â from personal experience of having worked for a very brief time with CEDA in Canada â that the Canadians bring a huge amount to the table in this particular regard, something which they do quietly and unobtrusively and which is all too frequently ignored.
In closing I want to say that I am very conscious that our transatlantic dialogue is formed more than by just what happens at official and government levels.
For this reason we were very happy two weeks ago to host in Ireland the 58th interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the US Congress under the joint chairmanship of Mr Nicholson and Henry Hyde.
It was my very great pleasure to actually host one of those meetings and it was a quite remarkable exchange.
I want to commend the Members of this House for this particular initiative.
It is very important that this House continues to have a very lively dialogue with Congress, because my own personal experience is that all too often in Congress Europe is seen through a very hazy glass.
The type of one-to-one relationship which this House has established with its counterparts in Congress is very welcome.
As I said, I witnessed the exchanges at first hand.
They are healthy, positive and productive.
I had the opportunity to meet the MEPs involved.
The debates were quite extraordinarily wide-ranging and, as the meeting was held in Ireland, much of it went on in my own constituency.
A good time was had by all as well and there is no harm in that!
The presidency is fully aware of how closely Parliament is involved in taking the transatlantic relationship forward.
We celebrate and commend that good work.
I realise that some of the words I have said will not fall easily on some of the ears in this House, but they are made against the background that friends can sometimes disagree, even on important issues.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by supporting the presidency's commendation of Irish hospitality.
Having spent the weekend at two conferences in Ireland myself, I can warmly endorse what the Minister said and I also warmly endorse his other remarks, not least what he said about our relations with Canada.
When one has problem-free relationships, it very often means that one does not discuss them sufficiently or with sufficient enthusiasm.
However we did set out last year, in a Commission document, some sensible proposals about beefing-up our trade and investment relationship with Canada.
Those were sensible proposals that were well received by our Canadian friends.
From the Middle East to the other trouble spots around the world we invariably see eye-to-eye with our Canadian friends who, I think, very much accept our notion of effective multilateralism.
So I was pleased that the Minister referred to that important relationship.
I am obviously grateful for the opportunity to commend once again the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for its commitment â demonstrated by this resolution â to the evolution and strengthening of transatlantic ties.
It is a testament to this House's maturity and common sense that, amidst the emotions of a turbulent 18 months, it has maintained a positive and objective approach.
That this relationship remains the keystone in the European Union's external relations is not to be doubted.
We have often talked in this Chamber not only about the stakes involved â the enormous flow of goods, services and investment and the millions of jobs that depend on them â but also about how this partnership is indispensable for promoting democracy, overcoming regional instability and coping with global challenges.
It is worth recalling some of the remarkable achievements there have been in the area of economic cooperation.
Mutual recognition agreements have removed technical barriers in fields ranging from telecommunications to marine equipment.
We have entered into bilateral agreements on customs procedures and veterinary equivalents.
We are progressing in discussions on the regulatory dialogue in financial markets, removing obstacles for our operators in this ever more integrated industry.
We are well advanced in negotiations on a cooperation agreement for Galileo and GPS and we are moving towards an open aviation area agreement.
Despite all these successes much still remains to be done in pressing forward regulatory convergence.
Neither the transatlantic economic partnership nor the positive economic agenda have developed as fully as we would have liked in removing barriers.
We are therefore considering a joint EU-US review of the transatlantic economy, to report to the 2005 EU-US summit with a view to identifying impediments to further economic integration and to addressing the means for removing them.
We have talked too about the importance of the relationship beyond the confines of the transatlantic community.
After the strains in our relationship last year it has now become clear to all that we face common challenges which we will overcome far more effectively in combination than in competition.
This of course implies that we have the political will in the European Union to unite our positions, and that we have in addition the capacity to act.
The language of transatlantic cooperation can often seem tired and clichÃ©d.
That is no reason to allow these important truths to go unsaid or to be drowned out by the discordant notes of those whom, for whatever reason, look to divide Europe and the United States.
In this spirit, I welcome the priorities set out in the resolution, many of which are familiar and match those on which we are working in the run-up to the EU-US Summit to which the Minister referred.
I would like to single out very briefly three issues which are referred to in the resolution.
First of all, HIV/AIDS.
The European Union and the United States have both welcomed last years World Trade Organisation decision on the TRIPS agreement and public health.
We must now implement this decision in legislative form without delay, with the active support of our business communities.
We must ensure that the Global Health Fund can build on sustained and reliable sources of funding.
In order to address the root causes of the pandemic in Africa, we are looking to European Union and US investors to establish a partnership to promote the improvement of health care where they operate in Africa, and we clearly need to do more together to tackle poverty there.
Second, a brief word on China and Russia.
Russia's proximity to Europe and the speed and scale of economic development in China suggests that we must continue to engage closely with both.
Continuing political engagement and a range of financial instruments demonstrate our determination to encourage Russia's development as a stable, prosperous democracy.
We will continue to encourage China to take a greater role in international affairs concomitant with its expanding economic capacity and interests.
I hope we can encourage our US friends to regard China's stability and economic development as a good thing for all of us, rather than as a threat.
We discussed the Middle East earlier, and I will not dwell on the arguments that we analysed an hour or so ago with some sadness.
I will simply say that we have to encourage modernisation throughout the region along the sort of lines now suggested in two UNDP reports.
We have to support Arab initiatives and Arab ownership of modernisation and democratisation, and must develop the plans that we already have in place â for example through the Euromed partnership â rather than believing it necessary to introduce new institutional arrangements.
I would in particular like to underline the importance that Commissioner Lamy and I attach to the successful conclusion, as soon as possible, of a free trade agreement between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
I repeat that, by and large, we are more likely to achieve most of the things we want to achieve in the world if we can work with the United States.
It is also true â though perhaps not as often conceded â that the United States is more likely to be able to achieve what it wants if it is able to work with us.
We agree that there is much for the European Union and the US to do both in terms of our bilateral dealings and in cooperation in the wider world.
The extent to which this requires the establishment of new structures or working methods is more difficult to judge.
However, I note that since the launch of the New Transatlantic Agenda in 1995 the mechanisms of the relationship have served us well.
The ups and downs we have experienced have been the result not of the institutions of the NTA but of genuine policy disagreements.
They have not been the result of procedural failure or systemic failure.
Where we have seen the need for changes we have been quite pragmatic.
For example, we are about to launch an enhanced security dialogue with the United States, which should reduce the scope for confusion and confrontation on a range of transport and other protective security matters.
Though I follow what the President-in-Office said in his extremely sensitive remarks about the issue of passenger name records, I am not quite sure what sort of dialogue the United States would expect us to carry forward if on this issue â which we have put a lot of effort into resolving â we were now to either scupper the prospects of an agreement or to put it on the backburner for the indefinite future.
Do we wish to be taken seriously in this realm or not?
With elections looming here and in the United States, with a new Commission to be appointed in the autumn and with the Constitutional Treaty coming over the horizon, I would argue that this is not necessarily the right time for a really radical change.
However, I totally accept that just as we need to look at the workings of the transatlantic economy, we should also review the workings of the New Transatlantic Agenda.
To that effect, I am about to launch an independent study of the New Transatlantic Agenda which, in turn, should form the basis of an EU-US policy review in 2005.
I believe that is the right timing.
I respect those who take a different point of view, but hope we all recognise that we are working towards the same objectives.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, my group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thinks it essential to view the excellent and close relations that exist above all between the EU and the United States, though, in a broader context, between Europe and North America, as has been reiterated here, as a key factor in maintaining global peace and economic growth.
If these, the two largest economic and military players in the world, were to come into permanent conflict, as unlikely as that may be, it would be a global disaster.
That is why our group, in any political or economic disagreements that happen to arise, tries to look ahead and find solutions rather than point the finger.
We are indeed concerned by many things.
The unilateralism shown by the American leadership, one example of which is the Iraq war and its aftermath, and the policy PresidentÂ Bushâs administration has pursued which we think has recently only taken the interests of Israel into account, cannot have our approval.
We cannot put this right, however, by terminating the framework agreement that exists between Israel and the EU or by just blaming the United States.
We must try to find a way back to democracy, one in which global multilateralism and using the United Nations, and increasing its prestige, form a basis for solving crises.
Good signs of this are already visible in Americaâs attitude to the forthcoming Iraqi administration under the supervision of the UN.
Bad signs, on the other hand, are still almost exclusively visible in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and that is why the EU needs to be ever more active there.
We also disagree about many trade policy and immaterial rights issues.
For example, Americaâs unilateral approach to applying the concept of dumping is not in harmony with good trade practices, but protectionism.
Under the expert leadership of Commissioner Pascal Lamy, the EU has endeavoured to remove barriers to speeding up the World Trade Organisation Doha round of trade talks.
The United States on the one hand is a good partner in these negotiations, but on the other hand it also constitutes a certain barrier itself with its own system of rotational aid for agriculture and industry.
By this I do not mean that the blame always lies elsewhere and not with us.
We also have to open up our markets in this sense to a greater extent than previously.
Once again, problems will be solved through dialogue, not through an escalating trade war.
I wish furthermore to stress that the values we share, as has been often been said here, on which both continents â I am including Canada here â will build their future, democracy, freedoms and rights of the individual, human rights, a society based on statutory law, the market economy with its system of free enterprise, are such a wide basis for the development of natural, lasting and good relations between us, that conflicting interests can surely be settled.
I am sure that speakers from our group will follow in my tracks and address many of the individual issues that make up transatlantic relations.
Â Â  MrÂ President, many fine words have been said once again about relations between Europe and the United States.
I nevertheless remain somewhat sceptical when I look at the reality.
Relations between Europe and the United States have been better.
The US Government often takes little notice of its transatlantic partners.
US policy is characterised by unilaterality and ever changing coalitions.
Iraq has proved a divisive issue, and a major role for the UN in that country still seems a long way off.
Earlier this morning, we discussed the Middle East.
PresidentÂ Bushâs support for Prime Minister Sharon and the latterâs unilateral policy has â rightly â been poorly received here.
The EU is clearly not a serious partner for the US on this issue.
Nobody is intent on a genuine split between the United States and the European Union.
We have a good deal in common, and together we could obtain more for each other in the world.
Things would perhaps be better under a subsequent US Government, but in my opinion the trends run deeper.
Today, we are discussing an agenda for transatlantic dialogue.
This dialogue is necessary now more than ever, but it must be an open dialogue and not one in which one side only talks and rarely listens.
Indeed, it is particularly important that we do not gloss over the differences between ourselves and the US.
In the field of international security, a number of priorities can be seen, including Iraq and what we can learn from this.
The first lesson, of course, is that something like this should never happen again, and another is that we must return to a full role for the United Nations, which must assume political leadership of the reconstruction of the country as soon as possible.
Furthermore, we must cooperate on the resolution of the Middle-East conflict, keeping to the roadmap.
Unless PresidentÂ Bush adopts a much more critical attitude towards the policy of Prime Minister Sharon â for example the security fence, the Gaza Strip and the assassination of Hamas leaders â it is unlikely that much will come of US cooperation with the EU.
We also want an effective approach to international terrorism, but not just on US terms.
What we want is that priority be given to a multilateral approach to international problems.
We want pre-emptive engagement, as Javier Solana calls it, instead of pre-emptive wars.
We want a strengthening of the United Nations and, in particular, a strengthening of the international legal order.
We must therefore remain committed to the work of the International Criminal Court and the support that the European Union has given this all along.
We also want a serious approach to disarmament initiatives.
We must enter into dialogue with the US on all of these issues, but we must also remain committed to our own strength.
We must be pragmatic, yet pursue our own aims.
Where the US stresses military supremacy, we envisage a role for the European Union as, say, a civil superpower.
Â Â  â Mr President, I hope that I am not disturbing too many of the private conversations that are going on.
I wish to state, however, that transatlantic cooperation must be strengthened and expanded for the benefit of the US, of the EU and of the whole world.
Through cooperation, the greatest military and economic power in the world must show the whole world the way to security, peace, democracy, justice and prosperity.
This cooperation is currently being put to the test in the fight against terrorism.
It is here and now that confirmation must be provided that there is more that unites the US and the EU than separates them.
Consequently, this topic must be high up on the agenda of the EU/US Summit, where a far-sighted common framework and action plan for the fight against terrorism should be established.
The UN must have a prominent role in this struggle, and we must emphasise that the struggle is to be conducted with respect for human rights and international law.
In this connection, I would once again draw attention to the prisoners being held at the GuantÃ¡namo Bay naval base, who have a right to a fair trial.
I would again appeal to the Council, even if it is not listening, to place this issue on the summit agenda.
We must strengthen and expand our cooperation but, as friends of the US, we must also be able to speak out when we disagree with the US Government.
That is what we must do right now on the issue of passenger list information, which the Presidency has discussed and which is also part of the war on terror.
We must also stand firm in our assertion that fundamental rights must be respected in this matter.
The Commission is evidently in the process of transferring a piece of US legislation to the EU â bypassing the European Parliament, the national parliaments and presumably also the US Congress.
As regards the attitude to the situation in the Middle East, we must also speak out against the latest pronouncements by President Bush.
Any change to the boundaries dating back to before 1967 can only be recognised if it is the result of negotiation between the two parties.
It is not something that Mr Sharon and President Bush can decide between them.
Rather, we must call for the existing Road Map, to which the Quartet has given its support, to be abided by.
Once again, yesterday, we heard in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy about the Geneva initiative for peace in the Middle East, a highly commendable initiative that should be brought into the discussion.
The forthcoming summit between the EU and the US will be the first following EU enlargement.
Europe will appear stronger and more united.
The EUâs position on the international political stage has been strengthened, and we must exploit this situation in order to improve our necessary and desirable cooperation with the US.
I hope I have not interrupted too many of your conversations.
Â Â  I apologise to our colleague for the level of noise before the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would ask you in future to intervene should such a situation arise as that which occurred while Mr Andreasen was speaking.
This circus in which Members stand around holding private conversations, quite unconcerned, whilst someone is speaking is disgraceful.
In my view, these Members are behaving outrageously and downright stupidly and unintelligently when they show no respect for others when they are speaking.
Consequently,I would ask you to intervene in future and remove from the Chamber those Members who cannot work this out.
Â Â  Colleagues, on Wednesday 31 March I made a statement to the House about a number of newspaper articles and television reports concerning allegations made about Members of this House, purportedly on the basis of interviews and comments given by one of our Members, Mr Hans-Peter Martin.
I informed the House at that time that when allegations are made, they are thoroughly and promptly investigated by the relevant services and appropriate action is taken.
I went on to invite Mr Martin, if he had information concerning possible wrongdoing, misuse of funds or irregularities, to draw these to my attention so that they could be appropriately investigated.
It was his duty as a Member of the House.
Belatedly, late on Monday night, he sent me a letter that makes detailed criticisms of the allowance system that we have for Members.
He further makes specific allegations â two concerning meetings of a political group outside the working places â and he also lists 7Â 000 cases where Members have claimed allowances in circumstances which he claims to be inappropriate, for example, when Members have signed the central attendance register and not attendance lists for parliamentary meetings.
As regards the specific points, I have asked the political group concerned to give me further information about the two meetings indicated.
On the more general point of the central attendance register, it is clear to me that MrÂ Martin is criticising the system and a specific Rule.
However, there is no indication whatsoever that Members have broken the Rules of this House.
On the wider point, he fails to acknowledge the important progress that has been made by Parliament in reforming our rules and regulations to ensure greater transparency and accountability and to respond promptly to any points that have been brought to our attention by the Court of Auditors in its annual or specific reports and which have highlighted possible shortcomings in our rules.
Specific reforms on travel allowances, on the secretarial allowance and other allowances have been decided by the Bureau and by the Quaestors under the presidencies of Mr HÃ€nsch, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, MrsÂ Fontaine and also during my mandate.
At the outset of my mandate I sought a global reform based on two main elements: firstly, fair treatment of Members of this House on the basis of equality, and secondly, transparency on allowances to be based on costs incurred.
Until the beginning of this year we, in Parliament, were hopeful because we had made the compromises necessary, that the Council could agree to this package.
At the very last moment a minority of Member States blocked this reform.
That has not prevented the Bureau and other bodies of this House from examining further reforms on an incremental basis.
It would have been more helpful and, in my view, more fruitful had Mr Martin associated himself with this drive for reform in committee and in plenary ...
... rather than by conducting a campaign, the main purpose of which appears to have been to seek to discredit the institution, to call into question the honour of Members of this House and to wreak maximum damage â on zero evidence â to individuals, their careers and their families.
In the times in which we live, it is very easy to blacken the reputation of public figures.
It is extremely difficult to counteract slurs and partial information once these have been launched in certain sections of the media.
The Rules of this House are a work in progress.
Historically, we are still a relatively new Parliament and are constantly evolving.
From May onwards, we have to find systems that are fair for elected representatives from 25 Member States.
One area that has not been regulated concerns the behaviour of Members.
It is my personal view, however, that the secret filming of Members and the secret recording of their conversations is unacceptable in every circumstance, most of all when it is done by a fellow Member.
These are methods that are reminiscent of another time and another place.
When we talk about standards of behaviour in this House, the way in which we behave towards each other is an important consideration in those standards.
This House has always stood up for the rights of whistle-blowers, but we also expect whistle-blowers to exhaust the available and proper procedures.
Here, it appears to me that no attempt has been made to use the normal procedures of this House, which have been bypassed in a grotesque attempt to maximise personal publicity.
I shall reply to Mr Martin in detail.
The specific cases that he raises will be looked into with the cooperation of the Members and the Groups concerned.
But let me repeat that on the basis of what he has sent to me, there is zero evidence to support his claims of wrongdoing or breaches of the Rules.
Let me place on the record my deep personal disapproval of the methods employed by our esteemed colleague.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today.
I have been mentioned so often here in plenary in recent weeks, but this is the first time I have had the chance to speak to my fellow Members here in the House.
You are correct, Mr President: at your written request, I submitted a dossier of information to you.
You claim that there is no indication whatsoever that Members have broken the rules of this House.
I have made it clear in all the statements I have made â and this is a very important point â that I have evidence of more than 7Â 200 cases where colleagues have falsely claimed a daily allowance.
To what extent this is regarded as a violation of the rules is a matter for you and others to judge.
Nonetheless, Mr President, in my letter to you, I presented a number of cases in great detail â one being the meeting of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in Berlin on 10 May 2001, which you have mentioned â and asked you to indicate or clarify which rule governs conduct of this nature.
I remember you from our personal discussions before you took up your present office and at that time too, you had my support and vote as someone who was very reform-minded.
You supported me on numerous issues â as we discussed at the time â and acknowledged that I was right in many instances, as with the campaign on parliamentary reform with which you were associated and which you often took up as an issue.
I resolutely refute your statement that there is zero evidence for the allegations that I have made to you, and I also refute the suggestion that I am launching a campaign.
I hope that the public will hear this reaction.
I would ask you to take this reaction into consideration by granting me a few extra seconds in addition to the speaking time that I am allowed.
I refute the suggestion that I am launching a campaign.
This is a European initiative for transparency, and to claim that I have no proof while criticising my methods is a contradiction.
Lawyers, colleagues, citizens and voters have said to me that I will have to provide detailed proof.
That is why the footage was taken, and what I have done is no different from the actions of the President of the EU Summit in Denmark in 2002, who adopted the same approach in order to reveal the internal workings of the EU Summit.
That was broadcast and discussed.
I believe that reformers and critics should not be silenced.
We will continue our work.
Â Â  I know that many colleagues would like to speak on this matter but we do not have time to have a debate.
Mr Martin, you continue to allege the unscrupulous claiming of expenses.
Your evidence of this unscrupulous behaviour named me.
I reject the imputation and the slur on my personal character.
Those who seek to promote transparency should cease to skulk in the corridors and secretly record and film their colleagues.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say firstly that you have the support and the thanks of the Socialist Group for the statement you have just made.
Having said that, I would like to refer to the point of order I raised this morning at 9 a.m., at the beginning of the session, jointly with other group presidents, with regard to the re-inclusion of the Boogerd-Quaak report on freedom of expression and information in today's vote.
I raised the issue this morning and I leave it to the Presidency to choose when it can be dealt with in depth.
Â Â  Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, we shall deal with that later.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to protest again this year that the amendment tabled by my delegation on the 2005 calendar, which seeks to end this charade of coming to Strasbourg every month at gross expense to the European Union taxpayer, has been declared inadmissible.
Mr President, I think you should refer the matter to the European Court of Justice.
Â Â  Mr President, Strasbourg is a beautiful and historic city but, for those of us living some distance away, it is extremely difficult to access.
Colleagues should be aware that if they vote in favour of Amendment 2, they are voting in favour of adding Friday sittings to the Strasbourg calendar next year.
I should like to remind colleagues that on Monday afternoon I informed the House of the contents of a letter sent to me by the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Gargani, in relation to the agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on the handling of personal data by air carriers.
On Monday, Commissioner Bolkestein made some introductory remarks to the House on the matter.
Yesterday, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report was discussed in plenary and Commissioner Patten spoke in that debate.
We shall not vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report on air passenger data now; that vote will be taken as planned in the voting order.
I am now asking for the advice of the House on the question of whether to make a referral to the Court of Justice.
Many in the House will have heard Commissioner Bolkestein on Monday, but will not have heard a view from the Commission in the light of the full debate.
I do not want to open a debate, but perhaps Commissioner Patten would like to say a few words on the specifics.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have never knowingly turned down the opportunity of addressing this many people â a number slightly higher than the crowd I normally draw!
As you have said, Mr President, I spoke at what the leader of one Group regarded as inordinate length on this issue in the middle of the night, when the few of us here would have preferred to be where I am sure everybody else was: in their own bed.
Perhaps I could have phrased that better.
Perhaps very briefly I can make three points in response, bearing in mind that I was criticised the other day on the grounds that my virtue was that I said what I thought, but that my vice was what I thought.
However, I will very briefly say what I think.
First of all, as the Minister said earlier in the debate on the United States, if we had been through what New York went through in September 2001, we would have wanted our government to do everything possible to secure our freedom, to secure us against atrocity.
Secondly, I do not pretend that the agreement we have negotiated in good faith is perfect â alas, we are not in the business of perfection â but I think it is an extremely sensible proposal and it has, I believe, resulted in a number of proposals being made which Parliament pressed for and we have been able to secure.
I will not go through them all.
Thirdly, let us be clear what will happen if we have to delay this for months or do not have it at all: complete disarray for the next few months, airlines facing financial chaos, people waiting in queues without any of the protection that we have managed to secure.
I do not think that those people or those airlines will be singing Te Deums to thank the supporters of a motion to put off any decision for months.
I had not meant to intervene, on this occasion, but I hope that people will think very seriously about the consequences of this and the consequences for our credibility when it comes to negotiating in the security area with the United States.
Â Â  Mr President, I enjoy listening to Commissioner Patten speak, but this particular speech was too much.
Commissioner, the issue may be clear to you, but it is also clear to us.
We want consultation of the Court of Justice because we are prepared to fight terrorism, but we are not prepared to fight against people's rights to confidentiality.
This is part of our European identity.
We will not cede our European identity to the American way.
It is a vote for Europe, which approaches liberty and justice in a different way: the right way.
Â Â  Mr President, this House has discussed on a number of occasions the matter of the Commission's proposed agreements with the United States.
The House has expressed its own willingness to reach agreement with the United States on exchange of data on air passengers in a proper international agreement, to be approved by Congress and by this House, to ensure that we get the right balance between data protection and an effective fight against terrorism.
The Commission is deeply divided on this matter, and is unable even to claim adequacy because it does not know about the circumstances in which the Americans can refer data to third countries.
We are seeking the advice of the Court of Justice on whether this is compatible with our own laws and our own Treaties.
I advise this House to think very carefully and to refer it to the Court.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not believe what has just happened to be reasonable; I do not believe it to be reasonable that speakers should have the opportunity to express, in front of all the Members of this House, an opinion contrary to that of Commissioner Patten on the referral to the Court of Justice, when we have spent months discussing it here.
We did not have the opportunity that Commissioner Patten had yesterday, of speaking in front of a larger audience; we had our opportunity in the in-depth work carried out in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
There is a favourable opinion from the previous plenum about referral to the Court of Justice; there is a favourable opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs; we should have referred the matter to the Court by now.
Let us stop this, please.
It is not acceptable.
And let us move on at last to the vote, because this will ensure that there is no further opportunity to change what until today has been the majority position in this House.
We accept it, but do it now, please.
Â Â  Mr President, the agreement improves the legal position of European passengers, and I would like to make it quite clear â and Commissioner Patten has announced what will happen â that we will place the responsibility firmly on the shoulders of those responsible for this chaos.
We will make it clear to Europe's citizens exactly who has curtailed their rights in this area.
Thank you.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should just like to say that the current situation is illegal and that a proposal for reform is not credible when it comes from those who have so far been unable to enforce the existing form.
The United States has the right to ask for any data it likes before flights; this has to be done, however, through procedures that conform to our rules.
The United States, if it wished, could even reintroduce compulsory visas: it can do that.
What it cannot do is take data collected for commercial purposes and use them for security purposes.
It is not a matter of the United States being bad.
No Member State, no European government could do that.
I do not think, therefore, that we can tolerate a situation where a state that is not a European Union member can do something that a Member State cannot.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is not a question of whether or not an agreement should be concluded; Parliament has said all along that an agreement should be concluded.
Rather, what we want is an agreement to be concluded that has the approval of Parliament, as MrÂ Bolkestein promised us in September of last year.
We are asking the Court of Justice to take care of this and to ensure that we are able to exercise our rights, so that we can block parts of the agreement â the transferring of data to third countries by the United States, to name but one â if we believe that they are not currently possible.
I hope, therefore, that Parliament will continue to follow the course outlined.
Â Â  On this occasion I intend to exercise my own right to vote and will vote for the primacy of politics.
I shall do my duty and refer the matter to the Court later today.
Â Â  Mr President, referral to the Court is not something that we would have chosen.
The Commission promised to consult us under Article 300 with the power of assent.
The Commission has not fulfilled that promise and, therefore, we have had to use a very blunt instrument to try to maintain democracy within this Union.
Â Â  On behalf of the House I should like to welcome to the official gallery a Rwandan delegation, led by the President of the Rwandan Parliament, who attended a ceremony here yesterday to mark the atrocities of one decade ago.
You are very welcome here in the European Parliament.
Â Â  I now turn to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report on the freedom of expression, which I was invited to address earlier today.
I shall point out a number of elements that have been drawn to my attention.
We have 338 amendments.
I referred a request to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to consider the amendments under Rule 130a.
I have received a report back from the committee.
All the amendments tabled have received favourable votes from at least one-tenth of the members of the committee and so, under the Rules of Procedure, the amendments are entitled to stand.
I had received a letter from Mr PodestÃ  requesting that the report be declared inadmissible.
I replied to MrÂ PodestÃ  and I sent a copy of our correspondence to the Civil Liberties Committee.
I felt that, under the Rules, certain parts of the text could be reviewed, possibly involving the publication of a corrigendum; but that the report, as such, was admissible.
Before the debate yesterday, I received a request from Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, to apply Rule 143 on the inadmissibility of the matter.
The Vice-President in the Chair at the time ruled out this request because no notification had been given 24 hours in advance and because I, as President, had already decided that the report was admissible.
I have since received a letter from Mr Poettering requesting a review of the decision not to refer the report back to committee.
In his letter, Mr Poettering asks me once again to review the possibility of referral back, using the prerogatives and powers of the Presidency.
In sticking to my decision, I am encouraged by the comments I have received from the chairman of the Civil Liberties Committee, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, who pointed out that the political groups shared my evaluation on the issue of admissibility in terms of the report overall.
I thus intend to hold to the view that the report is indeed admissible in its totality, although some corrections may be required.
I am prepared to take a vote on the referral back before the start of the vote on the report.
This is in accordance with the Rules, it is not a question of personal preference.
The House can do this at any time and we need to respect that fact.
So, why are we not voting right now?
Here we begin a rather sorry story.
Yesterday the services received 51 pages of requests for roll-call, split and separate votes for the Boogerd-Quaak report on the freedom of expression and information.
This would amount to a total of 1Â 200 single votes, in addition to the 338 amendments, resulting in a vote that could last for four hours or more.
Secondly, under these conditions, it was physically impossible for the services to prepare the vote overnight in time for voting today.
At the end of the debate last night, the Vice-President in the Chair therefore announced that the report would be voted on Thursday.
I have been looking into the matter â not just because it was raised today, but also because of its complexity â on the basis of the powers conferred on me, as President, by our Rules, especially the interpretation of Rule 19(1), which confers on the President 'the power to put texts to the vote in an order other than that set out in the document to be voted on', and also Rule 130 concerning the order of voting on amendments.
I also fully recognise the rights of groups to table requests under our Rules. On this basis I wish to propose to you the following package.
First, the vote would take place tomorrow at noon.
Second, I shall allow a normal vote on all amendments, but no split votes and no roll-call votes on them. I shall also allow all requests for split votes concerning the original paragraphs of the motion for a resolution, but I shall allow only one roll-call vote per paragraph, according to indications supplied by Groups.
This, I regret to inform you, would still give a total of 600 votes and a voting time that could last for two hours.
It would, however, mean that this suggestion would rule out 1000 split votes on the amendments.
In making this proposal to you I am trying to strike a balance between the rights of different Groups in the House and the preferences of one or another to try to conduct our business in a reasonably orderly fashion.
I am prepared to put my proposal to you in accordance with Rule 19.
If the House rejects the proposal I shall decide on the basis of Rule 130(3) to put to the vote first the original text of the report, paragraph by paragraph, and to vote on that alone.
That is my proposal.
I am prepared to hear one speaker from each Group, to vote and then make a ruling.
Â Â  Mr President, I must say firstly that it was I who proposed the content of that report, which was supported by a majority in the Conference of Presidents, and it deals with freedom of expression and information in the European Union â particularly in Italy, but in the European Union as a whole â and Mrs Boogerd-Quaakâs excellent report refers to the majority of countries in the European Union, including my own, and I therefore believe that it is a good piece of work which does credit to Parliament.
Having said that, I would like firstly to make a political criticism, because I believe it is very positive that during this last plenary session of this legislature we should hold an in-depth political debate, and this relates to the case of filibustering which has arisen in relation to this report.
You have mentioned a series of incidents which have taken place during the negotiation of the report.
I can add some more information: for example, documents have disappeared in the committee, something which is entirely inexplicable.
We are facing an obstacle course.
And since you yourself have mentioned a letter which was written to you by Vice-President PodestÃ , I am aware of an article Mr PodestÃ  has written today in the well-known Italian newspaper , in which he makes a series of serious accusations with regard to the European Parliamentâs behaviour.
He says â and I quote in Italian: , [the Rules of Procedure have been flouted, by allowing the debate in Parliament to run on indefinitely] and further on it says that [in the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is dominated by the centre-left âŠ] Well, I did not know that we were so dominant in Parliament and I do not know if Mr Poettering will agree with this.
He then refers to the letter which he wrote to you and says that President Cox, in his reply, [had to admit that I was to a large extent right].
I would also like to make it clear that I believe that we in the so-called centre-left coalition have strictly observed the Rules of Procedure; we have had the patience of Job in the face of systematic manoeuvring involving blocking and filibustering.
However, if we look at the issue in political terms, I accept that there are two groups in the House â and I am coming to an end, Mr President â who indulge in filibustering, because it is they who have tabled all the amendments but four, and I understand why they would defend Mr Berlusconi, who is currently the leader of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I accept that as well, but they should say so clearly, because ...
... because I would remind you of an old Roman Law principle which said â and this was what made Rome great â that one cannot legislate for the benefit of just one person.
We must legislate for all the citizens, and that is what is at stake here.
And I will therefore end, Mr President ...
... I will end with a proposal, Mr President: the so-called centre-left coalition has four amendments.
You have 350.
We accept that they be voted on en bloc and, if not, we accept that the Presidentâs proposal should be voted on paragraph by paragraph.
Â Â  Mr President, I have every sympathy for MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, but I am not clear about his conclusion.
You asked a question and Mr BarÃ³n Crespo provided an explanation, but he failed to arrive at any conclusion.
That is why I have risen in order to say that I will gladly endorse your proposal to hold the vote tomorrow.
We are in a difficult situation with 338 amendments which are multiplying as a result of procedural issues.
I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, to underline this point, and I make it calmly and objectively.
We have already discussed this issue this morning when the sitting opened at 9 a.m.
The Chairman of one of the groups claimed that the amendments come from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I would like to point out that there are 338 amendments, and that not all of these amendments come from our group.
We have tabled 157, which means that 181 amendments come from other people.
I would ask for this fact to be noted.
I shall refrain from commenting on the quality of the report at this point as I do not wish to exacerbate the situation, but I would ask everyone to work together to achieve some kind of resolution to this difficult issue.
Mr President, we know you to be a fair and objective President of this House, and if you propose that we vote on the report tomorrow at 12 noon in accordance with the procedure that you suggest, you have our support.
Â Â  Mr President, I will not go into the substance of this matter since we all know what it is about.
My Group has no objection to taking part in 600 votes tomorrow, but we have a clear preference for your suggestion that we simply vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph.
A long voting session is already foreseen, colleagues on both sides have had their say, and, therefore, I propose to you that we follow your suggestion of voting on the original report paragraph by paragraph.
Â Â  â MrÂ Poettering, it is true that this will be a complicated vote, but I appeal to you as President of the largest group in this House and to the President of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, because, of course, groups of this size do not normally use obstructionist tactics and, besides, you have said that you do not want to.
The first thing I want to do, then, is to appeal to these groups to glance through their amendments and see if any of them can be withdrawn.
When more than a hundred amendments are tabled, I am sure that some of them will be more important and others less important.
Please do that and make our job easier when we come to vote: we shall all be grateful.
I think this would demonstrate the political sensitivity expected of groups of your standing.
MrÂ President, we agree with your second proposal, to vote on the original text first.
Â Â  There is only one proposal, but depending on how the House votes it may manifest itself in one of two ways.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should just like to say that my group agrees to your proposal to vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph.
The report is good enough, almost perfect to begin with; these amendments have been tabled for the plenary.
I should just like to explain to the House, to anyone who may not have been paying attention, that it is true that 200 amendments come from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and another 200 from other groups, but altogether 350 amendments come from and .
It is obvious, therefore, that they all come from MrÂ Berlusconiâs friends.
We therefore agree to your proposal, Mr President, and will vote accordingly.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I believe your proposal can certainly be taken into consideration and, if you could grant a suspension of our work in order to assess it, we would be able to give you a more objective opinion.
For instance, I feel we could accept Mrs Frassoniâs invitation to re-examine some amendments to see whether it is possible to group them together or cut any out.
I am certainly in favour of having the vote tomorrow, if that is more convenient for everybody, but, MrÂ President, I am absolutely against any possibility of having all the amendments and all the calls for secret ballots rescinded, because it is unthinkable that all the secret ballots could simply be wiped out like that.
I recall that many Members from other groups have tabled 30 or 40 proposals for secret ballots on documents that interest them without causing any outcry at all in Parliament.
In connection with what certain Members have said, I remind Mr BarÃ³n Crespo â who criticised an article by Mr PodestÃ  â that this mysterious, as he puts it, centre-left coalition has already published a pamphlet taking the approval of this report in this House as a certainty and making a whole series of remarks, even though the report has not yet even been put to the vote.
Publishing wicked comments or lies is certainly not a mark of goodwill in a political group.
As for the other Member who spoke of âMr Berlusconiâs friendsâ, I can assure him on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that our amendments are on behalf of the whole group; the whole group is united; none of us has private friendships or enmities; but we claim the right as Members of this Parliament to carry out our mandate to the full, doing what the Rules of Procedure allow and not just standing by listening to the constant provocations made even in committee.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to commend you on your wisdom.
Having heard all the discussion, I agree that it is an excellent idea to vote on my original report.
It contains sufficient substance for it to be steered through Parliament soundly, and this will perhaps take some of the pain away.
Putting the original report to the vote sounds like an excellent idea to me, therefore.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to speak on behalf of the committee I chair.
Mr BarÃ³n has made a statement, an accusation which I believe to be particularly serious.
He has said that documents have disappeared in my committee.
I would like to say to the Presidency that, if that accusation is false, it is extremely serious since it would seriously harm the prestige and honour of the committee I chair.
Secondly, Mr President, I would like an explanation of how Mr BarÃ³n has received that information, because I was not aware until today that this has happened, and that would also seriously harm the prestige of the services of my committee.
I believe that this, Mr President, requires immediate clarification and, in any event, I would ask for the support of the Presidency.
Â Â  We have heard from the Groups' spokesmen.
I would now like to take your advice.
The package that was offered to you tries to respect the Rules and the different stresses and strains that have been brought to our attention.
For the sake of clarity, I repeat that the vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
I shall allow a normal vote on all the amendments, but no split votes and no roll-call votes on them.
I shall also allow all the requests for split votes concerning the original paragraphs of the motion for resolution, but I shall allow only one roll-call vote per paragraph according to indications supplied by the Groups.
This would yield a total of 600 votes for the report, a long voting time, and would mean ruling out about 1000 split votes on the amendments.
I feel that this tries to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of the Groups and the requirements of the House to conduct its business in an orderly way.
I put this proposal to you in accordance with Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure.
If the House rejects this proposal, I shall decide on the basis of Rule 130(3) to put to the vote first the original text of the report, paragraph by paragraph.
The vote will therefore take place tomorrow, and, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 130(3), we shall vote on the original text, paragraph by paragraph, and on that alone.
Â Â  â Mr President, let me just ask you to examine the possibility of starting tomorrowâs votes earlier, as I believe it to be unfair that all the other votes cannot otherwise go ahead.
Either we should make an earlier start on the sitting, and hence on the votes, or we should defer some of the morningâs agenda to the afternoon.
Whatever happens, the votes should start earlier, by which I mean at 11 a.m.
Â Â  As a consequence of the decision you have taken, the vote should not take so long tomorrow.
Â Â  . â I am surprised.
I have asked for explanations of a series of accusations which have been made in this House and I have received no reply.
I would ask that somebody answer my question.
Â Â  Bearing in mind that I am not the only person to have made accusations, but that Vice-President PodestÃ  has made a series of written accusations in the Italian press ...
... I am happy to accept Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollarâs challenge, but I would formally request that a package be produced containing what I have said and what Vice-President PodestÃ  has said in writing ...
Mr President, I would ask the wild boar roaming wild out there to calm down.
I am prepared to provide explanations to the Bureau of Parliament about all these issues, about Vice-President PodestÃ âs accusations and about mine.
Â Â  Would everyone please relax.
I know that near election time we suffer from election fever and our temperatures go up.
Please calm down.
You will all get a fair hearing.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, you stated that there was some problem with the disappearance of documentation.
I do not know the detail.
The chairman of the relevant committee has pointed out that he regards this as offensive to the committee and its secretariat.
