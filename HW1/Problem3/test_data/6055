Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I had intended to start my brief, one and a half minute speech differently, but I must comment on the statement by my honourable friend Mrs Bonino, who spoke earlier and blamed the Greek Cypriots because they rejected the Annan plan.
I think that it is accepted that decisions taken following referenda are respectable, as stated in the motion for a resolution, irrespective of whether she personally expresses her regret.
However, I would expect Mrs Bonino to also explain the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan and, also, to clarify that 35% of the Turkish Cypriots said 'no' and, also, that the settlers who are committing a war crime under international law also had the right to vote in the occupied territories in Cyprus. That by way of a brief comment.
Turkey must honour its obligations under international law and the principles on which the European Union is based.
Account must also be taken of the fact that the European Union consists of 25 Member States which include the Republic of Cyprus and that it would be a paradox if Turkey were to accede to the European Union and, at the same time, to have an occupying army on the territory of a Member State and to refuse to recognise it.
Within this framework, Turkey has to apply fully and without discrimination the provisions of the protocol, including the chapter on transport.
As such, it goes without saying that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus.
With a reunified Cyprus, Greece and Turkey as members of the European Union, peace and security in the area will, I believe, be strengthened.
Â Â  Mr President, sooner or later, ambiguous politics face punishment from the electorate, and the dubious course steered by the Council and the Commission in their dealings with Turkey is no exception.
We have already had the first punishment: a Constitutional Treaty that has been torpedoed by two referendums.
A second, late electoral punishment is in the offing in the form of new referendums if it turns out that the so-called âopen-ended negotiationsâ with Turkey are to culminate in membership.
Why do the Member States not simply opt for a solid neighbourhood programme with Ankara?
In the final analysis, even a fully-fledged Customs Union between the EU of 25 and Turkey is already throwing up a nigh insurmountable political obstacle in the shape of the deep divisions about the divided Cyprus.
Meanwhile, the prospect of negotiations with Turkey particularly saddens me on account of the position of the Christian church in that country, which is â and I emphasise this â without rights, and I am not even mentioning the serious cases of physical abuse of Turkish Protestants last month.
I am looking forward to initiatives on the part of the Council and the Commission as regards compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria, and Commissioner Rehn might remember that I called him to account on the same subject one year ago.
This morning, I heard a great deal about the so-called secular state in Turkey.
Members who mention this issue do not know the facts, and it is with those that we should start.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in December we asked Turkey to give us a clear sign to show that it accepted the European Unionâs rules on democracy by first of all recognising Cyprus.
The Turkish Governmentâs refusal is, on the contrary, a sign of surprising intransigence.
We are aware that it was a unilateral statement without legal effect, but for that very reason it was serious and unjustified.
No less surprising is Europeâs attitude: with its eternal compromises it has once again shown its ambiguous role of putting off and exacerbating problems instead of solving them.
We wish to emphasise that the outcome of Turkeyâs accession procedure must not be a foregone conclusion.
Turkey has to make tangible commitments, and we cannot make allowances on that account.
I do not mean to say that there have been no improvements, but there is still too much to do on torture, respect for human and civil rights, and the protection of minorities.
Above all, Turkey must not refuse to recognise an existing European Union Member State like Cyprus, let alone continue to occupy Cypriot soil with some 40Â 000 Turkish troops.
What is needed is a serious, transparent accession procedure in line with the values of integration and mutual respect.
We are also aware of the extent to which the Italian Government has committed itself to the success of the negotiations but, for the reasons that I have given, the delegation will mark its criticism by abstaining.
That does not mean closing the door on Turkey; we just want the rules to be obeyed, because they must always be the same for everyone.
Â Â  MrÂ President, once negotiations with Turkey are opened, sooner or later they will regrettably result in accession, even if Turkey fails to meet the conditions set.
After all, why should it strive to meet any conditions, when the fact that it is not doing so today is not deemed an impediment to opening negotiations?
Turkey will not respect our culture, and will try to impose its own on us.
A country that was not previously Christian can never become European.
All current and prospective Members of the Union became Christian over a thousand years ago, and no humanist philosophy can replace this common denominator binding all us together.
Let us welcome Turkey as a partner but not as a Member.
Two days ago PresidentÂ Borrell reminded the House, admittedly in a different context, that of the Constitution, that âEurope is for the Europeansâ; otherwise, the Europeans will leave the Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I was one of those who, last December, did not oppose the opening of negotiations with Turkey, in the hope that it would promote the issues of democratisation and human rights in that country and foster peace between Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and Armenia in the region.
Unfortunately, last year saw retrogression and no progress.
One thing essential thing, apart from legislation on sex discrimination, was requested from Turkey.
That was that it extend implementation of the Ankara Protocol to include Cyprus.
However, only a week ago Foreign Minister GÃŒl said that ports and airports have nothing to do with the Customs Union.
The Council and the Commission want to brush this under the carpet, just as they have brushed under the carpet the treatment of religious minorities, Article 305 of the Penal Code, the question of the Armenian genocide, the repression of demonstrations by women and so many other issues, including that of Orhan Pamuk and freedom of expression within Turkey.
Turkey's treatment as a candidate country has to be fair, but strict.
Who among the previous ten candidate countries would have dared, when embarking on their negotiations, not to recognise a Member State?
And yet that is the case with Cyprus.
We may lament the result of the referendum in Cyprus but must respect the outcome of that referendum, the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands.
The complacency shown by the Council and the Commission weakens the message coming from those referenda.
I am afraid that the problem here is not Turkey. It is the Council and the Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr ErdoÄan, has done a great deal for his country, not least in changing it in ways that bring it closer to the European Union.
He did it a disservice, though, in delivering this unacceptable unilateral declaration at the same time as he signed the Ankara Agreement.
It goes without saying, though, that this agreement has legal consequences that Turkey must not merely accept but also put into effect.
I do nevertheless believe that we, in the European Union, need to show Turkey what it means to think and act in a European way, and to go forward in confidence and with consistency.
That is also why I believe that the European Union must open negotiations on 3 October.
Why is this so?
Firstly, although the reform process that is going on in Turkey is facing obstacles and problems, to which MrÂ Kasoulides is right to draw attention, it would be irresponsible of us to curtail it, and it would be damaging to Europe.
Rather than do that, we must help it along.
Secondly, we must give all groups in Turkey, and such minority groups as the Kurds in particular, the chance and the opportunity to use this reform process as a means of finding new ways of expressing their culture and participating in political life.
Thirdly, we have to ensure that Turkey, having been recognised as a candidate for accession to the European Union, should also, and in a similar way, improve its relations with all its neighbours, particularly, of course, with Armenia, and this will involve, among other things, acknowledging its own history and the atrocities to which that testifies.
Fourthly, it is absolutely vital that we also give support to the Turkish-speaking population of Cyprus.
We have a lot to say â and rightly too â about the islandâs Greek-speaking majority, but let us not forget that it was the Turkish minority that said a resounding âyesâ to reunification and a resounding âyesâ to Europe.
Let us not forget either that Europe has so far failed to discharge its obligation and responsibility to this minority in such matters as trade and financial support.
For all these reasons, we should adopt a consistent attitude and say an unambiguous âyesâ to getting negotiations underway.
It will be a difficult process, with many, many problems to resolve, but we must make sure that Turkey presses on with the reform process.
If Turkey succeeds in doing that, then it can and should become a Member State of the European Union.
It is only if it fails in this that we will need to seek out other forms of relationship with it.
Let me say, for Mr Poetteringâs information, for the sake of absolute clarity and the avoidance of doubt, that we, in this group, hope that 3 October will see the opening of negotiations not only with Turkey but also with Croatia.
That would be a great signal to move forward.
We have no desire to play Turkey and Croatia off against each other.
Both countries are worthy of negotiations being opened with them.
If we can start them now, the negotiations with Croatia will certainly be completed before those with Turkey, but let us go forward into the future of our continent with both these countries together.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with the date scheduled for the opening of the negotiations only a few days and hours away, Turkey has still not recognised the Republic of Cyprus, and the Turkish justice system has banned, once again, a conference from being held on the Armenian genocide, a genocide that Turkey has still not recognised.
In spite of these serious violations of the duty to remember and of the principles of democracy, Europeâs institutions are acting as though there were nothing wrong and are confirming that the die is cast: on 3 October 2005, the European Union will begin accession negotiations with Ankara.
I would like, in a word, to respond to all those who explain to us that starting these negotiations in no way makes their results a foregone conclusion.
That is untrue, and for at least two reasons.
The first is that these negotiations are opening explicitly with the subject of accession in mind, and not with a privileged partnership in mind.
To say otherwise would be to lie.
The second reason is that, obviously, the opening of the negotiations will lead to the subject of accession.
Over several years, we will open, examine and then close again, one after another, the various chapters relating to accession.
Yet we already know how the situation will end: no country, at the close of a long process, will take the responsibility solely upon itself of saying ânoâ.
To say otherwise would again be to lie.
Today, Europe is undergoing the most serious crisis in its history, and there is no project or prospect on the table, either from the Council or from the Commission, apart from the prospect, if the recent declarations are anything to go by, of turning our back on political Europe.
The only item on the agenda is the enlargement to include Turkey, just as though, in this bewildered Europe, perpetual forging ahead were from now on taking the place of vision.
In the future, Europe will require a real overhaul.
We will support all those who wish radically to reform the European project in order finally to give substance to a political and democratic Europe.
Â Â  (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said in this House about last weekendâs conference of historians in Istanbul, in which I was a participant.
Contrary to what Mrs De Sarnez has just said, it did actually take place, and it did so because the Turkish prime minister and foreign minister stated plainly that it had to go ahead and expressed their solidarity with the academics and critical minds in Turkey.
It would do credit to the European Parliament if all groups in it were to take this opportunity to thank the prime minister of Turkey for this demonstration of his courage in allowing this critical meeting to be held.
That testified to his awareness of what it means to be European.
I have returned, though, from Turkey, with a twofold mission.
The first thing I have been asked to do is to thank all those in this House who, over a period of many years, have campaigned for human rights and democracy in Turkey, and that at a time when Turkey, like the rest of the world, was waging the Cold War, and when some of those talking about human rights today saw everything in Turkey except the problems with human rights.
Secondly, I bring with me a plea for us to press on with the process of bringing the country closer to the European Union, for that is the only way in which democracy and reforms will be put on any kind of sustainable footing in Turkey.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations with Turkey start on 3Â October, but Turkey must not be allowed to make a fool of the European Union: human rights must be at the heart of any talks.
In contrast, constitutional reform has remained a mere aspiration and there is still the 10% barrier in electoral law that prevents the Kurds from having their own representatives in parliament.
A new law restricts lawyersâ ability to carry out their professional duties; journalists can be arrested and their articles considered an attack on territorial integrity; teachersâ unions have been condemned for defending everybodyâs right to speak their own language as well in school; and Mehmet Tarhan, a young Turkish gay, has been sentenced to several years in prison for claiming to be a conscientious objector.
The situation is even worse in the Kurdistan region.
Only a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Erdogan raised hopes that a peace process might begin, but nothing of the sort has happened.
Although the Congra-Gel have declared the suspension of all military action, there are still reports of violent military action against the Kurdish population, together with torture and rape.
The European Union must call on Turkey to politically acknowledge the existence of the Kurdish issue and to start public negotiations.
The road to the European Union passes through Diyarbakir, the capital of Turkish Kurdistan.
Human rights and respect for democratic rules are non-negotiable, yet the Turkish Government does not seem to have any intention of agreeing to the call from the European Court of Human Rights to grant Abdullah Ocalan a retrial.
The European Union must not ignore that situation, unless it wants to undermine the credibility of that institution.
The idea that Turkey can join the European Union without recognising Cyprus is utterly unacceptable: the ball is now in Turkeyâs court.
We can negotiate on economic and customs agreements for years, but never on human rights.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are talking about Turkey joining Europe.
An example yesterday: it prevented the Pope from going to celebrate mass in Istanbul.
Tell me, which other country in the world prohibits the Pontiff from visiting it?
Even communist Castro received the Pope with the honours befitting a head of state.
Turkey bans him.
That is racism.
This ban is racism.
It is not just against the Ecumenical Patriarch; it is not that they have converted the biggest church in Christendom, Saint Sophia, for oriental dances and swimsuit fashion shows.
It is an insult.
What is happening is an insult to Europe.
It does not recognise Cyprus and some people are talking about the Annan plan.
If the Annan plan was so attractive to Turkey, let it apply it to the 20 million Kurds.
If the occupying army leaves, the 1960 constitution will be restored, with a Greek Cypriot President and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president and there is an end to it.
Automatically, northern Cyprus will enjoy the benefits that southern Cyprus enjoys.
It is a straightforward matter; it just needs logic, not the intervention of the Americans which, unfortunately, also directs the steps of Europe here in this Chamber.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always looked with great interest on Turkeyâs bold decision to align itself with the West, at least at the level of military and strategic choices.
In particular, those like me who live on the most southerly patch of European soil, in the heart of the Euro-Afro-Asian basin, are aware more than anyone else of the need to establish borders and boundaries in a spirit of peaceful coexistence.
The democratisation process that the Turkish Government has launched with a view to possibly joining the European Union still seems slow, uncertain and contradictory.
Some obstacles have undoubtedly been overcome, but others have yet to be removed.
It is not a case of the West subjecting Turkey to a long, never-ending examination, but it is essential to base enlargement on foundations of democracy and respect for civil and international rights.
The European Union therefore has a duty to support Turkey on its westward journey of preparation, but it also has a duty to be inflexible and intransigent in this field.
It would be totally unjustifiable to make any other decision for the sake of opportunism, so for now that justifies our considered abstention today.
Â Â  Mr President, those who are listening to this debate are already asking themselves how it is possible for people to act in such an irresponsible way.
What was it, they ask themselves, that the decision-makers in the place promised over and over again?
No enlargement beyond the Ten without Nice and no further enlargement without a constitution for the EU, and what are we doing now?
We are making the way straight for Turkey!
If that is what actually happens, then I am convinced that history will bury the EU.
We will have no chance to carry on with what was originally thought of as the European Union in any meaningful form.
If we go on with this process, then that is something I regard as a great failure, and, indeed, particularly in view of its responsibility towards young people â as an act of betrayal by the political elite.
So let us have some symbolism today as well, with another coffin in the plenary.
You are ruining the European project!
I have time for a last appeal, made in my new capacity as a member of the delegation to the EU/Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and so I say: pull the ripcord and stop the negotiations!
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past weeks and months, I have lost count of the debates I have heard in Turkey on the need to keep to agreements â , but that seems to apply only to the European side, and, in this House, not even to all, but only to those who take a critical view of Turkey and its accession.
The principle appears to apply only to us, with no demands being made of Turkey, which is evidently â to judge by the events of the past few months â not even prepared to abide by our rules. ; but not even the Council or the Commission put that into practice, for they constantly break the rules, and infringe the treaties that we have in common.
They really ought to be taken to court for it.
The Copenhagen political criteria are non-negotiable, and the other candidate countries had to fulfil them before negotiations could begin.
Suddenly, none of that applies to Turkey any more, even though â despite all the reforms â everything there is wrong.
What has happened?
Commissioner Rehn said earlier that the Commission finds Turkeyâs misdemeanours regrettable, yet it is still arguing forcefully in favour of negotiations and full membership.
The Commission tells us that Turkey now attaches great importance to economic and social development in its south-eastern regions; well, it does not.
What is going on there at the moment is a great show staged by Mr ErdoÄan.
The truth is that the Kurds are shut out not only from the EU process, but also from their own national parliament.
Let us not forget that it was a member of the Turkish Government who originally blocked the conference on the Armenians.
Orhan Pamuk is being put on trial.
The day before yesterday, Turkeyâs gay and lesbian organisation was outlawed.
Peaceful demonstrators were beaten to the ground and then hauled before the courts.
Torture is still widely practised.
The position of women is shameful; that alone is a reason to say no to negotiations being started, for there is no prospect of any change in that area.
Freedom of religion does not exist in practice, but Turkey quotes it as justification for the countryâs Islamicisation.
By abandoning â whether out of naivety or in the service of massive national interests â any and every means of exerting pressure, the European Union is allowing all these things.
In Turkey, though, things change only if ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has always supported opening negotiations with Turkey, with the clear prospect of its accession to the European Union.
At this point, however, I should like to say to MrÂ Erdogan: frankly, you did not help us with your unilateral declarations when the Ankara protocol was signed.
As you know, there are three groups in this Parliament, as has been seen clearly today.
There are those who let it be clearly known that they do not want anything to do with Turkey and who have even been gleefully making funeral preparations.
There is a second group: those who resign themselves to a marriage of convenience by telling themselves that, after all, Turkey is a great country, it is a crossroads for energy resources, it has water, it is a friend of the United States and it behaved correctly during the Iraq war by not interfering in events and that, when all is said and done, there still remain 71 opportunities for each country to use its veto during the negotiations.
Finally, there is a third group, and this third group, to which I myself belong, believes in this project but believes in it as a real political project, opening the way to a tolerant, pluralist Europe that is accepting of diversity.
This is not a funeral. Instead, this huge project, which is a tremendous gamble about which the voters will require some convincing, involves two aspects.
The first is that we will not compromise, not on Cyprus, not on the Armenian issue, not on the rights of the Kurdish people and not on womenâs rights.
What we want is a proper marriage in which the parties concerned can speak their minds.
We are adamant in wanting democracy of this kind.
Yet, there is a second aspect, which is even more difficult to get right.
Will we â by whom I mean Europe â be able to change without betraying our social model?
In welcoming Turkey, will we be able at the present time not only to enhance our institutions and to vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty but also to show solidarity with this country which, large though it is, is nonetheless poor?
That is a question that remains open.
However, if we open the negotiations, we must not forget that, in a marriage, there are two partners and that each of them bears a responsibility.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ De Keyser, for that account of marriage.
It was a fine way of presenting matters.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is in a crisis; we have no constitution, and how the EU is to fund itself in future is anyoneâs guess.
The institutions of the Community have too much to cope with even with 25 Member States, and the democratic deficit is becoming plain to see.
If the EU itself were to seek accession to the European Union, its application would be rejected on the grounds that it was not a democracy.
It is under these circumstances that negotiations with Turkey are now to be embarked upon, and, as there is no likelihood of the two sides achieving union in the foreseeable future, they must be judged by the same standards, as of course required by the Copenhagen criteria.
The possibility of the negotiations being open-ended as regards outcome and duration must, in the interests of both sides, be guaranteed.
Reform is needed on both sides, and the negotiations will present both Turkey and the European Union with a great opportunity to implement it.
Thank you, and the Minister for Europe in particular, for your attention.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my country will always be grateful to Turkey for the solidarity it showed to Poland when the latter lost its independence in the 17th and 19th centuries and was partitioned between Austria, Prussia and Russia.
On the basis of that same principle of solidarity, it is incumbent on us today to express strong opposition to Turkeyâs entry into the European Union, because one of the Unionâs Members, namely the Republic of Cyprus, is currently occupied by Turkey and its statehood is not recognised.
Consent to this state of affairs would set a very dangerous precedent for all Member States of the Union.
It would mean condoning a situation where the rights of smaller or weaker nations are sacrificed in the name of the political or economic interests of stronger ones.
The history of Poland shows how dangerous this can be, and the recent agreement between Russia and Germany demonstrates that such a situation might recur.
If we have Europeâs interests at heart, it would be irresponsible to discuss accession with Turkey at all until the latter recognises the Republic of Cyprus, which is a sovereign nation and a Member of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the citizens of Europe do not welcome Turkey to the EU.
If this Parliament votes for the opening of the negotiations, it will be acting against the wishes of the citizens who voted us into this House.
The citizens of the EU do not want to see a non-European country and a non-European culture in the EU.
Our citizens do not want the Koran to have any influence on European democracy.
They do not want to pay for the development of Turkey.
The politicians who would like Turkey to enter say that Turkey must take on all of our values.
They do not know what they are asking for.
You cannot take the culture out of a people.
We believe our culture is unique. We are building the EU upon it.
But the Turks think their culture is the best and they demand space for it in Europe.
They tried that for a thousand years.
We rejected it, but now some politicians will open the door that can destroy the EU.
They underestimate Islam; they underestimate the demographic and economic effect of a country in which the religion is not only a religion, but also decides the politics.
Â Â  Mr President, 70% of Europeans and 80% of my fellow Austrians are opposed to Turkish accession, and that is quite understandable in view of the way things are going.
If someone in this House â by which I mean Mr Cohn-Bendit â can get away with describing such people as racists, then I regard that as an unparalleled disgrace to a democratic political institution.
Signing the protocol on customs union was meant to be a quasi-recognition of Cyprus, which would have enabled Ankara to save face while also meeting one of the essential conditions for the opening of negotiations.
The disregard of every agreement by inserting the additional statement, whereby recognition is rigorously, but surreptitiously refused, and the toothless new compromise, amount, in many respects, to brinkmanship.
Not only are we no nearer to resolving the issue of Turkey and Cyprus, but giving in would mean that Turkey would be dictating terms to us, which is absolutely unacceptable.
Further evidence of this is provided by Turkeyâs frequently arrogant attitude in demanding from the EU strict adherence to undertakings already given and backing these demands up with threats, while not regarding itself as bound by any treaties or agreements whatever.
That is not the right way for Turkey to become a part of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the UK Presidency opened with a speech made by MrÂ Blair that was full of allure and ambition.
From now on, we know that the only significant decision to be taken in this second â and yet altogether crucial â half-year of 2005 will be the opening of the negotiations with Turkey.
Such a decision is the height of pretence and of diplomatic correctness, shows indifference to the opinion of our populations and is inconsistent with the European integration project.
It is, above all, this project that we are talking about.
The European Union that we desire is not the one that Turkeyâs presence would force us to create.
There is an incompatibility between our political Union and the destiny that this great Nation State, which we respect, wishes to pursue on a sovereign and nationalist basis.
Since 15 December 2004, the situation has become even more perilous than what we have known in the past.
We can clearly see that, when it comes to freedoms, rights, the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide, the situation in the region populated by the Kurds and, finally, the refusal to recognise Cyprus, the negotiations will be conducted under Turkeyâs, rather than Europeâs, terms, which is a state of affairs that we have always criticised.
How can it be said that, after the decision taken by the Council at the end of last year, we have now more adequately met the conditions for opening the negotiations?
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative for this Parliament, which represents the people, to give a strong signal by postponing the decision on the Ankara protocol and by saying that the negotiations cannot be opened under the conditions that there is a desire to open them under today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, unlike the previous speaker, I, like many of us, remain convinced that Turkeyâs accession to the Union is essential for guaranteeing reconciliation, peace and security in the entire region, for contributing to the effort to make it a democratic and developed country and above all, perhaps, for demonstrating to a Muslim country that, if it respects human rights, there is a place for it in a Union of democratic countries.
The task, however, is a very difficult one, as this debate shows, since hostile forces exist that are gaining ground and striving to see this process end in failure.
MrÂ President, Commissioner, what we have here is a textbook case illustrating the political difficulty involved in taking decisions that are burdened with complications in the short term and whose positive results it will only be possible to appreciate in full 10 or 15 years later.
That is why I urge you to grant a great deal of importance and to devote a lot of time to the task of explaining.
You have to publicise the difficulties, of course, such as this unilateral Turkish declaration on Cyprus that has just been mentioned, as well as the recent cases of people being sentenced for their opinions.
Yet, we must also emphasise the progress made and the reason for the delays.
With this in mind, I cannot but believe that the declaration on Cyprus, which we regret, is a response from Turkey, long-awaited by its people, to the refusal of the UN draft by the Greek Cypriots.
That does not excuse anything but does help us to gain a better insight into events and, above all, urgently to inform the UN of the need to step up its work and to resume its mediation.
Furthermore, we must, above all, lay a great deal more stress than at present on the meaning of the academic conference held in Istanbul only recently on the Armenian issue.
It is a taboo that has finally been broken, and it has taken a very firm commitment from the Prime Minister to make this happen.
This does not mean that, from now on, Turkish public opinion is prepared to recognise what took place, but at least it is the start of a crucial stage towards such recognition.
MrÂ President, Commissioner, the process will fail if the negotiations that you are conducting and the progress that they give rise to are not mentioned.
Give descriptions, explain yourselves â you need to fight on two fronts: that of your Turkish partners and that of European public opinion.
Fight on both of them and never fail to do so!
Â Â  MrÂ President, the fact that the EU begins accession negotiations with Turkey on 3 October 2005 shows that we in the EU keep our promises.
Moreover, that is the way it should be in the EU, which is, and needs to be, a community founded on the rule of law.
Turkey is developing rapidly, as I have seen with my own eyes.
Turkey really is changing day by day.
This process of transformation is something that we must support and encourage.
Not everything is, however, as it should be in Turkey â far from it.
The customs agreement between the EU and Turkey has been signed, but Turkey will still not allow Cypriot ships to call at Turkish ports.
That is completely unacceptable.
What I am demanding of MrÂ Erdogan is crystal clear.
Turkey must treat the Cypriot ships as if they were Danish or French ships.
They must have access now.
The EUâs foreign ministers must make this indispensable demand of Turkey on Monday, 3 October 2005.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in relation to Turkey we have heard talk of human rights, religious freedom, the Kurds, Cyprus, the Popeâs masses, the Armenians and so forth. They may all be highly interesting and important, but in my view only one thing should guide us in our decisions: the will of the people.
The citizens of Europe, the electors whom we represent, do not want Turkey in Europe.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to respect the will of the people and not to consider ourselves superior to those who elected us, because if we are here it is because someone voted for us, and that someone does not want Turkey in Europe.
Let us be consistent.
Â Â  Mr President, there are powerful arguments both for and against Turkey's proposed membership of the European Union.
However, I do not have time to rehearse them now.
For me the key argument is one of democratic accountability.
The accession of a new Member State as large as Turkey would dilute the influence of all other Member States and would, therefore, further compromise the self-determination of the people I represent in the UK's East Midlands.
For this key reason I oppose Turkish accession.
I urge our Turkish friends to consider the proposal of Germany's Angela Merkel for a privileged partnership.
This is not a second-best option; on the contrary, it would give Turkey most of the benefits of full membership with few of the costs.
It is, therefore, a better deal than full membership.
Indeed, privileged partnership is such an excellent deal that I wish it were available to my country, the United Kingdom.
It would be a much better option than full membership on current terms.
Â Â  MrsÂ Merkel is not proposing that the United Kingdom should benefit from it.
Â Â  Mr President, last Christmas the Council voted for Turkey when it agreed that accession negotiations could begin on 3Â October 2005, provided certain conditions were met.
Those conditions have been met.
The process of modernisation that has been taking place in Turkey over the past 70 years has been massively accelerated and additional attention is now being given to human rights issues and to overcoming historic grievances.
Of course, there are still dissident elements within Turkey that pursue separatist ambitions or wish to reorient Turkey away from westernisation.
Care must therefore be taken to ensure that any weakening of protective state structures does not become an opportunity for radical elements to change the nature of Turkey's unified and secular democracy.
We have heard that the negotiations will be the most rigorous yet.
Natural justice and fair play should demand that Turkey be treated in the same way as other candidate countries to the European Union.
The Cyprus issue should be a matter quite separate from the candidacy of Turkey, but it has become inextricably linked.
The history of that island has been distorted these past 30Â or so years.
There have been wrongs on both sides and no justice is served by the pretence that the Turks alone carry the blame.
We should ask no more of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in relation to the Republic of Cyprus than we ask of Greece and the Greek Cypriots in relation to Northern Cyprus.
It was the people of Northern Cyprus who voted in favour of the Annan Plan; it is the Government of Northern Cyprus that has expressed its readiness to reopen negotiations on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's plan.
The rejectionists are in the south.
Why should Turkey open its ports to ships flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus when the ports of Northern Cyprus are closed to international trade and direct international flights cannot land at Ercan airport?
In May 2004 the EU Council promised to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus, but has done little about it.
That is not justice.
The Cyprus issue must be resolved.
The unification that so many of us want to see must be brought about in a manner which meets the concerns and interests of both communities on the island, not just one.
I welcome the opening of negotiations with Turkey.
Those negotiations will last for many years.
Commissioner Rehn has correctly observed that for Turkey the journey is as important as the destination.
What is clear is that the prospect of Turkey's accession will have a catalytic effect on the nature of the European Union; the EU will have to drop its integrationist ambitions and become a looser community of sovereign nations.
This will be of enormous benefit to us all.
Â Â  Mr President, in December last year, this House came to a decision, voting by 402 votes to 216, in favour of a start being made on accession talks with Turkey.
I have to say that I fail to see either why it is that some apparently find that impossible to swallow, or why this whole scheme of things is again being called into question.
If a decision we have taken is then openly questioned, what is left of this Houseâs credibility?
That is one issue, and Cyprus is another.
I would be very glad if people were to devote some of the vehemence with which they campaign for Turkish recognition of Cyprus to the cause of the Turkish members of the Cypriot nation, with whom we should also concern ourselves, by urging us to exert pressure on the government of Cyprus to work for lasting reunification, as provided for in another plan.
One-sided pressure I regard as unfair, for, at the end of the day, this is about a part of a nation â the Turkish Cypriots â who really have lost out, who have not managed to obtain what is rightfully theirs.
This House must take account of these peopleâs rights too.
As a republic, Cyprus consists not only of the Greek Cypriots; there are Turkish Cypriots there as well, and who, in this Parliament, is standing up for the rights of these people?
Â Â  Mr President, there is no Turkish part of Cyprus, just as there is no Greek part of Cyprus.
There is only one Cyprus: the Republic of Cyprus, which is internationally recognised.
Some of us consider that starting accession negotiations with a country that does not recognise one of our Member States, continues to occupy part of EU territory and has an abysmal human rights record is totally nonsensical.
Equally, the idea that Turkey must join the EU in order to be transformed is incomprehensible.
By the same argument, we should get Iraq, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal and many other not-so-democratic countries to join the EU.
A woman does not get married to her rapist in order to reform him.
She stays well away from him and hopes he is put in prison for a long time.
Let us stop behaving like a subordinate of the United States.
If Mr Bush, in his plentiful wisdom, thinks that Turkey is so great, let him have it join his own country!
Trying to get Turkey to become an EU Member is turning from a bad joke into a nightmare, and our citizens, who will pay dearly for our mistakes, realise this much better than we think they do.
Let us stop insulting their intelligence.
Turkey is an undemocratic, highly aggressive and super-problematic country and is light years away from European standards and values.
Let us not turn 3Â October into a black Monday for Europe, and let us vote against accession.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I call for the negotiations that are due to begin on 3 October purely and simply to be cancelled.
I call on the French Government to brandish Franceâs veto on the morning of 3 October and to leave the negotiating table.
If the negotiations begin on 3 October, the process will be difficult to reverse and Europe will be taking two risks: first, of disgracing itself by negotiating with a country that refuses to recognise one of the Member States of the European Union; second, that of disintegrating.
The European Union is unable today, I am afraid, to resolve its problems, in particular those related to delocalisation and immigration.
It would thus take on the burden of additional problems connected to delocalisation and immigration.
That is why I invite everyone to adopt a clear position, and I address MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, who has questioned the sceptics over the issue of Turkey.
I put to him the following question: MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, do you support the Turks who continue to deny the Armenian genocide?
Â Â  Your questions will be passed on to, respectively, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit and the French Government.
Â Â  Mr President, we are now about to take a great historic step as far as the EU is concerned.
For the first time, we are expanding beyond the borders of Europe.
We are no longer talking of a European Union, but rather a superstate.
There are nevertheless huge risks attached to opening negotiations with Turkey.
Firstly, the interests of Cyprus must not be violated simply because of the presence of Turkey, a large country.
The fact that Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States is an indication of her attitude as she enters the negotiation process.
If the intention is now to commence talks without Turkey having recognised Cyprus, the whole process will be very humiliating for the entire European Union.
Turkey will be dictating to us how to proceed, rather than the other way round.
Earlier on, the leaders of a large number of countries emphatically demanded that Cyprus should be recognised.
Hopefully they will not now be withdrawing their demands.
I myself, as someone who represents a small country, am very worried that we will be allowing Turkey to walk over Cyprus.
Evidently, nothing has been learnt from the French and Dutch referendums.
I was especially worried by what MrÂ Schulz and MrÂ Cohn-Bendit said.
They were so keen on the idea of an EU superpower that they paid no heed to the position of Cyprus, a small country.
They did not talk about the status of the minorities in Turkey: the position of Christians, the Kurds, or even the status of women there.
If they just want to make the EU into a superstate and do not at the same time strongly insist that Turkey should make headway in human rights matters, we can only ask: where does the racism really lie?
Â Â  Mr President, last week, I was in Turkey for talks with NGOs and the government about my report on womenâs rights in Turkey that this House adopted before the summer.
The government is taking the report very seriously and has started to get new projects moving and to enact new legislation.
In fact, the Minister told me that the number of relief centres has increased from 15 to 26.
While I was in Turkey, many things have happened that have given people in both Turkey and the European Union much to think about.
The problems concerned were a conference about the Armenian issue, the persecution of Orhan Pamuk, the recognition â or not, as the case may be â of Cyprus, and the closure of an organisation that stands up for the rights of homosexuals, Kaos-GL.
I can tell you from first-hand experience that the conference on the Armenian issue, despite claims in various media to the contrary, did take place.
In the end, the conference took place at the Bilgi University where I was, as it happens, giving a speech on womenâs rights at the same time.
I have also spoken, in Turkey, with Orhan Pamuk, the author, who is hopeful that the whole thing will fizzle out.
He was also somewhat taken aback at the commotion in Europe.
The Pamuk case indicates how important freedom of expression is.
Whilst a government may not be able to interfere in the independent administration of justice, it can change laws that cause confusion in its interpretation.
As far as Cyprus is concerned, I was given the assurance that the Turkish Government would certainly recognise Cyprus once a sustainable solution has been found for the whole of the island.
The good news about the homosexual rights organisation Kaos-GL is that it is still active, but I would urge the Turkish Government to leave NGOs such as this one alone.
They too must be able to take part in public debate openly.
I would call on both Turkey and the EU to remind themselves of what is at stake when the membership negotiations open on 3 October.
I wish Turkey and the EU much wisdom and patience on that day and in the days to come.
Â Â  Mr President, why is there such great indignation about the Turkish stance on Cyprus?
It is because we are diverting attention from ourselves; it is because the way the Turks are putting us on the spot hurts.
The European Union was meant to take over peacekeeping operations on the island on 1 May 2004 â but we did not.
We kept none of our promises.
We have neither put an end to Northern Cyprusâ isolation, nor have we injected the EURÂ 259Â million we promised for the reconstruction of the economy.
It is not just the case that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus; we must, once and for all, acknowledge that the Turkish Cypriots who live on the island are people with equal rights.
Young North Cypriots are not even allowed to participate in international sporting events â still less are North Cypriots welcome as Members of the European Parliament, or as observers in it.
When we say, in the Ankara Agreement, that we want to open up all the ports and airports, then the port at Famagusta and Ercan airport must be among them, in accordance with the principle of equal rights for all â unless, that is, Turks are second-class human beings.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is unthinkable that one should wish to make Europe with and for the people of Europe and not listen to their opinion on Turkeyâs application for membership.
The people have requested some respite.
Well, this unfathomable Europe, that of our Heads of State or Government, is demonstrating, once again, that it is not interested.
This is a two-fingered gesture to democracy.
Thus, nothing will be able to halt Turkeyâs accession process, the accession of this country that lacks the courage to apologise for the Armenian genocide; of this country that does not recognise the existence of our friends from Cyprus.
Well, the Council told us that such recognition was a fundamental factor.
As far as I am concerned, it is an essential factor.
Torture and discrimination against women still go on in this country, which does not respect minorities and the freedom of worship; it has no place in the European Union.
Who are we trying to kid?
In order to reassure public opinion, the Council today maintains that Turkey will be very different as a result of its joining the European Union.
Then, we are told that the negotiating conditions will be so difficult as to ruin these negotiations.
What hypocrisy!
What do the people of Turkey think about this?
And Europe for that matter?
Europe is in crisis, and this crisis is serious.
Its institutions are not allowing it to operate properly with 25 Member States.
It still has no budget for the future.
Thank you to the UK Presidency, whose only track record will be that of having bowed to US pressure calling for Turkeyâs accession.
This Europe refuses to come to a decision about its borders. What has become of our European integration project?
We are told that this accession is necessary for our economy and our security.
Well, in that case, we should propose to Turkey a strategic partnership with a view to a strong cooperation project with that pinnacle of Europe comprising Russia, our new neighbours from the East, Turkey and the Maghreb.
Turkey has no business in joining the European Union.
Truth requires the courage and the determination to demand that the opening of the negotiations may result in this partnership.
Unfortunately, Europe is continuing to forge ahead regardless, and with a cowardliness that our fellow citizens no longer accept.
Â Â  â Mr President, the PASOK delegation supports the joint motion for a resolution on Turkey, even if it is not perfect.
It also supports, as it has from the beginning of this long procedure, the prospects of the real accession of Turkey, with real rights and real obligations.
This means that the start of negotiations with Turkey does not imply that everything is negotiable.
On the one hand, the honest will of the Union to see a European Turkey as an equal member one day is non-negotiable.
On the other hand, Turkey's obligation to apply the protocol in full is non-negotiable and Turkey's obligation to recognise Cyprus is non-negotiable.
If these obligations change into a simple wish list, it will be catastrophic.
Consequently, clear objectives are needed, together with timetables, cut-off dates and sanctions if they are not achieved.
We owe it to the people of Turkey, to its millions of citizens who honestly wish for a European, democratic, prosperous and peaceful country.
We owe it equally to the European citizens, in order to combat easy and dangerous Turko-scepticism.
We must give them the certainty that the accession of Turkey will come from honourable European negotiations and not from an eastern bazaar.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, having clarified that the New Democracy delegation supports both Turkey's European prospects and the start of accession negotiations, I wish to point out certain obligations which Turkey has, precisely because of its European prospects and the negotiations.
Firstly, the immediate recognition of Republic of Cyprus which is, as you all know, a Member State of the European Union and on which the European Council recently took the right stand.
Secondly, compliance without retractions with all the obligations which derive from the Ankara protocol, which Turkey has signed.
Thirdly, respect for minority rights, especially of Greeks in Istanbul, Imvro and Tenedos.
Fourthly, respect for religious rights, especially respect for the role of the Ecumenical Patriarch.
Fifthly, I do not wish to start a legal discussion at the moment, but I do wish to draw the Commissioner's attention to the talks being held with the Turkish Government and to ask him to make sure that the Turkish Government does â I repeat â also send the unilateral declaration of the non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus to the Turkish National Assembly.
Finally, a candidate country must clearly improve its bilateral relations with all the Member States of the European Union as quickly as possible.
Â Â  â Mr President, all of us who consistently and decisively defend Turkey's path towards Europe welcome the positive fact of the start of accession negotiations, which may contribute towards the in-depth democratic transformation of Turkish society, to peace, to prosperity and to the development of the area as a whole.
Only an honest strategy of clear objectives and clear messages on the part of the European Union can be effective towards Turkey.
The consistent defence of Turkey's path towards Europe does not give it .
It must not see it as an opportunity to water down the preconditions and obligations which it has undertaken.
Turkey has to respect the European legal order and European democratic principles on human rights, minority rights, the role of the Ecumenical Patriarch, the issues of the Greek minority, the Armenian issue, the diplomatic recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and the application of the Customs Union protocol within a clear timeframe.
All these issues, Mr President, are issues relating to respect for the European legal order and the very credibility of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the Turks are not making things easy for the Members of this House.
We have to ask ourselves what is actually going on.
Where Cyprus is concerned, what is the truth of the matter?
While the extension of the customs agreement amounts to its indirect recognition, a unilateral statement is made at the same time to the effect that it is not recognised at all.
Never before, in the whole history of the opening of accession negotiations, has anything like this happened.
The Turkish attitude may well be understandable, but we, in this House, must not stand for this sort of coercion.
I would like to say, secondly, that nobody has so far been able to convince me that Turkey meets the political criteria; it may do so on paper, but it does not in reality.
Authors who make explicit reference to the Kurdish and Armenian problems are hauled off and find themselves in front of a judge.
Lawyers who seek to defend the Kurdsâ human rights are obstructed when they try to represent their clients.
I do not want to go into the issues surrounding womenâs rights, but they fall a long way short of European standards.
It was in the hope of progress in relation to human rights that the EU undertook to open negotiations with Turkey, but the crucial thing is that we are applying dual standards here.
We are, for example, taking a far more tolerant line towards Turkey than towards Croatia, which has produced far more evidence of progress in this area and is meeting the targets of the Council Task Forceâs Action Plan.
The Eurlings report represents an attempt at squaring the circle.
If it is not somehow laid down in black and white that these negotiations are open-ended, and if this Houseâs minimum requirements, as set out in these two additional amendments tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are not complied with, then I am in favour of rejecting the whole report in order, before 3 October, to send a message, not least to the Council.
Â Â  In December last year I told this House that the European Union should honour its undertakings and acknowledge the progress that Turkey has made.
Today I would like to repeat this appeal.
As stated in the resolution we are about to vote on, Turkey has formally met all the conditions for accession talks to begin on 3 October.
These accession talks will mark the beginning of a long and open-ended process.
In the first instance it will be up to our Turkish friends to demonstrate that they are capable of meeting all the requirements and criteria that the countries that became members of the European Union last year also had to meet.
These include political requirements, human and civil rights issues, economic preparations and many more conditions, but I believe and am of the view that the European Union should give our Turkish friends a chance, and try to overcome this obstacle, which many people regard as very serious.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, all the problems can be found in the content.
I would rather have anticipated difficulties relating perhaps to religion or ideology, and now it appears that Turkey is creating difficulties at political or diplomatic level.
The fundamental question arises as to whether Turkey wishes to join Europe in a responsible manner, or whether Europe wishes to admit Turkey irresponsibly, at any price, in the spirit of international socialism or as a previous speaker put it in such fine romantic language, in the spirit of love.
But fine is only what is true.
MrÂ President, is this not a case of our being hoist by our own petard, or in other words of our being caught out by the rule sometimes known as too much invested to quit?
With all this in mind, is it not the case that Europe has moved too far in Turkeyâs direction, despite the latter behaving like a spoilt child blackmailing its parents?
Is it not perhaps also the case that Europe cannot now afford to lose face by withdrawing, or does not know what other solutions it could conjure up to ensure coexistence and a common future?
It certainly appears as if institutional Europe as opposed to the citizensâ Europe has rather lost its way.
I very much hope it will soon be back on track and time frames cannot be restrictive in this regard.
Please note that I was brief, MrÂ President.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is a country on the move; it is no longer what it was yesterday.
Its relationship with Europe has itself pushed the country towards major reforms.
The Turkey of today certainly could not join the European Union, but we are not debating that, and the resolution that we are going to adopt includes a raft of conditions.
We are debating the possibility of revitalising Europe as a leading figure that can promote a project of democracy and stability at a time when the world has seen a prevalence of insane political decisions based on hatred, fear and the presumption of exporting democracy with bombs.
Such decisions have led to death, insecurity and greater instability.
We have had enough of giving in to fear.
We need a change, a sign, I would say a different policy, like the Zapatero-Erdogan proposal taken up by Kofi Annan regarding an alliance of civilisations.
I am therefore in favour of opening negotiations for the sake of the security of Europeâs citizens; for the sake of peace; for the sake of the fight against terrorism, which, to be effective, must also include political decisions to isolate terrorists; and for the sake of the strength of Europe as a model of democracy that exports democratic values.
Â Â  Mr President, two principles appear to be clashing where Turkey is concerned.
Which is more important: democracy and the Copenhagen criteria or Turkey's significance as a geo-strategic partner?
There is a serious danger that those who favour the geo-strategic argument are underestimating the gaps in Turkey's democratic attainments to date.
Views are deeply divided as to whether matters are improving or deteriorating in terms of meeting Copenhagen criteria.
The decision to press charges against Orhan Pamuk on grounds of having libelled the Turkish Republic because he had spoken critically of the Armenian genocide and the treatment of the Kurdish minority is deeply worrying.
In a fully democratic state these cannot be grounds for criminal proceedings.
There are those who would overlook these and many other shortcomings on Turkey's part, not least by saying that they are 'road accidents'.
The trouble with that approach is that it gives too much leeway to those who are not really interested in the democratic transformation of Turkey.
Equally, it disheartens the country's committed democrats.
What is the point of being committed to democracy if others can get away with non-democratic behaviour?
All this raises a difficult question: does the Turkish Government have control over all the institutions of the Turkish state?
If it does not, then there is no way that Turkey can comply with Copenhagen criteria.
That in turn raises the even more difficult problem of the Turkish armed forces, which still have the right to intervene in the political process as guardians of secularism and the country's territorial integrity.
Is that compatible with Copenhagen criteria?
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament in response to what has been both a timely and an emotive debate.
I would like to shall begin, however, by echoing the earlier remarks made by Commissioner Rehn in welcoming to Parliament the Bulgarian and Romanian observers.
I welcome also the timeliness of this debate and the genuine efforts of MrÂ Brok and other Members of this Parliament to ensure a broad base of support, so that the voice of the European Parliament is genuinely heard before 3 October.
I should also like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his contribution to the earlier discussions.
The terms and substance of his contributions evidence the extent to which a common approach is being taken by the Presidency and by the Commission on the important issues facing us.
I pay tribute to Mr Brok and his predecessor as rapporteur, and indeed to the leaders of all the political groupings we have heard from today, in setting out their views so clearly.
I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work of other Members of the European Parliament, for example Mrs Pack's work in relation to women's rights in Turkey, which I think has been evidenced by both the experience and the expertise brought to our discussions and deliberations this morning.
I ask Parliament's forgiveness for not seeking to respond to every specific point that has been raised during the course of what has been a long but nonetheless illuminating debate.
Instead, let me try to address the main themes that were picked up on by a number of different speakers.
I shall start with the general point alluded to by MrÂ Wurtz, which was that the Presidency is steering the Council to fulfil the mandate of the December European Council's conclusions, which were then indeed reaffirmed by the June Council.
The decision essentially to open negotiations with Turkey on 3Â October has therefore already been taken.
Our job as the Presidency is to ensure that the conditions are met and that the framework for doing so is agreed.
In this context let me touch on the issue of Croatia, which was alluded to by Mr Brok, Mr Poettering and indeed by Mr Schulz.
Turkey and Croatia are of course separate issues.
Conditions have been set out for both and the Council will make decisions independently on the basis of an assessment of those objective criteria.
I am pleased, however, that in the case of both countries it is clear already that the anticipation of making further progress in relation to both countries' desire to be part of the European family has brought significant progress, as was recognised explicitly by Mr Duff in his contribution this morning.
I shall also address some of the specific questions that were raised.
Concerns were raised about Turkey's statement prior to 3 October.
It is important to recognise specifically that concerns were raised in relation to the recognition of Cyprus and the implementation of the AAP.
The Council's position on both of these matters is clear, and indeed was set out in the declaration which I quoted in my introductory remarks.
I will let Commissioner Rehn reply to the specific points relating to your letter to him, but the Council's position on the need for full implementation, including the statement, has already been made clear.
Indeed, the need for monitoring is also set out.
Specifically in relation to the reforms that have already been undertaken, but also, more significantly, continue to need to be taken, I have noted very carefully the concerns expressed here this morning, whether in relation to the position of minorities, to the freedom of religion and expression or, indeed, more broadly on the issue of human rights.
Commissioner Rehn has already commented on the specific issue of the case of Orhan Pamuk, the distinguished Turkish writer.
I would, however, respectfully remind Parliament that the draft negotiating framework, and the overall reform process set out by the Commission, are designed to address exactly those concerns.
Indeed, that is one of the reasons why both the Commission and the Council has been so keen to take forward the process of negotiation to ensure further progress in relation to the reforms.
It is also worth reflecting at this point in our debate on the words of Mrs Bonino, who made clear that the European Union process has already achieved a huge amount within Turkey, notwithstanding the fact that there is much further progress to be made.
One question left hanging in the air somewhat in some of the contributions has been to ask what the ultimate goal of the discussions and the process being taken forward is.
Again, the starting point in responding to that question is to recall the conclusions of the December Council of 17Â December 2004.
Let me quote directly from the conclusions: 'the shared goal of the negotiations is accession'.
However, the statement also went on to say that 'these negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand'.
So let us be very clear that the shared goal of negotiations was full accession, but, equally, the conditionality inherent in that statement was very clear.
I have also taken note today of the concerns that have been expressed over the absorption capacity of the Union.
Indeed, this is reflected in the Commission's draft negotiating framework.
Some speakers referred to the need for a settlement in Cyprus and this is, of course, an important and sensitive issue.
However, I welcome the Parliament's recognition of the importance of widespread support being garnered for the UN process, and again that is reflected in the Council's earlier declaration.
The final point I want to touch on is the issue of the Constitution.
Many have talked about it in relation to Turkish accession.
I would, however, respectfully remind Parliament that there will be further opportunities for discussion on the European draft Constitutional Treaty.
Indeed, the June decision of the European Council was to have a further rendezvous and revisit this issue in spring 2006.
That does not remove the obligation on the Council or the Commission to continue to make progress on a range of areas concerning Europe's future in the meantime.
That is what we intend to do.
I value the contributions made in relation to our thinking about Turkish accession and particularly value the opportunity to have heard the views of MEPs at this particular stage, given the imminence of the decision and the process now being taken forward.
Â Â  . Mr President, I compliment MrÂ Alexander, especially as regards the questions about the legal nature of the declaration.
Like him, I will skip the small talk and get straight down to business.
Honourable Members have asked whether the Commissioner can provide a written statement from the Turkish Government concerning the ratification process and the nature of the declaration.
I take this question very seriously and I am willing to ask for details of the ratification process from my counterparts in the Turkish Government.
We need to take into account that Turkey has a parliamentary system â thank God, it is a parliamentary democracy.
It is the Turkish Grand National Assembly that will have to ratify the Ankara Protocol, not the Government of Turkey.
I am sure that as parliamentarians you well understand the order of business and will agree that it would be a very delicate matter and indeed questionable for a Commissioner to give guarantees on behalf of the European Parliament.
The key point that needs to be underlined again is that the declaration made by the Turkish Government can in no way call into question Turkey's obligations.
The protocol has to be fully and properly implemented and the declaration does not in any way reduce the legal relevance of the Turkish signature of the protocol.
There is also a very strong revision clause in the EU declaration that the Member States adopted last week, which refers to 2006.
Moreover, we have all the necessary means to make sure that full implementation takes place, for otherwise there will be direct consequences for the progress of negotiations.
There is a very clear and strong conditionality â and please let us not underestimate the intelligence of Turks.
They know that in order to make progress in the negotiations they must fully implement the protocol, as they have signed it and will soon ratify it.
Concerning the prospect of new peace processes in Cyprus, which was referred to in many speeches, the European Union remains fully committed to our overall objective, which is the reunification of Cyprus.
In that context, I would like to recall the declaration by the EU and Member States, which agreed last week, and I quote, 'on the importance of supporting the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem'.
The Commission remains ready to assist the United Nations wherever possible, as proactively as we have done, and we will continue this work with determination in the future.
However, let us be frank and open here: the keys to the solution are in the hands of the two communities and it is high time that both communities engaged in a serious dialogue with each other, so that Cyprus can become a Member State like all others, united and in peace.
Both communities are keenly interested in a solution and they are best placed to address the critical issues.
Certainly, we also expect Turkey to continue to work constructively towards a settlement and support the resumption of the UN efforts.
Let us also recall what today's vote is all about. It is about concluding a procedure on the EU side, relating to a commitment that we have ourselves demanded, even insisted on, from Turkey.
Now that we have achieved this, there are some on our side who say 'no thanks'.
Seriously, I cannot help comparing this to a rather strange situation on a football field.
Imagine that your team has worked very hard for 89 minutes to score a winning goal.
Finally the striker is alone in the box, he passes the goalkeeper and he is just about to put the ball into the empty goal when suddenly the coach shouts 'stop, turn round and bring the ball back'!
Maybe this makes sense to some but certainly not to me.
To my mind it is rather like an own goal.
Moreover, it is difficult to understand why this House would want the Customs Union to apply only to Germany but not to Poland, to Greece but not to Cyprus.
Again, this may make sense to some but not to me.
By voting for assent now, you will help to extend the Customs Union to all new Member States of the European Union.
Finally, and this is extremely important, I want cordially to ask honourable Members, for the sake of Europe, not to weaken our negotiating position by postponing assent to the protocol.
Instead, by voting for assent now, we will be giving the European Union far greater credibility in its demand for rapid ratification by the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
That should be our objective.
Please let us keep this main target in mind and, for the sake of our credibility and for the sake of Europe, let us vote in favour of assent.
Â Â  Mr President, it was said earlier that personal statements must be made at the end of debates.
We have now reached the end of one, and I would like to make a personal statement.
Â Â  If you wish to take the floor under RuleÂ 145, you have a maximum of three minutes in which to speak.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit accused those who are opposed to Turkeyâs accession to the EU of riding a wave of racism and hostility to Islam.
I would like to make it abundantly clear that I believe that the Bosnian Muslims are Europeans, that the Muslim Albanians are Europeans, and that our Muslim fellow-citizens of the EU are Europeans, but that, to take one example, the Christian Ethiopians are not.
My misgivings are founded on the simple fact that Turkey is not a European state.
To maintain that that statement is an indication of racism and of hostility to Islam is a distortion of the facts and a deliberate slander that I wish to repudiate.
Mr Cohn-Bendit himself drew a subtle distinction between those who are self-evidently European and a shift towards Eurasia.
That was actually a very astute line for him to take, although he then threw his chance away by starting to deliberately and slanderously accuse those who take a critical view of the situation as racists, and that is something I repudiate!
Â Â  MrÂ Posselt, I am going to interrupt you. This is not a personal statement but a continuation of the debate, which we cannot resume.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement.
The Chairman of the Socialist Group in this House asserted during the debate that I had formerly advocated Turkeyâs full membership of the European Union.
I would like to make it clear that I do not do so and never have.
I have obtained the minutes of the debate on 13 December 1995.
It is quite clear that the only subject of this debate was whether to say âyesâ or ânoâ to customs union.
At that time, Mr Schulz and I were on opposing sides; I was campaigning for a âyesâ to the customs union, while he was against it.
What has been said today is a manifest distortion of the truth.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
We shall suspend the sitting until voting time.
Â Â  I fully support the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey this autumn.
They will no doubt be long and difficult, but if agreement can be reached and if Turkey meets all the necessary conditions regarding the functioning of democracy and respect for human rights including the rights of minorities then there is no reason of principle why it should not be entitled to join the European Union.
I reject the arguments of those who object to Turkeyâs membership on the ground that Turkey is not âEuropeanâ.
That argument was settled years ago when we accepted Turkeyâs membership of the Council of Europe.
Opponents of Turkeyâs membership try to equate âEuropeanâ with âChristianâ.
Yet Islam has played a part in Europeâs history and culture for centuries.
In any case, the motto of the European Union is âunity with diversityâ.
We are not trying to harmonise cultures but to find ways of working together whilst keeping our various identities.
By reaching out to Turkey we underline that the EU is not based on an exclusive European identity, but of an inclusive one.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen,
Parliament is preparing today to give its assent to extending the Ankara Agreement to the ten new Member States of the European Union.
Members of the refuse to associate themselves with this.
In actual fact, the Turkish Government was keen to emphasise that, in signing this protocol, it was under no circumstances recognising the Republic of Cyprus.
In other words, the Turkish Government is denying any legal existence of a country that is a full member of this Europe in which Turkey wants to assert its presence.
In view of Turkeyâs exclusion of the Republic of Cyprus, the Council Declaration of 21Â September is utterly scandalous.
In actual fact, the Council is not drawing any conclusions from the position adopted by the Turkish Government.
It is merely asking that, in 2006, Ankara respect these commitments towards all the countries of the European Union.
In the meantime, however, the reservation clause desired by Turkey will take full effect.
The only response possible would be not only to question the signing of the protocol, but also to abandon once and for all the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey, which clearly are not the right path to take for ensuring calm and mutually beneficial relations.
Â Â  Either the Parliament continues to engage with such forces of progress as exist in Turkey, or we can throw away all leverage we have.
It grieves me that the Parliament has today thrown a series of unnecessary inconsistencies into our Report.
Turkish recognition of Cyprus, respect for human rights, better treatment of the Kurds, recognition of the Armenian genocide and many other issues must all be dealt with, as Turkey is currently far from any acceptable standards.
The only way to raise such standards is to continue dialogue.
Â Â  Mr President, during the debate on our policy towards Turkey, I asked for permission to make a personal statement in response to a less than friendly comment directed at me by Mr Langen.
During our time in this House, though, Mr Langen and I have had so many rows, after which we have always buried the hatchet, that I can dispense with the personal statement.
Â Â  I am delighted.
Reconciliation is the very basis of the European project.
Mr Brok, do you wish to reconcile yourself with anyone?
Â Â  Mr President, there are many things we can achieve, but the greatest of them all is love.
Â Â  That is what I like to see; you coming to plenary with such a positive attitude.
Â Â  Before the vote, I would like, on my own behalf and on behalf of all of you, to welcome the members of the Delegation from the Mexican Congress to the official gallery.
This delegation is taking part in the work of the first meeting of the European Union-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, which is being held in Strasbourg.
I would like to wish the best to the whole of the delegation and in particular its leader, Mr Fernando MargaÃ­n, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Mexican Senate.
I am convinced that the work of the first meeting of this Joint Parliamentary Committee will represent a milestone in the strengthening of cooperation between the two parties, because we both advocate the same democratic values and the same commitment to the Rule of Law.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot offer you any declarations of love; I think it is enough for us to be able to have mutual respect for each other.
Pursuant to Rule 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, I would like, on behalf of my group, to move that we defer our agreement to the additional protocol on customs union.
The reasoning behind this motion is that the Turkish Government, although it has accepted the additional protocol, has, at the same time, whilst wishing to negotiate with the Republic of Cyprus, refused to recognise it, declaring furthermore that the ships and aircraft of a Member State of the European Union, that being Cyprus, are barred from using Turkish harbours and airspace.
We take the view â logically enough â that this is inherently contradictory and politically utterly unacceptable.
If we were now to give our approval to the additional protocol, then it would no longer be open to us â the statement by the chairman of the Socialist Group this morning notwithstanding â to exert influence on the Turkish Government.
I therefore, and on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, move that the vote on the additional protocol be deferred.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I disagree with Mr Poettering.
Contrary to what he says, the resolution, which we are tabling jointly, makes clear that we are demanding the full implementation of all the agreements entered into, and, as the Commissioner reiterated in his speech this morning, it also states that, if they are not, the negotiations will be suspended or even broken off.
We should, I think, for our part, stand by the contractual agreements into which we have entered, for that will make it easier for us to retain a high degree of credibility if, in the event of the other side reneging on its undertaking, we have to declare that the negotiations are closed and are not being taken any further.
We are therefore in favour of putting this to the vote today.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to request an addendum to Amendment 5, the correct amendment tabled by MrÂ Lambrinidis.
As I have the English text in front of me, I shall read the addendum in English.
At the end, after the phrase 'under the protocol', I should like the phrase 'and should not be sent to the Grand National Assembly for ratification' to be added.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a simple amendment to replace the words 'as soon as possible', in paragraph 6, with the words 'at an early stage in the negotiating process'.
Â Â  We shall continue with the votes, but first of all I must inform you that the Member of the Peruvian Congress, Mr Gustavo Pacheco, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and of the European Union-Peru Friendship Group, is present in the official gallery.
I would also like to point out that the last meeting of the European Union-Latin America-Caribbean Interparliamentary Conference, which was the seventeenth such meeting, took place in that country during June of this year.
On behalf of all the Members of the European Parliament in the delegation, which was chaired by our fellow Member AntÃ³nio dos Santos, I would like to express our thanks to the Peruvian Congress for its support for that conference.
Â Â  We shall continue with the votes.
Â Â  .
Mr President, this amendment has been agreed, not only with the other groups, but also with the Council and the Commission, as a compromise, and it recurs in Amendment 785.
I shall read it out:
... 'without prejudice to the implementing measures already adopted, on expiry of a two-year period following the adoption of the directive and on 1 April 2008 at the latest, the application of its provisions requiring the adoption of technical rules, amendments and decisions in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be suspended.
Acting on a proposal from the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council may renew the provisions concerned in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty and, to that end, they shall review them prior to the expiry of the period or date referred to above.'
Â Â  Mr President, this too is a compromise between the various groups, the Council and the Commission, and it too will recur in Amendment 782.
It begins like this:
... 'in the view of the European Parliament'; to which should be added the words: 'the European Parliament and the Council should have the opportunity to evaluate the conferral of implementing powers on the Commission within a determined...'.
Â Â  Mr President, this is the same amendment that we voted on before under Amendment 781, which I have already read out.
The next one corresponds to Amendment 778, the second oral amendment.
Â Â  . Mr President, today marks the beginning, in Milan, of the trial resulting from the Parmalat scandal.
At the time the scandal broke, this House adopted a resolution requesting that accountancy rules within companies in Europe be made more rigorous, and I am, today, as rapporteur, able to present to you a package of measures that should tighten up the supervision of accountants generally, and, more specifically, of those working within companies.
We managed to reach agreement on this with the Council and Commission in just one reading, an agreement that, moreover, involves a considerable restriction of the comitology.
I would ask you to endorse this proposal and report in order that this House may send a clear message to the effect that we believe that accounting scandals within companies in Europe must stop.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a connection between the rapporteurâs Amendment 14 and my groupâs Amendment 50.
In Amendment 14, Category C has been deleted.
In our Amendment 50, that is about three yearsâ national professional experience of locomotive drivers in cross-border traffic, we were working on the premise that this Category C was still in force.
In agreement with the rapporteur, we will delete the reference to Category C, so that it can no longer give rise to anyone voting against Amendment 50.
Â Â  Mr President, although I would certainly like Amendments 32 and 138 both to be put to the vote, I would welcome it if the vote on Amendment 138 were to take precedence over that on Amendment 32, so that the amendment is amended to read as follows:
... 'they shall transport the bicycle of the passenger in all trains, including cross-border and high-speed trains, possibly on payment of a charge'.
Â Â  The proposal for a regulation has been rejected.
The Commission has the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission takes note of the position taken by Parliament today on this issue.
Having regard to its commitments vis-Ã -vis the European Parliament, the Commission will not hesitate to draw all the conclusions from a rejection by your Assembly, taking into account the Council's position as well.
As my colleague Commissioner Barrot told you yesterday, the Commission will have to reflect on the best way to achieve the objective shared by all three institutions on improving international rail freight services.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are about to vote on Amendment 5.
I am an advocate of long-term thinking, but the Swedish version is surely wrong in referring to the âfinancial framework 2007â2123â.
I suspect that it should be 2013.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .The Commission has not answered my question as to whether, at the end of the Helsinki Summit in 1999, MrÂ Verheugen and MrÂ Solana had to convince Prime Minister Ecevit to give his assent to naming Turkey as a candidate country.
It is not clear whether the text submitted to the Turks at the time was the same as the one that had been accepted by the European Council in 1999.
I should like to know the truth.
I voted in favour of Turkeyâs accession during the vote in December 2004, out of respect for those who campaign for human rights.
Since that vote, there has been no end to the provocations on the part of the Turks. The brutal repression by the police during the demonstration of women on 8 March 2005, the denial of the Armenian genocide, the attitude towards the Kurdish people and the non-recognition of Cyprus lead me to vote against the start of the negotiations.
I question whether Turkeyâs membership will not be the outcome of US pressure and of the economic motives of certain European governments.
We need to see acts on the part of the Turkish Government, proving its willingness to comply with the rules of the European Union.
Â Â  .Only a few days away from the opening of the negotiations on Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, MEPs from six political groups believe that it has fulfilled the final conditions enabling these negotiations to get under way.
It is altogether alarming to witness these âEuropeanâ elected representatives compromise themselves by telling lies, acting disgracefully and giving in.
Is it a matter of pleasing a certain internationalist pseudo-elite, of protecting a few obscure economic interests or, indeed, of giving in to the political will of the United States?
From a Machiavellian viewpoint, can this kind of attitude guarantee effectively that such and such an âenlightened conservativeâ or such and such a âprogressiveâ will reap the lucrative benefits of re-election?
The reality stems more from the fact that these ârepresentativesâ do not listen to their voters but scorn them instead.
European public opinion clearly says âNOâ to Turkeyâs membership.
It would, in actual fact, be totally irresponsible for an Asian country which is, moreover, poor and with a Muslim culture, to join an unstable Union that has an uncertain institutional and economic future.
It is not enough for Turkey to recognise Cyprus, an occupied European territory, in order to be able to join the Union.
Turkey must not join the European Union quite simply because it is not a European country.
The obligatory good neighbourliness does not involve us all living under one roof.
Â Â  .Our Parliament is thus preparing to vote in favour of the legislative resolution relating to the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement.
Although Turkey still refuses to acknowledge its responsibility in the Armenian genocide and still refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus through its continued occupation of the north of the island, the Heads of State or Government, the Commission and Parliament are preparing to bypass the opinion of the people in defiance of their sovereignty.
The internationalist machine calmly pursues its course, concocting a policy that will prove to be disastrous for the economic and social balance, as well as for peace in Europe.
In a period marked by Islamic terrorism, where fundamentalist networks are being broken up in certain suburbs, and at a time when our republican laws and our principle of secularism are coming into conflict with the development of a radical kind of Islam on our soil, how can Europe take the responsibility of forcing upon Europeans a country with an Islamic government?
In this matter, should we not, on the contrary, implement the precautionary principle by proposing another partnership?
This accession will do nothing other than reinforce a logic of promoting minorities in society, and one that paves the way for the fragmentation of Europe.
Â Â  .By supporting the principle of Turkeyâs entry into the European Union, the European Parliament remains deaf to the voice of the people, who are expressing growing reservations as regards this new enlargement.
The time has come to set clear and coherent borders for the Union instead of endlessly forging ahead regardless.
No serious political construction â apart from the creation of a single market â can dispense with defining the EUâs territorial outline.
In fact, nothing has been undertaken to that end.
I have been arguing for years for several circles in the integration of Europe to be created: the first would be a federal circle, which would be very integrated and in which there would be agreement as regards social and fiscal convergence; the second circle would integrate the countries of Eastern Europe and enable our policies to be strengthened at a more progressive rate; and, finally, there would be a circle of cooperation and of close and strengthened partnership in which Turkey would play a full part.
Beyond that, I see no reason why we should not treat with the same consideration regions such as the Maghreb, to which a large number of the Member States are united by close links.
What is being put to us has nothing to do with this project but confirms the fact that the European project is on its way to being diluted in a vast free trade area.
Â Â  . I regret that shortsighted and narrow views won the day over the Turkish Protocol.
The delay in voting on this is setback but should not fundamentally alter Turkey's progress towards membership of the European Union.
The motion for resolution which was adopted shows acceptance that the question is not if Turkey will join but when and under what conditions.
Â Â  Mr President, since Turkey first applied to join the Union, our Group has supported this process.
Our Group held a meeting in Istanbul where we endorsed this process directly.
We think that Turkey has undergone a transformation in order to embrace modernity, democracy and the correct process for gaining accession to the European Union.
Turkey has made efforts to adapt its legal system to comply with the Copenhagen criteria.
It has also made advances towards democracy, human rights and the protection of minorities.
I wonder why those who now claim to defend Kurdish rights have been silent for nearly a century and why they do not work for minority rights in other countries in the European Union.
Turkey has a functioning market economy capable of being competitive within the Union.
It also has an administrative and institutional capacity to implement EU rules and regulations.
I think that we have to work so that Turkey recognises Cyprus and that we should consider what would happen if Turkey did not join the EU.
There are difficulties at present, but I think we should facilitate changes in Turkey so that it can make progress towards joining the European Union.
We decided to abstain, because the amendments adopted during the vote altered the meaning of the text in many cases.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was leaving Genoa airport to come to Strasbourg, a Genoese pensioner, Giacomo Bertone, came up to me and asked, âBut is Turkey geographically part of Europe?â
I answered, âA small part of Turkey is in Europe, and a large part of Turkey is in Asia.â
âThen you must say no to Turkey joining the European Union,â he remarked, and then continued, âbut if Turkey does join the European Union, will it at last put an end to Islamic terrorism?â
âNo,â I answered, âI really do not think so.
Quite the opposite, Islamic terrorists will attack not just Europe but Turkey too.â
Then he added, âMrÂ Fatuzzo, as the representative of the Pensionersâ Party you must vote against Turkey joining the European Union for those reasons, while remaining a good friend to the people of Turkey.â
That is what I have done, MrÂ President.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Turkey is an extremely important country from a European perspective, too.
Nevertheless, we should be aware that even countries as large as Turkey, which on top of this is a candidate country, must comply with certain criteria.
We should be aware that the fundamental values of the Union are at stake here.
I believe that last weekâs judgment by the Supreme Court, which ruled against the conference in Istanbul on the reappraisal of the past relating to the genocide of Armenians, gives ample food for thought and shows us that fundamental rights are probably not being respected in Turkey.
For this reason, I rejected this resolution, and I believe that we would all be well advised to insist on respect for the fundamental values of the Union and to apply the same conditions to Turkey.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, todayâs vote was a colossal shot across the bows of the Council on the issue of Turkey.
Opening negotiations with Turkey but not Croatia next Monday would give the EU public the impression that all 25 Members of the Council had collectively taken leave of their senses.
This not being a desirable scenario, there are certain things I would urge tomorrowâs meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives to do.
Firstly, to give the green light to Croatia, a European country that meets all the conditions.
Secondly, if you negotiate with Turkey, to do so only if the negotiating framework makes clear that the objective is a privileged partnership.
If this proves unattainable, I must appeal to the Member States to make use of unanimity and postpone negotiations with Turkey, as was done â unjustly â in the case of Croatia on 16Â March â one day before negotiations were due to begin.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted ânoâ to the resolution on Turkey because we believe that Turkey will be Islamâs Trojan horse in Europe.
We voted ânoâ and we hope that at least one of the Member States will oppose the 3Â October decision, because it would be an ill omen for the future of Europe.
I personally hope and wish that it will be my government that does so, the Government of Italy, a country that has historical roots that go all the way back to that great tradition of European and Christian opposition and resistance to the Islamic invasion, which is summed up in a single word: Lepanto.
Those who must decide on 3Â October should remember Lepanto: no Islam in Europe; no Islam in Europe ever!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is not Europe.
Its sensibilities, uses, customs and dominant religions are too different; its forms of interpersonal and gender relations are too different; its geopolitical interests conflict, as they are too closely linked to those of the United States, which â I must point out â conflict with ours.
Cyprus, first of all: we should be ashamed even to begin such talks when a Member State and an old ally is still not recognised and is partly under military occupation by Turkey.
Then there is the Armenian genocide, the Kurdish issue, civil liberties, social tensions â I could go on with a long list of undeniable contrasts that count against Turkey joining the European Union.
The system by which political weight in the European Parliament and the Commission is proportional to population will give Turkey a dominant role in European Union decision-making.
We resisted Turkeyâs annexation of Europe â for that is what we are dealing with â at Lepanto and then at Vienna.
The vast majority of Europeans do not want Turkey in Europe: that is the peopleâs mandate, and we have a duty to respect it by voting ânoâ.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago, the Flemish newspaper wrote that Turkeyâs future EU Member State status was decided on a long time ago and that an anonymous EU top official had told the paper that the so-called open-ended nature of the negotiations was no more than window dressing and that, I quote, âthe phrase âopen-endedâ is included only in order to fool critics into thinking that no definite decisions have been takenâ.
That says it all, really.
I think that the Turkey issue is becoming the most striking and most politically frightening illustration of the way in which the European Union is suspending the normal democratic decision-making processes and is ramming decisions down the publicâs throat, if need be with all the dirty tricks of the trade, and, in the case of Turkey, with lies and deceit.
You need have no illusions about that, though, as the last word has not yet been spoken, and our opposition to the accession of Islamic Turkey to the European Union will only become stronger and more determined, and the European public will back us even more than they do already.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I voted against the motion for a resolution on the opening of negotiations with Turkey, because I consider it irresponsible to start negotiations on its accession.
Turkey in no way meets the preconditions for the opening of accession negotiations.
It is rumoured that torture is still practised there, violations of human rights persist and Christians continue to be substantially hindered in the practice of their religion, to name but a few reasons.
It is incomprehensible how the Commission is going against its better judgment on this.
The Commissioner responsible for enlargement, MrÂ Rehn, should step down before he does any more damage.
He is offending against the concept of European integration on a massive scale.
We should not be surprised when increasing numbers of citizens lose confidence in European institutions such as Parliament, the Commission and the Council and the majority therefore votes against the Constitution, as it did in the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
In rejecting the resolution on Turkey, I, like my friend MrÂ Posselt, have most certainly acted in the interests of the great majority of the Bavarian electorate, which wants a privileged partnership with Turkey, not full membership.
Incidentally, many of my Turkish friends share this opinion.
Â Â  . As an opponent of non-European Turkey joining the EU, I have today voted against the resolution endorsing the opening of negotiations with this Asian state.
I believe it is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey.
Moreover, Turkey's duplicity over Cyprus makes it unworthy of membership.
On one hand it disingenuously accepts a Protocol apparently accepting Cyprus, but at the same time issues a declaration disavowing any such recognition.
When added to its cruel history and continuing persecution of Christians, it is clear that Turkey is one country and culture that we can well do without.
Â Â  .I am convinced that joining the EU is synonymous with subscribing to certain values, in particular in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
That is why Turkey must become a full-scale democratic country.
The prospect of its joining the EU can bring about positive developments leading to a real, and not only virtual, kind of democracy, which recognises and respects its minorities, in particular the Kurdish population, and to greater respect for human rights, by putting an end to the violations of the freedom of expression such as the recent conviction of the author, OrhanÂ Pamuk, as well as to a fresh perspective on the dark pages of its past, through recognition of the Armenian genocide.
Nevertheless, on the eve of the 3 October deadline â the date on which the Council must reach a decision about the opening of the accession negotiations â we are far short of the target.
On the contrary, Turkey is digging in its heels and even becoming more radical as regards at least two points: the recognition of Cyprus, which can under no circumstances form the subject of negotiations, and the stubborn refusal to tackle the issue of the Armenian genocide, a willingness to tackle which I consider to be a preliminary condition for membership.
That is why I, together with others, tabled two amendments to supplement a resolution that is particularly reticent on the subject of the Armenian genocide.
It is the responsibility of the European Parliament to point out to a modern Turkish State that professes to be on the road to democracy that it has a duty to remember.
Â Â  .By formally opening accession negotiations with Turkey, the European Heads of State or Government will be taking a decision for which they will have to be answerable to the people and to history.
The authorities of my country are, however, in possession of a clear mandate from the people they are supposed to represent: on 29 May 2005, the people of France rejected the European Constitution and the project of enlargement to include Turkey.
Today, the representatives of the UMP party in this Parliament are worried about the dangers of an âautisticâ Europe and of the danger of a divorce between the people and the European project.
What a revelation!
Do they recall that they regularly voted in favour of the pre-accession credits for Turkey?
Do they recall that, within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, they sit alongside the AKP, the Islamic party led by MrÂ Erdogan?
Are they only aware that the person who holds the key to this affair is the most senior among them, MrÂ Chirac?
This collective lie, which says that Turkey must enter the Union, is disgraceful, since each of them, in silence, is hoping that the other one will say ânoâ and take responsibility for the breakdown.
That is why, on behalf of the people of France, we solemnly address the President of the Republic and call on him to veto the opening of these negotiations.
Â Â  . Although the Commission and the Council consider that Turkey has formally met the final conditions for accession talks to open on 3Â October 2005, the truth is that there are key questions that were not taken into account, as Parliamentâs resolution mentions.
One of the most important issues centres on the protocol extending the Ankara agreement to the ten new Member States.
Turkey signed the protocol but at the same time issued a statement saying that the signature, ratification and implementation of the protocol does not represent recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, referred to in the protocol, in any way, shape or form.
We object to this unacceptable position.
We also object to Turkeyâs continued ban on vessels flying the Cypriot flag and vessels from ports in the Republic of Cyprus from entering Turkish ports, and to the ban on Cypriot aircraft from flying over Turkish airspace and landing in Turkish airports.
We abstained from the vote on the resolution, due to our objections to some of the points therein.
For example, it advocates constitutional reform as a condition for the accession of other new Member States; we believe that this is not an obstacle to enlargement.
Â Â  If a country in the immediate vicinity of Europe complies with the EUâs political and economic requirements, there should in principle be no obstacles to membership.
The EU is not a cultural or religious block, but a form of cooperation in which the Member States have to guarantee democracy, human rights and a functioning market economy.
Turkish membership cannot therefore be dismissed on religious or geographical grounds.
The June List therefore believes that Turkey should in the long run be able to become a member of the EU.
However, the EU has not been reformed sufficiently to enable it to receive Turkey as a member. That especially applies in the cases of agricultural policy and the Structural Funds.
Nor has Turkey done enough to comply with the EUâs political requirements.
Quite a few requirements concerning respect for human rights have not been implemented.
The Armenian genocide of 1915 has not been recognised, and nor has Cyprusâs sovereignty.
Moreover, the financial consequences for the EU of Turkish accession are still uncertain.
Finally, the draft Constitutional Treaty has now been rejected, so no one knows how the EU is to be governed in the future.
That is another important reason for delaying membership negotiations.
In view of these factors, we believe that membership negotiations should not be embarked on as matters stand.
We are therefore voting against the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  . Many now see the Cyprus issue as the most controversial.
Indeed, by signing the protocol on customs union on 29 July 2005, Turkey has needlessly put everyone on edge.
This was, to some degree, to be expected.
That its signing would be tantamount to the recognition of Cyprus is mainly, and only, based on declarations made by European Heads of Government and has never been corroborated by Turkey.
What is more, on returning to Ankara â following the negotiations in December 2004 under the Dutch Presidency â Mr Erdogan made it known at once that the signing would certainly not amount to recognition of Cyprus, whether explicit or implicit.
With regard to the Cyprus issue, I take the view that the Council should make every effort to bring about the unification of Cyprus.
For this, we need to take the Turkish Cypriot community out of its economic isolation as soon as possible.
As expressed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, Turkey must, of course, embark on full implementation of the customs union without delay, thereby, among other things, opening up its ports to Cypriot ships.
Parallel to this, though (and hence with the same timescale), the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community must end, and so paragraph 7, appealing though it is, is too non-committal.
Â Â  .On many occasions, we have stressed the fact that Turkey is not a European country, whether by virtue of its geography, its history, its culture, its language or its religion.
Faced with such evidence that is borne out by the Treaties, one cannot but conclude that the leaders of Europe are blind.
Only the people of Europe, instilled with the common sense absent in their leaders, have understood for a long time that Turkeyâs joining Europe would mean an end to the European adventure and, above all, would entail the rapid spread of Islam in European society.
The Turkish people, who are themselves being provocative, refuse to recognise the Republic of Cyprus on the grounds that they occupy part of it. They do so in defiance of international law.
This is without mentioning the Armenian genocide of 1915.
The duty to remember, which our great Western consciences hold so dear, has not reached as far as them.
In their new penal code, making reference to this very Armenian genocide or to the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus is punishable by imprisonment.
In these conditions, and without even mentioning the tragic fate of the Christian minorities, it is obscene to open accession negotiations on 3 October with a large country in Asia Minor.
Â Â  .On Wednesday 28 September, in the debate on Turkey, the speeches and the clapometer were unequivocal.
It was a ânoâ from all sides.
The speakers spoke of âArmeniaâ, âthe violation of human rightsâ, âthe light years separating two civilisationsâ, âthe occupation in Cyprus of part of European territory by a foreign army âŠâ Even MrÂ Toubon, the French MEP and great devotee of PresidentÂ Chirac, had his say in opposing matters.
We heard a British MEP propose to the people of Turkey that they accept the status of a privileged partner, which is such an attractive prospect that he is demanding it for the United Kingdom.
However much MrÂ Cohn-Bendit shouted âracismâ, MrÂ Rocard pleaded for Turkeyâs accession amid disapproving silence.
In this House, the representatives of the people of Europeâs nations are repeating the ânoâ uttered by Cervantes at Lepanto, by Lord Byron at Missolonghi, by the Greek children of the Catacombs who used to practice their religion in fear, by the paintings and poems of, respectively, Delacroix and VictorÂ Hugo on the empire of massacres and kidnappings, and by the martyrs of âMidnight Expressâ.
Â Â  . A week before the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey on EU membership, there is little cause for optimism.
Its development towards being a normal country in which all ethnic groups, all political opinions and all religious faiths are considered equal is stagnating.
Last week, a court banned a conference on the mass murder of the Armenian people in 1915, which had been denied for many years.
The large Kurdish community in the South-East still has no prospects of education, administration and media in their own language, of normal representation in the national parliament or of regional self-government.
Prominent forces in Turkey reject further concessions to European wishes and even hold out the threat of Turkeyâs membership application being withdrawn.
Over the last few weeks, interest in the situation in Turkey seems to have shifted to the countryâs relationship with Cyprus.
It is unacceptable that ships from southern Cyprus should still be barred from Turkish ports, while Turkey claims that it has observed all agreements since as long ago as 2004.
This does not augur well for other areas of discussion.
As an EU Member State, Cyprus has the right to veto negotiations and membership.
The disadvantaged groups within Turkey do not have such influence.
That is why this House should especially take their problems and interests to heart.
Â Â  . â Î€he joint motion for a resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey demonstrates that this procedure relates to the more general interests of and in-fighting and competition between the imperialist powers in the area.
From this point of view, the pressures and coercion on the peoples in the area will intensify for them to accept solutions which are at their own expense.
This motion for a resolution comes within the more general philosophy of the European Council's so-called counter-declaration.
Despite the fact that it contains some positive points, it does not clearly state the obvious, by which I mean a clear declaration that, unless there is immediate recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, negotiations for Turkey's accession to the EU will not start.
The Communist Party of Greece is against the accession for the same reasons as it was against the accession of Greece.
We consider that the very policy and the character of the EU do not offer any guarantee, however many resolutions are passed on a fair solution to the Cyprus question.
This is also being proven now.
The supposed principles of the EU and the famous are being used in keeping with the interests of the imperialist countries.
Â Â  . This compromise resolution deals with the TurkeyâCyprus issue satisfactorily and reasonably clearly.
I should have liked to see clearer statements regarding democracy und human rights in Turkey.
According to Amnesty International, torture in Turkey continues to assume proportions similarly serious to before; it just takes a different form.
The case of Mehmet Tarhan was a recent example of how conscientious objectors are punished with years of imprisonment.
There are renewed conflicts in the Kurdish regions, police and military forces are omnipresent, and state and non-state actors commit human-rights violations.
Freedom of the press is continually violated: for example, anyone publishing material that takes a critical line on the genocide of Armenians or the continuing Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus still faces imprisonment.
As far as the EU Heads of State or Government are concerned, a key motivation for this accession is geopolitics.
A Commission working document drawn up to render Turkeyâs accession to the EU plausible states: âTurkey is a strategically important country (...) Turkeyâs accession would help to secure better energy supply routes for the EU.â
It continues: âWith its large military expenditure and manpower, Turkey has the capacity to contribute significantly to EU security and defenceâ.
I, too, wish to see Turkeyâs accession to the EU; just not like this.
The EU Heads of State or Government and the European Commission evidently care little about the real-life situation of the people.
Â Â  . The key precondition for giving my consent to the joint draft resolution of the European Parliament on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, drawn up further to the resolution of 15 December 2004 and the conclusions of the European Council of 17 December 2004, would be approval of the motions in favour of amending and supplementing, Nos 2 and 3.
Should these amendment motions not be approved, I will vote against the resolution.
I have the following reasons for this decision.
I believe that Turkey has failed to meet the Copenhagen criteria for opening accession negotiations with the EU in view of its persistent problems with human rights, its failure to tackle the problems of the Kurdish minority and, most importantly, its refusal to grant legal and political recognition to an EU Member State â Cyprus.
Without the unanimous consent of all Member States, it is not possible to grant the mandate for launching accession negotiations with Turkey.
Â Â  . The negotiating process towards Turkeyâs accession to the EU should proceed in the usual way and should observe clear and objective rules.
To my mind, there is no possible justification for treating this application for membership any differently.
On that basis, I had no option but to vote against the joint motion for a resolution before us, on account of two points that I believe are of crucial importance.
Firstly, by rejecting the amendment tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats clearly stating that ââŠmost importantlyâŠ, from the outset, the negotiations must be conducted with an open mind, and ways forward other than full accession should be consideredâ, Parliament clearly refuses to incorporate a Plan B into its resolution, which I feel is essential if we are to avoid the possibility, at some point in the future, of the opening of the negotiation process being taken as full commitment to accession.
It is, moreover, abundantly clear that the Cyprus issue has not been properly resolved.
Turkey is seeking to join the EU but does not accept the Union in its current form.
Let us face facts: you cannot join an organisation that you do not recognise, just as you cannot negotiate with a party that does not recognise your organisation.
These negotiations are starting off on the wrong foot and consequently do not have my backing.
Â Â  . On 23Â September 2005, the Turkish Court of Justice banned a conference on the Armenian genocide from being held.
This ban unfortunately makes it clear that the Turkish Government authorities continue to keep this debate shrouded in complete obscurity and entirely outside the law.
The power of the present and, more specifically, that of the past thus force us to reaffirm the fact that the people of Europe will not overlook this issue.
Therefore, I must, I am afraid, reiterate the speech I made on 6 October 1999, since there has been no change whatsoever in the situation.
The resolution of the European Parliament of 18 June 1987 emphasised four points comprising major obstacles to the accession negotiations with Turkey. They related to:
1/ the refusal of the Turkish Government to recognise the Armenian genocide
2/ its reluctance to comply with international law in its differences of opinion with Greece
3/ the ongoing presence of Turkish occupying troops in Cyprus
4/ the denial of the Kurdish issue.
The Armenian issue cannot be sunk into oblivion as these negotiations become part of history.
I stand firm in refusing to accept that.
The European Union is strong enough to impose upon Turkey a significant change of attitude, if the latter wants to join our Union and respect our rules and values.
Â Â  . Even as we speak, a battle is being fought out in Turkey between reformists and traditionalists.
The current Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister belong to the former group and deserve all our support.
The debate about the opening of the negotiations has recently been fed by political opportunism, many, as my group chairman, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, has said, riding on a wave of latent racism.
It would be unfair to be stricter at present than the Heads of Government had agreed in December and it would also send the Turkish people the discouraging message that Europe does not actually want Turkey.
Those who make negotiations conditional upon the recognition of Cyprus overlook the fact that a swift recognition of Cyprus by Turkey would spell the end of Kofi Annanâs attempts to set up a fresh round of negotiations about the islandâs division.
The EU must support the reformers, demand the correct implementation of the customs union and insist on the penal code being honed down further.
The opening of the negotiations will send Turkey further into the direction of a secular state where people, along with international law, are respected in full and in practice.
Religious minorities, Kurds and Alavites will be better off in a Turkey that forms part of the EU than in a Turkey that turns its back on our continent.
Â Â  . The motion on the opening of negotiations with Turkey is to be welcomed.
However, I hope that in these negotiations religious freedom will be highlighted.
The right for someone to freely express their religious belief is essential in any democratic society.
The First Step Forum, an NGO committed to religious freedom, will be visiting Turkey in the next few weeks.
I hope that the Commission will listen to the outcomes of the delegation's visit.
Â Â  .On the subject of the assessment made of Turkeyâs transition to a democratic country, the country still has some way to go, in spite of the efforts made.
The Turkish Governmentâs recognition of Cyprus and the Armenian genocide remain preliminary conditions for the negotiations to continue after 3 October.
The EU will also have to remain particularly vigilant as regards the human rights situation.
The condition of women in the country remains of concern, and the Turkish Government must make a greater commitment to reducing the inequalities between men and women.
Freedom of expression has still not been acquired.
The EU must endeavour to put pressure on Ankara so as to ensure that the conditions are met for a viable public and democratic debate.
Since this is an open process, whose results cannot be guaranteed in advance, and given that each and every one of the 25 Member States will benefit from the right of veto at any time during the negotiations, it would consequently be advisable to make provision for an alternative to membership, by defining, as from now, the conditions of a privileged partnership.
That is why I voted against this resolution, refusing to accept this fast track to Turkeyâs accession.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of this report and would like to join with those who have complimented my colleague, MrÂ Radwan, on the excellent work he has done with members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this important subject of banksâ regulatory own funds requirements, with the aim of taking account of recent developments on the financial markets.
It had become necessary to ascertain the coherence between economic capital and regulatory capital within a framework of international convergence of the measurement of these financial data (Basel II).
Nevertheless, I pose the question as to whether the time has not come for the financial community of the credit institutions, under the auspices of the ECB and in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States responsible for banking supervision, to examine which resources should be implemented in order to accelerate the creation of the money supply that is necessary for Europeâs economic development, especially within the euro zone.
It is a matter of going beyond the practical, monetary and financial success the euro has enjoyed and transforming it from a technical currency into a political currency that serves Europeâs economic development.
Â Â  . The banking system is one of the key pillars of our market economy, and it is the duty of the public authorities to ensure that its functioning observes clear rules, is transparent and safeguards the customersâ interests.
In a market that, naturally, cannot be completely assessed by the consumers, it is therefore the public authoritiesâ responsibility to provide these much-needed guarantees.
In this context, the capital requirements laid down in the proposal for a directive before us, and the version adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, are entirely in keeping with what I feel are the duties and the appropriate concerns of the public authorities.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  Where this report was concerned, I voted against, or abstained from voting on, quite a few parts to do with Parliamentâs competence.
The report contained quite unnecessary references to the Constitution, which is now defunct.
I believe that a certain freedom to pursue oneâs own financial policy is important, especially so as to be able, in sparsely populated districts, to contribute to credit guarantee associations capable of bringing about cooperation at local level.
I abstained in those cases where perfectly sensible demands were being made in terms of Parliamentâs working conditions but where unnecessary references to the Constitution had been slipped in.
Â Â  . This report is an essential element of the financial services industry, bringing together internationally agreed banking rules.
The Labour Group has supported the work undertaken by the rapporteur and services of Parliament to ensure that the European Parliament maintains its legal/political powers.
To this effect, the EPLP can support the measures introduced to enable the right of call-back and sunset clauses contained within this directive, which is not an imposition on national powers.
Â Â  .After having voted in favour of this text, I would like to join with those who have congratulated my colleague, MrÂ Doorn, on the excellent work he has carried out with the Committee on Legal Affairs.
In order to supplement the confidence required in businesses and in their systems of governance, it was very important to provide the European Union with rules on the subject, drawing inspiration from the international standards derived from global best practice.
The aspects connected to the independence of auditors have a crucial bearing on the quality of the controls.
In particular, it was becoming a matter of urgency to define the concept of ânetworkâ.
Finally, I will be very attentive and request that the issue of the liability of auditors be looked at, as it is unthinkable that they might have unlimited liability and, therefore, be uninsurable as regards the work they carry out.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which if passed into legislation and properly enforced should prevent an Enron type scandal taking place in Europe and reduce the likelihood in Europe of future Parlamat type situations.
Â Â  . Annual accounts and consolidated accounts must be subject to efficient and thorough auditing.
This objective was expressed clearly by the Commission in the proposal it submitted to Parliament, which has been improved substantially by some of the amendments introduced by this report.
I therefore voted in favour.
It has come to light that the rules currently in force in this area do not guarantee the key factors in this extremely important task, namely, market transparency and freedom and independence for those carrying out audits, by which I mean properly carrying out audits.
This is hardly healthy for the economy.
In the absence of such factors, action must be taken to rectify the legal framework relating to the proposals concerned.
As I said, I believe that the Commissionâs proposal, along with the amendments tabled by this Chamber, will enable this objective to be met.
Â Â  Europe needs its railways, mainly for environmental reasons but also for the transport of freight and passengers.
That requires railway markets to be opened up between countries so that trains can travel quickly and smoothly across borders.
The markets for the transport of freight by rail are now being opened up in accordance with the second railway package, and that is something of which we approve.
MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs report now proposes that passenger services too, both international and national, be opened up, with a particular timetable being followed.
We believe that it will be possible for international passenger services to be opened up within a few yearsâ time.
When, however, it comes to national passenger services, we believe that the process needs to take place over a longer period than that proposed.
We are not, therefore, at present prepared to vote in favour of MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs proposal regarding the deregulation of national passenger services because we cannot foresee the consequences of his proposal where, for example, local and regional public transport is concerned.
Â Â  . Along with the other Portuguese Socialists, I welcome the general thrust of the Jarzembowski report, as we are in favour of the principle of opening up the international passenger services market.
In the debate, however, we have expressed some reservations and objections to the plan to bring forward the liberalisation of international transport, including cabotage, to 2008, and the plan to liberalise national transport services from 1Â January 2012.
It is true that the liberalisation of international transport has the potential to help revitalise rail transport, by fostering its growth and putting it on a more equal footing with air and road transport.
It is also true, however, that if services are liberalised in unchecked, haphazard fashion at European level, this could lead to serious problems for some Member States such as Portugal, where specialised infrastructure, such as high-speed rail links and the management models thereof, has yet to be put in place.
Furthermore, the provision of public service in the area of transport, which is a key factor in employment and economic growth, remains to be guaranteed.
We therefore voted against all of the provisions on the above-mentioned forms of liberalisation, and this was reflected in our final vote.
Â Â  . A glance through the demands set by the European Employersâ Confederation (UNICE) on the liberalisation of passenger rail transport (press release, 21Â JanuaryÂ 2005) reveals the reason behind the position that has been taken by the majority in this Chamber.
Despite welcoming the Commissionâs proposals on the new wave of rail transport liberalisation, UNICE is calling for more, and faster.
It is calling for the âopening up of the marketsâ throughout the passenger rail transport sector, and not only international transport, as the Commissionâs proposal had envisaged for this stage.
UNICE also highlighted the position previously adopted by the majority in Parliament to open up passenger rail transport as early as 2008.
Yet again, the majority in Parliament (and that includes the votes of MEPs from Portugalâs Social Democrats, Peopleâs Party and Socialist Party) is pandering to the demands of Europeâs captains of industry, by approving the liberalisation of international passenger transport in 2008, and national passenger transport in 2012.
What is more, Member States can even bring these dates forward.
Accordingly, we are extremely disappointed that our proposal to block this fresh step in the liberalisation of rail transport was rejected, and will continue to strive to defend public rail transport services and the working conditions of employees in the sector.
Â Â  .I shall be voting against the report by MrÂ Jarzembowski, which establishes a new stage of deregulation for rail transport.
The âopening upâ of the freight market was already a threat for the public rail services but the shift to opening up passenger services is unacceptable and fraught with consequences for the users and for planning and development in Europe.
On the grounds of ensuring an improvement in the organisation of international traffic, the Commission and the report are opening up to competition the most profitable railway lines in each country, thus depriving the public services within the Member States of resources that are essential for tariff averaging and for regional development in relation, for example, to less profitable routes.
While in a large number of countries in the European Union, the passenger routes are operated well, this decision will make their future less certain and reduce the governmentsâ investment capacities.
Â Â  . Whilst savings continue to be made and both regional railway services and international railway connections continue to be cut, politicians of every hue insist that more passengers and more freight should be transported by rail.
The recipe for that is freight traffic on the roads and competing low-cost airlines in aviation.
They separate the management from the rails and the implementation from the provision of services, and hope that private companies will bring lower prices, provide a customer-friendly service and attract more customers.
I think that that approach will ultimately fall short of expectations.
Their only interest will be in reducing costs by closing down lines, thinning services, increasing charges and discouraging the many loss-making customers.
The Savary and Sterckx reports offer insufficient compensation for Mr Jarzembowskiâs liberalisation plans.
The Savary report is desperately needed to drive back the technical problems involving cross-border trains, such problems having occurred since electrification.
The Sterckx report thrusts aside the possibility of forcing railway companies into making cross-border services more accessible and maintaining them.
The only people who are left better off are those with disabilities.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the outstanding Jarzembowsi report, because I feel that, by promoting competition and the creation of a genuine internal market for rail transport, it constitutes a positive step towards revitalising rail transport.
It is essential that the downward trend in rail transportâs market share be reversed, and we must be resolute in our efforts to achieve this, by building an open, competition-based market.
As regards the Commissionâs proposal to allow rail companies access to the infrastructure of all Member States for the purpose of operating international passenger transport services by 2010 at the latest, the rapporteur includes national services in the opening up of the market, so as to offset the inevitable reduction in the cost-effectiveness of international services and the enormous barrier that this presents to entering the market.
Moreover, within the context of opening up the networks to passenger rail transport, our proposal is to give the Member States the right to restrict the opening up of the market in certain cases in order to maintain the economic viability of a rail service of public interest.
I feel that the main gaps in the Commissionâs proposal have been plugged and wish to restate my positive opinion and vote on this report.
Â Â  . We all are faced with the challenge of rational energy usage.
Even with the best will in the world people going and coming from Ireland will have to rely primarily on air transport.
However, development of rail transport within Ireland is vital to reduce road traffic and internal air traffic and consequent fuel use.
Our capital city, Dublin sits on the East coast, yet virtually all trains begin and end in Dublin.
I live in the south west of Ireland.
If I want to travel north by train I must travel east to Dublin, then west to my destination.
Ireland urgently needs a Western Corridor rail line to link the towns and cities along the west coast.
Until this is done we needn't bother asking people to leave their cars at home.
The other area of growth in rail transport is commuter transport.
We are building satellite towns with new roads linking them to the city.
Why are rail lines not being laid at the same time along these roads?
This would seem to be the most cost effective approach.
Where commuter lines exist people use them.
Even if priced competitively, these commuter lines whether public or private would be profitable.
Â Â  . I voted against this proposal that European Member States should be obliged to open up all railway networks to private companies by 2012.
First of all, what we need is an extensive evaluation of the different Member Statesâ past experiences of railway liberalisation.
Both the Commission proposal and the Jarzembowski report are premature and lack a solid basis.
The proposed directive fails to provide binding agreements in relation to the quality of services, security or environmental requirements.
In addition, the same form of liberalisation of the rail network is imposed on all EU countries, which differ widely in terms of the position from which they would start and of the way in which their railways are used.
This makes it necessary to list the forms of rail liberalisation that have worked in the past and those that have not.
There is also the issue of whether Europe can indeed add value to the way in which Member States can, in future, make their national railways more efficient, more customer-friendly and more environmentally-friendly.
It may be the case that, once the situation in the different Member States has been assessed, we will have no choice but to admit that this subject should ideally be tackled at national level after all, because each situation is unique.
For the time being, I refuse to endorse the wild liberalisation plans that are now before us.
Â Â  . â An attempt is being made with the 'third railway package' to deal a final blow to rail transport in order to increase the profits of big business.
Speeding up the liberalisation of the market in both international and national railway services and the full liberalisation of all passenger services will, on the one hand, increase the profits of the monopolies and, on the other hand, will deal a heavy blow to workers' rights, will increase ticket prices and freight costs and will lower safety standards, as has been the case wherever privatisation has been applied.
In order to secure the workers' consent and make it easier to sell off the wealth of the grass roots to the monopolies, the proposal is embellished with provisions about possible compensation for passengers in the event of poor services.
The question is how, starting from the 'fillet', private companies will exploit the workers, the travelling public and the areas in question by bringing a basic lever of transport under their absolute control.
In the name of competitiveness, more public investment is being called for in infrastructure which will be operated by big business.
The workers will fight to overturn the anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU, for radical change and for a policy under which rail transport will be social property and will add to grass-roots prosperity.
Â Â  The June List is opposed to the Commissionâs proposal to create common rules for train drivers and crews.
Cooperation must be based on trust and intergovernmental agreements.
We are therefore abstaining from voting on all the amendments and should ideally have liked there to have been the opportunity also to vote against the Commissionâs original document.
Â Â  .This September 2005 we are voting on a ârailway packageâ.
However, for rail workers, passengers, public service and the train stations in our small rural towns, this is not a âgift packageâ.
It is all very well to worry about an international certificate for train drivers, to talk about competition between road and rail and to want European passengersâ rights.
In France, however, the TGV will reach Nice only in 2020, two years after a permanent space station has been built on the moon.
Train stations are closing or are falling into disrepair like in Sainte-Gabelle, not far from Toulouse, while the Paris-Bordeaux-Pau-Madrid line, together with the Paris-Montpellier-Perpignan-Barcelona line, still do not exist.
Thousands of kilometres of rail tracks are no longer maintained, forcing the TERs to travel at 80 km/h instead of at 120 km/h. In Tarascon sur AriÃšge, the train station only opens at 3.00 p.m. for one train â the Tour de Carol-Toulouse â that departs at 2.50Â p.m. âŠ
Thus, when Europeâs rail system is deteriorating to the standard of UK railways, what is urgently needed is a massive rail plan in order to link up finally, in the next decade, the 25 European capitals with high-speed rail lines.
Â Â  . I voted for the Savary Report as a London MEP having had discussion with rail Trade Unionists as the report creates a system of certificates for train crews to show they meet professional, medial and linguistic standards for those train drivers working across borders.
With sufficient training such an advance would protect passengers in health and safety terms on rail journeys across EU countries.
Â Â  . The purpose of the Savary report is to clarify and simplify the Commissionâs proposal establishing harmonised European conditions for the certification of train drivers with a view to the opening-up of the rail transport of goods and passengers.
This proposal for a directive provides for a two-tier certification system for all train drivers and staff involved in driving trains throughout the European rail network.
The mutual recognition of train driversâ training is essential if we are to promote the free movement of workers, given that by establishing common standards we will facilitate the situation and help towards making these workers more employable.
Accordingly, I voted in favour of the Savary report.
Â Â  There exists an intergovernmental organisation for international rail traffic (OTIF) that has already agreed on travellersâ rights.
There is a charter, signed by the European railway undertakings, involving quality standards for passenger transport by rail.
We do not believe that the EU should go in and regulate this area.
If regulation is needed in this area, it needs to be brought about through the national authorities in the countries concerned.
To vote, as matters stand, in favour of a regulation on minimum compensation for delays to passengers would be a big step to take.
It might mean increased costs, which the service providers would have to pass on to their passengers, a factor that might further hit this industry hard at a time when it is under pressure from low-cost flights and coach travel.
We therefore believe that, in this situation, the European Parliamentâs report does not propose anything of benefit to passengers in the longer term.
We are therefore voting against Parliamentâs suggested changes to the Commissionâs proposal.
We also wish to reject the proposal itself.
Â Â  . This report is part of a broader package of measures which seek to improve rail and freight transport across Europe.
International rail travel within Europe is growing in importance as an environmentally-sound alternative to air travel.
I therefore welcome this report as a means to provide clarity and workability for business whilst protecting the interests of the millions of people across Europe who depend on rail travel both for work and leisure.
This report needs to be seen in the context of the wider package however: Over the coming months we must work to ensure that these new laws strike an overall balance between the needs of rail users and the interests of the service providers.
Â Â  . I am voting for the Sterckx Report because I believe that, as a London MEP and representing one of the biggest transport hubs anywhere in the world, that passengers' rights and obligations have not been clearly set out.
I believe that passengers' rights should not only apply to international rail passengers, but also to national ones.
I believe that the minimum compensation guidelines set out by the Committee for unacceptable delays are broadly correct.
I believe strongly that passengers who hold season tickets and encounter repeated delays or cancellations should receive compensation in the form of free journeys, price reductions or an extension of the period of validity of a season ticket.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Sterckx report.
The proposal for a regulation on international rail passengersâ rights and obligations proposes minimum standards for providing information to passengers before and during the journey, and rules to be followed in the event of delays, for dealing with complaints and on how to deal with people with reduced mobility.
I feel that the establishment of these rules clearly stems from the need to establish rules without jeopardising the quality of transport for passengers.
The text on which we are voting today seeks to improve the coherence and the readability of the text and to simplify some of the wording and definitions.
In our view, the crux of the proposal lies in the implementation of this framework of passengersâ rights and obligations at both national and international level.
A further reason why I voted for this report was that it does not propose excessively detailed regulation.
Instead, it leaves room for businesses to make commercial decisions and encourages them to come up with new ways of making rail transport more attractive to passengers.
Â Â  . Passenger rights are essential no matter which mode of transport is used.
The rights of rail passengers to compensation is a step forward and I welcome the Sterckx report.
However, in light of recent air passenger rights legislation and its application, there is a need to be clear what rights passengers have and the compensation which they are entitled to.
It is no use introducing legislation which is then not properly implemented.
If we are going to be true to our constituents we require well implemented rules.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that it was right for us to liberalise freight transport by means of the second railway package.
Yet it would now be an additional burden on, and indeed an intervention in, free-market regulatory mechanisms if we were to introduce provisions such as those the Commission has just proposed.
Either we release the railway undertakings onto the free market or we regulate them: we have to decide.
For this reason, it would also be sensible to refer the whole report back to the Committee.
Â Â  We believe that no EU framework is needed for compensation in the event of delays to freight transported by rail.
We thus support the Committee on Transport and Tourismâs position and are voting against the Commissionâs proposal.
The intention behind the Commissionâs proposal is to encourage the railway undertakings to achieve an improved quality of freight transport and thus to strengthen customer demand.
We question whether the proposed regulations are desirable and whether they will have the intended effect.
Â Â  .The 25th anniversary of Solidarity must be, as far as we are concerned, the opportunity to remember that half of Europe, surrendered to Stalinâs USSR, endured the terror of Communism for nearly 50 years.
We must not only celebrate the courage and the memory of the workers of Gdansk and the role played by their strike in the fall of the Iron Curtain.
