In Lapland, in northernmost Europe, repairs of particular makes of car can only be obtained in the county government seat of Rovaniemi.
At the service station in medium-sized Muonio, five makes could be serviced on 1 October 2002.
Now, no such services can be provided.
What does the Commission intend to do about this matter?
Where Microsoft is concerned, we heard yesterday that the Commission is close to reaching a decision on Microsoft, Media Player and the abuse of a dominant position.
We again call upon the Commission to finish its investigation as quickly as possible and to take decisions that guarantee a genuine market and freedom of choice for consumers.
As emerged from the parliamentary question to Commissioner Monti in December 2002, we expect you to look seriously at this issue so that all new businesses are given a genuine opportunity to operate and so that certain standards do not become standards that reduce competition and the free flow of information.
Intellectual property rights, together with the monopoly and the standards that sometimes come about mean that much of the right to competition is rendered ineffective.
That too is something I hope you will look at, so that there is no repeat of the situation we experienced in my own country when the Market Court had to find Gramex (the Copyright Society of Performing Artists and Phonogram Producers) guilty of abusing its dominant position.
When shall we see a decision concerning Microsoft?
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to speak on just one point â State aid for services of general interest.
I am addressing you in particular, Commissioner.
Through the Resolution of 14 January, Parliament has just confirmed its desire to legislate in this field.
In our view, the Commission therefore urgently needs to say, âyes, we are going to prepare a legal act under the codecision procedureâ.
The aim is to increase the scope of public authorities to choose and to act, in particular local and regional authorities, and to ensure that the rules of the internal market and of competition are compatible with the inalienable rights in terms of services of general interest.
With this in mind, we wish to establish common principles, criteria for specifying exemptions and derogations on competition rules and funding.
We now have codecision power, with Article 95, interpreted in the light of Article 16 of the Charter.
The draft constitutional treaty also aims to strengthen that power.
I would like to point out that the Commission should implement the rules ex post, but certainly not decide on them itself ex ante.
That is the job of the Treaty, the Court of Justice and the legislator.
We are concerned about abuse of power by the Commission, in the name of its competence over competition, and we think that it has a degree of legal confusion, particularly as regards funding.
First of all, it is not up to you to say whether or not funding is legitimate and in particular what is aid and what is not.
It is only after the rule has been made that you should ensure compatibility with competition.
There is therefore necessarily an area of possible conflict between the legislator and you.
That is why, after the Altmark judgment, we ourselves wish to clarify under what conditions financial compensation under public service obligations is not covered by the rules on State aid.
You wish to interpret Altmark yourselves through a communication, and we wish to do it through a legislative act.
Secondly, the Commission, having been authorised by the Council, may decide to implement a rule of exemption from notification with regard to State aid.
In fact, services of general interest have an increasingly economic dimension.
However, our resolution rejects your use of ArticleÂ 86(3) to decide everything yourselves, claiming an urgency that has been denied for many years.
We are therefore asking you to establish a provisional derogation so that the codecision procedure can ultimately clarify the general conditions for validation.
Thirdly, taking into account the disputes that there already are against your services and the bodies responsible for services of general interest, we have grounds to ask you to respect our resolution that services such as health, social housing and even social services should be excluded from the scope of application of competition rules and only come under the control of the Commission in the event of abuse of discretionary powers.
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we wish the future codecision act to establish a right to own production, so that the threat of intrusion from the Commission will not always be brandished under cover of the argument of distortion of competition.
Â Â  Mr President, I will concentrate on the electricity market and competition policies in that market.
On paper on 3 July 2004 we will create 25-country electricity markets.
In reality, the market is becoming an oligopoly.
Germany and France and their companies EdF, Eon and RWE presently control 40% of the electricity production in Europe and 50% of all the grid and the balancing capacities.
So, Commissioner, you are asking for national competition authorities to able to act and to create competition in the national market.
The Eon-Ruhrgas merger and the decision by the German Government show us that the German Government has the option of having national championship-building and is not playing the game of establishing a competitive market in Germany.
Their idea, and this is also the idea of the French Government, is that their three companies will dominate the European market.
These two countries have also been successful in blocking ownership unbundling, and thus the complete separation of interest between production and grid, which is necessary if you do not want these companies to control new entrants and you want more competition in the market.
These two countries have also been able to block access to decommissioning funds, and thus these three companies buy up the other companies.
My analysis, as Parliament's rapporteur on the electricity market, is that today in the European Union we do not have the relevant instruments to cope.
The only country to be really successful in establishing a competitive market is the UK, because when the British opened the market they had a tough divestment policy.
France and Germany will not touch divestment policy.
We thus need an instrument to impose on them, at European level, the divestment of their two big companies.
Otherwise there is no hope at all for competition in the market, for lower prices, or for innovation
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to make a general point.
I address myself to you, President Cox: this is the first time in 25 years that the European Parliament has not been able to discuss the annual report on competition policy which, concerning an area that is increasingly more central to European politics â one only need flick through the daily newspapers â is one of the most important documents published by the Commission.
In recent years, the debate in the European Parliament on the annual report has always been the most important â if not the sole â occasion for the democratic scrutiny of competition policy which, although having an increasing impact on the life of European companies and citizens, is one of the areas where Parliamentâs role is merely consultative.
Mr President, we have repeatedly called â as we did during the work of the Convention, on behalf of the European Parliament â for codecision in relation to competition policy.
We have not been able, for the first time in 25 years, to secure a debate on the European Commissionâs annual report.
This conjuring trickÂ âÂ because that is what it isÂ âÂ which meant that we did not hold an open and timely debate in the European Parliament on the general outlines of the Commissionâs competition policy, has led us to today holdÂ âÂ thanks to the availability of Commissioner MontiÂ âÂ a debate in a vain attempt to replace the one that we should have had.
I believe that the Conference of Presidents has a grave responsibility; there has been a misunderstanding about the fact that this report â who knows how â as of this year should no longer be considered an obligatory report, but rather an own-initiative report.
The Conference of Presidents did not want to remedy the situation which had been created and today we therefore find ourselves with half a debate, with a Parliament split down the middle on competition policy.
This is, in my opinion, a very serious situation that must be noted and criticised as a disgrace in this Chamber.
Coming now to the subject, Mr President, Commissioner, of this report which in reality brings to the plenary, in a manner of speaking, the report for which I was appointed rapporteur, adopted in committee, I want to make three points: first of all this report welcomes the commitment with which Commissioner Monti and the Commission have implemented a major programme of legislative and organisational reforms in the Directorate General for Competition.
Last week the Council gave the final go ahead to the new regulation on the control of mergers: as Parliamentâs draftsman on that subject, I must express my regret at the fact that the amendments â which I consider important â suggested by Parliament were not adopted, in particular as regards the automatic transfer to Brussels of some of the most important concentration and merger operations and powers.
Two further points, the first of which concerns national champions.
I agree with what was said a few moments ago by a Member in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: in Europe the process of liberalisation of crucial sectors such as energy is influenced by the policies of national champions.
We have national champions in certain sectors â not just energy, but also telecommunications â which are often also national champions under public ownership, in which the State finds itself playing the dual role of controller and direct acting manager of companies.
In such situations, in my opinion, irrespective of the difficulties involved â we are confronted with the major countries of the European Union, extremely large and powerful companies in Germany, France and also in Italy â the Commission must keep up its guard and, if possible, attempt to obtain more positive results than those achieved so far.
Another point is that of the liberal professions: a key component for the future of the European economy which is increasingly a service economy.
In so many countries the growth of that sector is stifled by the survival of corporate limitations which operate to the disadvantage of consumers and to the advantage of the professions.
Finally, a more general point about competition policy, also in relation to the amendments tabled to the resolution that we are due to vote on tomorrow.
I believe Commissioner Montiâs policy has a sole, crucial, extremely important objective: to guarantee fair competition, to guarantee competition in open markets for all European companies.
It would be an extremely serious mistake and an illusion to think that the choices made by Commissioner Monti must have a direct impact on specific social or employment aims.
The best way to guarantee employment, growth and resources earmarked for social measures is to guarantee economic growth and competitiveness in Europe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, first of all, my compliments on the report by MrÂ DellaÂ Vedova: it is a good one.
I share his objections to the highly unusual procedure that has been followed here for holding in this House a debate on competition policy.
In my opinion, a debate on such an important part of Community law should be carried out through the front rather than the back door.
The Commission has undertaken a substantial revision of competition policy, but unfortunately not all its changes are for the better.
As rapporteur on merger control, I have already stated my opinion that it is wrong to force the Commissionâs powers of investigation under the Regulation on merger control into line with those pursuant to the Regulations on cartels.
Mergers are not punishable in themselves, but the formation of cartels is.
I hope that the Commission will yet consider reversing this decision.
The Commissionâs persistence in shifting from the market dominance test to the âsubstantial lessening of competitionâ (SLC) test, too, against Parliamentâs advice, is most regrettable.
The market also needs clear competition legislation and a reduction in administrative burdens.
Prior impact assessment of new legislation is a very important means to this end.
Looking at the impact that the Regulation on distribution is currently having on the motor vehicle sector in the Netherlands, I can see developments towards the dominance of certain parties, particularly the importers.
Of course, that was surely not the intention, and this is why prior impact assessments are potentially very important.
I am currently working on a report on institutionalised impact assessments for European legislation, and I am assuming that the Commission will also subject competition legislation to an impact assessment in the future.
In view of the imminent enlargement, it is most important for the Commission to examine state aid in the acceding countries and to make it transparent.
I have heard reports that, in certain sectors in the acceding countries â the Czech banking sector, for example â the levels of state aid entered in the State Aid Scoreboard are incorrect and should be adjusted upwards.
I hope that the Commission can shed some light on the course of action it intends to take if it emerges that candidate countries have given it incorrect information on the state aid they have granted.
Finally, MrÂ President, I can tell you that I do not endorse the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The modifications that they propose relate to policy areas that are not covered by the Commissionâs competition policy.
These proposals would result in confusion and legal uncertainty.
Â Â  Mr President, according to the renowned French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi, whose astuteness and common sense we all admire, the EUâs economic government is run by just three people: the secretary of State in charge of fiscal surveillance, the minister responsible for monetary policy and the minister charged with coordinating and boosting support for competition policy.
Fitoussiâs intention here is to stress the current fragility of the structure of economic governance in the EU, while acknowledging the vital role played by competition policy in economic governance.
Executive, legislative and legal powers also fall within the competences of the minister for competition.
Competition in European culture is a means of progress and development and never an ideological end in itself.
It must consequently strengthen and consolidate a market economy that does not abandon its social dimension and always responds to the needs of the consumer.
This policy must therefore involve all EU institutions, especially Parliament, as this is the body that represents all European citizens.
At a historical moment, when the EU faces challenges in terms of social and economic progress, and when it also feels the need to re-shape the institutional framework that governs its workings, Parliament can hopefully take on new competences within the scope of this policy that are not merely consultative.
Competition policy will only be successful, however, if the Commission is able to create equitable conditions, whereby rules can be applied across all Member States.
Progress has been made in this respect during the past year, but this is an area of competence that requires constant work, especially given the difficult economic situation, which makes it opportune for Member States to use state mechanisms and aid in order to safeguard companies and their own citizensâ jobs.
The report tabled by Commissioner Monti is to be welcomed and represents hope for an improvement in competition policy within the EU.
Parliamentâs motion for a resolution, subject to the approval of some amendments that have been tabled, will also constitute an extremely important guiding policy document and provide a sound basis of support for the Commission itself.
Â Â  Mr President, we are at the end of the mandate of the Commission and Parliament and therefore, on this occasion, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Monti on the excellent work he has done throughout the mandate of this Commission.
Competition policy, as has been pointed out, is one of the fundamental policies which the Commission is responsible for.
Its implementation and application is very difficult and subject to many pressures, I would therefore like once again to congratulate Commissioner Monti on his success in implementing this policy.
Nevertheless, there are certain aspects which worry us and which other Members have pointed out.
The first, naturally, is that we must not lower our guard.
The pressure from economic and political interests to sidestep market rules is logical, and we must always balance, for the benefit of citizens and consumers, the free exercise of market mechanisms in order to ensure an efficient market with a correct allocation of resources.
It is therefore obvious that we must counteract these pressures, since it is logical, and we economists know it, that the tendency of any company is to control the market, if it can be done in an oligopolistic way, all very well, but if it can be monopolistic, even better, and in certain sectors there are still very significant distortions, as has been mentioned here.
The second point that I would obviously like to point out is the Liberal Groupâs traditional position that there should be a section in the Court of Justice to deal with these issues.
The third and final point would be to ensure, both in the Commission and in the other institutions of the European Union, that the operation of the courts responsible for competition, at all levels within the Union, is correct.
If it is rigorous in certain areas but not in others, we are obviously giving comparative assistance which distorts the situation of the markets, and even more so, as has been pointed out, in view of the enlargement which will take place in a few monthsâ time.
Having made these observations, which I would like to leave as suggestions for application in the future, I would like to repeat that we in the Liberal Group are in agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Della Vedova, and we congratulate Commissioner Monti on his wonderful work.
Â Â  â Mr President, while you are congratulating yourself on your competition policy, the workers of Aventis and Sanofi are filled with fear and awaiting redundancies and closures.
They know that these stock mergers always lead to redundancies, in other words human catastrophes for those who make these companies work and often to the death of whole towns.
I condemn a despicable system in which, in secret board meetings, a few individuals can decide the fate of thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of human beings.
The European Parliament never condemns this type of dictatorship, for that is what it is, and this is one of the worst types of dictatorship.
Moreover, in the pharmaceutical sector, we are talking about peopleâs health, and these corporations, which are some of the most profitable, make their profits by plundering social security.
So why should the workers in those companies, the people, not have the right to monitor the decisions, why should they not have the right to force the billions in profits made thanks to the work done by them all to be used for something other than enabling the giants of industry to buy each other out, why should they not have the opportunity to force them to make the choices dictated by collective interests rather than just by those of the shareholders?
What I would like, would be for the workers to be strong enough to put an end to this uncontrolled power exerted by the major financial groups over the life of the economy, and therefore, over life full stop.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank all Members for their support of the Commissionâs competition policy, and even, in some cases, for their generous comments regarding this Commissioner.
I must say not purely as a matter of course but out of full conviction that the dialogue with this Parliament and the support from this Parliament apart from minor disagreements on specific occasions has been, and I am sure will continue to be, a strong driving force for the European Commission in the area of competition.
Several subjects have been touched upon.
I will not be able to address each of them in depth.
However, it seems to me that there is a large consensus on the fact that competition policy is indeed one key component of the social market economy.
By its very nature, it addresses the market component of the social market economy.
However, it is also connected with the social aspect, even though on some occasions this might not appear to be the case.
It cultivates the market dimension of the social market economy and is specifically of benefit to consumers.
The comments from right across the political spectrum, from Mr Karas, Mr Rapkay, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Doorn and others, although with different tones, fit into this general framework.
Of course, imperfections remain in the single market.
I totally agree with Mr Karas.
Competition policy has to try to make the single market single and open and is therefore one of the driving forces of Europeâs competitiveness and economic development.
As MrÂ Rapkay said, competition policy is an instrument, not an end in itself â I totally agree.
It is a rather delicate and sometimes powerful instrument, but it is not an objective in itself.
If it were, it would not be such an interesting instrument to operate.
Mr Rapkay also mentioned the need for the strict monitoring of state aid, but also pointed out that state aid should not act against the need for sustainable development.
Again I agree and, in particular, I would like to point out that some specific guidelines and frameworks in the area of state aid are almost explicitly aimed at sustainable development, for example those aimed at supporting renewable energies, employment creation and research and development.
There have been many speeches about services of general economic interest, particularly from MrÂ Herzog, who as we all know is the rapporteur on this fundamental issue, and from MrÂ Rapkay and Mr Doorn, who particularly highlighted State aid in the new Member States, and from a few others.
With regard to services of general economic interest, we have obviously very closely followed the Herzog report and the European Parliament resolution of 14 January on the Commission Green Paper on services of general interest.
With regard to follow up on the Green Paper, there still needs to be a debate within the Commission on the nature of the proposal to be put forward.
With regard to the funding of services of general economic interest, I would like to respond quickly to Parliamentâs demand that legal security for enterprises be increased.
Soon, following on from the Altmark judgment, I will propose a package to the Commission based mainly on three texts: firstly, a communication from the Commission specifying under what conditions public service compensation could constitute State aid; secondly, a Commission decision applying to small public services and hospitals, to obviate an obligation of notification under certain circumstances; and thirdly, a Community framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation, more for large public services.
I will not go into further detail, because I still have to present these three texts to my fellow-Commissioners.
Mrs Thors mentioned the car block exemption regulation, a subject which was also touched on by MrÂ Doorn.
We are, of course, permanently monitoring the effects of the new block exemption regulation.
Many questions were asked about the impact of the new rules; it is far too early, however, to draw a final conclusion, especially because, as Parliament will recall, the centrepiece of this structural change will only enter into force on 1Â October 2005, when the location clause for dealers is abolished.
In the meantime, we are closely monitoring compliance with the new block exemption regulation by all agents in this complex market.
Initial trends indicate greater price convergence and we believe the process is fully under control.
Mrs Thors referred to the situation in Lapland; we are always interested in learning of any situation that may present particular problems.
Mrs Thors also touched upon an entirely different but not uninteresting specific case: that of Microsoft.
She urged us to reach a prompt conclusion on that matter.
What I can say in this context is that we are indeed nearing an end to this case.
It is fair to say that we have investigated this case thoroughly and carefully.
As you may recall, we sent three statements of objections to Microsoft.
In November 2003 the Commission listened to Microsoft and interested third parties at a hearing in Brussels.
This was the final step in our procedure and it should therefore come as no surprise that the Commission has reached a draft decision.
I cannot, of course, go into any more details on this at present, as the Commission has a duty to keep its investigations confidential.
However, I hope for the moment that this answers the point on Microsoft made by Mrs Thors.
I often talk to Mr Turmes, who has had to leave, about issues of competition in the energy markets, of the importance of which we are all aware.
I would like to respond to his comments referring to the E.ON-Ruhrgas case.
He said that we want to give more power to the national competition authorities.
That is the case in Regulation 1/2003 as it deals with Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.
However, it is not the case with regard to monitoring of mergers.
The case concerned was one of monitoring of mergers.
Mr Della Vedova, thank you for your continued and, if I may say so, particularly competent support; thank you for your opinion.
You know that, on the question of national champions, we shall seek to follow â or, whenever possible, pre-empt â your invitation to keep up our guard.
Indeed, the criticism is sometimes made that the European Commissionâs competition policy does not do enough to encourage national champions.
As regards the liberal professions, a subject we have already discussed in this Parliament, in February I will present to the Commission a report â which will subsequently be published â on the liberal professions in Europe.
That report will indicate the subsequent steps that I felt could be taken.
I agree with Mr Doorn that cartels and mergers are very different phenomena requiring the attention of a competition authority.
We have worked hard on state aid cases concerning the enlargement countries, and will do so even more intensely and directly after 1 May 2004.
I should like to thank Mr Santos very much for his support of our reforms, including in the field of state aid.
Mrs Bordes, sometimes, human catastrophes may happen.
That is your expression.
Speaking in general terms, yes, there are sometimes sacrifices, at least temporary ones, associated with mergers â not always, but often.
We also, however, need to consider how the European economy could gain the impetus to enable it, in an increasingly open global economy, to achieve â and if possible to increase â a degree of competitiveness in order to safeguard and increase employment, if it did not have the possibility of being regenerated and restructured, including through mergers.
It is true that many studies show that mergers have not subsequently fulfilled the promises that those responsible attached to them.
Our monitoring of mergers is â as you know â more limited; the aim of it is to check for the possibility of consequences that could be damaging to the competitive structure of the market and to consumers.
Our role is not to replace the shareholders and others involved in the economic governance of the enterprise in taking the basic decision.
Finally, I should like to thank Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm again for his very generous words.
We are going to issue a communication on the modernisation-related relationships between the national courts and the European Commission, and we are also supporting an effort â instigated in particular by Sir Christopher Bellamy â on initiatives for national judges in the area of competition policy.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
I have received one motion for resolution to wind up the debate.(1)
The vote will be tomorrow.
Â Â  Catalonia and the Kingdom of Spain have been experiencing a real political storm in the last few days.
The reason I am discussing it is that it has affected our institution.
Indeed, our President, Mr Cox, deferred the meeting that he was supposed to have only yesterday with the new President of the Catalonian Parliament, MrÂ ErnestÂ Benach.
The reason for all this is that on Monday, the Madrid daily newspaper ABC revealed that my Secretary General, Josep LluÃ­s Carod-Rovira, who had just taken up the role of Prime Minister of Catalonia, had secretly â but not so secretly that ABC was unable to reveal it â met with leaders of the terrorist organisation ETA.
With his characteristic courage and sense of honour, MrÂ Carod acknowledged the meeting, stating that it took place at the request of ETA, from which he hoped to procure a truce announcement.
Since Monday, the anathemas have been pouring out from Madrid in an election-driven battle of indignation.
MrÂ Carod has stepped down as Prime Minister, courageously heading up the list of candidates in Barcelona for the elections to the CortÃšs to take place on 14 March.
Like a good democrat, he is letting the citizens judge his actions.
In my view, there is no doubt about the verdict, which is the only one that counts, and I condemn the fact that the President of our institution refused to meet or deferred his meeting with the President of the Catalonian Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to raise the issue of various moves in some Member States, notably France, to ban the wearing of so-called overt religious symbols.
The spotlight has fallen in particular on the hijab, the Muslim headscarf.
In order to be consistent and non-discriminatory, any such bans would affect the Sikh turban, the Jewish kippa or skullcap, and Christian crosses.
Such bans are misguided.
Apart from the purely pragmatic argument that if you ban something then people want to do it, there are strong human rights arguments as to why banning is unacceptable.
I refer in particular to Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to manifest one's religious observance in public.
These guarantees are, of course, echoed in our own Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It must surely be arguable that a ban would breach the EU directive on equal treatment regardless of race or religion.
Before France or other Member States find themselves condemned before the Strasbourg or Luxembourg courts they need to remember that a European model of integration rests on respect for differences and freedom to choose, not on illiberal imposition of uniformity.
Â Â  â I wish to raise a matter which, unfortunately, has been pending since August 2003.
Five Community nationals, citizens of the European Union, are being held by the Pakistani authorities.
The Greek-owned ship, the sank in Karachi harbour and, unfortunately, the cook is still being held, as are people from the salvage company who went there after the accident.
All so that the Karachi port authorities can haggle with the insurance company over the insurance premiums which they should receive for the damage, which was indeed caused.
I raised the matter with the President of the European Parliament before Christmas.
He was sympathetic but, unfortunately, the matter is still pending.
What I am requesting is that the President of the European Parliament intervene again, perhaps calling on the ambassador to Pakistan or even asking Commissioner Patten to tell us what demarches have been taken by the European Union.
The Italian Presidency and the Commission had mobilised and we must not allow anyone to haggle over insurance premiums with citizens of the European Union as hostages.
Â Â  I shall ensure your remarks are passed on to the President of Parliament.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the Single European Sky:
- Report (A5-0010/2004) by Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (PE-CONS 3690/03 â C5-0603/2003 â 2001/0060(COD))
and
- Report (A5-0009/2004) by Marieke Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint texts approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on:
1. air navigation services in the Single European Sky (the service provision regulation) (PE-CONS 3691/2003 â C5-0604/2003 â 2001/0235(COD))
2. the organisation and use of airspace in the Single European Sky (airspace regulation) (PE-CONS 3692/2003 â C5-0605/2003 â 2001/0236(COD))
3. interoperability of the European air traffic control system (interoperability regulation) (PE-CONS 3693/2003 â C5-0606/2003 â 2001/0237(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have no hesitation in defining as a historical step the approval of this regulation on the Single Sky, which is the work of myself and my colleague Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, and of many Members who have contributed over the last two years to make this a fundamental commitment for our Parliament.
I consider it important because it allows us to extend our philosophy, our challenge to also see European integration in our skies, and it enables us to attain two fundamental objectives: the first, immediate aim, is to create an integrated air space, governed by the same rules, the same guarantees; second, it also enables us to review the concept of sovereignty in order to adapt it more completely to the process of European integration in which we are currently investing our energy and resources.
The first objective that this regulation has certainly achieved is that of safety.
A report drawn up a few days ago lists the last 18 air incidents, the last 18 major air disasters recorded since 11 September 2001: we have calculated the total number of deaths at 2300.
Not one of these disasters is linked to terrorist acts; they are air disasters linked to problems concerned with flight safety.
So, in this sense our regulation makes a fundamental contribution.
If air traffic grows at the same rate at which it has grown in recent years and if we do not take steps in relation to safety, as we are seeking to do with this regulation, then in the year 2015 â according to forecasts â we will have a disaster of this scale every week.
The Single Sky is a fundamental contribution, a contribution that also seeks to have spin-offs in terms of organisation, efficiency and good sense.
Currently in Europe there are 41 different air traffic control centres, each often having its own rules, with its own flight paths, its own corridors, its own flight quotas.
From Rome to Brussels one passes through the hands of seven different flight control centres, and handovers are not always smooth: consider what happened over Lake Constance a few years ago when as a result of a misunderstanding between two flight control centres during a handover an aeroplane crashed to the ground.
As a result of this regulation safety will once again become the priority of European policies.
Another priority the regulation would appear to have established concerns costs and timetables.
The growth of European traffic will take us from seven million flights in 1997 to twelve million flights by 2010, and today one in five flights experiences more than 20 minutes delay.
It is clear that efficiency in terms of timetables and costs makes our companies competitive in the market: the US has more or less the same geographical area as Europe, but they have double the number of aeroplanes in the air and much shorter delays.
How have we attempted to deal with these points and these issues?
We did so with the committed and knowledgeable support of the Commission, represented by the Commissioner, Mrs De Palacio, and with the good sense shown by the Council in this difficult conciliation phase.
There are three points I want to touch on briefly: the first naturally concerns civil-military cooperation.
In the compromise finally reached it was decided that explicit reference should be made to the statement of the Member States on military matters.
In that statement the Member States acknowledge that air space can be used in a safe and efficient manner only if there is close cooperation between civil and military authorities.
We consider it a milestone in the process of European integration: for the first time the military top brass of all fifteen European countries understand that the European skies are not anyoneâs property and that a balance must be struck â at the highest possible level in terms of quality â between the defence requirements of all Member States and the safety requirements that are the main concern of the customers, that is to say European citizens.
The second important point is the role played by Eurocontrol.
We have attempted to take on board and make good use of, in terms of experience and efficiency, what Eurocontrol stands for and the role it could play in constructing this integrated European single space.
To achieve that goal required cooperation whilst avoiding the duplication of roles and functions; cooperation with the European Institutions and the Commission is a must for this regulation.
It has been established that Eurocontrol will be able to participate as an observer in the meetings of the Committee on the Single Sky; we are therefore moving towards a major stage in the contribution that Eurocontrol will be able to make.
Finally, provision has been made for sanctions, at Parliamentâs request, on the basis of an elementary principle taught us by Beccaria: without sanctions, without the threat of sanctions, it is difficult for any legal principles to be respected.
Mr President, I believe that the merit of this regulation â and of the European Institutions that have contributed to its achievement â lies in having again overcome certain national concerns and egoistic considerations.
A European Single Sky from 1 January 2005 will provide clear confirmation that Europe is growing, that the process of integration is developing and that that process is also synonymous with the quality and safety of our lives.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, as the elections approach, I am increasingly being asked whether Parliament actually amounts to anything, and whether it really does have anything to say.
I think that this dossier is a case in point, and I shall discuss this in more detail.
The Council and the Commission initially had very great ambitions, particularly after 11Â September, but these gradually evaporated.
There were all kinds of sensitivities regarding sovereignty and legal hurdles; in short, the Council did not dare to make a bold move, and Parliament clearly took a different perspective.
We have a clear aim, which is increased integration in European airspace in the interests of the citizen.
That is necessary, and, in consultation with the Council, we finally obtained a clear commitment on their part to achieve that aim, too.
This is a first step in the right direction.
The main points that we agreed with the Council in conciliation were on the subject of implementation, of course.
Service providers must comply with stringent requirements, and this compliance must be monitored.
Conflicts of interests must be eliminated, and access to services must be guaranteed for all airspace users: including military, I should like to add.
I think that it is important for that to be pursued by the European Parliament.
We also reached agreement on the charging regimes.
Incentives can be used to promote a better use of airspace.
There must be a decrease in subsidies, and, furthermore, everything must be made more transparent.
We have also pushed for clarity as regards the future.
When shall we see legislation regarding the licensing of air-traffic controllers?
At what point might the concepts of the Single Sky in the upper airspace also be applicable to lower airspace?
We should like some certainty on those points.
In addition, we think it is a good thing that Eurocontrol has become involved with this; it has worked very hard on this, and indeed I believe that the discussion on this dossier has focused everyoneâs attention, which is all to the good.
The second point on which there was a difference of opinion was, of course, civil-military cooperation.
I think MrÂ Favaâs greatest achievement was to succeed in securing the inclusion in the text of a clear reference to the need for this kind of cooperation.
Parliament is committed to this, and emphasised it continually in the course of the negotiations.
Indeed, this could perhaps be a stepping-stone to more and better military cooperation in the future.
We in this House also succeeded in making clear the importance of data exchange; again, that applies to all â including military â service providers.
We are also pleased that the Member States have committed themselves to cooperating on the concept of the flexible use of airspace across national borders: that will prevent many delays.
MrÂ Fava has already discussed this in detail.
Finally, there is the point on which conciliation nearly foundered: cross-border airspace blocks.
I think that we have reached a reasonable compromise in the form of Article 5(6).
Speaking personally, I think this was one of the most important points, because, if progress is to be made, provision for conflict mediation has to be included in the text, otherwise it is all too easy to hide behind someone else.
Having invested a great deal of effort in this on behalf of my colleagues, I am fairly pleased with the outcome.
The Member States are obliged to take the views of the Commission into consideration, and they must also take those views as the basis for resolving conflicts over the creation of cross-border airspace blocks.
What helped win us over was the Commissionâs pledge, in the form of a written statement, to take action to review the procedure after five years if no clear progress has been made with the reorganisation of the airspace.
This provides the impetus that is vital in order to make European airspace safer and more efficient.
This is important for service providers, airspace users, and, of course, passengers.
It is also essential in view of the current increase in air traffic of more than 2% perÂ annum.
Commissioner, you can be assured that the European Parliament has acted in the interests of the citizen and that we shall closely monitor the progress made and take action if the Member States are found wanting.
It only remains for me to thank my colleagues for their excellent cooperation and the services for their support.
Negotiations with the Council may well have been tough, but they were also congenial and constructive throughout, with each party understanding the otherâs views; and that is the way it should be, too.
It has been an honour to do my share towards making air transport safer and more efficient in the interests of the citizen.
I should also like to take this opportunity to point out how important the role of the European Parliament has been, because I think that, together with the Council, we have achieved a very good proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can imagine, today is an important day for me.
It is a pleasure to be able to attend this debate which is going to represent the positive conclusion and therefore the approval of what has been one of this Commissionâs priorities and, of course, one of my priorities, as Commissioner responsible for transport: the implementation of the Single European Sky.
The work we have been doing has been hard and complicated, and we have therefore been working for some years.
In relation to this initiative, for the first time, dressed in uniform, military aviation chiefs from all the Member States of the Union, together with civilian chiefs, met on the premises of the European institutions â and specifically the Commissionâs premises â in order to discuss certain aspects which have been pointed out by the rapporteurs, such as the flexible civilian and military use of European airspace.
It is an initiative for which the support of Parliament, and in particular that of Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has been the key to being able to promote it and bring it to light.
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political groups and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their support during the many discussions we have held.
I would like to point out that an initiative which, at the time we launched it, met with great scepticism from the Member States of the Union, which was fiercely opposed by certain sectors, is in the end going to enjoy generalised support.
We must remember that all the Member States support this initiative and they demonstrated this with the adoption of the latest decisions within the Council, and I hope that in todayâs vote this will also be the case.
I would also point out that the various sectors of the industry in question (air navigation service providers, airlines, manufacturers of equipment, airports ...) are aware of the opportunity offered by this initiative, an opportunity to promote a market with greater dimensions, greater capacities and, above all, which is going to allow us to be leaders and work on the definition of new concepts of air navigation and air traffic control with a view to the STAR 21 initiative for 2020 and also participate, cooperate and combine proposals with those of the United States in order to promote a safer system.
Mr Fava insisted on the safety aspect, which is a key element of this initiative, safer systems for the future but with a more appropriate technology which allows better, safer and more efficient use of the airspace and I would insist that all of this is going to lead to greater safety.
I would like to say something which is also extremely important, and that is that the unions, in particular those which represent the key actors in this field, such as air traffic controllers, have in the end been appreciating the advantages of an initiative of this type and in this regard I am pleased with the joint statement which unions and employers have issued on the final text agreed, a final text within which Eurocontrol one of the key elements which was involved in the discussion also finds its role and responsibility as a body with experience and knowledge which is absolutely essential to the development of the Single European Sky.
I am aware that some people have doubted the willingness of the States in relation to specific aspects and, just today, the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, has indicated that we are going to closely monitor how the States of the Union develop in terms of the implementation of this Single European Sky.
I believe that the text we have finally agreed on is a balanced text, a balanced text which will certainly evolve in the future, but we must be aware that we are carrying out a genuine revolution and an extremely important step forward in the construction of Europe in a real sense.
The notion that there is sovereignty over airspace, an area in which we are going to regulate and act according to common rules within an integrated system is a tremendous step forward which we cannot underestimate, and therefore, the fact that the Member States maintain â as reflected in the text which we have finally agreed on â the guarantees necessary to accept this change, seems to me to be the appropriate compensation if we want to continue taking steps forward in the knowledge that Europe cannot be built in one day, but that it is a process within which we must continue to make progress on the basis of consensus with the support of all the States, because it is not a question of leaving anybody behind.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know there are still things to do â and I would insist: over the coming years there will be new proposals â but I believe that today we are opening up new possibilities which mean taking maximum advantage of the prospects offered by our very membership of this group known as the European Union, in other words, taking advantage of European added value.
And that is what we are doing today in order to create an airspace which can be managed more efficiently but, above all, more safely, in a manner which respects the environment, at the service of the citizens, and which represents, I would insist, a step forward which, in certain respects, is almost revolutionary.
I would like to thank the Council for its position which has allowed us to develop in this way throughout these discussions over all these years â the first meeting took place in January 2000, it was one of the first things I did â four years during which we have all been able to develop and come together in relation to rules which allow us to introduce this initiative which, I would remind the honourable Members, will also affect Swiss airspace and Norwegian airspace.
Furthermore, Switzerland and Norway have participated fully in the discussions we have held over all this time and, once again, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all the Members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Parliament and the Council for their contributions which have undoubtedly improved the final result.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really does matter a great deal to me that I should start by thanking both the rapporteurs, Mr Fava and also Mrs Sanders-ten Holte.
I think they have fought splendidly and with commitment, particularly in the final stage, when one sometimes got the impression that only Parliament was left to carry on the fight on this issue, the Commission having thrown in the towel a while back.
According to the splendid brochure that was issued in 2002 with a foreword by the Commissioner, âthe time is ripeâ.
Then along came the many proposals that, alas, never seem quite to have taken legal effect.
It is for that reason that I am a bit wary today of talking in terms of a historic moment or of a culmination.
This is at best a start.
Let us have no illusions; this is the third time that this House has discussed this topic, and if the public could listen in, they would find it utterly beyond belief, believing as they do that this ought to have been sorted out ages ago.
On the ground, we have no borders any more; I can get in the car and drive from Berlin to Paris or from Paris to Rome without undergoing checks.
Despite the compelling arguments in favour of its doing so, this situation does not, however, apply in the skies above us, where aircraft fly over borders on a day-to day basis.
What is so comic about all this is the lamentable fact that the Council, in March 2002, when it met in Barcelona, came out with an explicit statement, noted a need, and made a demand to the effect that âwe need a single European skyâ, and it was the Council that stonewalled wherever it could, right up to the very end.
I put this in such blunt terms simply because I have for a long time been considering whether I can at all vote in favour of the conciliation procedure.
As we saw it, there were two central points, the two big issues.
We wanted greater safety, and we wanted more efficiency in the air.
We were aware that the two were closely interconnected, and that, on the one hand, collaboration and cooperation between civil and military aviation had to be organised, whilst, on the other, we must put an end to fragmentation once and for all.
As the brochure so splendidly put it, the patchwork had to become a network.
As Mr Fava put it, the fact that there are 41 air traffic control centres in the Member States alone, with a short flight from Brussels to Rome having to pass through seven of them, not only makes for potential dangers, but also provides reasons for unnecessary delays.
The Council has spent a long time blocking these central points.
I regret having to tell you, Commissioner, that, when the Common Position came back to the committee, it was your representatives who said that the Council may well have taken a conservative position, but that was the only big success we were going to get.
If Parliament had not stood so firm, and if the two rapporteurs had not given their all, it would not have been possible to achieve what is at least a beginning, with some degree of cooperation, an agreement, an understanding, a shared conversation between all the users.
Nor, moreover, would there have been the clear instruction to the Member States â who, let us recall, have had decades in which to create functional airspace blocks â combined with the declaration, which I saw as crucial, that if nothing changes in the next five years, we must and will make improvements, in which event we cannot allow the Member States to retain competence in this matter.
With this in mind â for this was what I saw as essential â I said it would be better to have a bird in the hand at the moment and to make a start, for there was nothing else on offer.
Let me make it quite clear, though, that I have not lost sight of the two birds in the bush, and I would ask that all of us in this European Parliament should continue to keep on working hard so that this single airspace in Europe should not be merely a vision, but should indeed, one day, become reality.
We need it â whether we get it with the Member States or despite them.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to the rapporteur for the good work he has done and for his good cooperation.
Commissioner, you once shared with us a vision of how we would in future be able to fly directly from A to B within Europe, thus enabling much better use to be made of capacity, reducing delays to a marked degree, radically minimising safety risks by, in short order, creating a few functional airspace blocks in Europe, and putting an end to the patchwork in the skies above Europe.
What we have ended up with is a sort of âSingle Sky â.
Politically speaking, it is clear, nothing more could be achieved, and agreement between the Council and Parliament was reached only at the very last minute â quite literally, at five minutes to twelve.
As it is the overall result that matters to us, Parliament has moved a long way and has acceded to many of the Councilâs wishes and concerns.
It has to be said that the Council of Ministers gave us the distinct impression that the national point of view continued to predominate â and that impression remains.
The result is that we have flown in the right direction but have landed well short of the runway.
Particularly where military-civilian cooperation is concerned, Parliament had to be very careful of national sensitivities and was in fact obliged to abandon the concept of flexible use of airspace.
Substantial areas of airspace continue to be barred to any but military traffic.
While a direct flight from Rome to Brussels has presented no problems in navigational terms for some time now, it will not be possible in future, which is economic and environmental nonsense.
We have in any case made progress in that the Member States have, for the first time, acknowledged that the only way to ensure the safe and efficient use of airspace is for the military and civilian users of it to cooperate, irrespective of how this is to be arranged in future.
I cannot, though, do other than agree with Mr Fava when I say that, as regards the functional airspace blocks, which are at the heart of the Single Sky, the result was less than what the facts of the situation demanded, for a real Community solution would have been needed, with the Commission having clear decision-making competence.
That, unfortunately, is something we could not get accepted; here too, the Member States still have the last word, but decisive progress has been made in that they are, for the first time, obliged to negotiate about the establishment of cross-border airspace blocks.
Moreover, the Commission is to closely monitor developments, review the situation after five years and propose any changes that may be needed to the system; like Mr Schmitt, I hope that it will.
To put it in plain language, the Member States can no longer evade their responsibilities, as they did over past decades, now that they are under close observation, and both Parliament and the Commission expect great things of them.
To sum up, the outcome may well not be the quantum leap in air transport that we had hoped for and that had been heralded, but we have started to stake out the ground and can look forward to more Europe above the clouds in the future.
Turning to the integration of lower airspace that is being contemplated and â if I may go one step further â the creation of a single trans-European airspace, I hope that the topic of flexible airspace use and, of course, of functional airspace blocks can again ...
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed regulations being put to the vote today are the result of an agreement made in conciliation following months of debate and work.
On behalf of my group, I abstained on this agreement, but I support the steps forward made from the initial draft.
Firstly, after various air disasters, the issue of safety remains the priority for any approach in this field.
Therefore, from the start I looked at these reports mainly from the point of view of safety.
I had expressed my regret in this House regarding the ideological bias that was placing liberalisation at the heart of the measures proposed.
It was a bias that was aiming to make economic issues the regulator for air activity and the main method of improving things.
In my view, the agreement reached now has a much more realistic approach.
Cooperation between civilian and military air traffic will be promoted, insofar as it is compatible with the sovereignty of the Member States, even though I would have hoped for a more dynamic approach in this area.
The airspace blocks will be based on operational or functional requirements, irrespective of national borders, in consultation with Eurocontrol.
In the event of a dispute, the Member States will, if they wish, be able to jointly request the opinion of a Single Sky Committee, the body responsible for implementing the plan.
Chaired by the representative of the Commission, this committee will be made up of two representatives of each Member State and a representative of Eurocontrol.
The agreement allows the Member States the freedom to entrust air monitoring to a public service or a private company.
I see these proposals as positive developments.
Although there is not the initial plan to dismantle the chain of so-called ancillary services, I nevertheless regret the fact that it was not more clearly recognised that the management of air navigation safety is a chain of actions and services that requires a global approach rather than a piecemeal one.
I still regret the fact that Parliament did not wish to retain the amendment that I had tabled on behalf of my group aimed at doubling monitoring mechanisms in order to ensure that operations continue in complete security in the event of a fault.
I still think that the absolute rule of obligatory separation of functions between the service providers and the national monitoring authorities does not necessarily take into account the complex realities of decisions in sectors that are so inter-related.
I also think that the issue of air traffic control and of everything involved with the regulation and safety of air traffic are tasks that are the responsibility of the public authorities, who should be considered as public services.
I have met the operators.
I have worked a great deal with the unions on this matter.
I wish to thank them and say that their contributions counted towards the positive progress that we have made.
I also think that in the future, the points of view of the main people involved, the employees, should be better taken into account.
This is one of the conditions necessary in order for other improvements to be made and also for the measures that will be taken in Europe to be effective.
You can be sure that my group is determined to contribute to this.
This is the reasoning for my vote, aiming to both take into account the progress made and show how much there is left to do.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, my congratulations and thanks to both the rapporteurs, MrÂ Fava and MrsÂ Sanders-tenÂ Holte.
I should also like to thank them for their dedication to bringing common interests to the fore.
It is clear, after all, that the whole political spectrum in this House advocates greater European powers in order to better guarantee safety.
I think that our national governments will have to be accountable.
If an accident should happen, this would be owing to our continuing strong adherence to national lines, and so countries would have to answer to their own citizens regarding the lack of a genuine Single Sky.
We often parade the principle of subsidiarity, of which I am a great supporter, but that subsidiarity must also apply from the bottom up.
If this is necessary for the sake of the safety of air transport, the national authorities must be prepared to hand over power to the European Union.
Anything else would be irresponsible.
I recently had a conversation with the federal authorities of the United States, where no fewer than 48Â 000 people are engaged in monitoring air transport safety under a single federal umbrella.
In my opinion, the degree of safety must not be subordinate to our great predilection for diversity.
If there is one place where diversity should not apply, that is in matters of safety monitoring.
For that reason, we agree with you that we are taking a step forward with the Single Sky today, but we could actually have taken this step as long as 20Â years ago, and we should have been able to go much further today than we have now gone.
Naturally, we are not blind to the improvements that have been made in the arrangements discussed during the negotiations.
Nevertheless, we should like to emphasise that accidents of this kind, such as the one near Lake Constance, give us a further impetus to go over to those cross-borderairspace blocks, in order to preclude the possibility of even more accidents of this kind occurring as a result of poor communications.
All in all, the improvement that we have here is still insufficient.
After all, if we look at the way in which the civilian and military spheres are already cooperating on interoperability to a certain degree for the benefit of safety, we see that the concept of national sovereignty is invoked much too often there, and that could be detrimental to safety.
That is a priority for this entire Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, again today I think that numerous honourable Members are not particularly satisfied within themselves with the agreement which we have before us.
I understand the reasons for their reactions; however, if they themselves go back a bit, six or seven years back, and look at where we were then, they will see that we have before us a very important step, a very important step for Europe, a very important step for the European citizens.
As you too, Mr President, were personally involved in the conciliation procedure, you will understand, I think, better than anyone, that a very important step is being taken in the field of restricting delays and, consequently, in this manner we are strengthening air transport, protecting the environment better and efficiently supporting European tourism.
Right until the end, we were faced with prejudices either on the part of certain Member States or certain military authorities.
You know that, up to the last minute, there was a problem as regards cooperation between military and civil authorities, on the one hand, and there was a problem as regards the way in which single operating sections or blocks are defined at international level.
Some steps were taken under pressure from the European Parliament.
Perhaps the steps were not taken which should have been taken.
Nonetheless, it is better for the European Parliament to agree to what we have before us and to look on it as a first step.
Our efforts must not stop here.
It is worth our putting even greater pressure on the Member States to become more bold in their approach and, I think, to close my short position, within these frameworks, it would be an oversight if we failed to mention the exceptionally positive role of the European Commission, and the Commissioner in particular, for whom I imagine it is perhaps one of the greatest achievements which she has had in her term of office to date as the Commissioner responsible for transport.
We must thank her and congratulate her on that.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner and our rapporteurs for their tenacity on a very important subject.
I would simply like to say that, as we saw with the Lake Constance disaster, the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster and those of the and the , whenever there is an accident people look to Europe.
And generally speaking the very people who are against European integration forget they were against it when tragedies happen.
I therefore believe that the creation of the single sky bodes well for the future.
At any rate, in this integrated European area we ought to do for the sky what we have done for roads and what we are trying to do for shipping and the railways.
I believe that in this matter Parliamentâs role was quite decisive in getting the general interest and public service nature of air traffic control recognised.
Conversely, I think that air traffic control personnel have gained a European dimension that will make them think differently in future and probably play a more active part in the next stages of the single European sky.
I am pleased about all that and I think this text is at last integrated and that this evening we have good reason to be pleased with the result we have achieved.
Â Â  Mr President, you claim to be achieving what you call the single European sky, but even the small amount of progress made to overcome the divisions and rivalries between states, which are particularly absurd in the field of aviation, are more than offset by the increased competition between private airlines, and even air traffic control is handed over to the race for private profit.
Behind the term âsingle skyâ is the race to privatise the old national carriers.
This policy has already resulted in thousands of redundancies in the aeronautical sector.
At this very moment, massive redundancies have been announced or are under way at Alitalia, at KLM, which is controlled by Air France, and in other large airlines.
It is obvious what the privatised airlinesâ shareholders have to gain from the reduction in personnel, not only flight staff, but also those involved in maintenance and safety checks.
But this profit-driven approach means that passengers are running growing risks.
To continue with this policy after the Lake Constance disaster 18 months ago, which was a direct consequence of the privatisation of air traffic control in Switzerland, is criminal.
As for the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster, even if the precise technical cause is not yet known, everyone knows that the airlines, including the one that owned that aircraft, make their profits by turning their aircraft round more quickly, extending their flying time, taking on staff who are less well paid and often not trained well enough or by cutting maintenance and technical inspections to the mandatory minimum.
Even the major airlines are doing the same, hounded by the competition.
The quest for profit is not compatible with the quest for safety.
We will vote for the amendments aimed at improving safety, but we are against every aspect of a policy that is based on competition, whether or not regulated at European level, because it will create an enormous mess and can only end in disaster.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too would like to join in the expressions of gratitude to you, Madam Vice-President, for the idea for the Single Sky was yours.
You succeeded in getting it through the high-level group and in laying to rest many misgivings at national level, and, although Mr Schmitt is right to criticise what has emerged from the conciliation procedure, we do all agree that the system has undergone fundamental change.
It formerly consisted of cooperation under Eurocontrol, but under Eurocontrol alone.
The Member States were sovereign, there was no Community law, and each and every state could escape scrutiny by insisting on its own sovereignty.
With this legislation, we now have a Community law that nobody can evade, one that can be adopted and amended by a majority, and the Commissionâs role as guardian and administrator of Community law means that no Member State can admit that it is doing something not quite right in its own airspace control and safety measures, while asserting that it is no business whatever of the Commissionâs.
On the contrary, there is a manifest sharing of responsibility, and the Commission is at the heart of the implementation of the new law.
I see this as a very great step forward, and one that is very much to be welcomed.
As a result, I believe, we will be able to reduce waiting times in the air and at airports, and this will be to the benefit of passengers and airlines.
We will be more successful on the environmental front, as every aircraft that spends too much time in parking orbit has a disastrous effect on our environment, and we will make progress in terms of safety, for fragmented technology and cooperation will be a thing of the past.
Of course, I have to tell my socialist and post-communist friends that their belief that air navigation services must be provided by the public sector is one that I cannot go along with.
If, though, we look back over recent years, let us ask ourselves where it was that service was always provided according to the book?
Where was it that aircraft were left hanging in the air?
The country that always occurs to my mind is one whose air navigation services are staffed by State officials, who do not necessarily make for better and more effective use of airspace.
This, Commissioner, is something we need to discuss together as and when the opportunity arises.
Following this legislative act, I believe, we will need â perhaps in two or three yearsâ time â a new initiative to introduce competition among air navigation services, where, as much as anywhere else, competition is required if performance is to be improved.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking our rapporteursand shadow rapporteursfor their work on this very detailed and complex report, which, of course, applies to upper air space.
Further to the last Council common position â which my Delegation broadly supported â and the subsequent conciliation procedure, we are now able to fully support this regulation.
During the process, one of our key objections concerned the inclusion of military operations and training.
I am delighted that this sovereign competence is now excluded.
Had it not been excluded there could have been an adverse impact on NATO operations, so I am also delighted that this is no longer the case.
However, care needs to be taken during implementation that the newly-created bodies â i.e. the single sky committee and the industry consultation body â do not duplicate their efforts, thereby causing unnecessary confusion.
It is quite clear that the aviation industry cannot continue to sustain the loss of USD 4 billion per year due to airspace congestion across Europe, and I believe that this regulation will go some way towards addressing this.
Eurocontrol should also be congratulated for its initiative, put in place in January 2002, which introduced reduced vertical separation.
I understand that we have increased capacity by some 30% and reduced delays to the levels we saw in 1998-1999.
However, it does behove certain countries and areas, such as France, Italy, Spain, southern Germany and Switzerland, which are responsible for 44% of the delays, to make radical improvements nationally if this regulation is going to succeed.
Another area which needs to be addressed urgently is the shortage of air-traffic controllers across Europe.
In conclusion, with this regulation we should improve safety, efficiency and the economics of air traffic management, which, as air traffic across Europe continues to grow, is good news for the industry, for business and for the consumer.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner deÂ Palacio, I would like to use these two minutes to praise the work of the rapporteurs, who have been so persistent and clear on a complex issue that is full of nuances, but who have never lost sight of, or abandoned, the main objective; to also praise every one of us, members of the committee, who have believed in their work and supported it; and to praise the Commission, which has worked alongside us and also allowed us all to achieve a result with which I can say that I am satisfied.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is not merely technical satisfaction.
Some Members have already said that, on this issue, we could certainly have done more, we could have achieved more, we could have gone further in terms of the level of harmonisation, but I would invite you to reflect on the satisfaction that we must feel from a political point of view: we have, at any rate, succeeded in breaking a taboo, since from now on â and armed with a regulation for achieving it â we can talk about a single European sky; of course, not yet at the level that we want and hope for, but nonetheless on the basis of an actual situation of which good use has been made.
There is even more reason to be satisfied because this provision belongs within a framework that has already brought other provisions to bear: I refer to the one, approved by the Council, on denied boarding, and the oneÂ âÂ and I really hope that it will be adoptedÂ âÂ that MrsÂ Maes is preparing on aircraft safety.
I therefore believe that we must also be satisfied, because this is the Europe that the citizens understand best, the Europe that the citizens feel close to, because it is the Europe that increases their safety, enhances their rights and increases their satisfaction with the response to their expressed needs.
I believe that the citizens will be our main allies when, on this issue too, we seek to progress and achieve the results which today are not within our reach but which we will certainly be able to achieve in the years to come.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my full and unconditional satisfaction with the result that has come out of the Conciliation Committee.
I believe that the encouraging prospects that have been illustrated here are certainly more significant than the doubts raised by the debate in previous years in committee and within the Council and the Commission, and which have also been expressed here today.
What I would like to stressÂ âÂ and in doing so I support what previous speakers said in their speechesÂ âÂ is the political aspect, as well as the emphasis being placed on defining this agreement as historic: we must not forget that it is the same emphasis which, ten years ago, we placed on abolishing territorial borders, which at the time seemed a miracle and which paved the way for real European integration.
The agreement reached certainly represents a balanced compromise given the many difficulties and the selfishness of the various sectors which, quite rightly, set down their interests and competences.
The result is, therefore, a result that is due to everyone, but I too would like to express my satisfaction that you, Commissioner de Palacio, focused on this objective with great tenacity, together with the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and also ourselves as members of the committee.
The result is satisfactory.
The new role of Eurocontrol and military and civil cooperation have been highlighted, but I would also like to stress the interoperability of the European air traffic control network and the issue, no less importantÂ âÂ which you, Commissioner de Palacio, emphasisedÂ âÂ of the certification of service providers.
Similarly positiveÂ âÂ the rapporteur MrÂ Fava mentioned this, and I would like to say that I completely agree with him âÂ is the matter of sanctions for service providers and airlines that breach the provisions of the single sky, with safety objectives set, not just for the benefit of our European citizens but also for the benefit of all those who are to use, and fly in, the skies above Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe we are all aware that todayâs discussion marks the conclusion of an historic step forward in European integration.
We have broken a taboo, according to Mr Lisi, and we would perhaps have liked to have gone even further and to have created more common ground, and I am sure that in the coming years there will be modifications to these two regulations, to this legislative package, with a view to improving it.
Once the degree of trust increases, and the application and reality of the Single Sky becomes the norm, and we all see how we can combine the elements relating to the concepts of sovereignty and defence, which are present in airspace, with more appropriate, efficient and safer management of airspace within European civil aviation.
In this regard, I would like in particular to thank the honourable Member, Mr President, because it is true â Mr Dimitrakopoulos â that your work during the conciliation procedure was key.
Also key was the work, as I said a moment ago, of the two rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and all the people responsible within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would like to say that for the Commission, and for me personally, this is one of the three great initiatives which I will always remember from my time in the European Commission.
Then we are going to talk about another one, the GALILEO Programme, as soon as we finish this debate.
With this initiative, together with GALILEO and certain others â perhaps maritime safety, despite the fact that some people do not yet see it like this â we have carried out a genuine revolution and we have changed the limits, the borders, of Europe.
By means of this initiative we are Europeanising our airspace, which was previously not European.
Through this initiative, we are truly creating a European airspace, we are creating a European sky, furthermore combining guarantees for States.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am just going to make a brief comment: there are certain Members who say that on the whole issue of functional blocks there should be Community competence; , although it is not exactly the same, it is as if the Commission had full competences in relation to defining road routes or railway networks and in relation to constructing them.
We must also take account of the will of the States.
It cannot be done in a contradictory manner, the Commission must provide this European thinking and this European component which is perhaps not always present in the national view, but it is obvious that without the Member States we cannot carry out this kind of action.
I would like to say that Eurocontrol, throughout these years, has also made very great progress.
And I believe we have contributed something to these improvements because Eurocontrol is aware of the process and the impetus that exists and, in this regard, I am extremely pleased that we have been able to finally achieve full Community participation in Eurocontrol, which has been extremely important, as well as the organisation of its cooperation in the whole Single Sky process.
I will end by saying just one thing: what the Commission has never done in relation to this initiative has been to throw in the towel.
Some have perhaps done so at certain times, but the Commission, and myself personally, have not done so.
As I have said, I began in January 2000, with a series of meetings in which civilian and military chiefs participated, when no progress had yet been made on defence aspects, though over recent years progress has been made.
There was no COPS or anything like it but nevertheless they came and, I would insist, at that time, it was believed that our initiative was impossible.
We have been able to separate the issues and resolve what could be resolved and not paralyse everything as a result of trying to resolve everything.
Because we all know that one way to ensure that nothing happens is to try and achieve perfection overnight.
I believe that what we have achieved today is very important, and that it is this very mixture of a vision of creating a European Single Sky and of realism, which has guided our action, both in Parliament and in the Commission, and also â I would like to point out â in the Council, which has allowed us to take pleasure today in a positive result, which is an extremely important step, which we all know will be followed by further steps, but which is the first step in this new frontier of the Single European Sky.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, both for your statement and your kind words.
The debate on this matter, on which we all worked very hard but with very positive intuition, is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (Î5-0003/2004) by Mr PiÃ©trasanta, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the state of progress of the Galileo programme (COM(2002)Â 518 â 2003/2041(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of this legislature a number of reports about Galileo have been made to the European Parliament in turn by Mrs Langenhagen, who is here today, Mr Glante, Mr Dhaene and myself.
They were always presented positively, but nevertheless had to overcome many obstacles to get our European project adopted.
It was criticised as duplicating the American GPS, but that made me think of the fable of the blind man and the paralytic.
Were we expected to call on the United States to be our eyes and show us the way to go?
The cost was said to be ruinous, although it is about the same as building a little more than 100 km of high-speed railway line.
Our wisdom finally carried the day and, concerned to implement the European Unionâs strategy for employment, economic reform, research, and social cohesion decided by the Lisbon European Council in March 2002, we adopted Galileo.
I have now been working for nearly a year on this report to bring us up to date on this project and on the integration of EGNOS into Galileo.
However, the fear of a delay in implementation was such that we have been overtaken, and happily so, by the project being put in place and I am now in a position to present the excellent results that we achieved in 2003 and to make a number of recommendations for operational implementation in order to ensure that Galileo really does go into service by 2008 at the latest.
I am therefore taking account here of two Commission communications.
The first is concerned with the state of progress following the Council decision of 26 March 2002, which saw the informal adoption of the regulation creating the joint undertaking on 21 May 2002, and the second the integration of EGNOS into Galileo.
The communication covers the following aspects: the creation of joint undertakings, which has now been done, the systemâs security â on our recommendation the supervisory authority was created at the same time as the security centre; its role is vital because it ensures that Galileo will remain a project geared to its usersâ wishes; I believe Parliament should be more closely involved with this committee in a way that remains to be decided â service definition and frequency planning, the reservation of frequencies.
The problem of the overlay of signals on the fifth service (or PRS) with the US armyâs M signal has also been settled.
The Commission and the United States have found a compromise.
The Galileo signal will surround the US signal and will no longer be overlaid.
Relations with third countries have been normalised.
There are no problems with the Russian Glonass system.
There is some cohabitation, or at least consultation, for the American GPS.
And countries are joining us, like China, with whom a promising agreement, especially in the field of research, was initialled in Beijing on 18 September 2003.
By way of reminder, Galileo is merely a giant clock consisting of around 30 satellites capable of determining a position in time and space very accurately.
Unlike GPS and Glonass, it must remain a purely civilian project.
The services it will provide are very important, especially in the environmental field.
As a tool for protecting nature, it will help to track pollution by dangerous substances, track icebergs, and map the oceans and sea levels.
It will help to monitor the atmosphere, the ionosphere, radio communications, space science and even to predict earthquakes or monitor endangered species.
It will be possible to pinpoint dangerous substances such as nuclear waste at any time.
We have not forgotten space pollution either, since we shall have to ensure that any new object launched into space can be neutralised.
There will be many other developments in transport and communications.
I would like to stress Galileoâs fundamental contribution as a spearhead for our European space policy, integrating more closely the roles of the Union and the ESA.
And in the European Research Area, a large amount of funding is provided in the sixth research and development framework programme by the European Space Agencyâs ARTES programme and the private partners.
With a large part of the funding coming from the public purse, the results of the research and the intellectual property will belong to all the European Unionâs citizens.
So far as EGNOS is concerned, I propose that it be integrated into Galileo, through the good offices of the joint undertaking, because this satellite radio navigation system can only be based on our global system.
Galileo is a very important achievement of our legislature.
It was proposed and supported by the Council and the Commission, and I want to pay tribute to Mrs de Palacio in transport and energy, to the Director-General Mr Lamoureux and also to Mr Busquin for their energy and determination in bringing it about.
I also want to thank all my fellow Members for the constant interest they have shown in Galileo, especially those on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Galileo is a fine European Union project.
First and foremost, it will help to implement our policy of sustainable development with the ethics essential to an action of such breadth.
Our Parliament can be proud to have been a driving force in the dynamic that our Assembly has shown and which will help to make the European Union more independent; it is a step towards a decision full of political significance and one very much called for by our draft Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like once again to thank the European Parliament for its support for the Commission in relation to moving ahead with the Galileo project.
The PiÃ©trasanta report is further evidence of this since it decisively approves the action we have carried out throughout this time and encourages us to move forward.
I would like to thank you once again for your support and I would also like to thank Mr PiÃ©trasanta in particular for his work.
I would like to point out that at the moment, as you well know, the Galileo joint undertaking is fully operational and has been since the summer of 2003.
Its two main tasks are, on the one hand, to select the future Galileo concessionaire we have four offers on the table which were received in December 2003 following the publication of an invitation to tender for concession last year and these four offers demonstrate the real interest of four consortiums in taking charge of this project and, therefore, clear interest in the private sector in the Galileo project.
The second element we are working on is the monitoring of the work carried out by the European Space Agency on validation in orbit.
A first experimental satellite will be launched before the end of 2005 and a second satellite will be ready to launch during the first half of 2006, because we must begin to transmit test signals, in order to guarantee that we maintain the signals which were granted us originally by the corresponding international body.
With regard to relations with third States, which MrÂ PiÃ©trasanta referred to a moment ago, what we are seeing is huge interest and this confirms once again that both the Commission and Parliament, which have never doubted the Galileo project, were right and those countries which had concerns or doubts and which for some time have had difficulties promoting the Galileo project, had no justifiable reason for it.
We have in fact signed an agreement with China, the negotiation with India is at a very advanced stage, Brazil also wants to participate in the Galileo project, not to mention cooperation with Russia and, of course, the United States.
With the United States, we have resolved practically all the compatibility problems with the GPS system by means of cooperation between systems which allows us to enhance and improve the signal and the corresponding services.
In this regard, at the last meeting we held at the end of last year, practically all the issues were resolved, there is just one issue to be resolved on open signals and we are very close to resolving it and we hope that tomorrow and the next day, at our meeting in Washington, we can finally resolve the matter.
I would therefore like to thank the honourable Member for his report, and Parliament for the very clear support it has given this Commission initiative throughout all this time, since we have had to fight hard and at times overcome complex difficulties, but I would like to say that it is moving in the right direction.
As I said a moment ago, with regard to these three projects: âSingle Skyâ is under way, Galileo is well and truly launched, and âmaritime safetyâ, which we has gone from nothing to a whole package which protects and supports us, not just in the European Union but at international level.
Mr President, if I could only mention three, then these would be the three tasks which we will have achieved â and I say âweâ because we have achieved it amongst all of us â a team, a Commission team, and I would like once again to thank the services I have referred to, from the Director-General to all the people responsible who have acted and worked throughout this time but of course with the invaluable cooperation of this Parliament, which has given us support systematically and, of course in the end as well, the cooperation of the Council.
If the Council is not there, then the system does not work; the Community triangle, once again.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we have just heard the USA declare that they want to make a massive commitment to space and again invest a great deal of money in it: settlements on the moon, a mission to Mars â pictures of which we see almost daily; this, I believe, is where Galileo is a very important and good sign for Europeâs economic and technological future.
I am also looking ahead to this yearâs European elections.
People are always asking us in what ways Europe is benefiting them, and Galileo enables us to give them an example of how European forces can combine â for only together can we achieve such objectives â in the spheres of business and technology, in a useful way that benefits the future of the Europe in which we share.
The problems have been described, and it is now urgently necessary that we make headway on the problems with implementation, including the ones that involve the Americans.
A large number of obstacles have been overcome.
Parliament has been constant in its support for the Commission, the Council has played its part, and now is the time to decide on the tenders.
We have to waste no time in installing the system, so that we can work with it, and we have to create the right framework conditions, especially in the structures.
This is where I wish to address a point that I see as important.
When deciding on the future structures of Galileo, which we will be debating in this House, it is necessary that these should be effective, but it is equally necessary that Parliament should retain its share of responsibility and not allow this dossier to be taken out of its hands.
Although I would ask that, when we come to discuss this, we should perhaps get more support from the Commission, I think that we have, together, demonstrated that Europe, the European Parliament, is united in its pursuit of this objective.
Commissioner, this House has always been behind you, so in this matter too, we should make common cause in seeing to it that responsibility remains with Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to extend special congratulations to MrÂ PiÃ©trasanta, for he and I worked well together in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy; he was a sympathetic and agreeable colleague and was open to all his fellow-Membersâ suggestions, misgivings and questions.
In the course of our deliberations on this report, we had interesting hearings with experts, whom we were able to ask about their reports, and who had interesting things to say about Galileoâs future uses.
Even though some of us had to allow ourselves a slight smile at some of the statements and prognoses, I see Galileo as a model for the future and believe that it will yield returns on what is invested in it, something that is apparent from the fact that there have already been four responses to the invitation to tender.
I can remember how, some two years or so ago, things looked very different and there was often doubt as to whether industry would get on board financially.
Now we are about to open the documents and announce the result.
That is something I cannot but welcome.
In fact, Mr PiÃ©trasantaâs report contains everything that matters.
There is one further thing I want to mention, on which I tabled amendments in the committee and will be tabling another for the plenary; I ask your indulgence, but it is one that matters especially to me.
I refer to the rescue and aid services that are to be implemented.
Although COSPAS-SARSAT is well-known, there is also the IMMARSAT-E system, which is preferable to COSPAS-SARSAT in many respects, such as its rapid response times, more precise positioning, permanent availability, 100% compatibility with Galileo, and coverage of the whole of the earthâs surface.
This system is important to people in trouble at sea, as such information is highly detailed and help can arrive at very short notice.
I think this is something to which we should give some thought; a number of organisations â some of them military, like NATO â and Member States are already fitting this system into their Transall transport aircraft, helicopters and naval vessels.
I think it would also be helpful to private individuals, and the two systems can certainly exist alongside each other.
I hope that we will implement this tomorrow and that Members will support the one amendment of mine that is still to be voted on.
Thank you all, and I wish you, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, all the best for the future; something lies in store for you and we will miss you.
Â Â  Mr President, in 2002 in Lisbon the European Council proposed the objective that within ten years the European Union should be the most dynamic and advanced economy in the world, generating employment, social protection and well-being for all the citizens.
To this end, it was established that various economic reforms were necessary, as well as a strengthening of research and social cohesion, but nevertheless, in almost all the Member States we are seeing constant examples of relocation of companies whose owners, generally multinationals, are seeking greater profit margins by reducing the manufacturing costs of products, establishing their industries in countries with cheaper workforces and, sometimes, with fewer environmental controls.
This creates unemployment in the Union and reduces our wealth and our capacity to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
In the face of this unstoppable dynamic caused by globalisation, our reaction must not be to try to compete in order to bring our costs into line with those offered by less developed countries, on the basis of sacrifices on the part of our workforce or of our environmental requirements.
Our approach must be to strengthen our human resources, education, training, technological development, research and knowledge.
Only in that way will we continue to maintain our competitive advantage and promote and retain cutting-edge companies and sustain the high level of social well-being, protection and cohesion we enjoy.
The Galileo project, which we are debating today, is a good example of our taking the correct path.
Together with the European Space Agency, the EGNOS programme, and hopefully also ITER, it creates a launch pad so that Europe can be in the leading group in terms of the most important challenges humanity is going to face during this twenty-first century, that is to say, taking advantage of our atmosphere and outer space in a manner which is sustainable and respectful of nature.
And since the Earth and the universe belong to all of us, we fully support the idea of Galileo being open to cooperation with third countries such as China, India, Brazil and others, as well as the negotiations with Russia and the United States on satellite navigation.
And also that our Galileo transponders be used to assist the existing maritime rescue systems and cover the needs of transport, telecommunications, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and, above all, people.
I would like to congratulate Mr PiÃ©trasanta on his report as well as the Commission, Parliament and finally also the Council, for promoting the Galileo project.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, for his thorough work on the Galileo positioning system.
Galileo has proved to be a tremendous success and I hold the view that it is vital for Europe to continue to invest in this key technology into the future.
It is worth noting that, unlike competing global positioning systems â notably American ones â our Galileo project has been used exclusively for civilian purposes.
I believe this must continue.
I am not keen on seeing Galileo turned to military applications.
Galileo can play a key role in helping the European Union achieve the competitiveness goals set in Lisbon, goals which form a key plank of the Irish presidency's programme.
The future participation of China in Galileo through substantial financial investment in the programme is most welcome.
I am convinced that we must go further in seeking international partners who will be pleased to find alternative options to the previous monopolies.
In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the supervisory board called for by Parliament, has indeed been set up.
This is an important contribution to transparency and accountability.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we certainly agree with the rapporteurâs statement relating to the satellite system and a civil satellite system but I believe that we should not have too many illusions about the possibility of clearly separating civil and military purposes, above all in view of the military repercussions of civil technology; still less can we be under the illusion that civil and military purposes are separate in dictatorships such as China, which use precisely these civilian instruments designed to locate people as tools for widespread repression, made possible thanks to new technology, in particular new satellite technology.
This is why I believe that the report should have expressed greater concern on this issue.
We welcome the conclusion of negotiations with China regarding its participation in the Galileo system.
In fact, the risks at military level are not theoretical risks, but those indicated by the European Commission as useful factors, from a European point of view, for its defence.
I would like to quote from a documentÂ âÂ a Commission position paperÂ âÂ of 31 December 2001 which stated that: âif the Galileo Programme is abandoned, we will in the next twenty or thirty years lose our autonomy in defenceâ;and again, on 12Â March 2002: âalthough designed for civilian applications Galileo will also give the EU a military capabilityâ, and the Directorate General indicated the usefulness of a separate Galileo signal to support the military aspect.
In view of this clarification from the European Commissionâs Directorate General regarding our technology; it is as well to know that this is also valid for China.
The issue is not about sabotaging the Galileo system; it is explicitly about taking these risks into consideration and taking adequate measuresÂ âÂ involving regulations, procedures and, if necessary, sanctionsÂ âÂ to prevent these technological repercussions, which are in part unavoidable and only natural, from going beyond what is acceptable.
Otherwise, there will be nothing for it but to imagine that the speed and ease with which the agreement with China was reached is part of the European Unionâs larger political strategy.
I apologise for digressing and implicating the government of the rapporteurâs country, but I believe that the attitude that we have seen recently from PresidentÂ Chiracand Prime MinisterÂ Villepin regarding the Chinese communist regime is a worrying sign of a very precise strategic and political direction.
If adequate countermeasures are not taken, there is a genuine risk of very real technological repercussions over the next few years for the army of a country that is antidemocratic, illiberal and a dictatorship and that knows how to turn secret services and specifically civil espionage to military use, something that our own intelligence organisations are, in any case, also doing.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, when we have something to say, we prefer to do so without delay.
For that reason, I would really have liked us to have discussed the state of play on Galileo some time ago, and would also have liked to see more regular follow-up.
The 2002 Commission communication has now, in 2004, been rendered obsolete by developments in the programme.
We cannot carry on being so slow in the way we handle current information, for I fear that any delay in Galileoâs development will make for serious problems if it is to be launched, as planned, in 2008.
Negotiations on the award of concessions must be completed without delay.
Galileo is still running on schedule, but we have to ensure that it stays on it, albeit without detriment to the necessary care in examining the tenders submitted.
We have to press on with the procedure and, of course, get the maximum use out of Galileo.
Only then will we be able to be convincing on the international stage.
In this respect, the signing of the EUâs agreement with China on the latterâs involvement in Galileo was a very important step, and others must follow.
The fact that the Council has now mandated the Commission to start negotiating with Israel and India in February shows that we are making good progress by way of bilateral agreements, but it is also of great importance, as has been described in relation to the USA, that we should find a shared basis for cooperation.
In this regard, making Galileo interoperable with GPS is a challenge we have to deal with, and both sides must make greater efforts.
Recently, there have been major forward advances across the board, and I would like it if future developments were to justify the great confidence placed in Galileo around the world.
Let me close by saying this: Commissioner de Palacio, you are right.
Galileo is the third pillar in your personal recipe for success.
We wish you a great deal more success in Washington, but also elsewhere, and Mr PiÃ©trasanta also takes our best wishes with him as he embarks on his further career in politics.
Â Â  I would like to begin by expressing my delight at the maturity of this Galileo dossier, which will remain one of the great achievements of this legislature and an example of what the Commission and Parliament can do together, to the general incredulity and despite the resistance of many Member States.
I believe this work does us all credit and I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Loyola de Palacio.
I believe this Galileo is something with a real future for Europe, firstly because of its many potential applications in a large number of services that will benefit our fellow citizens, secondly because it maintains our competence, and especially our independence, in space matters, and lastly because it will provide work for our launchers, which we know are a weak sector in a world where launchers are very exposed to competition.
Two problems remain, however, I believe.
First, there is the problem of funding for the operational phase.
I still do not understand in what way and how the private sector will be able to involve itself in the infrastructure competitively with a GPS that will provide its services free of charge.
From this point of view it will therefore either ask for guaranteed resources or it will seek something in return.
I think we must be very careful here.
I have always thought that infrastructure should be public and that services should be paid for by those that use them.
But I will wait and see what the funding plan will be, which I think should be settled as quickly as possible.
Then in the matter of international cooperation â and on this point I agree with MrÂ Cappato to some extent â I think it is good that China is interested, but not at any price.
Firstly, let us make sure that China does not demand that satellites be launched by its own launchers at the expense of Ariane, which needs an institutional market, and secondly, let us ensure that China, which is not a democratic state, does not use it for military purposes, which would be contrary to our essential values and in particular the respect for human rights which we know not to be the Chinese Governmentâs greatest virtue.
Â Â  â Mr President, my thanks go to my colleague, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, for the work he has done just as he is about to retire.
Galileo will bring a good deal of direct benefits, such as the EGNOS navigation system, due to make its appearance this spring.
It will provide industry with economic benefits and will bring to the navigation sector the competition it has long needed.
We would be able to combine the use of the GPS system, Galileo and the Glonass system.
I wish now, however, to stress the importance of Galileoâs later potential applications, especially in trans-European satellite-based broadband communication systems.
When used in combination with a global positioning function it will make possible many new options in the economy which now we can only dream of.
Economically speaking, it is the most effective way to bring broadband within the reach of all Europeans regardless of where they live and without discrimination.
Broadband can give the telecommunications industry the extra boost it needs to compete globally.
Finally, although I have mainly mentioned here the economic potential for supporting the Lisbon strategy, I would also like to emphasise the massive benefits Galileo will have for search and rescue services and transport.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you once again.
As was said a moment ago, there have been difficult and hard times.
I remember, for example, that at one point there was a collection of signatures of Members of this Parliament expressing support for a continuation of the Galileo Programme and calling on the Council to take positive decisions once and for all.
I would therefore like to insist that if this is one of the great achievements of this legislature, it is because of what it means in terms of enhancing the role of the European Union at international level, our autonomy and our very sovereignty, our future capacities, without leaving any field of technological development out of our ambitions.
I believe we have achieved this amongst all of us and there have certainly been really difficult times.
I would like to respond very briefly to certain issues which have been raised. The issue of China and human rights.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely concerned about the issue of human rights in China, and not only China, since there are unfortunately problems in other countries which are closer than China.
The European Union must not back down and must systematically ensure that the importance of human rights is respected.
What we have is an agreement for participation in the project, with certain limits, with certain elements, but I believe that the aspects pointed out by the honourable Members will of course have to be considered for the future and I believe them to be very important.
The next question is whether Galileo is a private system.
No, ladies and gentlemen, it is a public system, the property of the European Union.
All there is is a concession for its management by a private company.
But it must be made crystal clear that it is public, with public regulation and furthermore, as Mr PiÃ©trasanta said quite rightly in his report, intellectual property rights and other things will benefit all the citizens of the various countries of the European Union.
Why management by a private consortium and why payment services?
Why are there going to be payment services when there are free-of-charge services?
Because, as you are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, there are three levels, one of which is open, free and free-of-charge for any citizen, like GPS, but unlike GPS it is not subject to ups and downs since it is a civilian project rather than a military one.
Secondly, there is a free entry level but by means of payment, and with that free entry by means of payment there will not only be better definition and greater precision in terms of the signal received, but also a quality certificate, in other words, it will be known at all times whether the greatest possible precision is really being provided, or if, on the other hand, there is any difficulty which is reducing it.
This is fundamental for certain types of service, such as air navigation, for example.
With this signal quality certification it will be possible to land, it will be possible to change air navigation systems, for example, and it will also be possible to land simply relying on a system such as Galileo.
Thirdly, the final signal, as you know, is a security signal, closed to public use, intended exclusively for use by governments.
I would finally like to thank Parliament once again â and also the Council, for the position it finally took â and all the services of the Commission, and Mr PiÃ©trasanta for his work and his cooperation, and wish him luck in his new duties and congratulate on being lucky enough to mark his final plenary session with such an important and symbolic report for the future of Europe, such as this Galileo Programme.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on public sector contracts:
- Report (A5-0007/2004) by Stefano ZappalÃ  on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts (PE-CONS 3696/03 C5-0607/2003 2000/0115(COD))
and
- Report (A5-0008/2004) by Stefano ZappalÃ , on behalf of Parliament's Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal service sectors (PE-CONS 3695/03 C5-0608/2003 2000/0117(COD)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union delivers.
The effectiveness of the codecision procedure has made a substantial contribution in this case.
Peopleâs demands for development, increased growth and more jobs have now met with a response.
The conciliation concerning public procurement, which we are now to debate, is an expression of this.
It is necessary to modernise the European market and open it to public procurement in order to increase European competitiveness.
The directive on public procurement stipulates full competition between tenderers.
Complete transparency and equal treatment are guaranteed.
That is of benefit both to European taxpayers, who obtain better value for money, and to the innumerable companies that are now being given the opportunity to compete for contracts throughout the EU.
From Parliamentâs point of view, the conciliation was a success.
There were few of us who, at the beginning, had believed that the final outcome would be so close to our starting position.
The administration of procurement will be considerably simplified.
The directive will be simpler and clearer than its predecessor, and there will be increased user-friendliness, especially as a result of the electronic trading centres that are to be established, a development that will simplify matters for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited administrative resources.
Improved dialogue between suppliers and those who issue contracts has been built into the directive.
Our aim was to increase competitiveness, to promote equal treatment and to improve our tools for combating organised crime and corruption.
It was necessary to increase transparency and, in particular, information about who has obtained a contract and why.
It was these issues and the opportunity of introducing social and environmental considerations that, more than anything else, forced the conciliation.
The directive prevents social and environmental aspects being taken account of in an arbitrary or unbalanced way.
Thought can, however, still be given to such matters.
We obtained a balance with the aid of the EC Court of Justiceâs jurisdiction, whose case law was implemented, a factor that provides legal certainty in this area.
For this encouraging outcome, I wish especially to thank both the rapporteur, MrÂ ZappalÃ , and the shadow rapporteur, MrsÂ Berger, whose input has been considerable.
I also especially wish to thank both the entire parliamentary delegation and the two Commissioners who are present today and who, to use a homely turn of phrase, have not let the grass grow under their feet but really have made major practical contributions.
I even wish, unusually for an MEP, to thank the Presidency, which dealt with this issue and with which we negotiated.
Without all these combined efforts, it would have been impossible to take this step.
We should not have been able to come so far if all the parties had not had the practical political will to deliver to Europe in this area.
The outcome, therefore, was agreement, in spite of quite difficult political antagonisms at the start.
We expect this step to contribute to more intensive European trade, the consequence being gains in terms of prosperity for the EU, our citizens and our European populations.
Thank you, all who have contributed.
Â Â  C. Mr President, we are today on the verge of adopting the most comprehensive reform of EU public procurement law since the set up of the internal market.
It simplifies and modernises our legislation and gives to the public sector and to industry the means to cut costs and enhance competitiveness.
The importance of this piece of legislation for reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy is remarkable.
Indeed, public procurement is an important part of the internal market, not only because of its volume â for 2002 public procurement amounted to approximately EUR 1500Â billion: more than 16% of GDP or, in other words, more than half of the German GDP â but also because of the great potential for further savings for European citizens and taxpayers.
A recent draft report on the functioning of public procurement markets in the EU shows that the procurement directives have contributed to increased transparency in public procurement markets.
The new evidence, based on a sample of firms and public authorities, suggests that increased transparency has effectively resulted in more cross-border competition, price convergence and lower prices for goods and services purchased by public authorities.
Most importantly, this evidence shows that economic reforms work and pay off.
So much so, that the report strongly suggests that further savings are possible in this area.
Case studies show that savings of the order of 12% could have been made over the period 1998â2002.
The potential importance of this is quite remarkable: if savings of 10% could be made, then 5 countries would turn their budget deficits into surpluses and no eurozone Member State would run a public sector deficit that would break the Stability and Growth Pact's 3% limit!
This is quite remarkable.
Of course, the report recognises that problems, such as transaction costs, remain.
To address such problems, the legislative package in front of you will help with e-procurement, offering new possibilities for cost reductions.
If promptly adopted and effectively implemented by Member States, these measures will contribute to further improve the performance of our public procurement markets.
However important the economic aspects of public procurement may be, they should not be our exclusive focus â other major policies in the social and environmental fields also need to be considered.
In this context I would like to compliment the Conciliation Committee â and Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld â for their excellent work in reaching a well-balanced compromise which fully consolidates and safeguards the advances made by the current jurisprudence as regards the possibilities of using environmental and social award criteria.
Furthermore, as Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld said, I would like to emphasise the convergence between this solution and the latest Court of Justice ruling of 4 December 2003 â two days after the Conciliation Committee meeting â which confirmed the four conditions agreed upon in conciliation that are to be fulfilled by award criteria in order to be valid.
Provided these conditions are met, production methods could be used as award criteria without being mentioned explicitly.
Award criteria such as those dealt with in the recent judgment of 4 December will continue to be possible and will, furthermore, be based on clearer legal texts.
This confirms one of the merits of this legislative package, namely that the general clarification and simplification of the legislation will lead to more legal certainty.
Finally I would like to address the situation of certain professions with key roles to play in ensuring high quality when procuring.
In this respect, the legislative package will â thanks to the extensive work of the rapporteur â recognise this role and take the particular, qualitative aspects of such services into better account.
For all these reasons, I appeal to the Members of this House to support the results of this conciliation process and finally to adopt this important piece of legislation.
Once again, I should like to thank all Members who have contributed to the excellent outcome of the various debates held on this important matter.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the importance of this directive has already been emphasised by those who have spoken before me, but in recent years it has been frequently highlighted and reflected upon specifically in order to achieve a result like the one that we have obtained.
I will not, therefore, dwell on the importance or the content of the directive, which have already been the subject of many meetings and many debates.
I would merely like to quickly take the opportunity to make two remarks: the first is to point out that this directive will enter into force just when enlargement takes place, making things run more smoothly not just for the 15 current Member States, but also for the 25 which will, in a few monthsâ time, be Members of our Union.
I strongly welcome what Commissioner Bolkestein said as regards quality.
I tried many times, as rapporteur, to stress the issue of quality above all.
I know that the Commission is moving in this direction with other initiatives, and I therefore hope that, when a contract is awarded using the principle of the quality/price ratio, quality will always come out on top, above all in professional services.
Having, as rapporteur, spent four years on this issue, together with many other Members, I would conclude by impartially thanking all those responsible for such an important result for the European Union: the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, to which I dedicated a considerable amount of my time, for having conducted the final stage in the committee extremely proficiently; and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Bolkestein.
I would also, however, like to mention MrÂ Vattela and all his team, with whom we worked for a long time, often disagreeing but certainly in the constructive spirit of the European Union.
I would, furthermore, like to mention and thank the Chairman, now the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who chaired the committee and did a great deal of work on this issue, namely MrsÂ deÂ Palacio; the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who gave me this task, and for doing so I therefore thank the Chairman MrÂ Poettering; the current Chairman, MrÂ Gargani, and also all the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in particular MrsÂ Berger who, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, was so patient and with whom we concluded a significant process; my colleague MrÂ Lehne, coordinator of the European Peopleâs Party within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; the lawyer MrÂ Preto, who was certainly extremely valuable in bringing about everything that we have achieved; all the shadow rapporteurs; and, to conclude, the Italian Presidency.
During the last six months, the Presidency has finished a task that began a long time before the Spanish Presidency and, together with MrÂ Buttiglione and all of the Italian delegation, it has allowed us, for everyoneâs benefit, to bring this story to a close.
Having dedicated most of this parliamentary term to this activity, I am happy.
Now a new one is beginning, but this is certainly a milestone for the conclusion of the European internal market.
I therefore thank everyone; I thank you, MrÂ President, and, once again, all the Members for the opportunity given to me.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too would like to start by thanking most warmly everyone involved in the work that we are now bringing to a conclusion â as the rapporteur mentioned, we spent four years working together on it, and it was, for me, one of the best experiences I have had in the European Parliament, involving getting to grips with a great deal of highly complex material.
Let me thank the Commission, and also the Commissioner, who again reminded us today how very important this legislative project is in economic terms.
When getting to grips with one formulation or another, one is all too ready to lose sight of the whole and no longer quite see how very important this project is, and I think it is vital that we should remind ourselves of that as things draw to a close.
I also want to thank Mr ZappalÃ , the rapporteur, who has had to be very patient with me as I expressed what I sought.
Opinions may differ about the Italian Presidencyâs record, and different people in this House will assess it in different ways, but it can certainly chalk up as one of its credits the successful completion of this conciliation procedure, the result of which I will of course, tomorrow, be advising my group to adopt.
I am not doing that half-heartedly, merely because it is a compromise, but because I am convinced that 90% of our result is very good.
I would like to highlight a number of points that were of particular concern to us in Parliament and can be said to be enshrined in the outcome.
We of course share the Commissionâs goal of simplification and modernisation, which I see as having been largely achieved.
It was important to us that electronic procedures should be made easier and electronic auctions introduced.
When it came to the threshold values, we had differences of opinion.
I regard the slight increase in the threshold values from what they had been previously as a good solution, especially because this means that smaller contracting authorities, such as municipalities, do not have to put projects in their area out to tender right across Europe, whilst the internal market continues to apply to larger projects.
I also see it as significant that it has been possible to rethink the Utilities Directive, and, in particular, that we have succeeded in transferring postal services to it from their traditional directive, for this had been one of this Houseâs concerns, and that individual provisions for many sectors are now somewhat less stringent.
I believe that sheltered workshops are now well protected; these are an important area, as are the joint purchasing bodies that more and more Member States are setting up, and, of course, all those provisions â particularly in view of enlargement, to which the rapporteur referred â that can be said to clarify the application of the locally-applicable provisions on labour law, social security, taxation and the environment.
The conciliation procedure gave attention to, and was speedily able to resolve, the issue of national legislation on the award of contracts, which must, in future, be accessible on a website.
The Internet is an important source of information for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and it is intended that it should facilitate more cross-border transactions.
Reference has already been made to award criteria, which were without doubt the stumbling-block right up to the end of the conciliation procedure, and I find the result that we have achieved perfectly acceptable.
We have secured the position of the case-law of the European Court of Justice, which has developed over a lengthy period of time.
What we learned from Helsinki â and, thank heaven, on later occasions â has now been incorporated into law.
I see this as very important, particularly in terms of legal certainty, and perhaps this legislative package expresses to some degree the value we attach to the case-law of the ECJ in this area.
In conclusion, it only remains to me to appeal to the Member States to transpose this directive without delay and to do so in line with the new conception of it in order to create a real internal market for public-sector contracts, for more competition, and more transparency, but also for advances in the fields of environmental and social policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very satisfied with the outcome of this conciliation.
When we consider the outcome and what we were aiming for, our assessment is that we wish in every respect to recommend what has emerged.
Firstly, we succeeded, at the previous readings, in averting an increase in the threshold values that would have significantly limited the scope of this directive.
That is something we are really pleased about.
Secondly, we think we have achieved secure and modern tendering methods.
I believe that, as previous speakers have said, we can now go in both for providing more information to businesses on the Internet and for enabling small businesses more easily to find out which rules apply.
This will play a part in our successfully helping the administrations to modernise.
I believe that this is very important now that we are talking about a competitive Europe.
Our objective is to increase the number of cross-border tenders.
When we began the debate, we were sometimes concerned about the reports we received at the time to the effect that there were so extremely few cross-border tenders.
Our rapporteur in the Conciliation Committee, MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld, whom I had wanted to thank for her constructive work, mentioned that transparency had increased significantly.
I believe that what the Conciliation Committee has arrived at, and which really is closer to the Liberal idea, is what the majority signed up to at second reading.
It is important for competitors also to be able to see the final outcome of a tendering procedure and to be able to judge whether any errors have been made.
That is what is most important in the fight against corruption and in the interests of greater value for money
As we all know, the issue of the social and environmental criteria has been much to the fore in this debate.
We can now observe that the Commission has also prepared an action plan for modern environmental engineering.
I really do believe that the final outcome we arrived at is a tool in this context too.
We must not be afraid of modern environmental technology.
Finally, I want to say that, following our last conciliation meeting, the Finnish press said that the case of Concordia Bus Finland, brought before the EC Court of Justice and relating to bus traffic in Helsinki, had led to a sound directive on public procurement.
I was somewhat irritated about this, because no buses operate without drivers.
I want to thank all the drivers who contributed to this end result, and I note that we have steered the matter into a safe harbour.
My special thanks are due both to the Commissioner and his colleagues, who said just the right words at the right time, and to the Conciliation Committeeâs secretariat for its quite excellent work.
We have worked on this matter for many years, and it feels as though we have reached a conclusion.
I hope it will help our administrations get greater value for money.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have worked for a long time on these important procurement directives, and it is now time for a final debate and a vote on the outcome of the conciliation.
I would take the liberty of providing a short rÃ©sumÃ©.
Viewed in a Green perspective, the Commissionâs original proposal was completely unacceptable when it came to environmental and social criteria in the case of public procurement.
I was, however, very optimistic about the procurement directives once a majority of the European Parliament, at both first and second readings, had strongly supported the proposal to give the procuring parties greater freedom and legal entitlement to take account of, and incorporate, environmental and social criteria in public procurement.
Unfortunately, I saw from the very beginning that the Commission did not really want to acknowledge the fact that Articles 2 and 6 of the Treaty, together with the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and other policy documents, clearly state that environmental and social considerations must be incorporated into all EU policy and that public procurement must be used to achieve the objective of sustainable development.
The outcome of the conciliation is quite clearly better than the Commissionâs original proposal and the old rules, but I think that we have unfortunately missed a unique opportunity to be as progressive as the pledges and the talk of sustainable development would seem to require.
I think that the Council has demonstrated a stronger will and greater flexibility, for example through raising the threshold value.
I nonetheless believe that, during the conciliation, there was a failure to resolve the important issue arising from the fact that, with a value of 14% of GDP, public procurement really could make a difference to the EUâs environmental policy and promote âgreenâ procurement.
I would thank my fellow MEPs, who fought hard for this during the conciliation negotiations.
The criteria said to be of an environmental character are among those that, according to the agreed wording, must be set by the procuring entity.
This term does not, however, include the methods through which goods are manufactured.
Nor does it include the life cycle perspective, that is to say the period from the manufacture of the goods to their becoming waste.
Nor does it include the long-term effects, nor the internationalisation of the external costs.
What, therefore, is meant by criteria of an environmental character?
Will not a discussion arise concerning the interpretation and implications of the term and, as a concomitant of this, legal uncertainty too?
I think we have missed a brilliant opportunity to promote sustainable development and an improved quality of life for the present, and future, generations.
This was also the reason why the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance voted ânoâ in the Conciliation Committeeâs final vote.
I believe that many members of the Greens/ALE Group will in any case vote in favour of the proposal.
That is what I myself am going to do.
Despite these criticisms I have made, I naturally hope that the package of draft legislation will promote open and free procurement and also, when all is said and done, still promote environmental and social considerations in this connection.
Â Â  Mr President, I was wondering exactly what Mrs Thors meant when she said that the proposal was being âsteered into a safe harbourâ, especially as she was looking directly at me at the time.
Mr ZappalÃ  has been the main driver on this issue, but it has been a pleasure to work with many colleagues.
I also want to pay tribute to Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld for her wise leadership that has enabled us to arrive at a very satisfactory outcome to this conciliation.
I would now like to move forward.
The Commissioner gave a very powerful presentation about how important these reform directives are to the completion of the internal market.
They now have to work in practice.
One of the areas we worked on in this conciliation was that of measures that will encourage Member States to get these directives to work properly.
I make no apologies for repeating what I said in my speech at first reading: we know that there are far too many contracts in all areas of public procurement that are not being properly put onto the Official Journal system.
Essentially, governments are allowing their public authorities to evade the provisions of the public procurement system.
We know from good practice in a number of Member States, of which Sweden is probably regarded as the best example, that where governments take this seriously, the provisions start to work effectively.
Examples include setting up independent bodies to advise all the public agencies in the country concerned on how to work with the public procurement directives.
We need to make sure that this is happening.
I would like to pick up on the point made by MrsÂ SchÃ¶rling on behalf of her colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group, and by others, that the contractual terms clearly have to include factors other than economic criteria â as we have seen from the famous Helsinki bus case.
In terms of social and economic criteria this must be done in an open and non-discriminatory way as part of the published tender.
That was the point we secured in conciliation and I think we arrived at a sensible agreement.
This will be part of the new reform procedures that have to go out there and have to work for the sake of delivering and eventually completing the internal market.
Â Â  â Mr President, I agree with Mr Harbour; Captain ZappalÃ  and Captain Berger have indeed âsteered us into a safe harbourâ after we were forced to pass through what were sometimes very choppy seas during this conciliation process.
Let me also say that I am very satisfied with the outcome that we have reached, although â like everyone else â we would obviously have liked to achieve more.
Nonetheless, we have achieved a great deal, and as a Social Democrat, I must also make the point that we have also obtained the endorsement of both the Commission and the Council.
It is very positive, in my view, that we have managed to establish these criteria â as regards sustainability, environmental and social award criteria, and, for example, the special provisions for people with disabilities â and ultimately managed to secure the approval of the Commission and the Council.
I think we can proceed very satisfactorily on this basis.
Yes, we would have liked to achieve more in this area, but we have at least established these criteria as a means of exercising control in the contract award procedures.
We have thus ensured that it will not always be the cheapest tender that is awarded the contract, but the most favourable.
As Mr ZappalÃ  has said very clearly, the most favourable is not necessarily the cheapest, for quality is important as well.
We have achieved something more in this context, something I felt was very important and have repeatedly mentioned.
By ensuring that the public sector has the option of deciding for itself which criteria, if any, it wishes to apply to the contract award procedure, we have strengthened the hand of local authorities.
In this way, a certain measure of freedom has been maintained for the public sector in the regions and at local level, which these authorities need to be able to implement their own economic policies, and I think that this is a positive achievement.
I would like to thank Mrs Berger again for her very good work.
We have secured a positive outcome and we can vote for it with a clear conscience, even though, as I said, it would have been good to have achieved more.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank all those involved in the conciliation.
As Mr ZappalÃ  pointed out, we were not always in agreement, but we did eventually reach a decision.
These two directives are a step forward â not a huge step, as Mrs SchÃ¶rling said, but at least some progress has been made.
Comparing what was there originally with what we have today shows considerable progress.
But why is this?
We have talked tonight about the huge market involved in the whole area of public procurement.
The Commissioner himself mentioned the huge figures involved.
But too often when we talk about that market and about public procurement we talk purely about an economic market.
These two directives change all that: social and environmental criteria have now been introduced.
This means that the tendering authority does not have to accept the lowest tender.
Tendering authorities can also take into account recent case-law and I am glad that the Commissioner highlighted the 4 December judgment.
We also have the July court decision on the Altmark bus case and, as Mrs Thors pointed out, the Helsinki bus case.
This Parliament has added a social dimension to economic legislation.
We must never forget that while we strive for a competitive economy by 2010, this has to be accompanied by social progress.
That is why I will support tomorrow's vote: even though I voted against this conciliation I will actually now vote in favour.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr ZappalÃ , ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to join in the expressions of thanks.
If, though, I compare the speeches that have been made here, I have the impression that the ship has come into several different harbours.
I would like to share my own image of this harbour with you.
Initially, it is true, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats did reject the common position.
We take the view, however, that a number of substantial improvements have been achieved in the conciliation process, bringing the compromise more into line with our ideas, so that we can now vote for the outcome at third reading.
In my view, these improvements lie primarily in the fact that this compromise proposal has a far more market-oriented focus than was the case even with the common position.
The progress on liberalising public procurement through the internal market is maintained and, indeed, built on.
We were worried that through the overemphasis on environmental and social criteria, the internal market would be rolled back compared with the position achieved in 1993.
Thanks to Mrs CederschiÃ¶ldâs inspired leadership, but also due to the very substantial support from the Commission, this threat has been averted, so we can now vote in favour of this compromise result.
We have not achieved all that we set out to achieve.
The proposal still contains a number of very bureaucratic rules, some highly complex regulations and obscure phrasing.
It is therefore not entirely in line with what we wanted in terms of better legislation.
Nonetheless, I think it is also a step towards reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, and I am pleased that the Commission in particular has made such a substantial contribution, which we see lacking in the context of some other legislative proposals.
I would like to thank everyone for the very positive cooperation.
It is nice to be able to finish something that we started in this legislative term, and so we will all breathe a sigh of relief when we leave the Chamber today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is with great pleasure that I am able to note that we are finally obtaining comprehensive EU regulations governing public procurement.
I am of course particularly pleased that these regulations make it possible for those who procure contracts also to use criteria other than price.
I think it is important for us to use public procurement in order also to affect the development of society.
We must favour products and manufacturers that, from a social point of view, operate along the lines we advocate.
Environmental issues are central.
If we wish to reduce food contamination and pollution of the external environment, we must favour manufacturers who have that approach.
If we want to see gender equality in working life, we must favour workplaces where this is promoted.
If we want everyone to have job opportunities and to be able to support themselves, we must of course favour companies that create jobs for people with disabilities.
If we wish to bring about a fairer society that provides greater opportunity for participation, we must ensure that society is designed along those lines.
It might be wondered whether we could have achieved more during the conciliation negotiations.
That is a question that negotiators always ask themselves.
Having devoted most of my adult life to negotiating, I know that, in negotiations, a point must be reached at which the parties agree.
When that point has been reached, as I think it was in our own negotiations, it has to be acknowledged that the time has come to present the result.
I think that the result we have presented in our decision is something we can defend and, in actual fact, be proud of.
Parliamentâs position on public procurement shows that decisions at Community level can be important for achieving a more humane society.
It is an encouraging decision following a time-consuming and, at times, arduous piece of work.
I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this outcome.
Â Â  . Mr President, no questions have been addressed to the Commission and therefore I can afford to be very brief.
I know parliamentary is dear, and therefore I shall use few words.
I should like to say a few things in response to MrsÂ SchÃ¶rling on the issue of production methods.
I should like to reassure her about the findings of the European Court of Justice.
In its ruling of 4 December 2003, the Court confirmed and repeated its finding in the famous Helsinki bus case, namely that a requirement, according to which the energy to be supplied must be produced from renewable sources, is, , admissible.
The Court added that such an award criterion may be given a high importance, and in this case the relative weight was 45%.
To conclude, and to reassure Mrs SchÃ¶rling, the judgment confirms that, both under current law and under the joint text, production methods are legitimate award criteria and may be given quite a high weight provided always that the criterion is formulated and applied in such a way as to meet the four requirements set out explicitly in both the Helsinki case and in recital 1 of the joint text.
I should once again like to express the thanks of the Commission that, as one Member said, work on this important file has been concluded within this legislature.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , the shadow-rapporteur, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, and all who have contributed.
I will end by thanking Mr Miller for agreeing, in the end, to support the proposal, even though he voted against it in the Conciliation Committee.
Â Â  We have also concluded the debate within its allocated time, so there is good news all round.
The vote will be tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0006/2004) by Mrs Corbey, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (PE-CONS 3697/03 â C5-0629/2003 â 2001/0291(COD)).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the verge of giving our approval to the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste.
On 4Â December, Parliamentâs delegation to the Conciliation Committee approved the agreement reached with the Council by a large majority.
As the rapporteur, I am very pleased with this, and I shall explain briefly why.
There were two major points at issue and five minor ones.
I shall begin with the minor points: firstly, the definition of packaging.
I am sure you remember vividly the lobby and the debate on flower pots, CD cases, mascara containers and make-up pots.
Parliament wanted to avoid a continuation of the debate on flower pots.
The solution found is pragmatic: new products are not entered in the annexes, but the Commission is asked to give priority to examining, where necessary, those products that are the subject of legal controversy: CD cases, flower pots, toilet rolls and suchlike.
The Council has accepted the substance of Parliamentâs amendment of the basic definition of packaging.
The second point concerned prevention, which this House saw as important.
The environmental impact of packaging must be minimised.
The introduction of a packaging environment indicator was the main feature of this.
Parliament wants to encourage pilot projects, and its second reading amendment has been accepted almost in its entirety.
This will undoubtedly be elaborated on in the debate on the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling that is already under way.
The third point relates to the report.
The Council has accepted Parliamentâs amendment concerning the scope of the Commissionâs report on the implementation of the Directive almost in its entirety.
The fourth point concerns voluntary agreements.
The possibility of reducing the transposition of certain provisions by means of agreements between the competent authorities and the economic sectors concerned has been fully accepted by the Council.
This point is very important as far as the Netherlands, among others, is concerned.
The last of the minor points concerns the deadlines.
The existing Directive on packaging and packaging waste provides for a limited postponement for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
Parliament was prepared to grant a postponement from 2008 to 2010, the Council preferred 2012, and we agreed on 2011.
The two more difficult points concerned the amendment regarding the new Member States, and the recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
Firstly, regarding the new Member States, the issue was who should establish the deadlines for these countries.
Parliament wanted the Commission to present a proposal on which Parliament and the Council would then take a decision.
The Council preferred to deal with this issue by means of a declaration on bilateral agreements with each acceding country on the basis of ArticleÂ 57 of the Accession Treaty.
Parliament strongly defended its second reading position.
The result was the inclusion of a clearly worded recital in the Directive: this contains the derogation requests by the countries in question, and the final decision will be made in accordance with the appropriate legal procedures.
From the point of view of Parliament, this signifies a considerable improvement on the original position of the Council.
A particularly difficult problem concerned the implications of recent judgments of the Court of Justice for the Directiveâs recovery targets.
The Courtâs interpretation of the concept of ârecoveryâ in recent judgments had been the subject of considerable debate.
In these judgments, the Court of Justice concluded that waste incineration with energy recovery does not constitute recovery if that is not the main purpose of the operation, with the result that some Member States could unexpectedly find themselves in contravention of the Directive, either now or in the future.
Views differed as to how to deal with the matter from a procedural point of view.
Indeed, the implications of the judgments had not been addressed in either the common position or in second reading amendments by Parliament.
The compromise solution finally found was to modify the relevant parts of the text of the original Directive.
This made it clear that waste incinerated at incineration plants with energy recovery can count towards the targets of the Directive.
All things considered, it is my opinion that our Parliament can be very pleased with this result, and, indeed, I recommend that everyone vote in favour of the agreement.
Tomorrowâs vote brings the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste to an end, but not the debate on the wider context of recycling, waste prevention and the use of natural resources.
The debate has already begun in this House, with the discussion on the thematic strategies presented by the Commission.
This agreement on the Directive on packaging and packaging waste points the way towards a new scheme in legislation.
Parliament wanted to see greater emphasis on the environmental impact of the legislation and a flexible way of working.
In an enlarged, more diverse Union, it will no longer be possible for all 25 Member States to set the same targets for recycling and recovery.
Our debates on eco-efficiency at first reading and on the economic cost at second reading lead us almost inescapably to the conclusion that countriesâ optimum recycling percentages can differ substantially, and ultimately we must go down that path, too.
To do so, however, we do have to set clear recycling aims first of all; indeed, that is ultimately the objective of this legislation.
Another aim of this legislation is sustainable development, a concept to which we need to give flesh and blood.
Today, with the revised Directive, we are taking a step towards the modernisation of packaging policy.
A packaging environment indicator has the potential to stimulate the use of more sustainable packaging.
In the longer term, packaging does not need to be an environmental problem, but could contribute to sustainable development.
Constant innovation is the best guarantee of maintaining employment in the packaging sector, and I hope that the revision of the Directive on packaging and packaging waste makes a small contribution to this.
By way of conclusion, I should like to express my warm thanks to all the groups for their cooperation, and to say a word of thanks to the excellent conciliation team under the extremely capable leadership of Vice-President Imbeni.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, following a rather long and difficult negotiation, in the end we are going to have a Directive which, as well as being ambitious, is realistic and, above all, capable of being applied, because the dates and quantitative objectives set in it are well-balanced.
I would therefore like warmly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, and thank her for her work and the flexibility she has shown in order to reach this agreement.
This agreement has not been at all easy because, as well as the long and controversial debates we have held in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we have been faced with additional legal problems, resulting from the judgment of the Court of Justice in relation to what is understood by ârecoveryâ.
I would also like to thank all the Members who have made valuable contributions to improving this Directive and, in particular, the chairperson of the committee, MrsÂ Jackson.
The work has truly been worth the effort, because the packaging Directive will have enormous consequences for the various economic actors involved: local councils, collection systems, companies producing packaging materials, the industry, etc.
I would also like to make a particular appeal to consumers, who make up a sector which is essential to the system, to cooperate by taking all packaging to green points.
Re-use, recycling and recovery are three options for managing waste.
Each has its advantages and disadvantages, but I believe we must support all three because of what they have in common: any of them is always going to be better than depositing waste in dumps.
With regard to the concept of prevention, I believe that, without leaving it aside, we must be flexible, particularly in the case of the agri-foodstuffs industry which â let us not forget â is the biggest user of packaging, since in this field we must balance environmental objectives with the strictest possible food safety criteria.
Furthermore, the packaging-producing industry is already making huge efforts to improve the design of their products for the simple reason that it means a reduction in costs and, at the end of the day, that is a competitive advantage.
As the European Commission has acknowledged, certain Member States will have more difficulty complying with the Directive for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructures, low population density or, simply, consumer habits.
In this regard, I am delighted to have participated in the search for a solution accessible to all.
Portugal, Greece, Ireland and the new Member States are going to have longer time limits for complying with this directive.
I am aware that some of these countries are already making huge efforts and I am sure that they will achieve the objectives set.
Finally, I trust that the problems stemming from the imprecise definition, following the judgment, of what is considered recovery will be urgently resolved for the good of everybody.
Â Â  Mr President, it has been a long hard road on this directive.
We have to thank the rapporteur for all her hard work, we have to congratulate the Parliament for the way in which we took this all the way to conciliation and got a good result, and we now have a very ambitious package in front of us, a packaging package, which, I am afraid, is going to take some Member States a lot of time to digest.
We have set some very tough targets.
We have recognised that this directive will enter into force in a period when we are enlarging the Union and a whole series of standards and objectives that we previously had in the group of 15 will now have to be extended to 25 Member States.
Recognising that we even have weak Member States amongst the current 15, we have sensibly given derogations.
I cannot stand here tonight and say my own country is a shining example of progress as regards the recycling of packaging.
I am afraid we have always been slow, we have always been behind the average and we are going to have to do an awful lot of very hard work in terms of building infrastructure and putting a whole range of measures in place to ensure that we achieve the objectives that we have set down in this legislation.
Along with everyone else, we must do it: if we have signed up to legislation, we must accept the responsibilities of fulfilling the obligations it gives us, and that is something which I think the UK will do and all the Member States must do.
We have to recognise that high environmental standards must be paid for, but high environmental standards will also give us benefits.
We will also, in the longer term, create a cleaner and greener environment for ourselves and for our children.
I commend this package to the House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, packaging waste constitutes a considerable environmental problem.
It is good that targets are being set for waste recycling, but I should like to have seen some more demanding targets.
In Denmark, we are already close to achieving the proposed recycling target.
Not even more demanding targets for the recycling of environmentally hazardous packaging are sufficient, however.
All materials that are damaging to the environment and peopleâs health must be removed from the waste cycle and replaced by ecologically sound alternatives.
Such alternatives do exist now.
The waste problem does not need to become any greater than it is.
What I miss in the directive is reference to the rapid phasing-out of PVCs and phthalates.
As long as PVCs and phthalates are used, a duty must be imposed upon them and used to pay both for the damage that has arisen through the use of PVCs and for the changeover to ecologically sound alternatives.
The polluter-pays principle, confirmed by the Treaty, must be brought into use.
In spite of these shortcomings, I shall vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in MrsÂ Corbeyâs report.
Â Â  Mr President, it has indeed been a long, hard road.
I welcome the outcome of the conciliation talks and I should particularly like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, for her excellent work and understanding of the issues.
As an Irish Member, I believe we have benefited from what has been known as âthe Irish amendmentâ.
It seems a long time since I tabled an amendment for a derogation â not from the targets, but from the timetable â for Ireland, Greece and Portugal and I thank colleagues for their understanding.
We have to get the balance right between ambition and realism when it comes to the matters before us.
I cannot speak for Greece or Portugal â their own Members will do that â but my own country certainly does not have an infrastructure in place to be able to meet the targets within the timetable that was required of other countries, although our Danish colleague has suggested that it is not ambitious enough.
This is a balance which I really welcome.
There is nothing to stop others being more ambitious in achieving delivery.
I thank you sincerely for your understanding of the Irish position on this issue.
As an island nation, Ireland imports 80% of its packaging material and has a very small indigenous recycling possibility; we have a scattered population.
Demographics, infrastructure, size and isolation make it very difficult for Ireland to meet the same targets and deadlines as other countries.
We were way behind when this started and over the last five years have almost caught up.
The extra time we have now been given will hopefully allow us not to look for special treatment after 2011, and that has to be our ambition as a country.
We in Ireland must achieve these targets in terms of managing our packaging waste and waste in general.
At the moment we depend too heavily on exporting our waste, because we do not have the infrastructure in place to do so locally, despite a great catch-up over recent years.
The recovery issue and the judgment of the European Court of Justice really do not impact on Ireland as we have no recovery or incineration facilities at the moment and will not have for some time to come.
No doubt there will be an appeal, but I support that for those countries for which it is relevant.
Again my thanks go to the rapporteur and to all colleagues for their particular understanding.
I welcome what is before us here this evening.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the emphasis in this directive on the need to reduce discarded packaging and the increase in the targets for the recycling of packaging waste.
Like my colleague Mrs Doyle, I am glad to see the derogations agreed for Ireland and indeed also for Portugal and Greece.
I believe it is right and just that the accession countries should have a decisive say in when they feel they can reasonably implement this directive, remembering that they have to face the implementation of so many directives and regulations in the .
In Ireland we have quite recently introduced recycling and there has been a very positive response from the general public.
I feel we need a well-established recycling mentality before moving on in any direction.
Ireland is a net importer and 75% to 80% of our packaging is imported.
We also have a limited capacity to use recycled packaging.
We are not able to access the recycling markets easily and the expense involved is considerable for us.
We need realistic targets as regards the new directives, but the government feels that it can fully implement this directive by 2011.
The European Court of Justice ruling classing incineration as disposal means that we need to find other means of meeting recovery targets, and I would like to say at this point that there is very deep concern generally among Irish citizens regarding the use of incineration.
As other countries are moving away from incineration, I believe that we in the European Union need to look very carefully at the way we are moving in this particular area.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission welcomes the outcome of the conciliation process and is pleased that the co-legislators decided to more than double the recycling target by 2008.
The Commission also welcomes the fact that solutions could be found for two important and difficult issues.
The first is the procedure for adopting a deadline for accession states, and the second is the question of the consequences of the recent court judgment on energy recovery.
Concerning the deadline for the accession countries, a Commission proposal is under preparation.
The Commission thinks that the Parliament needs to be fully involved in this important matter, therefore this proposal will be based on codecision.
On the consequences of the Court judgment the Commission realises that not everybody is happy with the solution of transforming the recovery target into a target for recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery.
However, it would have been difficult to take Member States to court for having interpreted ârecoveryâ in the same way as most Member States and the Commission would have done until the judgment.
The view taken by the co-legislators may indeed avoid a period of legal uncertainty from which no one would have benefited.
However, this should not hide the fact that we need to solve the recovery issue. This must be done, not only for packaging, but also for all waste.
Therefore the Commission thinks that we need to review the status of recovery in the waste framework directive.
The ongoing debate on the thematic strategy on waste prevention and recycling will be an important input to such a view.
The Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, as well as all the Members who have contributed to ensuring the successful outcome of this important legislative process.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0486/2003) by Mrs AvilÃ©s Perea, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on adopting the decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2001 financial year
Section VII â Committee of the Regions (SEC(2002) 405 â C5-0247/2002 â 2002/2107(DEC)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, today we are examining a report which stems from the decision taken on 8 April 2003 to postpone granting discharge for the Committee of the Regionsâ accounts.
