That concludes this item.
2006 annual report on the Euro Area (debate)
The next item is the report by JosÃ© Manuel GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2006 annual report on the euro area (2006/2239 (INI)).
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, this is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on the economic situation in the euro zone and I therefore regard this report as being of unique importance, particularly as this debate - this analysis that we are conducting jointly for the first time - is taking place at a time when the situation is both politically complex and economically uncertain.
I say it is politically complex because, as we are dealing with institutional issues here, I cannot ignore the fact that the debate on what to do with the Constitutional Treaty is still ongoing.
Another point that I cannot ignore, either, is that this report is being debated within a 'new era' in terms of monetary policy - with interest rates that have been rising for some time and threaten to keep on rising - and at a stage when we are embarking on the new Stability and Growth Pact as revised by the Commission, and when the Member States are for the first time coming before the European institutions to account for what they have done regarding the Lisbon Strategy in their national reform plans.
I say that the situation is economically confused because, while I agree with the Commission's view that the economic situation is good, or at least much better than it was previously, I must emphasise that our potential 2% growth is not enough to absorb Europe's unemployed, to keep pace with our competitors or to maintain our standard of living.
As is customary in this House, this report is divided into several sections: macroeconomic policy; reforms, with special emphasis on the internal market; and institutional issues, focusing on economic policy coordination and external representation.
In the area of macroeconomic policy, there is nothing really new other than what we said in the debate on the broad economic guidelines.
What the doctor prescribes for our macroeconomic policy is more stability, more stability and more stability.
On monetary policy, the point that we highlight - and I repeat that we are highlighting institutional issues - is that we would like to see greater transparency and openness in the European Central Bank.
We would like to know why it does what it does, and how it manages and takes into account the two pillars on which it bases its decisions.
That is why we are asking for short minutes to be published showing the arguments for and against a particular decision.
On the subject of budgetary policy, this report's first finding is that monetary policy may be losing the momentum that it has shown so far, and budgetary policy must take up the torch.
That, as I have highlighted before, leads us to call on the Commission to adhere to a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and on the Member States to work harder at cutting their deficits, especially in good times.
Something new that we are calling for is greater coordination of Member States' fiscal calendars and of the economic forecasts that they use in making their budgetary projections.
It does not make sense for countries taking part in the European Economic Union to use different forecasts of oil prices or of interest or exchange rate trends; in our dialogue with the national parliaments, we should like everyone to know what we are talking about.
On the matter of public debt, we also call on the Member States, as usual, to make a greater effort to cut public debt in order to free up resources and to address the Lisbon Strategy and the budgetary challenges that will result from the ageing of our population.
The last point - which has been repeated already - is to review our fiscal systems in order to enhance the competitiveness of Europe's economy.
With regard to reforms, we prescribe Lisbon and more Lisbon.
We want the public to see how well each Member State is performing.
We therefore call for a code of conduct that will enable us to put greater pressure on the slowest countries and, through the dissemination of good practice, enable them to see how countries at the top of the class operate.
Regarding the internal market, we need freedom and more freedom, in contrast to the protectionist temptations that we have seen in recent years, as well as development of the services market.
In short, we want consolidation of fundamental freedoms.
As regards institutional issues - I want to focus on improving the way the Union operates - we call for a trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament to take place quarterly, in parallel with the dialogue that we have with the European Central Bank, although I am aware that the Commissioner is not enamoured with the idea.
To facilitate this trialogue, we ask that the Eurogroup draw up a roadmap showing which way the euro zone will be heading in the next two years.
We call on the Commission to provide us, in subsequent reports, with a more specific toolbox in order to promote such talks, and we invite the Commissioner and the Council to meet with us every three months.
On the matter of external representation, we find that it is not consistent with the international weight of the euro.
We are pleased that the Member States spoke with one voice at the meetings of the international institutions in Singapore, and we call for greater coordination and imagination to ensure that the Member States are represented as a single entity in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international bodies.
I am grateful to all the shadow rapporteurs and all my fellow Members for the efforts that they have made.
Member of the Commission.
(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo and the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the interest that it has shown in analysing this first Commission Annual Report on the Euro Area, whose main objective is to promote dialogue and debate between our two institutions with a view to identifying the priority measures that will improve the way that the whole area operates.
Since I had the opportunity to present this report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in July, the predictions for growth in the euro zone for this year and the following two years have significantly improved.
Last week I presented our autumn predictions, which can be summarised by saying that all of the economic indicators are pointing in the right direction: rising economic growth, which is the highest in the euro zone since the start of the decade, falling unemployment, stable inflation and clear reduction in public deficits.
The factors that have contributed to this positive picture include external factors, such as the sustained strength of the global economy, but also internal factors, which contradict the image of stagnation and paralysis that has been used to portray European economies, and in particular the economy of the euro zone.
Among these internal factors are the reforms in several countries in the euro zone in recent years, the budgetary consolidation efforts and the response of European economies to the significant increase in oil prices, which is more efficient than many expected.
The existence of the euro zone has also significantly contributed to this favourable climate, thanks to the good finance conditions for families and businesses provided by the current level of interest rates and also thanks to the protection the euro has provided against the turbulence of the financial markets, as occurred in the spring.
However, all of these positive factors do not invalidate the main conclusions of the Commission report on measures that should enable us to improve the operation of the area, which the majority of you agree with, according to Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo's report.
I am talking about the need to go further with structural reforms, to consolidate the single market and to ensure more effective and integrated external representation of the euro zone than there has been so far.
These three priorities, which are set out in the report, will also be included in the Annual Economic Report that I will present to the Commission on 22 November, which this year focuses on the operation of Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, of the euro zone, in the light of the eight years of experience that have been accumulated.
Having examined these three priorities and in relation to economic reforms I agree with the statement made in the report regarding the importance of carrying out the reforms promised by the Member States in the national reform plans as part of the Lisbon Strategy.
Once monetary policy has been unified and budgetary policy has been made part of the Stability and Growth Pact, the economic policies of each of the national governments should make the necessary adjustments in terms of productivity, competitiveness and the operation of markets in order to ensure a high degree of convergence within the area.
In December, based on the reports submitted by the Member States, the Commission will adopt the report on the first year of application of the national reform plans.
Our report will include an explicit evaluation of the degree to which each of the Member States has put these reforms into practice and, if we consider it to be necessary, we will give recommendations for each of the countries.
We will also include an evaluation in the report of what we the European institutions have done in application of the reforms required for the Lisbon Community programme.
We agree, as I said before, on the need to go further with the internal market, which, along with the single currency, is one of the two essential instruments for promoting more efficient allocation of resources and offering greater opportunities to businesses and more choice to consumers.
The integration of the financial system is also a top priority for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.
In this sector, the roadmap is set out in the Commission White Paper on financial services covering the 2005-2010 period.
With regard to external representation of the euro zone, I can confirm that the European Parliament agrees on the need for coherent external representation.
As I had the opportunity to explain in one of my recent speeches to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the European Union spoke with once voice in Singapore, as Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo has just reiterated.
In October, after this meeting, both in the Eurogroup and in Ecofin, we debated this matter again and arrived at some additional agreements that are moving in the right direction.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo's report also contains comments on monetary policy and on the application of the Treaty criteria for expanding the euro zone.
The European Central Bank is one of the most transparent central banks in the world and this perception is highly valued by the markets, which appreciate the Bank's communication policy.
With regard to the application of the inflation criteria for the enlargement of the euro zone, which we have debated many times in this House recently, I refer to what has been said so far.
Finally, I do not know what doubts Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo has perceived.
I am entirely in favour of dialogue with this House on the operation of the euro zone.
The Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well aware of this, as just a few days ago I had the opportunity to discuss with her how we can put it into practice.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this report; not only is there no dispute about that, but we also say 'yes' to its demands, its analysis and its substance.
By way of elaboration, I would like to say something about six fundamentals.
The first is that the euro is the EU's most potent response to globalisation.
The second is that it may be the most important instrument for a successful internal market, but it is not the only one; it must go hand-in-hand with the accelerated implementation of the four freedoms in the internal market by means of pro-active innovation, the removal of structural weaknesses and the stabilisation of the social security, pensions and health systems.
Thirdly, all EU Member States need to join the euro zone.
Any EU Member State that resists the euro and sets itself in opposition to the euro zone, that fails to make every effort to become part of the European currency area, weakens the internal market and lessens the European Union's resistance to the effects of globalisation.
Fourthly, the Maastricht criteria are the entry ticket, and I am glad that the Commission, in its decisions over recent months, has held fast to them.
Fifthly, the Stability and Growth Pact is the necessary framework for budget policy.
We demand that cyclical increases in revenue be used to reduce deficits and states' debts.
Sixthly, according to today's newspapers, the French interior minister, Mr Sarkozy, is calling for the euro zone to be under European economic government.
Those who want to strengthen the European economy need to ratify the constitution and endow the Commission with the necessary powers; that is why we favour a strong euro on world markets and a single voice in the IMF, along with a European foreign minister to enable the European Union to carry some global clout.
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the opportunity presented to us by this debate in plenary to review together the operation of the euro zone at a time when, as you have said, the outlook in certain areas is improving, yet when all agree that the potential for growth is not fully realised and when our economies are handicapped by an exchange rate that makes euro zone exports difficult and leads some of our businesses to contemplate relocation in order to produce their goods in the dollar zone.
This report presents an opportunity for review at a time when the Stability Pact has been revised and all agree that the commitments made by the Member States of the euro zone perhaps need to be better differentiated from the commitments made outside of the zone.
From this point of view, the report is valuable, and I believe that we must also congratulate our fellow Member Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo on the spirit in which he approached it.
We need to go further than reforming the Stability Pact in order to better coordinate timeframes and data and to ensure that, essentially, the Commission and the Central Bank do not evaluate the performances of the Member States of the euro zone solely from the point of view of their deficits, but also in the light of their strengths and weaknesses in a wider context.
You mentioned this in your speech, Commissioner, and I am grateful for your having done so.
I invite you, moreover, to continue along these lines.
There is also a need to link macro-economic analysis more closely with developments on the financial markets.
Furthermore, the way in which rating agencies have been able to be involved in the Italian question and to assess that country's debt must prompt us to be more vigilant, since, if rating agencies had to take a high-level role in the assessment of the debts of the Member States, there would be a very serious risk with regard to the leadership of the euro zone.
One final word, Commissioner, to reinforce what has been said by several others on the subject of exchange rates: we need more economic policies and economic leadership in this area.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic and Monetary Union, with a common currency, is the highest level of economic integration the European Union has thus far reached.
The euro zone has already been operating for six years, and its first enlargement revealed that the Maastricht criteria established more than a decade ago no longer correspond to the reality of the enlarging EU and the developing global economy.
The euro zone countries are unable to implement the indicators that are important for the operation of the euro zone, especially the requirement for price stability.
The European Commission (according to the EC Treaty) and the European Central Bank are both applying different criteria of price stability to the euro zone.
According to the European Central Bank, price stability ensures lower inflation, which is still close to 2%.
Based on the methods of the European Commission, the stability of prices in the euro zone is established by considering more than just the rate of inflation of the euro zone countries and, therefore, it is impossible to eliminate uncharacteristic inflation factors.
I call on the Commission and the European Central Bank to work together on improvement of the concept of euro zone price stability and methods for its establishment in order to avoid misapprehensions in the process of euro zone enlargement and implementation of indicators in the euro zone itself.
I invite euro zone Member States to properly implement the euro zone membership criteria that were adopted by the Member States themselves for better economic integration.
Furthermore, I would like to emphasise that structural reforms are necessary for the successful competition of both the European Union and the euro zone in the global economy, and especially in further implementation of a domestic market with free movement of services, which has contributed to the competitiveness of the European Union.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commission, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil for this report on the situation in the euro zone.
The rapporteur observes that the prognoses for the euro zone look better than they have done for a long time.
That depends, of course, on what economic policy it is intended to conduct.
The policy pursued so far has not exactly been a success.
Large parts of Europe are in social and economic crisis.
According to the latest statistics, seven million people are living in poverty in Europe's largest economy, Germany.
One of the causes of this is, specifically, economic and monetary union.
EMU is presided over by the world's most conservative central bank when it comes to inflation, and its Stability Pact stymies economic policy.
As the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) recently observed in a report, it is not more of this inflexible policy that we need.
Instead, the peoples of Europe need an active financial policy and a reorganisation of EMU.
As you know, my own country, Sweden, is not a member of EMU.
In 2003, a clear majority voted against participating in it.
That is why I am rather disturbed to read the report, which notes that, as from 2007, the euro zone will comprise 13 Member States but that - and I quote - 'macro-economic policy coordination and the internal market will involve all 27 Member States'.
What does that mean?
Does it mean that Sweden, which has voted against EMU, will have to participate in it sooner or later?
I should be grateful for an answer from the Commission and also from the rapporteur, if he is given the floor at the end of the debate.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in our discussion of the 2006 annual report on the situation in the euro zone there are two points I would like to make.
The first is the much lower economic growth rate and higher unemployment in the countries of the European Union, and in the euro zone in particular, than in the USA and in the emerging markets such as China and India.
Economic growth in the euro zone will in 2005-2007 be almost half of that of the USA, while unemployment will be almost twice as high.
The second point is the higher economic growth rate and the lower unemployment rates in three of the fifteen countries which did not join the euro zone compared with countries inside the zone.
No wonder that those countries are not rushing to join the single currency.
The new Member States now have even greater reservations about joining the euro zone, even though they are continuing to work hard to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, growth in the euro zone has been the lowest in the world for many years, as it was in 2006 as well.
But instead of looking for the causes at home, in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank, attempts are being made to impose the so-called harmonisation of budgetary and tax policies in the Member States.
This is an attempt to hobble the initiative of Member States, a kind of diktat imposed by the stronger on the weaker.
If the point of creating a common currency was firstly, to simplify the system and thereby to reduce costs, secondly to attract foreign investment, and thirdly, to make use of the privilege of issuing currency and creating a new world currency, then in the latter two cases the desired effect has not been achieved.
Foreign investment continues to focus on the United States and Asia.
Demand for the euro as a world currency is comparatively weak.
The opposite effect has been achieved: keeping interest rates high and artificially bolstering the euro has undermined the competitiveness of European manufacturers and reduced export earnings.
The common currency and the policy of the ECB appear to be serving the interests of finance capital at the cost of businessmen, consumers and the Member States' national budgets.
The single currency has had an indirect impact on the exports of the new Member States by slowing their development and holding them back.
We therefore take the view that there needs to be a radical review of EU monetary doctrine towards restoring authority over currency issue and interest rates to the monetary authorities of the Member States.
(DE) Mr President, we can all, in fact, take pride in the euro.
Much of what was predicted before its introduction has not come to pass, but there are three things that need constant emphasis.
One is that the tax revenues that are now coming in must actually be used to reduce deficits, and we demand this in paragraph 5 of the report.
Another is the urgent demand that the Maastricht criteria be rigorously applied.
Relaxing them again, in the way they have been in the past, will surely get us nowhere.
Thirdly, there is transparency.
The ECB lags a long way behind global standards.
The ongoing failure to produce anything like adequate minutes of decisions - or indeed any at all - defies comprehension, and this state of affairs is in urgent need of improvement.
Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
It underlines the need for cooperation in strengthening the European economy.
It is fair to say that the euro has provided Europe with stability that we have never seen before.
When I listened earlier to my Swedish colleague, it sounded as though it was a problem for the European economy to have low interest rates.
However, the truth is that we have lower interest rates than ever before.
Does anyone think that the European economy would have been better if we had the interest rates of the 1970s or 1980s, or if we had the budget deficits of those years when Europe was losing out in the European economy?
Let us stop dreaming and look at the reality.
Today we have a common currency that places the emphasis on and encourages competition, trade and investment and focuses on the need for structural reforms, as well as the need for fiscal discipline.
That is good.
That provides us with opportunities, because the problem of the European economy is not the interest rates, it is the lack of deregulation, it is the lack of more trade and of more of the internal market.
We can see that we are more efficient and more successful since we opened up the markets.
I believe that the euro will never be stronger than the European economy and the discipline of the countries participating in the euro.
That also underlines the need for the European Central Bank to be independent, as underlined in the report.
That is very important, because otherwise we will lose credibility.
From a Swedish perspective, we will soon have the euro in a number of new countries around the Baltic Sea.
I hope we will have a debate in my country that will make it possible for us to join them and other euro countries in the years to come.
(DE) Mr President, I am glad that the Commission has produced this report and that it is committed to observing what happens to the euro zone, but equally glad to be able to say that Mr Juncker's presence here today means that there will be a contribution to our debate from the person who has the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the euro zone's members.
So, then, where do we stand?
For the first time, we have got closer to the growth target that we set ourselves in Lisbon; growth in the euro zone now stands at 2.8%, which is almost the 3% that we took as a base figure at Lisbon.
In this situation, what is the challenge for the euro zone?
What is the essential thing that is at stake?
Will we be content with this being nothing more than a little gust of air, no more than an upturn in the cycle that will be gone by tomorrow, or do we want to put something structural in place to ensure that we can draw a deep breath and get the chance to generate a long-term upturn that will last and will - since it is not merely data that make the economy, but people - foster popular confidence?
That is why I believe that we have to make the effort to do what is now needed, namely to make smart investments in the euro zone.
Yes, consolidating budgets is a good thing to do, but we cannot simply chant that as a mantra when what we need to be doing is making use of the upturn we are experiencing now in order to embark on a policy of intelligent modernisation that gives us a chance of seriously reducing unemployment, and that, too, is in the report.
Finally, I would like to thank our co-rapporteur and shadow rapporteur Mr Rosati, who contributed to our discussions on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and I do not want to omit Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, to whom thanks are due for having - and not for the first time - made an essential and seminal contribution to macro-economic debate in this House.
Mr President, events seem to have overtaken this report.
In spite of Commissioner Almunia's comments, its upbeat projections for growth in the euro zone contrast sharply with the economic data released at the end of last week, which put growth in the French economy at zero.
There are also signs of faltering growth across the euro zone, which will not be helped by the austere taxation regimes being introduced in Germany and Italy next year to meet the euro zone's stability requirements.
What this report does not tell us is that the Government of Italy is on the brink of collapse because of Mr Prodi's determination to introduce tax increases and budget cuts demanded by the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs to bring Italy into line with the Maastricht Treaty.
It also does not mention the riots in Hungary following the Hungarian Prime Minister's revelations that he had lied morning, noon and night about the tax increases and public spending that he had secretly promised that same Commissioner.
Forcing many of our new members of the EU to abide by deflationary policies designed for the more developed economies of the euro zone is generating weak demand, weak growth and mass unemployment.
This report also fails to mention that the Maastricht Treaty has turned the Eastern Europeans into second-class citizens: they have no chance of joining the euro zone in the foreseeable future, while having to manage their economies in line with its requirements.
Sooner or later the people of Europe are going to get restless with a system that keeps them permanently in the economic slow lane, while denying them any democratic say in how it should be run.
(SK) I would like to welcome and support the proposal by the opposition in the European Parliament concerning the 2006 declaration on the anniversary of the euro zone.
In particular, I would like to highlight the passage calling for a thorough examination of the mechanism of the three Member States that are the best performers in terms of price stability, and the methods for calculating the reference inflation rates.
The point is that the varying rates of inflation among the euro zone Member States do not reflect different approaches to macroeconomic policy, but are rather the result of structural factors.
This premise, I believe, applies especially to the new Member States of the European Union.
The relative share of energy-intensive and raw material-intensive output in many of these countries is greater than in the euro zone.
A major portion of this output is then transported to the euro zone either directly or as part of finished products, for instance in respect of the sheet metal used to manufacture car bodies.
Because of these structural reasons, the new Member States are more susceptible to fluctuations in the price of energy and raw materials; by the same token, they serve as a buffer that absorbs the impact of price changes on the euro zone.
This problem particularly affects the Slovak Republic.
The current approach to assessing inflation criteria is, therefore, inappropriate and may in the long run diminish the chances of new Member States gaining entry to the euro zone, even if they comply with all other requirements.
(HU) Mr President, first of all, I congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur for their consideration of this difficult subject.
I am particularly pleased with the remarks concerning the flexibility of the labour market and the goal-oriented approach to education.
I believe that our conclusions point in a single direction.
As someone from one of the eastern European countries waiting to join the euro zone, I would like to make only four brief remarks:
First: with respect to the enlargement of the euro zone, no other standard for admission should be applied than the political standard that applies to those who are already inside.
Second: it is important that the new Member States join as soon as possible, and therefore there can be no interpretation, above all in the matter of inflation, sustainability and the reference level, which would in practice postpone for a long time the accession of the new Member States, which are still lagging behind the EU economic average, and are thus still in the process of catching up in terms of wage and price levels.
This is a point on which Mr KozlÃ­k has given a very good explanation.
Third: I agree that the statistics of the Member States have to be closely monitored, and that the Commission must respond with political tools, if nothing else, such as informing a European Summit, if a Member State is particularly undisciplined and heading in the wrong direction.
In the long run, turning a blind eye is unacceptable.
The Commission has a political responsibility as well in this regard.
Fourth: deepening the internal market is essential, and it is important that everyone observes the criteria.
The new Member States are doing this.
However, there is a contradiction: on the one hand, the labour market, the Schengen zone, remains closed to the new Member States, and the Labour-Intensive Services and the Posting of Workers directives are very restrictive.
On the other hand, however, we are obliged to open up the market in financial services to everyone.
This imbalance does not make the integration of Member States any easier from the perspective of deepening the internal market.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report contains several interesting and welcome recommendations for which I would like to thank the rapporteur.
Thus, instead of simply calling for public spending cuts, the report recommends freeing up resources to make what are presumably necessary public investments in education, training, infrastructure and research.
Furthermore, instead of recommending wage cuts, the European Parliament admits - that is in fact the term that is used - that, in the long term, real wages and productivity should grow simultaneously.
I would thank the rapporteur for his efforts at moderation and conciliation.
However, the subject of this debate is the economic performance of the euro zone.
In fact, I believe that, despite the recent and even unexpected improvement of growth indicators, the economic situation remains fragile and unsatisfactory.
After all, the Commission's macroeconomic policy affects the daily lives of millions of Europeans whose purchasing power, I would point out, is threatened by stagnating salaries and by an increase in the cost of living and whose working conditions continue to decline, while social protection is also dwindling.
The practical response offered by the Commission and the European Central Bank is always the same: to fight inflation through budgetary austerity and wage cuts, while increasing competition in the services, capital, products and labour markets.
Perhaps the time has come to evaluate the results of this policy and to consider whether dismantling public services, deregulating the labour market and cutting public expenditure really is a sustainable way of driving growth in the euro zone and in the European Union.
Unfortunately, no period of reflection is on the agenda.
In two days, we shall have to give our opinion on a 'services' directive that is admittedly improved, but that remains true to Fritz Bolkestein's deregulatory model.
In a few months' time, we will have on our agenda a directive proposing the end of the public postal service.
As for energy, despite the chronic instability of the oil-producing zones, despite the gas blackmail exercised by a neighbouring country, despite global warming and despite power cuts extending across half of Europe, it is all to no avail and the response remains the same: to complete the liberalised and deregulated internal energy market in Europe.
The euro zone's economic report is perhaps a little better this year, but its social and political performance remains, in my eyes, as bad as ever.
(EL) Mr President, I have been listening to the speakers all this time, especially the competent Commissioner, Mr Almunia, arguing in favour of the canonisation of the euro.
But is that really the case?
Perhaps, what we are tying to canonise, here in this Chamber, is the bad demon of the citizens of Europe which we represent?
The value of the euro rises and we are all delighted.
However, at the same time, the number of citizens living below the poverty line also rises.
Of the 500 million people in Europe of 27, 100 million people are living below the poverty line.
In other words, people who can only afford meat once a fortnight, who cannot buy clothes for their children, who cannot change their car until they have had it for 15 years.
What does the euro mean to these people?
I would remind you that it started with an imperium.
We do not want one and two euro notes and yet 75% of daily transactions are below the 5 euro line.
We are delighted that the euro is rising.
It has risen from 0.87 cents to the dollar to 1.30.
What does that mean?
No country which does not have proprietary products can sell to the United States of America or other countries.
Of course Germany can sell Mercedes because it is a Mercedes, but how can my country, which has no proprietary products, sell to America - the big market - when it can find the same product in a neighbouring country outside EMU for a third of the price?
How will tourists come to Greece or, Mr Almunia, how will American tourists go to Spain when it is impossible to monitor the value of the euro.
Can we not look at all this?
Can we not address all this?
It is a huge problem and you have a huge responsibility in the Commission, especially you personally, Mr Almunia.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we who live in the euro zone must, of course, make it our concern to leave our children in as little debt as possible, not under any circumstances must we, in our striving for a more vigorous economy, dispense with social standards.
Whenever we are invited to compare our growth rate with that of the USA, the lack of virtually any kind of social system in the United States must not be left out of the equation.
I do not think that we are going to catch them up by forcing masses of public sector workers into retirement and privatising their jobs, or by means of jobs paying EUR 1 an hour combined with the forcing of more and more staff into what appears to be self-employment.
We have, in the past, seen more and more of the family silver being sold off in order to gain membership of the euro club, and that must come to an end; we must instead make the effort to get on top of the explosive growth of black-market work, to cut down the bureaucratic hurdles that face small and medium-sized businesses, some of which are becoming harder to surmount, and make it easier for such businesses to get access to grants.
Only then will the euro zone have a future characterised by growth.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, it gives me great satisfaction to announce my support for the European Commission's presentation of the first annual report on the situation in the euro zone.
The report provides a good basis for discussing the main challenges facing the euro zone now and in the coming years.
There is plenty to discuss.
The average growth rate in the euro zone in 2001-2005 was a mere 1.9%.
Unemployment rose to 13 million, and the situation with public finances got worse, rather than improving.
Last year did bring a slight improvement in the situation, as you were kind enough to confirm, but this does not change the fact that Europe is falling further behind not just the United States and Japan, but also the Asian boom countries.
Unresolved structural problems lie at the root of European stagnation.
The high cost of setting up and running a business, high overheads on labour costs, reluctance to innovate, and the maintenance of harmful barriers to the labour market and the services market all reduce the competitiveness of European firms, holding back growth and increasing pressure on public finances.
It prevents us from making full use of the opportunities offered by a common currency and a uniform monetary policy.
I therefore call upon the European Commission to put pressure on the Member States to speed up implementation of the necessary reforms.
The need for this has been demonstrated in numerous reports and studies, including the Shapiro report and the high-level report made under the chairmanship of Wim Kok.
Macroeconomic policy in the euro zone needs to be improved.
What is missing above all is proper coordination of fiscal policy among the Member States.
At the same time, the common currency requires fiscal discipline which needs to be observed jointly by all Member States.
This will make it possible to balance macroeconomic policy and to restore a proper policy mix.
Monetary policy needs to be based on clear, transparent rules, and must be more forward-looking in character.
Excessive secrecy in decision-making, lack of clear regulations on the role played by the 'two pillars' of monetary policy, particularly the M3 monetary supply, which create serious doubts regarding the rules for appointing members of the board of the European Central Bank, all restrict the effectiveness and transparency of the common monetary policy, and may undermine the position of the common currency.
A substantial element in strengthening the euro zone is expanding it and taking on new members.
In this process we must observe the rule that candidates are bound by the treaty, the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty.
This means that they must meet the criteria set out in the treaty, but also that additional requirements cannot be imposed upon them.
I am convinced that the accession of new euro zone members, whose deficit and public debt levels are often much lower than those of the other Member States, will help to strengthen the euro zone.
In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Juncker, the president of the Euro Group, for taking part in our debate, and hope that it will inspire him and help him to manage the Euro Group even better.
I would also like to thank Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil for preparing this excellent report, and give my full agreement to the majority of the proposals made in it.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, thank you very much to all of the Members for their contributions.
I think that the debate shows that it is useful to have a report like this every year on the operation of the euro zone and its results, this being the first time that it has been adopted by the Commission and is being debated in Parliament.
As a conclusion to today's debate, I can make an optimistic observation: the euro zone is growing again, despite the fact that some said that it was a zone of very low growth.
The euro zone is growing by 2.6% this year, perhaps even more at the end of the financial year.
The euro zone is creating jobs and reducing unemployment.
According to our predictions, between now and 2008, five million jobs are going to be created in the euro zone.
It is not said very often, but it is true that since the beginning of this decade, despite low growth, in the euro zone and of course also in the whole of the European Union, significantly more jobs have been created than in the United States, which always establish themselves as the reference point to be imitated in policies and strategies for job creation.
I therefore think that, if we analyse the operation of the area and the results that we are achieving through monetary integration, there are elements that could justify a moderately optimistic assessment.
However, it is also true that there are elements that should continue to attract our attention, as there is still a great deal to do.
There is still a great deal to do, as many of you have said, in order to increase potential growth and continue to reduce unemployment, so that greater growth and a higher level of employment can improve the lives of our citizens, reduce inequalities and offer more solid bases for our social protection systems and for our social services system.
This firstly requires, as many of you have said, that we continue to comply and comply better with the stability and budgetary discipline criteria laid down in the Treaty and implemented through the application of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is being applied in a reasonably positive way on which there is a consensus.
We also need to continue with the reforms and go further with the Lisbon Strategy, because this plan of eliminating barriers and facilitating the four freedoms has proven to be a solid basis for creating better conditions in which to face the future.
It also requires, according to the analysis and many of its conclusions, better governance in the euro zone.
I think that the efficiency of the operation of the Eurogroup, since it has had a stable presidency, led by Mr Juncker, who is with us today, has improved.
It is enabling us to make better progress in analysis, mutual understanding and coordinating decisions that affect the Member States, but which cannot be imposed on them from above, and need to be adopted by consensus, with their full conviction, and in accordance with their competences.
We also need to strengthen dialogue.
If any of you still have any doubts, ladies and gentlemen, in the opinion of the Commission, and in my opinion, as the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, we need to enhance bilateral dialogue between the Commission and Parliament on these matters.
I think that we need to move forward in a tripartite dialogue between the Presidency of the Eurogroup, the Commission and Parliament, on the following matters: the operation of the Eurogroup, on any subjects that draw our attention and, if you agree, I also think that we need to move forward with a dialogue including, while fully respecting its independence, the European Central Bank and why not? which has a monetary dialogue with you but also has a monthly dialogue with us.
I think that Parliament can and should, every now and again, be part of this exchange of views between all of the institutions, whose common goal is for the euro zone to operate correctly and for the euro, our common currency, to produce the best possible results for all the citizens of Europe.
President of Eurogroup. (FR) Mr President, I should like first of all to apologise for being late.
The Luxembourg-Strasbourg route is terribly congested at the entrance to Strasbourg, and traffic jams prevented me from arriving on time.
Being conscious not to disturb the peace and quiet of the people of Strasbourg, I did not want to 'go all out'; I scrupulously adhered to the highway code, and I was the first to suffer, since I have arrived late for this debate.
Nevertheless, I should like to tell you that I attach importance to this debate because Parliament's thoughts are not only important in themselves, but they also sustain the debates within Eurogroup, which I chair, assisted, inspired, driven and spurred on by the Commissioner for Monetary Affairs, my friend, Mr Almunia.
I should like to begin by saying, Mr President, that I believe that we have strong growth: it is expanding and it is not under threat, despite the attempts to dampen it down, particularly on the part of France.
The employment rate is rising and unemployment is going down, although it has not attained acceptable levels.
As regards growth, if we look at it in perspective, it is probably stronger than we think at present and is, at any rate, stronger than we thought six months ago.
In 2007, we shall have to see to what extent the cyclical slowdown in the United States affects the economic performance of the euro zone.
At Eurogroup, we believe that the impact of the US slowdown on the euro zone economies will be less marked than in 2000-2001.
We see that the US cyclical slowdown is primarily hitting the building sector and that it is not going to spread to other sectors of the US economy.
Thus the impact on growth in the euro zone will be less marked than before, even though the country-by-country results will reveal some big differences.
Why have we attained a level of growth that seems more acceptable to us today than it did a few years ago?
Firstly, because the euro has protected us to a huge extent over the past few years.
It is never said enough, when the introduction of the euro is reviewed: the euro has protected us, is protecting us and will continue to protect us!
Imagine the state of the European economy and the state of the European monetary systems if the euro had not existed during times of crisis!
During this period, when preliminary work was being done on the euro, we witnessed the Latin American, Russian and South East Asian financial crises.
Imagine how out of control our system would have let things get before the European system was implemented, at the time of the war in Iraq and of 11 September 2001!
Imagine what the performance of the European currencies would be if they still existed, while the geostrategic dramas being played out are a constant cause for concern!
Imagine how certain national currencies would have performed after the French and Dutch 'No' votes!
The euro has protected us, and it has even protected countries that expressed some misgivings about Europe when it came to their approving the Constitutional Treaty.
The budgetary situation improved when, in all wisdom and with the agreement and often even the active support of Parliament, we amended and reformed the Stability and Growth Pact.
Some people felt they were entitled to express their grave concerns following the adoption of the reformed pact.
We see today that the mechanisms of the reformed pact are holding up well and that all the governments are making every effort to implement the main rules and guiding principles contained therein.
The budget deficits are decreasing, and a general consensus is emerging, which is aimed at all of the Member States taking the prevention aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact seriously: they have all decided to allocate as a priority the fiscal surpluses resulting from the cyclical upturn to the reduction in the deficit and to the reduction in the level of public debt.
I welcome that decision.
We, at Eurogroup, are giving more thought to stepping up budgetary controls and we are doing so together with the Commission, whose cordial manner of assisting Eurogroup's presidency is proving to be very effective.
We will see during our next meeting - which will be held towards the end of November, and thus after my visit to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which you, Mrs BerÃšs, expertly chair - how we can step up these budgetary controls.
We will do so, from now on, on the basis of a Commission horizontal report, which will not fail to emphasise the real political problems that exist, including the political-economic ones, or to draft specific recommendations - the form of which we have yet to decide on - to the various Member States, and even to the entire euro zone.
With regard to the currency area as a whole, I should like us to take what is, by now, a long-standing invitation from the Commission seriously this year, and that is to devote a specific chapter of the European Council's conclusions - when it examines the progress made by the Lisbon Strategy - to the euro zone, a chapter that includes the structural reforms that we will have to implement within the various member states of the euro zone.
As regards the structural reform problem, I would quite simply say, Mr President, that we underestimate the value that these structural reforms have already added to the coherence of the euro zone.
I do not agree with all - or in general, some - of the structural reforms that have been implemented within all the Member States, but the fact is that, contrary to the idea, to the image that we very often present of the euro zone, an important raft of structural reforms is underway, and we are now already reaping the rewards of this far-reaching structural reform that we have implemented with regard to the euro zone.
When you look closely at the national reform programmes that the various Member States have introduced, you will see that there are many structural solutions, that they are generally in line with each other and that we must proceed further with this raft of reforms, without for all that lapsing into unsavoury neoliberalism and into a boundless, shameless form of frenetic deregulation, to which I am opposed because I still believe that the euro and the euro zone and the consistency of the policies that we will be implementing would gain in credibility if we supplemented our work on structural reforms with the implementation of a set of minimum social rights. This would guarantee all workers, throughout the euro zone, a number of minimum rights, which the Member States, in trying to enhance their national fighting spirits, could not undermine.
Workers in Europe have a right to know where they stand.
We must stop giving the impression that the monetary Union is a business that is run by the ministers of finance, the bankers and the big investors and big businesses and that it actually works against the most basic rights of workers, who do, after all, make up the majority of the population in Europe.
I should like to say a word about the enlargement of the euro zone.
I disagree with all those who imply that we, in the euro zone, have become stricter than before towards the new Member States which want to join the zone.
The criteria that we are applying are those laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht.
There has been no demand to change the criteria that we adopted when the Treaty was signed in Maastricht, on 7 February 1992.
There is no question of abandoning the nominal convergence policy so as to replace it with a criterion that would omit the application of certain criteria, which the first members of the euro zone had to meet.
As for those who call into question the nominal convergence criteria, in non-theoretical terms, I would guard them against the genuine risks of seeing the nominal convergence criteria replaced by real convergence criteria.
The application of real convergence criteria would make the new Member States' accession to the euro zone a very distant prospect.
I therefore think that we would be wise to confine ourselves to the criteria that are currently ours, and this policy will enhance the credibility of the euro zone.
The way in which the euro zone is represented outside Europe does, in fact, warrant a lengthy explanation, but a brief explanation may suffice.
The euro zone must be represented by a man, by a voice and by a seat within every international institution, and particularly within the international financial organisations.
I am convinced that we will not have reached that stage when my term in office comes to an end on 1 January 2009.
Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the day will come when even the most reticent of Europeans will realise that we are constantly making fools of ourselves in aspiring to co-manage the world's monetary affairs if we continue to appear in international forums without a common plan of action.
There you have a few comments that I felt it my right to make, while I apologise for not having been able to reply to all of the speakers, as I usually do; I had to reply briefly because I was not present when the speakers, with the commitment that characterises this Parliament, took the floor.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30.
Written statement (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
(FR) Even though the report by my excellent colleague, Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil, puts forward some very interesting analyses and proposals on the euro zone, I regret the fact that it does not raise the issue straightaway of the development of the euro from a technical currency to a political tool benefiting growth and employment.
The monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) seems to be at odds with reality: the exchange rate should normally be strong when there is strong economic growth and should depreciate when there is weak growth.
The fact is that, in Europe, the opposite has been true since the start of the 1990s.
While the Member States are undergoing reforms, the quest for zero inflation through an inappropriate monetary policy is leading Europe to record mediocre results in terms of economic growth.
If this state of affairs continues, at a time when the price of raw materials and of energy is rocketing worldwide, we will have zero inflation and zero growth, and manufacturers will end up setting up their businesses in the dollar zone.
With everything that is happening, it is as though the ECB is disregarding economic policy, while its US counterpart is thinking of nothing else.
Community action in the field of marine environmental policy - Thematic strategy on the marine environment (debate)
The next items on the agenda are
the joint debate on the report by Marie-NoÃ«lle Lienemann on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the proposed Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on community action in the field of marine environmental policy - Thematic strategy on the marine environment (Marine Strategy Directive) - C6 - 0346/2005 -
the report by Aldis KuÅ¡Ä·is on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the thematic strategy for protection and preservation of the marine environment
Member of the Commission. (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to launch this joint debate on the thematic strategy for protecting and preserving the marine environment and on the proposed Marine Strategy Directive.
I should like to thank both rapporteurs - Mrs Lienemann for the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and Mr Kuskis for the thematic strategy.
I also wish to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts.
Furthermore I should like to thank the Committee on Fisheries and in particular Mr Gklavakis for his highly constructive approach to this important issue.
Seas and oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface and contain 90% of the biosphere.
Europe's marine waters extend across 3 million square kilometres, the same area as mainland Europe; in other words, 50% of Europe's territory is covered by sea.
Marine ecosystems play a key role in climate and weather patterns.
The status of Europe's marine environment is rapidly deteriorating, however.
In some areas, we may have gone past the point of no return.
Nutrient supply has a major influence on the Baltic Sea's marine environment.
Fish populations are in a poor state throughout Europe.
The Northeast Atlantic has one of the highest shipping levels in the world, with all of the risks and consequences that that implies.
The Mediterranean is under serious threat from uncontrolled development of its coastline.
If we are to reverse these trends, however, the existing measures and efforts - be they at international, national or EU level - are clearly inadequate.
Most measures drawn up at EU level were not geared towards protecting the marine environment as such and they therefore have a limited impact.
It has been demonstrated that measures adopted at international level are very difficult to implement or promote because they are not binding.
A healthy marine environment is crucially important both for life as a whole, and for the quality of our lives.
It is also an essential prerequisite for fulfilling the economic potential of the oceans and seas.
A dynamic marine economy can flourish only where there is a healthy marine environment.
The Marine Strategy will therefore make a significant contribution to the growth and employment goals enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy.
For the reasons outlined above, it is clear that the protection of the marine environment cannot and must not simply be a by-product of other policies.
At EU level what is needed is an integrated strategy that takes into account all of the pressures and influences on the marine environment.
This is precisely what the thematic strategy on the marine environment seeks to achieve.
It consists of the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and a report detailing the current state of affairs.
On a broader level, it covers the EU's environmental record on the marine environment and explains why the EU needs to take action.
Marine strategy must be viewed within the broader context of a new marine policy for the EU.
According to the Commission's Green Paper drawn up in June, the objective of the new policy is a dynamic European marine economy, operating in harmony with the marine environment.
The marine strategy is, within the area of the environment, one of the pillars of the future marine policy.
It will be based on the specific activities needed to protect marine ecosystems, which provide the sustainable wealth, productivity and employment opportunities and, from a broader perspective, people's livelihood from the oceans and seas.
The purpose of this Marine Strategy Directive is to achieve 'good environmental status' in the EU marine environment by 2021, in other words to restore the environmental health of our seas over the next 15 years.
This date will coincide with the first review of River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive, allowing for synergies on the further implementation of both directives.
The joint implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Directive thus brings together the protection of both marine and freshwater environments.
The directive establishes European Marine Regions on the basis of geographical and environmental criteria, and defines sub-regions as management units for implementation.
At an EU level no management-related measures will be adopted.
In the first phase, the Member States will be tasked with developing a marine strategy for the seas in each of their regions, and proposing practical solutions to address the specific needs of those seas.
Marine strategy should firstly include taking stock of the marine environment and the threats and pressures it faces, setting further environmental goals and indicators, and establishing monitoring programmes.
In the second phase, the Member States will be required to draw up and implement measures aimed at achieving good environmental status.
Cooperation is of vital importance between Member States and with the third countries with which Member States share saltwater bodies.
In order to achieve this objective, Member States will need to work within the framework of the regional marine conventions.
Regional conventions are invaluable partners when it comes to strategy implementation, as is evidenced by their long track record of scientific and technical competence, and the fact that they are able to work effectively at a regional level.
To conclude, I should like to stress the importance and sensitivity of marine ecosystems.
A high level of protection for the marine environment is a vital prerequisite for deriving the maximum economic benefit from the oceans and seas.
The marine environment is clearly the foundation of our marine economy.
The marine environment is under threat.
Consequently the EU must act effectively proactive.
I hope that the proposed strategy will contribute towards achieving that aim.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all, as rapporteur, to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the various groups and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for supporting a joint piece of work aimed at enhancing the Commission proposal.
As you said, Commissioner, the seas and oceans of our planet are in a worrying state: a crisis point has been reached.
Moreover, a recent study published in the Science review sounded the alarm bell by highlighting the risks of fishery resources disappearing from our seas and oceans.
The quality of the marine ecosystem plays a fundamental role in the planet's global environment and, in particular, plays a very important role in regulating the climate.
Our seas also play a decisive role in people's lives in every part of the globe.
As you pointed out, they play a major economic role when it comes to fishing, transport, tourism, sources of raw materials or even activities carried out along the coastlines that border them.
Yet, our seas and oceans are subjected to growing pressure and worrying pollution.
Let us first address this figure: 80% of maritime pollution comes from the land, and, as you said, Commissioner, there is clearly a direct link between the framework directive on water and the directive that you have presented and that our Parliament wishes to enhance.
However, if pollution comes from the earth via water, then it also comes via the atmosphere.
Recent studies show a significant interaction between atmospheric movements, air pollution and the sea and oceans, such that urbanisation and human activities taking place far away from the coasts may have a direct impact on the quality of water.
Pollution is also caused by activities linked to the exploitation of the oceans and seas, such as transport and aquaculture.
A few years ago, waste produced by fishing and oil industry activity reached altogether excessive and dangerous levels in certain sectors.
We are also at a time when we can see new threats looming, which the directive must anticipate.
In particular, we are seeing a large increase in the number of projects aimed at desalinating seawater.
We have to be certain that these activities are not going to affect the quality of water in the future.
Major international debates are taking place on the storage of carbon dioxide.
Thus, we can see that the threats are, indeed, real.
The aim of the directive has been to implement a structure enabling us finally to have access to a strategy that goes beyond international agreements, the results of which have mostly not lived up to our hopes thus far.
Our directive is based on a fundamental point: restoring the good ecological status of seas.
Parliament would like, Commissioner, the requirement for results to be far more present and far stronger than the text in its current state provides for.
Secondly, our Parliament would like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with a great deal more precision so that this is not some sort of pious hope and so that we come closer to doing what can be done to restore the life and balance of the ecosystem.
Thirdly, our Parliament would like the deadlines to be shorter and, at any rate, we would like there to be a good balance between the deadlines, the level of the demands regarding good ecological status and the requirement for results.
Finally, we advocate the creation of marine protected areas, because the experiences of the Americans and the New Zealanders have shown that these protected areas - indeed, in some cases, these genuine marine reserves - were such as to enable fish stocks to be built up again.
Finally, we would like territorial cohesion to be enhanced by an effective piece of work carried out at marine and submarine regional level, without, however, the Member States being exempted from their responsibilities in view of the objectives set by the management plans and the plans for measures aimed at restoring good ecological status.
We are anxious to include the Black Sea in the document.
We would like to sound the alarm bell concerning the Arctic: we need to think about the future of this part of the world. It is directly linked to us and its development has a considerable impact on the future of the planet, which may be endangered as a result.
We would like the outermost regions of the Union, which do not yet feature in the document, gradually to become at least the subject of an appropriate strategy.
I shall conclude by mentioning the democratic issues.
We see everyday, whether we are talking about fishing or transport, that sea users, ecologists and scientists feel the need to exchange their points of view so that the decisions that are taken are taken on the basis of a shared diagnosis and of a rational analysis of the problems.
In any case, that is the spirit of the amendments that we have tabled.
rapporteur. - (LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your cooperation so far and the valuable proposals that you have submitted, so that together we may improve the Commission's proposal on the thematic strategy for the protection and preservation of the marine environment.
I very much hope that this report will foster real changes that will preserve and improve the marine ecological environment.
I am happy that the report also touches on as sensitive an issue as the problems of the Baltic sea environment.
In the Baltic sea, which is also known as Europe's internal lake, it is particularly important to preserve the balance of the ecosystem, by not allowing it to be further threatened, and by taking special account of the specific low water exchange indicator.
I would like to emphasise, on this point, that the European Parliament ought also to scrupulously assess and join in monitoring the design and construction of a gas pipeline which is hazardous for the Baltic sea environment.
In my view, it is important for the people of Europe, and particularly those whose countries border the sea, to be able to personally see positive changes - the fact that water quality and cleanness is increasing, that a renewal of biological diversity is taking place in the seas and, finally, that there is considered, balanced and sustainable administration and development of the marine region following the adoption of this legislation and similar pieces of legislation.
I would like to stress that this report is the product of collaboration with non-governmental organisations and representatives of this field in industry, with whom wide-ranging debates took place even before the expiry of the deadline for submitting proposals, and that many of their ideas were included in the report.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge the European Commission and also ourselves to talk less but to work more and achieve concrete results, so that we may all live without fear beside our seas.
From this point I shall switch to English and, speaking also for my colleague Mrs Korhola, who cannot be here today for this debate, share some comments and messages.
The thematic strategy is decided on under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
That is very necessary.
As the Commissioner has rightly said, for some time we have needed a strong, integrated EU policy on marine protection.
The EU marine strategy directive will be an important new instrument in integrating the existing approaches.
Great things have already been achieved with the various policies - legislation, programmes, action plans and various international conventions - but still the state of the marine environment has been deteriorating at an alarming pace.
We need more overall joint action.
There are big challenges, such as the role of third countries, which might raise some questions.
But if third countries turn out to be the biggest polluters and if they think of this as only a European Union matter, how do we ensure that actions and efforts put in place by the Member States produce good results when, for one reason or another, third countries do not cooperate?
We have tried to address the issues in committee, but we shall only find out later how this actually works.
The rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, has done some excellent work, influenced strongly by the NGOs, and she has been very environmentally ambitious.
She has made some radical changes and integrated ideas into the report that were widely requested by the stakeholders.
In general, the rapporteur has made the directive stronger and more concrete, more ambitious and effective.
She has added the much needed guidelines and criteria and has tightened up the time limits.
Building on the rapporteur's approach, we have a solid chance to make this a real environmental pillar for marine policy as planned.
Here are a few key elements of the draft report.
The time limits and schedules for achieving good environmental status have been tightened up, from 2021 to 2017.
General definitions of measures which Member States are to take in order to achieve good environmental status are added and a detailed list of GES criteria is provided.
There is no clear definition of European marine waters.
The Black Sea has been added as one marine region in the directive.
Preparation timetables are tighter, as are programmes of measures.
Marine-protected areas are added, something that was not mentioned before.
More emphasis is given to cooperation by Member States in the same marine region in monitoring programmes, etc.
More emphasis is laid on third countries in broadening responsibilities and deciding who should be involved.
All in all, this report is making a strong point, from the European Parliament side, that we need effective measures to tackle this important issue.
Mr President, the main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status.
This strategy is more urgent today than at any other time, because the marine ecosystem has deteriorated significantly.
However, in order for this strategy to be effective, we must pay attention to two or three things.
First, we have a saying in my country, that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.
The money budgeted for this action is very, very little.
Provision has been made, for administrative expenses alone, for approximately EUR 90 million per annum for the first two years and for EUR 70 million per annum thereafter.
I think this sum is inadequate.
Saving our seas is such a serious issue that it merits our spending more money.
Secondly, we need coordinated actions.
First of all, we must make fishermen our partners in this endeavour.
We must come to an agreement with them; they must be persuaded that, first of all, they need to protect the environment, but that is not all; all of us involved in transport, tourism, industry, health, nutrition, agriculture and, above all, fisheries, must sit at the same table, so that we can agree and proceed.
The third thing I wanted to say was touched on by Commissioners Borg and Dimas and that is that we must agree on certain common indicators so that we can measure the environmental status at the moment, so that - and this is very important - when we speak of a good marine environmental status, we are referring to the same thing.
In other words, we must agree on common measurements.
To close, I wish to say and to emphasise that the directive on the marine strategy must give fisheries its proper place and must be at the heart of the endeavour.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, and at the same time I want to thank the Commission, which has embarked on this important project.
The Commissioner with responsibility for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Mr Borg, himself in fact organised a conference on maritime transport safety in July in my home town of Turku, at which these important matters were discussed.
This is just the sort of proper work which we in the EU should be doing together.
I would in particular like to raise the matter of the Baltic Sea, as the Baltic is an important EU sea, though at present it is a blot on the landscape.
The Baltic Sea is seriously ill.
Let me give you an example of this.
Last summer, blue-green algae took over the entire sea, aided by the warm weather.
It is hard to explain to your little children, who want to go and swim, that they cannot go in the sea because not only is it dirty, it is actually toxic.
There are toxic algae in the sea, and that can cause various diseases in children if they go and swim in the sea in warm weather.
Now the Commission and all of us are being urged to take swift and determined action and provide the resources needed to rescue the Baltic Sea.
That will of course mean that much action will have to be taken.
One excellent project now under way is the financing of the St Petersburg sewage plant.
This is one of the most important examples.
We also need dialogue with Russia, for example, in the area of safety regulations for shipping.
We will not succeed if we do not work closely with Russia.
Saving the Baltic Sea is no longer just an environmental issue.
It is above all a political one.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, it is no exaggeration to say that Europe's marine regions are in a crisis and there is an urgent need to take action to protect the seas.
Over the next 50 years, for example, fish stocks are threatened with collapse.
The Commission proposal for a directive in the field of Marine Environmental Policy and a Marine Strategy is a way to seek a pan-European integrated approach to saving marine ecosystems.
Although all our seas are in a poor state, it is only reasonable to examine the question of their protection from a regional perspective.
Marine regions vary in terms of their characteristics, and at least some of the problems are essentially local.
What they all have in common, however, is that they should all be capable of achieving good ecological status within a specific period of time.
Hopefully that will be before the year 2021.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the rapporteur's endeavour to define what we mean by good environmental status in the marine environment.
To achieve good status, as defined, we need to establish sufficiently stringent conservation objectives to prevent deterioration and for measures for the recovery of the seas and restoring them to a sustainable level.
These measures may be quite tough, but I hope that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support them in the vote.
It is important that the measures are properly binding and not merely recommendations.
The protection of the seas is about cooperation, not just among the Member States of the EU, but also with third countries with links to marine regions.
For example, effective protection of the Baltic Sea region cannot succeed without Russia's commitment to cooperation.
For years now, there has been cooperation in the context of HELCOM, or the Helsinki Commission.
HELCOM is presently overseeing a Baltic Sea Action Plan.
Conservation action under the strategy should start within the framework of the HELCOM Action Plan so that practical measures can be taken as swiftly as possible in the Baltic Sea region.
I would like to thank both the rapporteurs for having adopted this view within the context both of the strategy and of the directive.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, having a marine strategy that does not concentrate on fish is like filling a goldfish bowl with clean water after the cat has already taken and eaten the goldfish!
Having said that, there is strong support in this House for the principles behind this strategy and for the legislation, and that is hardly surprising given the catastrophic picture the Commission has painted of the state of our seas.
We need to introduce protective measures that are enforceable through the courts in order to ensure that Member States apply them.
The Commissioner used strong words, which we welcome, but the proposals originally submitted to Parliament highlighted some of the weaknesses and divisions within the Commission itself.
One thing we are most pleased about is the fact that the whole idea of good environmental status has been reinserted into the proposals and given a clear definition, and we are united on there being powers to create marine protected zones.
However, why were those ideas not in the Commission's original document?
When it came out of DG Environment they were, but by the time it emerged from the College some of these crucial matters had been deleted.
The time has come for the Commission to back up its fine words on sustainability with some united action from the Commissioners of each department.
We hear that there are divergent views in the Council - so be it.
But the message to the Commission and the Council from this Parliament should be that there is strong cross-party support for a significant improvement and strengthening of the measures being proposed.
The Commission was right to draft these proposals, but let us now ensure that the warm sentiments can be transformed into practical action.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their exemplary work and their excellent reports.
They improve the Commission's proposal by demanding that good environmental status be achieved by 2017 instead of 2021.
Moreover, the targets are made binding, and the importance of marine reserves is emphasised.
Climate change, waste, unsustainable fishing, noise, eutrophication and the extraction of raw materials threaten our seas.
If the mass destruction and the natural disaster taking place in the depths of the oceans were instead to be taking place - visibly - on land, the debate on the protection of the marine environment would dominate everyday discourse.
Species of fish, birds and mammals are threatened by extinction.
The Marine Strategy can, in fact, be a small step in trying to get to grips with the problems, but only if it is as ambitious as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposes.
The Member States must assume their responsibility for setting up significantly more marine reserves.
We have national parks in all the Member States, but marine reserves are conspicuous by their absence where they are most needed.
There is overwhelming statistical evidence that marine reserves provide protection that increases both the fish population and biological diversity in the immediate surroundings of the reserves.
When fish are protected and are thus able to increase in numbers, the older fish disperse and make for better catches.
The Baltic Sea, in particular, is an extremely sensitive sea with brackish water.
The countries around the Baltic Sea must always be entitled to introduce more stringent water protection requirements if they think it necessary to do so without, as a consequence, being constantly threatened by protracted legal proceedings because the internal market has to take precedence over protection of our seas.
I wish to point out the importance of the committee's call for no support to be given to agricultural activity involving large-scale nutrient leakage into the seas.
My Amendments 81 and 82 are designed to introduce responsible regulation of discharges from waste disposal sites.
The original proposal is too weak on this point.
I am opposed to Amendment 90 about removing the reference to radioactive substances, because doing so would be contrary to the original objective from 2002.
Finally, the Maritime Strategy's call for utilisation of the seas must be adjusted and altered so that it falls within the framework of the Marine Strategy.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work she has done in the report and to stress that she has managed, with a great deal of success, to include in her report the views of all the members and of non-governmental organisations, and as a result she has improved the Commission's original paper significantly.
The marine environment, which is a basic and valuable source of life, is under daily threat.
Maritime pollution, climate change, shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and to have an adverse impact on human health.
The directive in question, which is designed to plug the gaps in environmental policy, is an important step towards improving health and restoring the seas.
It is important for us to support amendments requiring the Member States to achieve a good environmental status, amendments which recognise the threats to the marine environment and which aim for the shortest possible timeframe for the implementation of the directive.
I refer to Amendments 24, 27, 73 and 78, which I urge you to support.
Furthermore, actions by the Member States must be based on the principle of prevention, on an approach based on the ecosystem while, at the same time, account must be taken of accurate evaluations carried out on the basis of current European legislation, as referred to in Amendments 23, 49, 45, 51 and 60.
Finally, I call on you to support Amendments 81 and 82 banning any systematic or deliberate dumping of any liquid, gaseous or solid body in the water or on the sea bed, in keeping with the provisions laid down for carbon dioxide, except where the relevant approval is granted in accordance with international law and a prior environmental impact study is carried out in accordance with the directive.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports under discussion could not have come at a better time, since they examine the notorious construction of the Baltic pipeline, a project that, in the absence of a serious environmental impact assessment, risks causing an ecological disaster in a sea already suffering, moreover, from a worrying level of pollution.
Not only that: the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean, where fish stocks are becoming ever more scarce, also suffer in some areas from a high level of pollution, caused, among other things, by oil extraction and, above all, by oil refining.
I refer, in particular, to the industrial triangle of Syracuse in Sicily, which is the largest petrochemical complex in Europe.
In this industrial zone, not only is there an extremely high level of air pollution, causing the tragedy of birth defects and the indefensible death rate due to tumours - over 57% higher, in fact, than the Italian average - but there is also the problem of marine pollution.
The consequences are obvious: the poor-quality fish stocks are down to critical levels; fishermen, often small operators, either cover more miles to find better fishing waters, or are forced to give up their traditional livelihoods.
As if that were not enough, plans are underway to construct a regasifier in this industrial zone, a project I have condemned several times before this House.
The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive and the appropriate amendments that, in our opinion, improve it, are therefore very welcome, Mr President.
Above all, I hope that it will shorten the timescale for achieving the objectives of a healthy ecology and environment.
We need to make up for the severe delays that Europe has accumulated in this sector, and, as we all know, political timing does not always coincide with the needs of the environment.
From this evening, we can afford to be a little more optimistic.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the marine environment has faced various threats for a long time now, which is why a far-reaching marine strategy is a necessity.
The European Union has territorial waters greater than its entire territory, with 1 200 ports, and 90% of its exports are transported by sea.
We consider it crucial to emphasise the interdependence of a common fisheries policy and the proposed marine environment strategy.
It is logical and advisable to allow a hazardous vessel that has been penalised to sail to the nearest shelter, and then to the nearest available shipyard provided that it does not pose a health or environmental threat.
Another proposal worthy of attention is that of declaring the Arctic a nature reserve dedicated to peace and science.
I have the privilege of representing Scotland in this Parliament and that means I also represent a large share of the EU's indigenous resources of oil and gas.
As I understand it, we are committed to maximising the potential of our indigenous energy resources.
Surely this is only sensible for economic and logistical reasons and for security of supply.
It is also the case that the extraction of hydrocarbons in the North Sea is already well regulated in all its environmental and ecological aspects.
Yet certain amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will effectively stop exploitation of these resources.
That is just plain absurd.
Indeed these amendments will even, I understand, cause suspension of a major offshore wind project in the Moray Firth.
Much of the research funding for this came from the European Union.
Do we want to look ridiculous?
Do we want to hobble our few indigenous energy resources and become even more dependent on one or two dominant, and often domineering, external suppliers?
The North Sea's ecology must be considered holistically in North Sea terms.
The North Sea is not the Mediterranean.
I appeal to the rapporteur and other sensible groups to support the PPE-DE amendments, which will make this proposal ambitious - yes - but also responsible and practical.
(SV) Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Lienemann and Mr KuÅ¡Ä·is who, I think, have done a very good job indeed on these directives.
I myself live by the Baltic Sea and have therefore, unfortunately, been able to see at extremely close quarters the significance, not only for individual people but also for employment and growth, of the seas' ecosystems being out of balance.
I also know that people expect us in this House to make a vigorous effort and do something about the problems they experience every day.
I therefore hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will not listen to the previous speakers but will instead give broad support to the changes backed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Firstly, it should support a considerably accelerated process, whereby the measures are implemented earlier, together with a timetable significantly more ambitious than the one proposed by the Commission, specifying precisely when the objective of good environmental status in our seas is to be achieved.
Secondly, it should support more clearly defined objectives that, just as Mrs Lienemann said, are a guarantee of our in actual fact achieving something and are not, in the end, just so much empty talk.
Thirdly, it should support making what is perhaps the sea in the worst situation, namely the Baltic, into a pilot area for this strategy - an area in which the measures are implemented particularly early and are preferably based on the Helsinki Convention.
These measures are needed if the Baltic Sea is to be saved.
(SV) Mr President, two weeks ago, Nicholas Stern, a former World Bank employee, published, on behalf of the British Government, a shocking report on the consequences of climate change.
The message was plain.
We must no longer think of nature as being something without value as, if we do so, the consequences may be incalculable.
The same also applies to the state of the sea.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have prepared a number of amendments in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
They are all aimed at increasing the level of ambition, bringing stricter timetables about, strengthening cooperation with third countries such as Russia and plugging loopholes in the legislation.
One serious loophole, for example, is in relation to the international waters that begin 12 nautical miles off the coast.
In the vulnerable Baltic Sea, mainly cargo ships - but also passenger vessels - continue to dump latrine waste straight into the sea.
That is something that they are able to do legally in international waters.
Out in the Baltic, 1 800 vessels are dumping in more ways than one all the time.
The mind boggles.
We are pleased that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs with whom we have worked are taking on board our amendment about plugging this loophole in the law.
The amendment needs to be implemented quickly, without the decision getting caught up for years in the International Maritime Organisation's decision-making machinery.
We must have a high level of ambition.
The EU must support Russia in its efforts to cleanse St Petersburg of all waste water.
It will be expensive, but not to take action would be still more expensive.
Drilling for oil and the laying of gas pipelines must not, out of economic considerations, take precedence over the environmental risks presented by such activities.
The harmful effects of traffic too must be reduced.
I believe that our populations wish to see the EU genuinely able to take action on these issues pertaining to the fate of humanity.
Only in that way can we increase confidence in the EU.
The objective must be to protect Europe's seas and restore them to their former state and to ensure that human activities are conducted in a sustainable way.
Mr President, the European Union has 68 000 kilometres of coastline; Scotland has 11 000 kilometres.
Almost 50% of the EU population live within 50 kilometres of the sea; in Scotland 70% live within 10 kilometres of the sea.
Clearly it is in Scotland's long-term interests to protect the marine environment and to conserve its wealth of marine resources for the long term.
Scotland has oil and gas reserves for at least another 30 years.
I will be supporting various amendments that will ensure that oil and gas extraction can continue to benefit the Scottish and EU economies.
I cannot support committee Amendment 8 in the Lienemann report, as drafted, because it seeks to link the marine strategy to 'the principles of the common fisheries policy'.
The CFP has been a miserable failure and the last thing I want to see is a new marine strategy linked to such a flawed set of principles.
The idea that Member States should determine what good environmental status is in waters under their jurisdiction, and work with their neighbours in logical marine regions, makes a lot of sense.
Fisheries management should be brought into that common sense situation, and jurisdiction should be returned to the Member States so that, for example, countries around the North Sea can work together with those who have most to gain from conservation being encouraged, giving the incentive to make a marine strategy succeed.
(EL) Mr President, systems to protect the marine environment are covered in a fragmentary manner by various sectoral policies of the European Union, with the result, however, that there is a compilation of policies, legislative acts, programmes and action plans, without any overall integrated policy for protecting the marine environment.
The aim pursued in the two combined legislative arrangements on the thematic strategy on the protection and conservation of the environment and the marine strategy directive is to achieve a good environmental status of the marine environment in the European Union by 2021.
However, if we take account, firstly, of the more general nature of the two arrangements and, secondly, of the pillars on which they are based, it is certain that in 2021, not only will there not be a good marine environmental status, but there will hardly have been any improvement to the present poor status, which is directly acknowledged in the explanatory statement to the proposal for a directive, which points out that overall there has been a fundamental deterioration in the marine environment over recent decades.
The substantiated scientific data of the United Nations Organisation concerning the causes of the deterioration and pollution of the marine environment are incontrovertible: they are shore industries and shipping and the non-existent or under-developed infrastructures for storing and processing residues.
More importantly, the pillars on which both the thematic strategy and the proposal for a directive are based are the common fisheries policy and the Green Paper on the European Union's shipping policy, all - of course - within the framework of the 6th Environment Action Programme for the period from 2002-2012, which we have acutely condemned.
In our opinion, these are in essence numerous, insubstantial interventions on the same wavelength as the Commission proposal, the most daring and ambitious aim of which is to bring the deadline forward from 2021 to 2017.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(ES) Mr President, I would like warmly to congratulate Mrs Lienemann, and I am not doing so in a superficial way or because protocol requires it.
I think that this Directive has achieved something important.
Thanks to her extensive experience, she has an extraordinary knowledge of philosophy and of European legislative formulas and has achieved a succinct, short Directive.
Despite the number of amendments, it does not have too much in it and her own amendments are very generic ideas that are typical of a framework directive.
I know for a fact that she worked with experts and was open to many suggestions; amendments were not even needed in order for some of them to be incorporated.
I would like to say that it is an extraordinary and wonderful thing that finally Europe is discussing the sea.
Its time has come.
I would, however, also like to say that this Directive should be the start of a subsequent development of legislation, as precisely because it is a framework directive, there are still many aspects that need to be developed in the future, which is what I want to talk about.
For example, Amendment 27, which is practically the same as Amendment 86 tabled by my group, suggests several aspects that should be developed: among other things, activities at sea, many industrial activities, many of which are new, such as desalination, which I am not against, but it has not yet been studied, and the methodologies for studying the marine environmental impact, which are practically in their infancy, that is, they have not yet been done.
I also think that the indicators should be developed more and that digital marine charts should be drawn up, which should also be used for cultural purposes.
I think that one of the great treasures of world and European history are archaeological charts.
This is something that needs to be developed in order to preserve our heritage and I think that it will be one of the most stimulating discoveries for all of us.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to congratulate my honourable friend Mrs Lienemann on her complete and detailed work.
It is now essential that the European Union acquire an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment, because the fragmentary legislation which has applied to date has not managed to reverse the reduction in biodiversity and the loss of habitats.
It is our duty, therefore, towards future generations to achieve a very high level of protection of the marine environment, so that our strategy on sustainable development can be combined with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, not forgetting that, in many countries in Europe and for a substantial section of the populace, the sea is a large pole of economic development.
At the same time, this directive offers the Member States an historic opportunity to collaborate in a field which, until recently, was a field of conflict and antagonism, such as sea fishing areas and fishing quotas.
The basic objective must be to clearly define the term good environmental status of marine ecosystems, so as to achieve a cohesive and effective marine policy at European Union level.
I believe that adopting protected marine areas, as a tool for protecting ecosystems and combating the reduction in biodiversity, will also help considerably in achieving this objective.
At the same time, we are calling for the deadlines for attaining the targets of the proposed directive to be brought forward to 2017.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Lienemann and Mr KuÅ¡Ä·is on their excellent reports which, despite the view of some Scottish colleagues, have been wisely strengthened by the Committee on The Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
European marine waters, as indeed international waters, have often become the dustbin for waste of varying quantities and levels of toxicity.
This practice has been carried out for many years by individuals, companies and governments, who have shown little knowledge of or regard for the enormous diversity and importance of marine ecosystems.
In many instances that has resulted in unprecedented environmental damage.
In other cases, the survival of certain species is now balanced on a knife edge.
It is high time for the EU to intervene decisively in order to protect our marine environment.
Therefore, we should all fully support these two welcome reports in the hope that the implementation of the necessary strategies and directives will be forthcoming unhindered, as well as extended to third countries, and that further, complementary measures will be introduced in the near future.
After all, the protection of our marine environment is an essential element in safeguarding our own survival on this planet.
(NL) Mr President, first of all, my heartfelt compliments to Mrs Lienemann, who really has written an excellent report.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy for fish to survive in the seas and oceans surrounding the European Union; overfishing and pollution have taken their toll, and when the fish are gone, they are gone, so we must take drastic measures now in order to prevent the situation arising around 2040 of there being no fish left.
Let this prediction by scientists serve as an important warning.
Whilst the marine strategy is a sound initiative, the directive is not specific enough for my liking.
First of all, fish reserves need to be set up.
By setting up reserves at spawning locations, fish are given the opportunity of reproducing at their leisure.
This has proved effective in New Zealand and Australia.
If, alongside reserves, sustainable fishing methods are introduced, then we can safeguard the future of fish in the waters surrounding the European Union.
In addition, something needs to be done about exotic species and the problem of ballast water.
The Japanese oyster has found a pleasant living climate in the North Sea without natural enemies, but this oyster is actually thriving too well.
The purification of ballast water is a simple procedure that must be undertaken across the board.
The marine directive requires Member States to think about how the marine environment can be improved and how we can cooperate better, which is in the interest of us all.
I warmly support Mrs Lienemann's report, and I hope you will all do the same.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, it feels good to be back again, and I have been able to begin work by reading two constructive reports.
We are all of us responsible for ensuring that our seas can survive the stresses to which the marine environment is exposed.
An additionally large responsibility lies with this Assembly and the European Union to find the right forms of coordinated and vigorous cross-border cooperation.
As many speakers have pointed out, time is extremely short.
In my own part of Europe, the Baltic is the most important sea and the one that has been, and still is, exposed to the greatest threats.
That is why we view the planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany with great concern.
Tomorrow, more detailed plans are to be presented.
A gas pipeline in the sensitive Baltic Sea constitutes a considerable threat to the environment.
The gas pipeline may be damaged by ships or old unrecovered mines and be exposed to terrorist attack.
The gas pipeline would constitute a threat to the environment and to fishing, both when it was being constructed and during the period that it was in operation.
In my opinion, the risks are manifestly greater than the advantages.
Certainly, Europe needs energy supplies, but this natural gas pipeline must not be laid on the bed of the Baltic Sea.
If the pipeline is to be constructed, it must be so on land - for the sake of the marine environment and of the Baltic.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I have followed your debate with interest and I am pleased to note that in principle you have endorsed the holistic approach favoured by the Commission.
On the other hand, it is clear that this issue is a complex one, requiring urgent action in many areas.
It is also clear that a range of different opinions has emerged and that further analysis and clarification are required.
I should like to refer to some of the main amendments in more detail.
In the timetable for implementation (Amendments 20, 24, 31, 32, 35 and 69), the Commission chose the year 2021 as the date by which the Member States have to achieve 'good environmental status' of their marine environments.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety proposed an earlier date.
Although the Commission would like 'good environmental status' to be achieved quickly, the committee's date is not in my view a realistic one.
The Commission's proposal addresses firstly the need to improve our understanding of the marine environment and the threats it faces, and secondly the need for action.
In order that we may find the most appropriate, and cost-effective, measures to protect the marine environment, we must equip ourselves with the essential knowledge and skills.
Under these conditions, to bring the deadlines forward would be counter-productive.
This is clear, especially in view of the parallels with the current Water Framework Directive, to which this directive is closely related.
In the Water Framework Directive, successfully adopted in 2000 due to the fact that Mrs Lienemann was the rapporteur, 'good environmental status' is called for by 2015, that is to say, 15 years after the adoption of the directive.
The Marine Directive should operate in the same way.
In view of the extent of the sea area addressed by the Marine Strategy Directive, and in view of the size of the task, no one should be in any doubt that our proposed timetable is highly ambitious.
The date proposed by the Commission in the directive, 2021, will moreover coincide with the first review of the River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive, allowing synergies on the further implementation of both directives.
Apart from this, the Commission believes that it would not be practical to call on the Member States to 'achieve good environmental status by 2021' as the Committee on the Environment is proposing in the Directive.
Nor would it be realistic.
The measures that must be taken as part of the Marine Strategy will be up and running by 2018 according to the proposed timetable.
Some measures will not deliver immediate results because it will take time for some of the ecosystems to react to the measures.
Overall progress towards good environmental status must be shown, however, which is why the Commission has proposed the idea of 'achieving good environmental status'.
The Commission is prepared to support the insertion of an article stressing the importance of marine protected areas (Amendments 27, 39, 62 and 72).
Such an article should ideally be based on Article 6 of the Water Framework Directive on protected areas.
The Commission is also prepared to back the idea that in order to meet the objectives of the Directive it may be necessary to create further protected areas or even closed nature reserves.
It cannot accept, however, the proposal from the Committee on the Environment for the mandatory creation of marine protected areas as part of the implementation of the proposed Directive.
Protected marine areas should be created only when they can contribute directly towards achieving a 'good environmental status'.
They should not simply be created as an end in themselves, but should be viewed as a means rather than an end.
The Commission agrees with the committee's wish to integrate the fundamental definition of 'good environmental status' (Amendment 80) directly into the Directive.
The Commission nevertheless has definite problems with the list of definitions proposed by the Committee on the Environment.
Many of these definitions are based on the factors influencing the marine environment and the threats to it, rather than the quality of the ecosystem.
This is a dangerous approach because some potential risks and threats may be omitted or, on the other side of the coin, unduly emphasised.
Even more importantly, if we monitor only the influencing factors, the EU will not be able to move away from the current fragmented approach on managing the marine environment towards a more integrated approach, which would cover all of the factors as well as their mutual impact on the marine environment.
Lastly, with regard to financial matters, (Amendments 19 and 74), there are a number of EU funding mechanisms from which the Member States can benefit, for example the Structural Funds, LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
Consequently, it is not necessary to create any special funding mechanisms.
Honourable Members, the debate has touched on the complexity of this whole issue, including the fact that the marine environment receives pollution from the atmosphere, and that the quality of the marine environment depends to a large extent on tackling climate change.
It has also been mentioned that some seas have not been included, as in the case of the Black Sea, and naturally the approach adopted by Romania and Bulgaria will fundamentally change the situation and open up fresh possibilities.
As regards the Arctic Ocean, owing to its geographical situation it is not possible to change the Commission's position significantly and nor is it possible to create an independent strategy for what is an exceptionally sensitive and important environment here, albeit in no way connected directly to EU territory.
Mr President, honourable Members, I shall pass on the list of Commission opinions on the Amendments to Parliament's Services.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
(SV) It is very gratifying that attention is being devoted to issues concerning the marine environment because there is a great need to ensure that our seas do not suffer still more pollution or destruction.
The amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are, for the most part, positive and will hopefully improve the condition of the marine environment, especially as a result of good environmental status being defined.
The Commission's proposal does, however, contain an article that gives rise to a certain amount of concern.
Article 13, on special areas, opens up opportunities for, to some extent, disregarding the environmental objectives if the alterations in a particular area have taken place as a result of actions taken for reasons of great public interest.
One can imagine this article being invoked very extensively.
It is therefore extremely important that the Commission impose significant restrictions if and when this happens, because the future environment we are all to live in is also of great public interest.
(IT) Europe is surrounded by four seas and two oceans, containing different types of ecosystems and different biogeographical regions.
The European coast extends over 100 000 km, and is where 16% of Europeans live, many of whom are strongly tied to the sea for their work, leisure, or sport, or because of the natural resources and energy it provides.
In the case of enclosed or partly enclosed seas, such as the Black Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean, the risk of pollution is particularly high.
The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive, which seems desirable and long-awaited, must enable the current political framework for the protection of the marine environment in Europe to be expanded and strengthened.
Its effectiveness will determine the future health of European seas, and has the necessary potential to guarantee the environmental basis needed for the sustainable use of the resources and functions of the sea, both within and outside of Europe.
European electricity network breakdown (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the European electricity network breakdown.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the serious incident on the continental European electricity network on Saturday, 4 November led to blackouts over most of the system.
We know from E.ON that the fault originated in northern Germany, where switching off an extra high-voltage line in Lower Saxony later led to the switching off of lines across Europe.
E.ON had carried out a planned deactivation of an overhead line and this operation had also been done with a previous line.
The incident led to the splitting of the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity Network into three zones: west, east and south-east.
The western zone was short of power and the eastern zone had too much power.
To cope with the lack of power in the western zone, automatic devices had to switch customers off in the countries affected.
The worst affected countries were France, where five million customers were reported to have been cut off.
In Germany, millions of customers were affected, as in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, where some hundreds of thousands of customers were without electricity.
Affected countries also included Austria, Slovenia, Portugal and Switzerland.
The incident was resolved after an hour and the power supply was re-established.
The incident could have had much greater consequences but the cooperation between transmission system operators and the size of the network made it possible to supply customers very quickly.
The precise cause of the failure is not yet known.
I have asked the European regulators to provide a report on what actually caused this blackout.
That involves analysing a huge amount of information before the blackout and after the blackout, so at this stage I cannot report to you on what actually triggered it.
The UCTE investigation committee will also provide a report, as will the European transmission system operators, who are investigating the incident.
As soon as we have a full report and a full-scale investigation has been held into this incident, I will report to Parliament in an appropriate form on what actually triggered it; but as far as I can see three lessons should be learned from it.
In 2003 a huge-scale blackout had already occurred in Italy and it is clear that the measures taken afterwards were not sufficient, in particular in three areas.
One proposal, therefore, is that we should set up a formal European grouping of transmission system operators which will have the task of putting forward common positions on issues identified by the Commission and in particular network security standards.
We should also institute a mechanism to ensure that these standards are formally binding on network operators.
It is also clear that much more investment is needed in transmission system networks to provide for an adequate response when such incidents happen, but most importantly to ensure that lines are not overcharged.
I am very pleased that you put this question on the agenda of this House, as it is a very important issue.
This was not a natural disaster but a system failure, and we should analyse it and draw the necessary lessons from it.
As soon as the report is ready, the Commission will not hesitate to draw the necessary conclusions and take the necessary action.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, many thanks for that level-headed report: the problem lasted an hour, and then it was sorted out.
That, too, is an argument worth mentioning.
Secondly, like you, I take the view that a full report needs to be produced first in order that we do not arrive at premature answers about all the things that might have gone wrong.
Thirdly, we politicians must face up to the question as to whether the approach we take might be somewhat contradictory: on the one hand, we call for more investment in electricity grids, while, on the other, we threaten the grid operators with the unbundling of their property.
Nobody can be expected to invest in networks when they are, at the same time, facing the threat of those same networks being taken off them; that can hardly be regarded as logical.
Fourthly, at the same time as we call for more and more renewable energy, we know that wind power contributes to the reliability of the grids being a very real problem.
I have nothing against wind power, but nobody should be surprised when problems of this sort occur.
Fifthly, we demand - and rightly too - more connection points, because we want electricity to be transmitted from one country to another.
Right though it is that we should want that, we are, perhaps, paying too little attention to the need to ensure that, at the same time or as a prior requirement, the grids before and after the connection points are adequately prepared.
One consequence I would like to see resulting from this occurrence is our handling energy policy issues in a more realistic and down-to-earth way, without making contradictory demands that can never be met.
Perhaps that is a contribution that we will be able to make; whether or not we do so, I look forward to a precise evaluation once the facts are before us, and then we will be able to consider what the political consequences must be - if any.
Much of what was said in the days following the power failure was precipitate and resulted not so much from in-depth analysis of the event but rather more from a momentary snapshot of what happened.
I am much obliged to you, Commissioner Piebalgs, for what you are doing.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the blackout in Europe affected 10 million people from Germany to Spain.
The power cut was a salutary reminder of how closely we are connected to each other via the electricity network and how vulnerable we are at the same time.
We still do not know why it happened.
In practice Europe has a common electricity network, but not a common energy policy that would secure supply.
No viable internal market for electricity has been established.
It is paradoxical that the more our networks are connected, the more vulnerable we are to power cuts.
Although connecting up the networks is an attempt to improve the security of supply of electricity everywhere in the Union, an adverse effect is that any problems that arise will affect us all.
That is why we need above all to ensure that our common networks function properly, that there are emergency systems that operate nationally, and that the system is monitored by one authority.
We need security standards, as the Commissioner said.
The likelihood of other energy crises was heightened when the energy production plants were privatised.
The state used to own these companies and invested in the long term.
Now we have reached the quarterly investment stage where cash has to be recouped fast, and that is why there is no long-term perspective.
The Commission has taken prompt action, and we are grateful for that.
The national transmission system operators must in future cooperate more comprehensively and more transparently.
In addition, the strategic review on energy out in January needs to examine the possibility of setting up a common regulatory authority.
Moreover, companies need to take responsibility and invest more than they do now in transmission and emergency capacity.
If that does not happen, governments will have to intervene and do what they had been doing up until the current phase.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Thank you for your communication, Commissioner.
It is imperative that an extensive and rigorous investigation be carried out into the causes of the power cut that affected a number of EU countries.
Should this breakdown be attributed to a lack of information?
To a failure to comply with procedures?
To a network fault?
To a shortage of investment?
To a fault in the maintenance of the network or to a commercial cause?
Some Europeans view this breakdown as a disastrous consequence of the liberalisation of energy; others view it as the product of inadequate interconnections and of an inadequate trans-European energy network.
As you pointed out, one might also take the view that the management of this breakdown demonstrated the Member States' solidarity towards Germany, deprived as it was of electricity, and that the power cut procedures were implemented in order to prevent far more serious consequences resulting from a European black out.
If the breakdown was a commercial one, the Member States' regulators must together define and review the applicable rules in order more effectively to control the electricity market.
If the breakdown was due to technical problems, or to a procedural fault, then the power distribution network managers need to be coordinated more effectively, as they are the operational links in the chain of free flowing and secure energy exchanges.
The creation of a European Centre for Energy Networks would enable us to implement a European code of networks aimed at harmonising the standards and procedures of the Member States' networks.
To conclude, I am delighted that the Commission has launched this investigation and I hope - allow me to emphasise this point - that it communicates the results with all due transparency so that we might make progress in preventing any incidents of this kind.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, since Mr Reul, two or three days after the electricity blackout, went on German radio to attack wind energy in much the same way that Mr Glos and E.ON had done, I am glad to hear him, ten days on from the event, declaring that he has nothing against it.
It has since become clear that German wind energy did absolutely nothing to help bring this calamity to pass, since the wind on that day was quite normal.
'Day ahead' was delivered, and it did indeed turn out that the wind farms in Germany had made a vital contribution to getting the grid up and running again, in other words, in those situations in which it is possible to define a good interface between the grid operators, the regulators and the providers of wind energy, wind energy did in fact, have positive effects on the grid.
In Spain, by contrast, many wind farms were taken out of the grid during a moment of low frequency, which makes no sense whatever, as wind farms are less vulnerable to low frequency than other generation facilities, and they could have helped to stabilise the Spanish network.
What can this breakdown teach us?
The first thing it can teach us is that we have to prepare the networks for long-term investments in energy; electricity generation will migrate to the coasts, and I am talking here not just about wind energy, but also about condensing power plants, which will find it impossible to cool themselves down further inland by reason of the warmer climate and warmer rivers.
We will also have to invest much more in decentralised energy provision, in the shape of biomass, biogas, combined heat and power, as well as gas power stations, which can be sited close to the centres of consumption in industry or in towns, which will, to some degree, compensate for this migration and enable us, by means of these decentralised investments, to make more room on the networks for business.
Secondly, what is needed is an EU regulator - not one who will abolish the national regulatory authorities, but an EU regulator with quite specific functions in the sphere of trans-European electricity trading, improving not only transparency but also the interfaces between the national networks.
We need this authority right now, but with a clearly defined and narrower spectrum.
Thirdly, the networks are in need of long-term investment, and that cannot be maintained on the basis of high yields in the short term.
It is precisely because E.ON and RWE want returns of 30% that we need ownership unbundling, for such high yields are not necessary in a monopoly sector, where no more than a return of between 6% and 8% on the investment to be made is needed.
A clear separation of the grid's interests and the production and trading interests will improve security of supply and also the European network's capacity to act.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, energy is produced heterogeneously among the Member States.
In some countries, cheap hydro-electric energy is of key importance; in others, cheap nuclear energy.
In other countries, electricity is produced by burning ever more expensive fossil fuels or by means of expensive wind power.
The picture of the market is further muddled by the EU's emissions rights trading scheme, and we do not know what the future holds for that in 2008, let alone 2013.
Connecting the EU's electricity networks does not solve all the problems.
Harmonisation of the market will produce winners and losers.
There are many countries that will not agree to invest in interconnecting networks or pay a high price for electricity just so that it might be cheaper in another country.
I am glad that the Commission's standard answer this time has not been that the harmonisation of markets solves everything, but that instead it is actually trying to find out what this was all about.
(ES) Mr President, the power cut that was experienced on 4 November once again demonstrated the high level of interdependence between the electrical networks of the Member States.
The fact that ten million citizens and about a dozen countries were affected gives us an idea of the gravity and scope of this incident.
There is undoubtedly a positive side to this, which is the swiftness and efficiency of the reaction by the operators, who, by taking the appropriate measures, managed to solve the problem in just under an hour.
However, although we should be pleased with this, what we should not do is tempt fate.
Commissioner, you said that a detailed investigation is going to be conducted into the causes of this incident and there is no doubt that this needs to be done, because from every crisis like this we learn very valuable lessons.
I am sure that when you have all the necessary information, you will pass it on to this House so that we can also analyse it.
Commissioner, I fully agree with you that there is a need, as you recently mentioned, to create a formal group, at European level, of transmission system operators that can make technical proposals on safety standards for the networks and other issues that are relevant to what we are dealing with.
A few years ago I proposed a similar initiative in relation to the report on security of supply and I must say that, on the part of the regulators and many colleagues in this House, the initiative was not very successful.
I hope that after this latest crisis, this proposal will be re-examined with more realism.
Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to make a comment to the Council: it is now time that, in a Europe in which there is free movement of services, goods, capital and people, in which twelve of the Member States have the same monetary policy, in which we all share an international trade policy, we stop pretending that the decisions that we take about energy only affect us.
This latest incident made this very clear.
It is not about taking sovereignty away from any Member State, but about acting together on all those things in which joint action benefits everyone.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the blackout of electricity networks on 4 November is a sign that should highlight the urgency with which we must provide common responses to the energy problem.
The episode has shown clearly how closely networks are interconnected, and the lack of appropriate management to support this.
Commissioner, the guidelines presented by the Commission on 9 November to rationalise the cross-border transport of electricity in Europe, which are aimed at improving the management system, are welcome.
However, it is important to enforce greater cooperation among regulators: we must speed up the implementation of a single European regulatory authority, a European centre for energy networks, as proposed by the Commission's Green Paper.
It is also necessary, in my opinion, to have network administrators that are independent of commercial operators, as well as greater computerisation, enabling transmission networks and distribution networks to communicate.
The internal market is a key aspect of common energy policy.
Today, more than ever, this policy is essential and must be regarded as a priority.
We must continue down this road with greater courage.
Together with the Member States, we must speed up this process, overcoming national protectionist self-interest that slows down liberalisation and competition on the market, so that episodes like that of 4 November will no longer happen, and, above all, so that Europe, as a single actor, can negotiate the delicate international geopolitical balances, securing for itself a protected, sustainable and unified energy supply.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we must first do is ensure that the grid is well divided up between large and smaller suppliers, between strong central units and regional ones that will enable us to build up a strong structure.
For that, of course, trans-European networks are needed, as is a regulator or coordinator to handle these matters, but what is needed above all is the fiscal incentives that will get the profits that will be made used for investment allowances or shorter-term rates of depreciation.
The most important thing, as I see it, is to draw up emergency plans that will give us a chance of shutting down the network quickly and efficiently in the event of a crisis and then restabilising it and restoring the power supply as quickly as possible.
We also have to introduce a qualitative dimension into the security of energy supply, meaning that those who are willing to have themselves removed from the network at short notice should also be able to benefit from price reductions, or, conversely, that those who want to remain on the grid as long as possible and be put back on it with the minimum possible delay, should also pay higher charges.
Where energy is concerned, we must get away from debating it only in terms of quantity; there is a need, in energy supply, for qualitative factors that will make it possible for the price schedules to demand that a user who wants absolute security of supply would also pay more.
If, though, a user is flexible by reason - for example - of being able to draw on the energy for his warm water requirements either by night or by day, then he should be charged at a correspondingly more favourable rate.
Everyone should be able to choose their own energy supplier, and everyone should be able to get their electricity from the generator of their choice; if they could do that, it would give us a real chance of reshaping the European market.
Mr President, this was an example of the law of unintended consequences, not a disaster.
We must await the outcome of the inquiry you have launched and avoid kneejerk reactions.
We have learned once again that people's behaviour is not always predictable.
I submit that it is not possible to legislate against every eventuality.
This was primarily a technical problem and not necessarily one about policy.
I would remind the Commissioner and the House that we already have legislation in place in the shape of the security of electricity supply and infrastructure directive, for which I was Parliament's rapporteur.
We should wait for that piece of legislation to bed down and be seen to be properly transposed and implemented in Member States before we move on to enact more legislation.
Let us learn from this, but let us also remember that the network operators - the transmission system operators - have a remarkable record of maintaining supply.
As my colleague, Mr RÃŒbig, has said, a 100% supply is a difficult target to achieve.
I believe they do a pretty good job.
I invite the Commissioner to come and join my colleagues on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
We are going back to our committee meeting after this discussion.
One of the matters we will be discussing is Mrs Morgan's report on the Green Paper.
It is good to see the Commissioner here and if he does not have to rush away he will be very welcome to join us.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, firstly, I am very grateful for the invitation and I will definitely come, but I shall only listen to the debate and not intervene in the proceedings of the committee.
Secondly, it is important to have all the results of the investigation before we reach a conclusion.
That is why I want to launch all these inquiries, because we really need a factual basis.
It was a planned action and not a natural disaster.
We really need to know why it happened.
Thirdly, today's debate has been very valuable.
In a way it has been a prelude to the debate to be held in the committee, because it has examined how best to ensure that the necessary investments are made in power and in the energy sector in general, and which are the best ways to guarantee that investments are made and the system functions properly.
I should like to praise the transmission system operators, who really cooperated on a voluntary basis.
Their quick response prevented an even worse blackout.
I should like to inform Parliament that during the summer the European transmission system operators always pay close attention to demand and supply on the electricity market.
As you know, summers are becoming hotter and the consumption of electricity at that time increases tremendously, so every year there is more and more demand for electricity and the networks are overloaded.
It is very important also to mention that network security standards must always be observed.
Therefore, we definitely need a binding standard to which all network operators have to adhere.
We have already seen the example of the Swiss blackout, which caused the blackout in Italy.
It was clear the operator had not complied with the network security requirements and that resulted in a large-scale blackout.
We should ensure that such a situation never occurs again and, at the same time, establish a system that is very reliable, where the size of the European network and the size of the UCTE system help to prevent blackouts, rather than causing blackouts or making them more widespread.
I thank you for the debate.
As I promised, as soon as the results of the inquiry are available, I will be ready to come to Parliament.
The debate is closed.
Milk quotas (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission on milk quotas by Duarte Freitas, Carmen Fraga EstÃ©vez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Esther Herranz GarcÃ­a, Elisabeth Jeggle, Albert Jan Maat, Mairead McGuinness, Francisco JosÃ© MillÃ¡n Mon, James Nicholson, Neil Parish and Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group - B6-0444/2006).
author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank the political group and the other groups for the interest that they have shown in this subject and that made it possible for this oral question to be put quickly onto the agenda.
This level of interest is indicative of the importance and sensitivity of the issue of milk quotas.
Commissioner, you suggested at the informal Council meeting that the system of milk quotas appears increasingly outdated and that it should be questioned and examined in such a way that farmers can plan their lives over the long term.
On 3 October, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Rasmussen, representing the Commission, confirmed that we would see changes following the CAP 2008-2009 health check, most probably a phasing out of the milk quota system before 2015, when the 2003 Agreement is due to expire.
It was not Parliament that raised this issue now, but it is in Parliament that the issue must be clarified, because our voters are most concerned and are anxious to know what is going on.
The truth of the matter is that the market reacted to these statements immediately, and various organisations and political agents appeared in public to have their say on the future of milk quotas.
Although the CAP health check cannot be viewed as a mid-term review, we are aware of the internal and external pressures to make changes that go beyond merely simplifying the processes.
In the dairy sector, planning is done over the long term.
As regards, on the one hand, quota acquisition and, on the other hand, genetic improvement, environmental obligations and investment in determining the quality of the milk fat and protein content produced by each cow per lactation, analysis is required every six to eight years.
Accordingly, what politicians are saying today will have repercussions until 2014-2015.
As I come from a region in the Azores which accounts for 30% of Portuguese milk production, where milk is the main source of income and where there are no medium-term alternatives, I am particularly sensitive to these changes.
It is therefore essential that we know whether or not the agreement must be complied with and whether any stringent mechanisms are to be put in place before or after 2015.
On the other hand, it is also crucial to state for political purposes that the EU will take into account the social and economic impact that changes of this nature could have on regions that depend on milk and, in particular, on regions in which there are no production alternatives.
What we really need to know now, Commissioner, is whether the milk quota system will be maintained in its current form until 2015, so that the market and the producers can be kept fully informed.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, for the time being the quota system provides some kind of stability for the European market, allowing successful full implementation of the 2003 reform without undue disturbances.
However, if the milk sector is to meet the challenge of competitiveness in the future and prosper in a more liberal world, the milk quota system will gradually become a less adequate instrument for achieving our goals.
I have therefore decided that a debate on the future of the quota system should take place within the health check process in 2008.
The most promising long-term scenario for the European dairy sector is one without quotas.
This would allow the more efficient producers to benefit from growing markets while avoiding the huge cost, especially for young farmers, of obtaining production rights.
The value of the quota system varies tremendously between the Member States.
Quota levels per Member State are fixed until 31 March 2015, as Mr Freitas rightly said.
After that date, in the absence of a proposal from the Commission and a decision taken in the Council, the system of milk quotas will end.
That is important.
If no decision is taken, the system will expire on 31 March 2015.
Were the Council to take a decision to continue the quota system after 2015, this should allow for a gradual transition from the current rules to a scenario without production limits.
It is in everybody's interest to have a soft landing in order to avoid disturbances to the sector.
When I travel around the Member States and talk to farmers, they ask for predictability.
We owe it to the farming sector to give them a clear signal, and not a last-minute one on 1 January 2015, as to whether the quota system is to continue or not.
We need to provide this predictability, and in this scenario specific measures should perhaps be introduced during a transitional period in order to make the milk quota system much more flexible than it is today.
However, it is still too early to take the appropriate measures.
We will all have a much clearer idea of the situation, and of the different options for change, once the dairy market outlook report is completed at the end of next year.
That report will be presented to Parliament and the Council and will look at the overall objectives and results of the 2003 reform, namely market orientation, competitiveness and the sustainability of the CAP in political, environmental and economic and budgetary terms.
I hope we can have a solid discussion on the future and on how to provide this predictability, which I consider so important, not just for the younger generation but also for those already in business.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks to you for what you have said, but I also want to extend warm thanks to my colleague Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and putting this oral question.
As you have already, and repeatedly, pointed out, Commissioner, the current state of affairs - that is to say, the decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 - and the question as to what will succeed it, is a cause of vigorous debate, particularly in certain regions that are, or believe themselves to be, dependent on milk and on the quotas.
It is good to hear a clear statement from you - as we indeed just have done - in which you give us the facts - namely, that the quota has been agreed on up to this point - and also tell us that we should have a debate in good time on what we propose to do about the situation.
If we want to carry on having a quota, then the farmers must be aware of that and supportive of it, exactly in the same way as they have to be of the decision to abandon the system, as is in fact currently being envisaged.
The question then arises as to what instruments might be feasible in the current financial situation as a means of preparing for its abandonment; it may well be, for example, that an increase in the milk quota is under discussion, but I would venture to express doubt as to whether this is the right way of going about it.
How are we dealing with the option for young farmers who need the security to plan ahead and who very probably ought not to be investing a great deal more money in quotas, but rather in restructuring for the sake of their own competitiveness?
How, too, are we to deal with areas that are nothing more than green spaces and need dairy farming if they are to be maintained as such?
These are, in the main, areas with very beautiful and very interesting landscape, in which there are, as a rule, very few other ways available of earning a living, and so we must support them in this way.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, I should like on behalf of my political group to thank the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and Mr Freitas for his reflections on the question of the Commission statements on milk quotas.
Commissioner, I shall not refer to what we all know to be the importance of the milk sector in Europe at the level of production, employment, investments, foreign trade or food security.
However, I would point out that any proposal to abolish or keep milk quotas must be studied promptly and carefully and an analysis must be made of its repercussions, firstly on rural incomes and the other sectors acutely affected, and on rural development itself.
This analysis should include all the regions of the Union, as well as the peculiarities of milk production in some of them.
Commissioner, we cannot be in favour of controlling milk production after 2015 under the current preconditions, which often create oligopolies in the sector.
It is a production model of the previous common agricultural policy philosophy.
On the other hand, however, we cannot accept the liberalisation of milk production quotas from one day to the next before 2015.
In this transitional period which we are going through, it is necessary to strengthen measures of transparency, efficacy and competitiveness of the sector in certain regions of the Community.
Nor can we announce any review of any product within the framework of the health check in 2008-2009.
If we want to believe that it is a health check, what we have is a simplification of the common agricultural policy.
I would like to put one question to you: is there any possibility of unbundling subsidies in 2007?
How can this be combined with the liberalisation or maintenance of the quota system?
Commissioner, I know that you will submit an honest proposal as regards the limits, so as not to give rise to any insecurity among producers.
I think that you have this political commitment, but above all it is the question of timely consultation with the European Parliament that will give competitiveness and a clear orientation to the sector.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and raising this important topic this evening.
When talking about the milk quota, it is important to note that the situation when this quota was introduced back in 1984 was completely different from now.
In 1984, there were large surpluses that could not be sold, and that is clearly no longer the case.
The difference between the global market prices in 1984 and the price in the European Union was enormous, but it is now considerably less pronounced.
If EU prices approximate to those on the global market, there is far less reason to have a quota system than there was in 1984.
I am in complete agreement with the Commissioner's statement a moment ago to the effect that it is important for farmers to know where they stand.
I do not know when the Commission will be able to indicate the proposals or direction in detail, but it would be ideal, in the framework of the health check, to also address all other components of agricultural policy and also to hear the Commission's view on the quota system.
The situation in the European Union is not - as somebody has already mentioned - the same everywhere.
When the Commission presents this analysis, it is important that this is done on a country-by-country, and perhaps even region-by-region basis.
For some regions, it is important that a quota system remains in place.
Would the Commission address this aspect during the analysis?
Whatever the outcome, on the basis of current knowledge, I think it would be preferable to phase out the quota system over a period of time.
After all, if we compare the EU's presence in terms of dairy products within the global market today to that in 1984, the situation is now considerably worse, and that is much to be regretted.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, the Commissioner's position on the milk quota system is most worrying, in that she is suggesting that they might be dismantled by 2015.
Although she says that it is too early to take substantive measures, the path to liberalisation to which she refers overlooks the importance of milk production in various disadvantaged farming areas.
For example, in Portugal, both in the North and Central Regions of the mainland and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, any dismantling of the milk quota system would hinder rural development and would impoverish vast areas in which the production of milk and other dairy production is the main activity.
We therefore emphasise the need to protect the specific characteristics of farming in various Member States and, in particular, in Portugal.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the author of the question for initiating this greatly needed debate on dairy quotas.
The problems associated with these quotas are a concern for farmers throughout Europe.
I would like to make the point that if these quotas are to be maintained for a longer period, it raises the obvious question of how high they should be, because the sizes of milk quotas are blatantly unjust: I can cite many examples of how they do not conform to market demand in particular Member States.
There are countries which are greatly damaged by quotas not being in line with their demand as consumers.
Examples are Italy and Spain, while Poland, a new Member State, is definitely another one.
For that reason, if the quotas need to be retained, then the size of these quotas must be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, since we are on the subject of milk quotas, I want to bring a serious situation to the Commissioner's attention.
The Irish milk quota sellers' group, whose members are all older farmers, all hold milk quotas which they wish to sell. Their decision to sell the quotas is based on illness, infirmity or old age.
The Irish Minister for Agriculture has stipulated that she will prioritise in favour of young farmers.
European law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age, yet our Minister is openly discriminating against older quota owners in favour of young farmers to whom she wishes to give quota - and this is the key - at below market value.
She proposes to take the cost out of present quota owners' pockets.
This is interfering with the market.
Many of these older farmers are at present subject to scaremongering, with inaccurate information from their cooperatives.
The Minister intends to confiscate quotas not offered for sale on two bases: if the quota owner does not produce for two consecutive years or if the quota owner has a leasing arrangement which expires in March one year and he does not sell his quota by the end of March the following year.
Minister Coughlan appears to want to divide the traditionally cohesive farming community by the exploitation of one group by another.
The threat to confiscate quota is an attempt to pressure farmers into poor arrangements and to sell against their will.
I ask the Commissioner to clarify this situation.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Freitas for the way in which he has presented the European Christian Democrats' initiative, and the Commissioner for opening the debate on the future of dairy products.
Let us be honest: the situation has changed over the years; high quota costs have caused the cost of milking to soar, while European dairy policy is increasingly becoming snarled up.
We have now lost 60% of our exports within the global market, and the European Union and the European dairy sector have lost 4% of world production.
Since current demand for dairy products by far outstrips production globally, Europe would do well to face the facts and ponder the question what to do after 2015.
On the one hand there are the entrepreneurs who would like to grow but are crippled by the high quota costs. On the other hand there are areas in Europe where the quotas are currently no longer being achieved, the United Kingdom being a case in point.
There is therefore every reason to look at how we can come up with a good timetable after 2015 in order to attain a better and effective system.
I should like to make a few suggestions in this respect.
First of all, milk quotas must become tradable internationally.
The superlevy must be lowered when the quota is being used but when sales are done with virtually no support to the European Union.
We could also consider levelling the milk quota at European level.
When one country does not manage to fill the entire quota and another country could do with some more, we could quite simply even the matter out afterwards.
A gradual quota increase for dairy farmers and cooperatives who sell their products without European support is also conceivable.
Finally, we advocate an effective use of European funds for rural development in those areas where small dairy farmers face problems in terms of employment and conversion.
In that way, the Commissioner may well be able to use a good timetable that leads to a more market-oriented focus and, as a member of the Dutch Christian Democratic party, the CDA, I would very much welcome it if the Commissioner were to adopt this line.
I have to congratulate her, also because a number of these proposals have already been expressed by Mr Rasmussen, Head of Section for Milk and Animal Products in DG Agriculture.
This bodes well for the future in terms of a timely debate on dairy products.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the mid-term reform of the CAP was announced as simply an intermediary review, but despite this it has been one of the most significant reforms that the policy has undergone since it began.
Given this history and the public statements that you have been making regarding the quota system in recent months that have generated a significant amount of alarm and uncertainty in the sector, I would like you to make it perfectly clear that the check-up planned for 2008 will assure us that the reform is working and that under no circumstances does the Commission intend to go further, or move forward to the date with regard to which Parliament gave its opinion in the debates on the last reform.
I would like to remind you that it was in favour of extending the current rules to the 2014-2015 financial year, in accordance with the Commission's proposal.
Other colleagues have said the same thing.
This prospect of stability, Commissioner, which the Commission proposed at that time, remains essential for an economic activity which, like any other, needs to make plans, make investments, pay and prepare for what the future may bring, with a previously established regulatory framework.
In my region, Galicia, as in others that have been mentioned, such as the Autonomous Region of the Azores or Northern Portugal (and I would like to thank Mr Freitas whose question made this debate possible), farms play a decisive role both in social and environmental terms and also in restoring territorial balance.
Agricultural unions maintain that it is the Galician model, based on family farms, that is the clearest demonstration of the multifunctional role of these types of farm and their capacity to tie people to the region.
If the Commission wants to change the rules of the game, it should first explain what it plans to do, when and how it is going to do it.
This should all be done with maximum transparency, because uncertainty, Commissioner, is the worst scenario for those working in the sector.
The sector needs stability and not shocks, time to adapt itself and to plan, and I therefore think that we should finish applying the current reform before thinking about the next one.
(FI) Mr President, milk production is a typical feature of the worst off farming regions.
It has provided a livelihood and has been a vital force in regions where other areas of agricultural production would be difficult or impossible.
It has been able to make use of good levels of coarse fodder productivity in areas that are infertile, for example.
Milk production is capital-intensive.
The investment needed is massive.
The modern production structure can cost up to a million euros.
It only normally creates jobs, however, for family farms.
Milk production is subject to quotas.
Many young farmers have made huge investments in acquiring additional production rights.
It is not uncommon for production quotas to be bought for EUR 150 000 or more.
Milk production therefore needs a long-term protected framework.
That cannot be seen as an eight-year goal.
What is a sound system has resulted in a balanced framework for the farmer in which to engage in production.
Price fluctuations have been small and the market stable.
Abolishing milk quotas would alter the situation immediately.
The large industrial concerns in Europe's best regions would be in a strong competitive position.
Agricultural diversity would be all the poorer.
Massive investments in milk quotas by family farms would immediately lose their value.
The milk markets would lose their stability.
All this would make the enterprise a very risky one and would have an adverse effect in particular on farming regions that are worse off in terms of their prevailing natural conditions.
(PL) Mr President, the common agricultural policy has raised many doubts and will continue to do so.
It will always have its supporters and its opponents.
The European Commission's intention to review the common agricultural policy, and with it milk quotas, has raised concerns as well as hope, especially in the countries that suffer from it, including Poland.
The quota allocated to Poland was insultingly low.
A case in point is Germany, which has 80 million inhabitants, and has a quota of around 28 million tonnes, while Poland, which has half the population, is only allowed some 9 million tonnes of milk.
In practical terms that means Poland has a quota four and a half million tonnes less than the thirteen to thirteen and a half million tonnes it should be allowed.
The question we would therefore like to ask is what would happen if milk quotas were abolished, particularly in countries such as Poland, where family-owned farmsteads rather than big farms predominate?
Would the change to the rules of the common agricultural policy not force these farms into bankruptcy?
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, to me it is highly regrettable that the new Member States benefit the least from the common agricultural policy.
They are participating in this 'Marshall Plan' for agriculture, whose great virtue used to be its long-term focus and vision.
Well, we joined the European Union late.
This is not the Commissioner's fault: such is the history of Europe.
But unfortunately Polish farmers are still grappling with the milk quotas, which are several million tonnes too low, and in the meantime we pay fines for over-production of milk, when they are to be lifted in 2015.
Unfortunately during that time many Polish milk producers will disappear from the market.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, as a representative of Galicia, a milk-producing region par excellence, I think that this oral question put to the European Commission today is very opportune.
Commissioner, producers are quite disconcerted by information that has been circulated, from which it can be deduced that there will be changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector and specifically concerning the quota system.
You were not very specific today, Commissioner, but I think that you made a series of things clear: that you are going to launch a debate, that there is going to be a transition period prior to the removal of quotas in 2015, from which I deduce that there is going to be a phasing out period prior to 2015 when quotas are permanently removed.
Commissioner, we are talking about an economic sector that needs legal security and medium- and long-term guarantees that will enable a minimum degree of planning, and any further change or uncertainty could, at least in my country, have serious social and economic consequences.
Quotas are a very important asset to farmers.
