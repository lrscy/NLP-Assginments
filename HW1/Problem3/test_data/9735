Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that, in fact, there are differences between these two types of water.
In this area, as in others, it is therefore essential to heed the World Health Organisationâs recommendations.
As for the âsufficientâ classification, it would only be acceptable if this were taken as a minimum quality requirement, to be improved by a specified tight deadline, which was not the case.
Similarly, bringing the classification date forward gives rise to problems with regard to the framework directive on water.
I welcome the measures on informing the public and emergency plans for areas regularly affected by flooding, and we therefore supported these proposals.
Â Â  .
On 21Â April, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted 34 amendments to the Council common position on the management of bathing water quality.
I am strongly opposed to Amendment 27, which is intended to remove the distinction between âcoastal watersâ and âinland watersâ in Annex I. Portugal has maintained a clear distinction between the two, given that epidemiological studies have demonstrated differences with regard to quality indicators and levels of bacteriological activity, using a range of different methods.
The conclusion is therefore that if the bacteria indicators are different and operate differently, then the two types of water require different epidemiological assessment criteria.
I see no reason to take decisions that run counter to the recommendations hitherto made by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and to the scientific studies on which those recommendations are based, which indicate that a distinction should be made between âcoastal and transitional watersâ, especially because in Portugal around 21% of bathing waters that currently comply would lose their classification.
I therefore feel that I cannot support this proposal by Parliament.
Â Â  I have voted against all of the amendments contained in the Maaten report that sought over-regulation.
The public must be informed about the quality of bathing water, and its quality must be improved.
We must, however, have confidence in the intelligence and judgment of human beings, particularly as regards carrying out recreational activities.
Â Â  Regulations concerning the rules that are to apply to the quality of bathing water at European seaside resorts are a matter not for the EU but for the individual Member States.
Parliamentâs proposal has taken no account of the principles either of subsidiarity or of proportionality.
Over and above the position we adopt on principle, to the effect that the management of bathing water quality is not an issue for the EU, we consider Parliamentâs proposal to be more bureaucratic and long-winded than the Councilâs.
We have thus voted against the present recommendation.
The condition of bathing water varies a lot within the EU, and it is therefore undesirable to adopt a directive applicable both to the Mediterranean countries and the EUâs northern countries, for example, Sweden.
We therefore object to a number of the wordings, for example the one stating that emergency plansneed to be set up to cover events such as floods, accidents or infrastructure problems that could affect the quality of bathing water.
We are not in favour of the detailed regulations Parliament wishes to introduce, for example stating that the scope of the directive should be extended to include further recreational activities.
Â Â  .
This report on bathing water quality is very important to my country.
The Portuguese coastline stretches for many miles, and bathing in the water is a very popular pastime.
The same is true of some inland bathing water areas.
The requirements that must be met in order to ensure the safe use of designated bathing water areas encompass not only access, infrastructures and safety on the beaches, but also, to an increasing extent, the quality of the water.
The quality of bathing water thus represents both a health issue and an important indicator of environmental quality and tourism development.
Nevertheless, I cannot agree with the proposal made in the report to scrap the distinction between coastal waters and inland waters, because there are differences between these two types.
I am also opposed to the removal of the âsufficientâ classification, which gives Member States greater room for manoeuvre in terms of managing the suitability of bathing water.
Adopting these two amendments would have serious repercussions for Portugal, given the disproportionate costs involved in relation to the benefits gained.
Â Â  .
I welcome this report and strongly wish to see further improvements in the quality of bathing water and fully recognise the need to update the existing Directive which is now almost 30 years old.
I have two concerns.
I do not wish to see the âsufficientâ category deleted as this would lead to some beaches in this category being labelled âpoorâ.
This would lead the public to this conditions had deteriorated when in fact no change had taken place.
Â Â  . Labour MEPs want to see further improvements in the quality of bathing water and welcomes the opportunity to update the bathing water directive almost 30 years after the existing directive came into force.
However, they did not support amendments in two key areas.
Firstly, on the deletion of the sufficient standard, Labour MEPs cannot support this because it would mean that bathing waters which meet current standards, would suddenly be classified as âpoorâ (the sufficient standard being proposed is twice as strict for coastal areas as the current minimum standard).
This would be confusing for the public.
It is much better to have a phased approach to improving standards.
Secondly on the extension of the scope of the directive to include recreational waters: Labour MEPs cannot support moves to extend the scope of the directive to recreational waters.
Such an extension is uncosted and impracticable â recreational sports are carried out throughout the year rather than in aÂ bathing season and the number ofÂ monitoring points would be huge.
Â Â  .
It is of course necessary and desirable to protect the environment with ever-tighter regulations.
However, because policy of this nature does not need to be incompatible with economic growth and development, the measures taken in this regard must not, in the name of staunchly protecting the environment and public health, end up damaging the economy, particularly the tourist industry, which is so important to Portugal.
In this report, and more specifically in some of the amendments tabled therein, this balance was not struck; far from it, some of them had no scientific basis whatsoever.
Consequently, I voted in favour of the report but against the amendments that would, to my mind, work against reasonable and justifiable national interests, such as the provision scrapping the âsufficientâ category in water quality assessment, and the removal of the distinction between coastal and inland waters.
Â Â  .
The purpose of this proposal for a directive is to facilitate cross-border mergers of companies with share capital, although I welcome the fact that it does not cover cooperative societies.
Broadly speaking, the report deals more with the companies themselves than with the repercussions of mergers on the lives of workers and regions, although it does mention that the draft terms of the merger should include the effects of the merger on employment and the opinion of the employees.
It does not consider that opinion binding, however, and does not provide for the merger to be rejected if that opinion is negative.
With regard to the employeesâ right to participate, there are some contradictions, which means that even some of the positive aspects will ultimately be difficult to put into practice, in light of the context of which they form a part.
Â Â  . In view of the fact that cinema is an integral part of culture and that culture is key to the development of human beings, it must be encouraged and supported by means of practical â and especially financial â measures.
The film industry must not be looked upon as an exclusively economic activity, because competitiveness has a negative effect and may dilute cinemaâs cultural and educational elements.
I agree with the rapporteur that the cultural heritage of European cinema must be preserved, âencouraging policies of innovation, research and technological development in the field of conservation and restoration of cinematographic worksâ, but with a cultural and educational end, rejecting competitiveness as a principal factor.
The establishment of the âlegal requirementâ to deposit the master copy is a further welcome measure in preserving peopleâs collective memory and identity.
These measures should form part of a cooperation framework between Member States, under the scope of the cultural diversity that characterises Europeâs different regions, countries and peoples.
The obsession with competitiveness undermines creativity and artistic nature, due to the pressures of the market and the demands placed by the capitalist, profit-orientated mindset.
A policy must therefore be drawn up that sets out practical measures to support the audiovisual sector, which would reduce the sectorâs dependence on private backing and would make it less beholden to the inherent contradictions therein.
Â Â  Preserving the cultural heritage is, of course, very important.
We believe, however, that this is an issue to be dealt with not by the EU but by the Member States and that we can have plenty of confidence in the latterâs way of handling this issue.
We have therefore voted against this report, since we believe that this recommendation need not have been dealt with at all by the European Parliament.
Â Â  In order to better protect the European cultural heritage, Europe intends to establish exceptional conservation and protection measures that will enable its film heritage to be preserved and that will promote efforts to protect the linguistic, cultural and artistic identity of our ancient continent.
One of the recommendations proposes extending the benefits of State aid to film.
This in fact means extending the âcultural exceptionâ and expanding this exceptional status, which is the exact adaptation of what we champion for France, that is to say national preference!
The Commission has taken the decision to extend the current system of State aid for cinematographic and televised works by three years, even though it would be more appropriate to evaluate and reform these far from satisfactory provisions.
In these conditions, why limit this protection to culture and not extend it to the textile industry, to agriculture, to the iron and steel industry, to the shipbuilding industry and so on?
In the end, will the internationalist logic of the Commission not condemn this moratorium that distorts free competition?
The clear defence of national and European preference will alone protect Europe from global ultraliberalism.
Â Â  I have chosen to vote against this report because I do not believe that the EU should exercise control over these cultural issues.
The report is far too inclined to interfere where it is not required.
It is up to each individual country to manage the way in which film is regulated.
Â Â  I have abstained from the vote on improving port security, because our Parliament, as usual, has unnecessarily overburdened and complicated procedures that in any case are subject to subsidiarity.

Â Â  Obviously, there need to be stringent security requirements for European ports. We acknowledge that.
We wonder, however, if there is any danger of a Member State such as the Netherlands genuinely mishandling security at the port of Rotterdam, which is so crucial to the countryâs economic life.
This directive has been designed in such a way that there is a danger of its dealing a heavy blow to smaller ports, which would have to implement a disproportionate number of costly measures in order to continue with their activities.
Because such ports are often situated in economically weaker regions, this would have unfortunate consequences for the regions.
We wish to see the directive reviewed and reworked from the perspective of the smaller ports.
Â Â  The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have put the issue of transport security at the top of the political agenda.
As vital links in the transport chain connecting the flow of goods and passengers by sea and by land, ports must obviously be the subject of security measures, in line with proposals by the Commission.
I can but endorse such an initiative because, as the elected European representative of the large north-west region, more than 15 large maritime trade ports vital to the local and national economy are affected.
France is susceptible to this dossier as it has three particularly well-exposed coastlines.
The English Channel in the north (the ports of Le Havre, Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne and Rouen), the Atlantic coast (the ports of Bordeaux, Nantes, Saint-Nazaire and La Rochelle which form entry ports for trade with Eastern, Southern and Northern Europe), and finally, the Mediterranean coast (the Marseille-Fos port).
These security measures must obviously not be restricted to port terminals alone, but must also extend to the whole of the port and related activities.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert on her important and timely report on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on enhancing port security, which I endorse wholeheartedly, especially the proposal to establish a common security level in all Community ports.
The Member States must be free, however, to establish different security levels commensurate with the amount of risk in the ports, and to define the perimeter of each port under this directive and its adjacent areas.
It is also crucial, I feel, to examine the costs involved in the proposed measures and who is to pay, in order to ensure a level playing field for all concerned.
Â Â  . I reject the need for EU legislation in this field since it should be the responsibility of the individual member states to decide how best to ensure port security.
In addition an IMO code of conduct covering the issue already exists.
The EU argues that the IMO code of conduct is not legally binding and a proposed EU Directive has ensued, which I have voted against.
Amendments 5, 6, 7, 30 and 45 attempted to mitigate the impact of this Directive, permitting Member States more authority over proposed measures and I would have voted for these had they not been included in a block vote, the remainder of which was impossible to support.
Â Â  .â The EU directive on enhancing port security sees off the directive on the liberalisation of port services, strikes at the wage and employment and social rights of the workers and sells off ports to shipowners, industrialists and monopolies in order to increase the profits of big business.
On the pretext of terrorism, the directive in question is being used to create ghetto workplaces, strengthen repressive mechanisms and strike at the collective and individual freedoms of workers in ports and on ships.
The Communist Party of Greece voted against the reactionary directive enhancing port security.
We call on the workers to take joint action against the anti-grass roots policy of the EU, to fight to defend and extend their rights, for radical changes, for ports which belong to the people for the prosperity of the people.
Â Â  The resolution on the murder of Robert McCartney identifies the IRA as being responsible for the murder, in spite of the fact that the issue has still not been decided in court.
It is absurd for the European Parliament to set itself up as a judge on a sensitive issue that can affect the peace process in Northern Ireland.
We therefore choose to abstain from voting on the resolution.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the resolution by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the McCartney case.
We have abstained from voting on the resolution by the other groups.
This resolution contains many sound points, but its basis, in Article 1, is that the murder was a political one organised by the IRA.
That is probably not the case, and the police investigation is not complete.
This introduces an imbalance into the resolution as a whole.
Â Â  . GUE/NGL deplores and condemns the killing of Robert McCartney and asks for justice to be done.
We express our condolences and stress that the McCartney family deserve the fullest support in their pursuit of justice.
GUE/NGL calls on those responsible to come forward and take responsibility for their actions and calls on those who witnessed any of the events surrounding the killing to come forward and provide information to the police or in any other form that will assist the prosecution of Robert McCartney's killers in a court of law.
Respecting what the sisters of Robert McCartney underlined when they visited the European Parliament on 6 April, that this murder had no political background, but was a criminal act which should be prosecuted and those responsible brought to justice, GUE/NGL made every attempt to agree a common resolution with the other political groups.
We very much regret that they were not willing to compromise, preferring to use the resolution to focus on the political situation in the North of Ireland.
GUE/NGL will be happy to deal with this issue in the European Parliament, but todayâs voted resolution is not the correct way to do it.
We therefore abstained in the final vote, and our position is made very clear in our own groups proposed resolution.
Â Â  . I welcome this vote to give support to the sisters of Robert McCartney in their fight to bring to justice his killers.
Their courage gives real hope for change and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.
Â Â  .
Democratic states have but one way of dealing with terrorism and that is through their judicial systems.
Free societies have but one way of dealing with those who use terror and private âjusticeâ as their weapon, and that is to reject them out of hand.
Anyone who wishes to represent people politically must follow these rules.
There can be no exceptions.
Quite apart from the personal family tragedy that the murder of Robert McCartney represents, it is also a perfect example of the fact that we must uphold these principles unreservedly.
Although it is not Parliamentâs job to become involved in national-level judicial processes, these values are so important that I shall be voting in favour.
Â Â  . We in UKIP strongly support the brave stand taken by the McCartney family to gain justice after the murder of their brother, Robert.
However, we cannot support the use of EU money in a civil court case in Northern Ireland.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Schmit, Commissioner, it is true â climate policy matters not only to the European Union, but also to the world as a whole, and attention to that policy is for that reason a global task.
Before we press on with discussion of the Kyoto issue, though, Europe should ask itself what targets it has set itself and which of them it has achieved.
Or perhaps the other way round: which targets must we set ourselves for the future, and by what means can we achieve them?
Have we, in the whole Kyoto debate, managed to involve those countries that have not signed the Kyoto Protocol?
Morally, at any rate, the Kyoto treaty is binding upon all of us, for we all share in responsibility for the policies we adopt with regard to this planetâs climate.
It is for that reason that I would like the Council and the Commission to tell us how they are preparing for this new step post-2012, and whether they are willing to take the initiative in finding new shoulders to bear the burdens of Kyoto.
Are you, then, looking for other partners and participants in this process as a whole?
The countries I have in mind are, of course, India, China, Brazil and the United States.
If this House believes that this or that country can be induced to make progress by threatening it with a court summons, then it is, in my view, making a mistake.
Only if all the arguments are in your favour and beyond reasonable doubt should you haul someone before the courts.
It strikes me as preferable by far, and as a more promising course of action, to get these countries into a situation in which they have to make a move, and to motivate them to stop sulking and making excuses for each other, and instead to say, âyes, we do have a shared responsibilityâ.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, there is another question I would like to revisit, and it is that of to what degree you are able and willing not only to involve other countries and actively engage in dialogue with them, but also other sectors as well.
I am thinking, for example, of transport policy, the heating of private homes ...
Oh yes, that is something we have long been calling for, but you have never paid any attention.
All these sectors, then, need to be involved.
There is no doubt that there will be trouble; that is why, when I told the German minister for the environment â who is one of your party-political allies â that he should ask for that, his reply was that he could not do that, for if he did, he would lose his seat in no time.
It is precisely for that reason, though, that he should do it, so, Commissioner, which sectors do you want to include?
I also believe that we have to have the courage to tackle heating in private homes â along with all the other things in our homes that give off heat and account for over one third of all CO2 emissions.
How far are you prepared to go in highlighting new ways of dealing with this?
The examples are very simple, but, rather than trying to apply one standard to all, what we have to give the partners who will join us in Kyoto is targets, leaving it to them to find their own ways of reaching them.
Who, after all, would have believed that the Federal Republic of Germany, to take one example, would, by means of a well thought-out waste policy, have saved 21 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over the last 15Â years?
We can, though, do a lot if we are willing to motivate these countries to get stuck into this.
Just by way of a final observation, why is there no longer any reference to agriculture in all this?
By this, I do not mean punishments for this sector â that is the Greensâ policy, which I have always thought misguided â but to motivating it.
Nowhere is it written that farmers must plant only root crops, cereals, rape or vines; they could equally well grow genetically or biologically modified plants that absorb large quantities of CO2 and return it to the atmosphere only in small quantities when burned later on.
Here too, then, there are lots of opportunities for the future and scope for being imaginative.
Commissioner, I would urge both you and the President-in-Office of the Council to be pro-active and optimistic when tackling this issue, so that we may be able, for our childrenâs sake, to take the necessary steps at long last towards making this continent safe where CO2 emissions are concerned.
Â Â  I think I should begin by thanking Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for his question and for his speech, which clearly defines the issues of climate change and also suggests some answers to this problem, which will, or might ultimately, be a threat to humanity.
I believe Europe has become a real leader in this field.
We have managed to show the way by applying the Kyoto Protocol, but we also know that we cannot stop there, that we must continue to develop the policies we have implemented on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol.
And while we must join with our partners to find solutions internationally, we must also, as you so rightly said, find solutions at home.
As the March European Council showed, I think climate change is indeed a major challenge for Europe, as it is for all the industrialised and industrialising nations, but it also offers our industries new possibilities and prospects.
To speak of the European economy being competitive certainly does not mean that industry need not rise to this challenge.
It is quite clear that Europe is also capable of exploiting its role as an engine to become an industrial power in development technologies, especially in the realm of alternative energies; when it comes to energy savings, Europe can consolidate its leading position and benefit more economically by cooperating with other partners, countries like China in particular, which is beginning to attach greater importance to these questions for a variety of reasons, especially reasons of climate.
I therefore believe that competitiveness and environmental protection are entirely compatible, as are competitiveness and a solution to the climate problem.
The Council also agrees with a number of the analyses Parliament makes in its resolution on the subject, and the seminar of government experts is an important occasion here: it is in a way a new stage in the development of a future climate regime for the years after 2012.
At this seminar, the parties will exchange views on present policies and initiatives and on the future adjustments that will have to be made to alleviate the problem of climate change.
The European Unionâs contribution to this seminar is therefore an important part of its strategy with a view to formal negotiations to draw up a post-Kyoto regime.
The European Council which met on 22 and 23 March 2005, and of which I have already spoken in connection with relaunching the Lisbon strategy, has already adopted some key elements which will be essential for designing the future climate regime.
It confirmed that, if the essential target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is to be met, the increase in the global annual average surface temperature must not be more than 2ÂºC above pre-industrial levels.
It also welcomed the Commission communication entitled âWinning the battle against global climate changeâ and in that connection clearly emphasised the need to give fresh impetus to international negotiations by exploring options for a post-2012 regime and ensuring the widest possible cooperation of all countries.
It also stressed the need to develop a medium- and long-term EU strategy that will be compatible with the 2Â°C target and in that respect I believe that it answers all the concerns you have voiced and that it takes on board the suggested solutions for the various sectors to which you referred.
During a visit by the troika to the United States on 18 and 19 April 2005, which I think the Commissioner may speak about, agreement was reached to explore ways of relaunching the EU-US High-Level Groupâs activities in order to examine policies for fighting climate change.
I can tell you that the President of the United States assured the President-in-Office of the European Council that the United States was going to adopt a more open and more sensitive approach to these problems.
Contacts with other key parties involved in the climate change process, and I will mention China and India in particular, will be made in the months ahead.
The issue of climate change also figures prominently on the agenda for the G8 and I know that the forthcoming British Presidency considers this problem one of its priorities.
The European Parliament certainly has an important part to play in our joint efforts to reach an agreement on a future climate regime.
The Council is very interested in Parliamentâs position on the post-2012 framework.
It also hopes that Parliament will continue to take part in international meetings.
The Council also invites Parliament to assist it in heightening the awareness of European public opinion and of national parliaments in the European Union and elsewhere.
It is not in fact rare to meet in other parliamentary fora MPs of countries that are concerned by this problem, a problem which ought to concern us all.
Â Â  . Mr President, following the very informative intervention by Minister Schmit, I wish to add a few comments and perhaps come back to some of the points raised by the Minister.
First I wish to thank the chairman, Mr Florenz, for giving us this opportunity to debate climate change and, in particular, the strategy of the European Union for the seminar of government experts on climate change due to meet in Bonn next week.
I share Parliament's opinion that the seminar is a very timely step in working out the future arrangements with regard to climate change.
The European Union's contribution to this seminar therefore constitutes an important part of our strategy, the aim of which is to obtain a mandate to open official negotiations on the development of these arrangements.
On 9 February, the Commission approved its communication entitled 'Winning the battle against global climate change'. This communication, which is also addressed to the European Parliament, contains the Commission's initial recommendations on the European Union's strategy after 2012.
Basic elements of the communication in question were adopted by the Environment Council on 11 March and by the European Council on 22-23 March, as Mr Schmit mentioned earlier.
Apart from defining the elements which will comprise future arrangements, the communication also lists specific steps which need to be taken in the direction of these arrangements.
First in importance is the need to investigate, jointly with basic partners and during the current year, both the potential for a strategy after 2012 and the shaping of a favourable climate for opening official negotiations on future arrangements.
Three weeks ago, as Mr Schmit said, I and my colleagues from Luxembourg and the United Kingdom visited the United States and the outcome of these truly constructive talks, as you acknowledged Mr Florenz, because we had discussed all this beforehand, was the agreement to find ways of restarting, of reactivating the EU/US high-level group, with a view to examining policies to combat climate change.
We have also scheduled contacts with other countries over coming months.
Climate change is also high on the agenda of the G8 Group, while I personally have already held unofficial talks with my counterparts representing our basic partners both within the framework of meetings of the G8 Group and at the United Nations during talks on sustainable development.
We met, either jointly with Mr Lux and Lord Whitty or separately, with representatives, with ministers from China, Brazil, Spain, South Africa, Australia and Russia and got their initial reactions.
Unfortunately, we were unable to meet the Indian minister, despite the fact that we tried both in England to achieve a meeting at the meetings held by the G8 Group and in New York.
At the same time, we are strengthening numerous informal contacts and talks at a technical level.
As far as the seminar of government experts is concerned, this is an important opportunity to broaden these contacts at the level in question through open dialogue within the framework of the United Nations convention on climate change.
According to the Commission's strategy, the objective of the European Union for the seminar is to create a climate of trust, to discuss and look for common ground and to send out appropriate messages, not just to the United States, but also to all the global partners.
I should point out here that many countries are hiding â at least they have been hiding until now â behind the refusal of the United States, in order to avoid discussing the question of climate change.
The European Union will not do likewise.
It will send out appropriate messages by presenting our opinions and endeavouring to obtain the opinions of others on the topical issues raised in the Commission communication.
I wish to agree with Mr Florenz that we also need to include other sectors, if we are to be able to combat climate change more effectively, including in the transport sector.
As we said earlier, the Commission is preparing a communication for next June on the question of air transport, the contribution of which to greenhouse gas emissions is increasing constantly.
We are examining three alternative solutions: tax, inclusion in the gas trading system or user charges.
Similarly, we must say that the new agricultural policy supports the production of biofuels and, of course, the housing sector and the construction sector in general are very important sectors in which we can achieve important results.
Finally, I should like to say that Parliament is being called on to play an important part in our efforts to achieve an agreement on future arrangements with regard to climate.
The Commission is particularly interested in your opinions on the problems and on the recommendations for the European Union's strategy, as presented in our communication.
I also anticipate that your active participation and cooperation at international conferences will continue.
Moreover, I call for Parliament's support in further raising the awareness of the public in the European Union and of your parliamentary counterparts in other countries.
You did a very good job in Buenos Aires and I want this work to continue with the same demands on the part of the European Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, may I thank everyone, and especially MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Dimas, for their contributions.
It is in itself extremely positive that you radiate a certain optimism regarding this difficult issue, both where the problem as a whole is concerned and, specifically, when it comes to your reading of Bush.
I wish I could be just as optimistic.
Just the other day, George W Bush gave a speech on energy and climate change that unfortunately did not show any real movement in the right direction.
I of course agree with you, however, that the dialogue with the United States is incredibly important because, without its active participation, the work on climate change can never be properly effective.
It is, of course, just as important to engage in dialogue â and dialogue of a strategic nature â with large developing countries such as China and India.
I saw the other day that China anticipates building 800 large coal-fired power stations over the next ten years.
The emissions from these will completely overshadow what we do in Europe.
The conclusion is, of course, that the developing countries need not go down precisely the same route in energy development as we have done.
They need not repeat our mistakes, and it is in the interests of all of us to offer them favourable conditions for investing in the best possible technology.
On this point, I am unfortunately compelled to note that the CDM, that is to say the Clean Development Mechanism, is not enough.
Instead, we must come up with something much more radical and ambitious.
The situation is serious, with the latest research reports in fact indicating that the climate system may be much more vulnerable than we had previously believed.
It will be much more difficult to stay within the two-degree increase in temperature established by the EU as an objective and to avoid dangerous climate change.
That is why the summit in Bonn is so important, for you will be able to lay a foundation for the period following 2012.
Our resolution indicates the need for short- and long-term emissions objectives.
We also think that such objectives need to be accompanied by far more ambitious programmes in terms both of the development of new energy sources and increased investment in energy efficiency.
There is a range of issues in this area to which we must return and in connection with which we must together devise practical objectives.
I wish the Commission and the Council good luck in Bonn and hope that you will come back with positive reports so that we can do this work in a way that is constructive for the future and, as MrÂ Florenz pointed out, accept our responsibility for future generations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Florenz and Mr Wijkman for taking the initiative and prompting this debate.
Commissioner, global warming is materialising much quicker than anticipated.
We are faced with the dual task of adapting to climate change and, at the same time, of keeping it to an absolute minimum.
In the light of this enormous challenge, the outcome of the Climate Conference in Buenos Aires was particularly disappointing.
It is, of course, good that a seminar managed to keep the Kyoto process on the rails, if only just, and that the EU had its own way and that next weekâs seminar in Bonn will be about future developments, but this is a shamefully poor result.
We have to conclude that the EU is becoming ever more isolated, and that the urgency that is felt in Europe is not shared in other parts of the world.
The EU will need to be constructive in Bonn if a much stronger international coalition is to be built up, and sound, productive and well-founded proposals will have to be tabled there.
Commissioner, I would like to put to you four points which, in our view, can help achieve a constructive, international coalition.
First of all, we must put far more work into adaptation and help others, certainly developing countries, to adapt.
Adaptation is certainly not simple, but aid should definitely not be restricted to major disasters.
As lifestyle adaptation is far-reaching, credible programmes must be written.
Secondly, with regard to the transfer of technology, which has already been mentioned by Mr Wijkman, we must abandon our ideological reservations about the mechanism for clean development and go all out for investment in technology transfer, concentrating on further research and development in the area of environmental technology, to which subject I will gladly return during the debate on the seventh framework programme for research.
Thirdly, we will need to focus far less on the national approach and objectives within each country, but far more on sectoral objectives.
In the discussions we held as parliamentary delegation in Buenos Aires, a sectoral approach emerged as a viable route.
We will need to enter into dialogue with the steel, cement and paper industries.
I regard aviation as a sector to which priority should be given.
In all these sectors, competition is worldwide, so it is obvious that worldwide objectives should be established based on the best available technology.
Moreover, a sectoral approach is ideally suited to our Lisbon strategy, which was reviewed during the last spring summit.
Finally, although it is more controversial for me to say this, I would ask you to consider the role that the WTO can play.
The European Union must open the discussion on trade measures against countries that fail to meet their climate obligation.
In that case, green trade policy is not directed against developing countries but against the richer countries, which can, in fact, result in help for developing countries.
Commissioner, we expect from the European Union an international climate policy with ambition and with the largest possible international support base in other countries, industry and among the public.
I wish you much success in Bonn.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is, in fact, an extremely important issue and a real issue.
There are still some who wish to deny it, but we cannot allow ourselves to conceal the seriousness of the issue.
Climate change derives from a two-fold shortage: the physical scarcity of energy resources and the inability of the ecosystem to absorb the flow of waste.
It must be pointed out, in actual fact, that, as extreme events become worse, climate change creates considerable threats for the region, which must be tackled immediately.
In the present context, greater security provisions are required: the Kyoto Protocol is only the first answer; we must move forward and provide a systematic solution.
It is not only the issue of energy production that is at stake, but also the consumption habits of our society.
What scares me most are the statements emerging from the United States, according to which their standard of living cannot be called into question.
On the contrary, such a reappraisal is the very first thing that we must make possible in Europe.
Taking the knowledge-based society seriously additionally means changing our way of life in an ever more radical way, and ensuring that our development is sustainable.
We must seek to progress in the work of involving other countries, persuading them that we are indeed faced with the duty of transforming our society.
We must emerge from the age of fossil fuels, and the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step; we must go beyond this and work in earnest, because we must radically alter the ways of our society.
Â Â  . Mr President, last autumn a Finnish business magazine wrote that if the world had a managing director, he or she would have already started to take vigorous action to reduce emissions, and action a lot more vigorous than Kyoto.
Some time ago, an article in the British magazine, , expressed astonishment at decision-makers who view the warnings of climate researchers with indifference.
The magazine asked whether political decision-makers thought they lived in an alternative universe where the laws of nature did not apply, and went on to say that no one would ever view a risk of economic collapse so nonchalantly.
After Kyoto, we will need bolder cuts in emissions and more countries to be involved.
We will also need to involve major economically developing countries, such as China and India.
Above all, however, it is the biggest polluter, the United States of America, which ought to recognise its responsibility.
It is pointless trying to imagine the involvement of China and India if the richest country on earth remains a free-rider.
The industrialised countries have to acknowledge their historical responsibility for the fact that climate change has begun generally, and, accordingly, it is we who have the main responsibility to cut emissions.
The countries which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol are trying to gain an unfair competitive edge.
We should seriously think about whether we can, for example, impose protective tariffs on imports into Europe of steel produced in the United States.
The rules of the World Trade Organisation make this possible.
Fortunately, the voice of reason is also being heard in the United States.
Many states there have decided to take action.
The north-eastern states are starting to engage in carbon dioxide emissions trading, and want to be part of the European Union emissions trading scheme.
A number of city mayors have committed themselves to action at local level, and they are seeking the involvement of 141 cities, which is the same as the number of countries that have ratified Kyoto.
Since, however, mere reason does not appear to be enough to persuade the United States to bear global responsibility, the kind of action possible under WTO rules ought to be seriously considered.
Â Â  . Mr President, I fully support the resolution on climate change.
In February, four members of our group attended the IPCCâs Climate Conference in La RÃ©union where we were shocked by the conclusions of the scientists that had gathered there.
Even if we resorted to all the measures listed in the resolution, we would not be able to resolve the problem of climate change entirely.
Even if we make every possible effort in the framework of Kyoto until 2050, we will still not be able to stop the earth from warming up by two degrees and the sea level from rising by half a metre.
I happen to come from the Netherlands, the Low Countries, so you can imagine that this causes me some considerable anxiety.
If the sea level increases by half a metre, large parts of my country will flood if nothing is done about it.
The coastline as we know it will disappear.
The Hague will disappear into the sea and with it, the embassies of all the countries represented here today, our government buildings, the International Court of Justice, the Yugoslavia Tribunal and the Palace of our Queen.
We may, as a party, be republican, but we do not want to achieve our goals by submerging the royal palace.
Fortunately, the Netherlands has the technical capacity to prevent this from happening, but many other countries do not.
The disappearance of whole swathes of coastline is inevitable.
We should prepare for that eventuality, and I would therefore urge the Commission to form an opinion on this.
It can make a start during the forthcoming seminar which will be attended by government experts.
I would ask the Commission at least to stand by its own measures and directives, including those for air quality.
Since these measures are now beginning to take shape in a concrete manner, opposition from some Member States or sectors will increase and there will be a call for moderation, something that we oppose, and we would ask you, Parliament and the Council, to stand firm.
We would also urge you not to opt for a step forward, for more nuclear energy, but instead to choose for the development of all possible alternatives, and we would ask you to stick to the text of the resolution so that the EU can continue to play its pioneering role.
Â Â  MrÂ President, during the last hundred years, the world has experienced an increase in temperature of approximately 0.6 degrees.
The UNâs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has noted that this change mainly affects the worldâs poor people.
I wish to emphasise this, because we in this House too often see global problems from a one-sided European perspective.
The reasons why it is mainly poor people who experience the effects of global climate change are many.
They partly have to do with the fact that these countriesâ economies are often dominated by climate-sensitive industries, especially agriculture.
They also have few resources with which to adapt to, and protect themselves against, various changes, for example rising sea levels or reduced rainfall.
There are also too few resources for preventive healthcare.
It is thus difficult to eradicate the risk of climate-related diseases, such as malaria, from breaking out.
The worldâs rich countries need to coordinate their common efforts in combating climate change and to work in particular with preventive measures.
My party believes that the EU should work on cross-border environmental issues. Climate change is among these.
I thus support constructive and well thought-out proposals by the EU in this area.
At the same time, I wish to emphasise that the UN Climate Conventionhasbeen ratified by189 parties.
Thus, we cannot operate unilaterally through European institutions.
We need instead also to coordinate our measures within the frameworks of other international organisations and to be alert to the UNâs competent bodies and the World Energy Council (WEC).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that the environment is an inalienable resource that must be managed to its full potential and its continuity must be guaranteed, and it is only right in our opinion and that of the , which I represent, that the Union includes this theme as one of its political and strategic priorities.
It is not possible to enter here into the scientific merits of the theory that our planet is undergoing climate change on a geological time scale â a theory about which researchers are not in agreement â partly because of the limitations of meteorological observations in time and space.
On the other hand, it is widely agreed that, since the beginning of the last century, the average increase in the planetâs temperature has been one of the causes of changes to the ecosystem â we only have to mention the increase in desertification by way of example.
Assuming that the rise in temperature is recognised as being, at least in part, attributable to human activity, we agree that application of the Kyoto Protocol on the widest scale is a worthwhile and necessary attempt to limit such effects.
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to encourage absolute compliance with the Protocol within the EU, and to examine every possible means of exerting political and economic pressure on countries that have not adopted said Protocol.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is very important to lay down the right preconditions so that policy on climate change, based also on the Kyoto Protocol, can start to bring about specific results.
I agree with the previous speakers that the United States of America, China, India, Brazil and other countries need to participate.
However, it is equally important that the right guidelines be given, so that policy and progress to limit emissions of greenhouse gases can be formulated and addressed in the long term.
I was delighted to hear the Commissioner talk about a strategy after 2012.
This policy must take account of the increased needs of our planet and of the pressure caused both by the population increase and our various manmade activities.
Sustainable development cannot be achieved without developing new environmental technology and innovations, especially in the transport and energy sectors.
We need to promote this policy not only at European Union level, but also at global level.
The seminar of government experts must also include the question of promoting environmental technologies and innovation.
Measures to moderate and adjust must also be based, over and above the aspect of the cost of productivity, on meeting future challenges.
With this objective, the seminar is seen as useful in identifying the factors which currently impose the greatest burden on the environment and, consequently, in promoting the necessary environmental technologies and innovations to mitigate these harmful repercussions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Dimas for your extremely hopeful contributions.
I really hope that you are right in your analysis and that things are moving in the right direction.
I should also like to thank MrÂ Wijkman for his work on the resolution we shall later be voting on.
In common with many others here in the House, I share the view that the conference involving government experts is an extremely welcome development, even though I also wish to emphasise that it cannot replace summits at a higher political level, for it sometimes feels as if we have a very great deal of knowledge but that we lack the political will to do more to get on top of climate change.
I hope that this conference can contribute to drawing attention to positive examples of the way in which the effect on climate can be reduced, especially when it comes to social planning, for it sometimes feels as if climate issues are only regarded as a peripheral environmental issue for those with a special interest in it.
It is extremely important, however, that we integrate this approach into all of our social structuring and social planning, for it will only be then that we shall be able to achieve results.
I also hope that the conference will include discussion of ways of integrating measures designed to reduce effects upon climate and bring about sustainable development into the WTOâs trade system, as well as into other international agreements.
That is what is needed if more countries are to adopt the measures required, but rules of that type could also help reduce the number of those shipments that at present play such a big part in causing major climate problems.
At present, for example, fish are hauled out of the Baltic and North Sea, transported by âplane to Asia and packaged as ready-made meals which are then transported back and sold in the same places as the fish were landed.
Shipments of that type cannot make economic sense or be in any way sustainable, and we must ensure that the economy is partly driven in a manner that makes it unprofitable to transport food in this way.
Finally, good luck with the conference, and do your best to let it be known that the EU is in actual fact doing something in this area.
We do need to do something.
We need to show our electorates and citizens that we are in actual fact doing something about the greatest challenge we face, namely climate change.
Â Â  MrÂ President, several of the scientific studies carried out recently show that climate change is probably proceeding even more quickly than we thought and that greater reductions in the quantity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are also needed in order to prevent this change.
This means that the demands upon us are increasing and that the measures we need to take to reduce emissions by 60 to 80% by 2050 â which is a realistic figure â will require quite different energy and transport policies than those we have at present.
We have, then, really only just begun.
At the same time, we are used to saying in this House that we are better than the United States, as indeed we are, but that is not of course something that it is particularly difficult to be in the present situation.
We saw in Buenos Aires how, at present, the United States does not only refuse to accept its own share of responsibility but also tries actively to prevent global cooperation in the climate sphere.
That is why it is even more important that the EU dare to conduct a consistent policy involving far-reaching objectives.
I also believe that the nation that, in the end, will be the main loser in this situation, not only ecologically but also economically, will be the United States itself because its outmoded and cumbersome energy and transport systems will force it to make even more rapid and more comprehensive adjustments further down the line.
Â Â  Mr President, last week the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted my amendment relating to the World Trade Organisation in which I propose that government experts should investigate the possibility of imposing trade sanctions at WTO level on those that remain outside the Kyoto Protocol in the future, in phase 2.
This is a tough statement, I readily admit.
It should be borne in mind, however, that no one is being condemned to having sanctions imposed on them here: we are simply proposing that the possibility should be investigated for the future.
For this we shall need new opening gambits and moves, and bold ones too, in the debate on climate policy.
I therefore ask whether we should not take the step that would make free-riding impossible and uncomfortable.
Hopefully, the weaknesses of the Kyoto Protocol will also reveal themselves to us, so that we might learn a lesson, and so that by 2012 we might have much more effective weapons to fight climate change.
We have to admit that Kyoto has now reached an impasse, as the global front is inadequate, partly because there are no limits for developing countries, and partly because the major polluters are on the outside.
That makes Kyoto ineffective and causes the distortion of competition and carbon leakage.
Even if we did all we could in the EU, it has been estimated that in future decades the proportion of emissions from the 25 EU countries will drop to below 10%, while developing countries will increase their share to over half of all emissions.
Unless the front is made wider, the efforts of the EU will come to nothing.
Not even the EU, however, will be safe from my WTO amendment, if it does not succeed in fulfilling its commitments.
Political decisions and rhetoric in the EU are now in a good state, certainly, but practical development is becoming a problem.
Progress in the reduction of emissions in the EU has come to a halt, as the easiest action to make cuts has been taken.
Nine of the fifteen old Member States have exceeded their own Kyoto targets by more than 20%.
Unless we can think of something radical, there is a danger that we too will have to recognise the hopelessness of the situation.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe the debate has clearly shown that there is no fundamental disagreement between the Commission, the Council and this House.
We are all aware that the issue of climate change deserves our full attention and must be fully integrated into our policies.
It is also the reason why the Luxembourg Presidency made sustainable development one of its major priorities, together, as part of the sustainable development strategy, with everything more specifically concerned with climate change.
As I have already said, Europe is showing leadership in this field and must continue to do so.
That will certainly be the case under the British Presidency.
Europe must make its voice heard loud and clear on the international scene.
Ultimately, I believe, no country will be able to avoid the obvious constraints that apply to us all in this regard, and if Europe continues to play its part on climate change, I think it will also succeed in winning over those who seem the most hesitant today.
Â Â  Mr President, once again I would like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to respond to some of the questions and for the discussion we had.
With regard to the merits and weaknesses, the advantages and disadvantages of being an optimist or pessimist, as suggested by Mr Wijkman and MrsÂ Westlund, on this issue one should not be an optimist or pessimist but a realist.
We must try to work with all those who realise the importance of the problem, that the problem is a global one and needs a global solution.
With regard to the United States, mentioned by MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, Mrs Hassi and Mrs Korhola among others, I have to tell you that during our discussions with the United States authorities, we were very clear that we consider that cooperation in research and development of new technologies and the deployment of new technologies is very important, but we are not going to consider this a first step forward because it is something on which we in any case agree.
No-one disagrees that we should use new technologies, as Mr Trakatellis said.
We should deploy new technologies in order to fight climate change.
That is something we have agreed.
We should make progress.
It is not progress if they agree at the G-8 or anywhere else that we will cooperate on development.
That is not enough.
We should take steps forward.
That was made very clear to the United States because, as we correctly said earlier, other countries will refuse to cooperate and, after a few years, the developing countries of South Asia and South America and other developing countries will contribute more to the greenhouse phenomenon than the European Union and the United States combined.
We need all countries to cooperate, to be on board.
We will follow a common but differentiated policy because we cannot ask developing countries to contribute towards the reduction of emissions as much as the developed countries that have contributed far more up until now.
The Commission recognises the need for the European Union to maintain its leading role in international and also domestic efforts to fight climate change, as MrÂ Trakatellis said.
The Commission highlighted in its communication of 9 February âWinning the battle against climate changeâ that we should focus on leadership by example.
Mr Prodi said that we have a moral duty to do so.
One of the central recommendations was that the European Council should give a clear message that the European Union wishes to engage with other countries in an open dialogue on what further multilateral action is required to address the challenge of climate change.
Targets were mentioned.
They have proved to be a very useful tool in environmental policy-making.
They provide clear guidance to decision-makers in society.
They are particularly useful to industry in the private sector.
Thus, targets will continue to be a core element of any future climate policy regime.
However, the timing of targets is very important.
The exact timing should depend on the progress we make in building international support for starting negotiations on the future climate change regime.
Once we have a mandate to start such negotiations, the European Union will need to consider putting forward the targets it is willing to set for the post-2012 period.
I should like to respond to the suggestion made by several speakers that the European Union should use trade measures to protect our industry or other measures to offset the competitive advantages of companies in countries that do not restrict their greenhouse gas emissions.
The European Unionâs climate policy has been carefully designed to minimise costs to industry.
That is the reason we opted for emissions trading.
Our goal should be to work towards a future climate regime that is not only a decisive step in winning our battle against climate change, but also allows us to do so in a way that strengthens our competitiveness in clean technologies.
Such a regime will get us much further â also in climate terms â than trade sanctions.
With regard to the developing countries, I agree about the importance of assisting developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
The European Union is the main contributor to the 2001 Bonn Political Declaration, which pledges USD 410 million per year in climate change funding for developing countries, starting this year.
An important part of this will go to support adaptation measures.
The European Union is also the main contributor to the Least Developed Countries Fund.
Those countries have to face all the consequences of climate change, but they are not in a position to take the measures needed to adapt properly.
It is our moral duty to work with them and help them.
It is also in our interests, because in this way they will also contribute to reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.
I should like to underline the importance of developing and deploying new technologies, including in developing countries.
The Commission is identifying and implementing concrete actions.
The Commission recently agreed with China on the setting-up of two new European Union-China action plans in the area of energy: one on clean coal and the other on renewable energy and energy efficiency for which the Commission has secured initial funding.
Once again, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the Bonn seminar and the forthcoming negotiations on the future international climate change regime.
I am confident that Parliament will, as usual, play an important part in this debate.
The Commission and Parliament have always been strong allies in this respect.
I look forward to working with you in the future.
Â Â  To conclude the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution B6-0278/2005.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on small arms, ahead of the United Nations Conference in July 2005.
Â Â  . Mr President, when it comes to small arms and light weapons (SALW), we all know that the world is faced with many regional conflicts where weapons of this kind, sometimes even used by children, are creating extremely dangerous and destructive situations.
That is why the European Union is backing the Secretary-Generalâs call for the development of long-term strategies to end the scourge of the illicit proliferation of small arms.
The United Nations programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects is one such strategy.
It was adopted on 20 July 2001 and the European Union is actively seeking to apply the recommendations it contains at national, regional and world levels.
The consequences of the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation and of the excessive build-up and uncontrolled spread of small arms lie at the heart of four of the five major challenges identified by the security strategy adopted by the European Council in 2003.
Small arms and light weapons in fact help to exacerbate terrorism and organised crime and are a major factor in the unleashing and spread of conflict and the collapse of state structures.
As the European strategy underlines, conflicts in which weapons of this kind are by far the principal instrument have cost the lives of nearly 4 million people since 1990 and have forced more than 18 million others to leave their homes or their countries.
The increased access by non-state players to these stocks of arms has changed the nature and duration of conflicts.
It is a situation that risks compromising our own security and the European Union needs to cooperate closely with its international partners in responding to it.
We are therefore very actively preparing for the second biennial meeting of states to consider the implementation of the United Nations programme of action on small arms and light weapons, to be held in New York in mid-July.
In connection with preparations for this important event, the Presidency has compiled a list of subjects that should be given priority in the competent international fora.
This list, which is awaiting approval, includes in particular the illicit brokering of small arms, control of transfers, verification of end use, the link between security and development, the management of weapons held by the military and security forces, the creation of machinery for implementing the UN action plan, the possession of small arms by civilians, transfer to non-state players and technical assistance for the submission and presentation of reports.
More particularly, the European Union stresses the importance of creating a group of government experts immediately following the 2006 conference that will examine the programme of action; the group will consider further measures to strengthen international cooperation to prevent, combat and eradicate illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons.
Another of our key priorities is to negotiate an international instrument for the identification and tracing of such weapons.
The open-ended working group responsible for negotiating this instrument has the European Unionâs full support.
At the two meetings held by the working group of diplomats and experts up until now, the European Union and the other parties have explained and confirmed their priorities on the different aspects, in particular the type of instrument, its scope and definitions, the marking and tracing of small arms and ammunition, registration and international cooperation.
The European Union notes the progress made at these talks, while regretting that the participating states remain divided on the two big issues of the type of instrument and the inclusion of ammunition.
The European Union itself is working to see the adoption of a legally binding instrument to complement the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms.
It is also insisting that this instrument should include suitable provisions on ammunition.
After all, only a steady supply of ammunition enables illicit small arms and light weapons to continue to wreak havoc.
If we can prevent trafficking in ammunition, however, we will be able to silence the weapons themselves.
If the working group reaches a positive outcome at its final session in June 2005, the EU will do all it can to see that the instrument comes into force quickly.
As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is also very active in this field, both internally and through its bilateral aid to third countries.
In the EU itself, the Council adopted the Code of Conduct on Conventional Arms Exports in 1998.
This makes for improved exchanges of information between Member States and strengthens mutual understanding of their export control policies, including requirements for an end-user certificate or appropriate documents or a form of official authorisation issued by the country of final destination, which must be meticulously checked.
As you know, the code of conduct is currently being revised; it will cover virtually all activities closely or remotely connected with arms transfers.
So far as assistance to third countries is concerned, following a few limited common actions, in 2002 the European Union adopted a common action and on that basis launched specific actions involving projects for the collection and destruction of weapons in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Balkans.
In the matter of those weapons, the Council is willing to report to this House periodically and to work closely with you.
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Members, the European Commission obviously approves the constant efforts being made by the United Nations and other players in the fight against the serious effects of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
We welcome the renewed attention being paid to this issue and we are looking forward impatiently to taking part in the biennial meeting of States to be held in New York in July 2005.
We are very grateful to the European Parliament for taking the initiative of drawing attention to this forthcoming event.
The Commission will be studying the proposals made in the Parliamentary resolutions very closely.
We recognise that the build-up and spread of these weapons aggravates conflicts, feeds terrorism, hampers reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of conflicts and reduces the prospects for sustainable development.
It is therefore essential that we tackle these questions through multinational partnerships combining preventive and responsive measures and it is also essential that we use the United Nations instruments to that end.
The effectiveness of the fight against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons depends on communication and cooperation between states.
The Commission favours a multilateral approach and has committed a number of its services to different projects in this area.
It is important to stress that, if an answer is to be found to this problem, action must be taken in several directions, ranging from development aid proper to reform of the security sector, by way of the actual destruction of these weapons.
Some of these areas are matters of Community competence, others unfortunately are not.
In its violent conflict prevention programme, the European Union recognises that by endeavouring to eliminate small arms as a source of destabilisation and conflict it would make a major contribution to preventing renewed acts of violence.
The European Union is trying to achieve this through international cooperation, financial and technical assistance programmes and effective arms control.
Through the European Development Fund, the Commission is financing a number of actions involving the demobilisation of ex-combatants and their reintegration into society and the collection and destruction of these arms.
In a very large number of cases, these actions are implemented through specific demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration programmes.
In other cases, however, the reintegration of ex-combatants has been included in broader programmes for the development or rehabilitation of post-conflict areas.
These programmes seek to bring about an overall improvement in the economic and social structures of the areas affected by a conflict by helping to reintegrate former combatants and their families into civilian life.
A number of questions relating to the cross-border transfer of these weapons are currently being examined for next yearâs conference.
In particular, a treaty on the arms trade is being discussed.
The Commission will be actively involved in the debate on these subjects that will be held in the Council.
It would be premature to discuss these points in detail at present, since some of them will have to be examined in depth by several commissioners.
The European Union has also on several occasions called for legally binding instruments on arms brokering and the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons at the United Nations conference and the follow-up meetings on the illicit trade in small arms in 2001 and 2003.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figure of four million victims just quoted by the President-in-Office of the Council shows how important this topic is.
We are all agreed that small arms have to be prevented from getting into the wrong hands.
Here in Europe, in the European Union, the state has a monopoly on the use of armed force, and that is of enormous benefit.
Circumstances here are different from those in the United States, where this is not understood in the same way.
What that means is that the use of small arms is reserved to soldiers and police officers, with special arrangements being made for those engaged in hunting and in shooting as a sport.
It is vitally important that every single weapon here in this European Union of ours is actually registered, or in other words that its origin is known.
A problem arises when these weapons find their way into countries outside the European Union, and this is what makes it so important that the code of conduct on the export of arms, as it stands at present, should be further tightened up and that we prevent, in so far as possible, at least the supply of weapons to the trouble spots where, in fact, this extraordinary number of people are killed.
To do so will involve developing a tracking system, in which every single purchase or sale of such weapons is recorded by being entered in an international register, thus making it possible to trace a specific weapon back to its origin and to its manufacturer, and to determine who was responsible for it being sold and who for it being passed on.
For this, international agreements are needed, and that is what makes it especially important that we, in this House, should play our part in actually taking these projects â set in motion by the United Nations â further and bringing them to a successful conclusion.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst the world has focused on weapons of mass destruction, it is right that we look today at the 650Â million small arms and light weapons in circulation worldwide.
Almost one person every minute is killed by the bullet from a gun and two million children have been killed in the last decade.
These arms escalate and provoke prolonged conflicts.
They facilitate violent crime and they are used for terrorism.
It is in Europeâs interest to limit small arms for our own security, to protect foreign investment and to promote development. That means integrating small arms into Europeâs security development and governance programmes.
It is not simply a question of supporting ad hoc disarmament, demobilisation and reconstruction programmes as part of our crisis management response, we have to mainstream this into broader development assistance programmes and include it in our political dialogue with all other countries and regions worldwide.
As a follow-up to the EU security strategy, it means developing a comprehensive EU disarmament and arms control strategy.
This should integrate with civil society initiatives, just as NGOs should be able to contribute actively to the UN biannual meeting of states in July.
It means, as we say in the resolution, new impetus for the UN consultations on combating illicit brokering.
Here in the EU, our Member States have only to consider applying these controls to our citizens operating outside of the European Union.
Yet these brokers deliberately travel overseas to ply their trade.
I would have liked, this afternoon, to have heard a commitment from the Luxembourg presidency to strengthen the common position to make it mandatory to control EU nationals involved in arms brokering, wherever they are based.
Finally, it means limiting the supply of arms overall.
Action by the EU to control the proliferation of small arms in fragile states is undermined by our role as major arms exporters.
Good as the EU code of conduct is, strengthened as it must be, German armaments used in Burma arrive there only because they were exported via Ukraine, which is not bound by our EU rules.
It shows why regional agreements alone are not enough.
That is why I welcome the commitment from my own government in the United Kingdom and from the Finnish Government, as well as the recommendation of the High Level Panel of the United Nations to champion an international arms trade treaty.
Arms transfers must be subject to legal controls, not just in the EU, but across the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking both the Commission and the Council and all the other Members of this House for having accepted the invitation to deal once again with this issue â the scourge of small arms in the world.
Because today, as has been pointed out, these are the real weapons of mass destruction, not just because of the millions of victims they cause every year, but because of their social and political consequences.
The lack of control of pistols, revolvers, assault rifles, grenades, machine guns and similar weapons has had dramatic consequences for the security and integrity of millions of people throughout the world.
In some countries, such as Brazil, Colombia or El Salvador, it is estimated that violence involving this type of weapon is responsible for the loss of 10% of gross domestic product.
At the request of civil society and in particular the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), in July 2001 the United Nations held a conference in New York during which an action programme was adopted to prevent, combat and eliminate every aspect of the illegal trade in small and light arms.
Next July, the governments of the Member States of the United Nations will meet again in New York for the bi-annual meeting on the implementation of this action plan, and the review conference is scheduled for a year later.
The action programme urges the governments to control the production and sale of this type of weapon, to mark pistols in order to facilitate their identification once they have been sold, to penalise the production and possession of illegal weapons, to identify and destroy surplus weapons and to establish final use certificates for export and transit, amongst other measures.
Since 2001, considerable progress has been made, particularly in the field of national legislations.
It is still necessary, however, to develop and implement general recommendations.
Within this context, the European Union and its Member States must continue to lead the debate.
The current process of reviewing the code of conduct offers a good opportunity to do so.
I must say that, in general terms, I am optimistic, especially since the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, not just today, but on other occasions, has insisted on the need to go further and urge the governments to produce a legally binding text on brokering and transfers of small arms.
Nevertheless, other data makes me a little more wary, such as, for example, the fact that few European Union countries have expressed support for the establishment of an international treaty on the arms trade.
So far, only Finland and the United Kingdom have expressed firm support for the idea, although Spain has also made comments in this regard, and we would therefore like more details to be provided.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is urgent that we provide real impetus for the establishment of an international treaty on the trade in weapons which should be possible immediately after the review conference on the United Nations action plan in July 2006.
This is not just necessary, but clearly of vital importance.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in the world in which we live nearly 700 million weapons are in circulation and a further eight million are produced each year.
Businesses are manufacturing them, brokers are putting them on sale, governments and individuals are buying and selling them and people are dying: at the rate of one a minute.
With those words Amnesty International has recently launched the Marking and Tracing project, a treaty under which States undertake to adopt measures for identifying all weapons and ammunition with a serial number that cannot be falsified nor destroyed.
This represents a necessary step in preventing the illegal trade in arms.
For as long as arms remain unidentifiable, States and businesses will always deny responsibility for them.
The European Union should actively support this campaign.
From 1999 to 2003, Italy, for instance, as the second most important small arms manufacturer in the world and the first at European level, sold, in defiance of legislative decrees, EUR 36 million of arms to countries involved in armed conflicts, EUR 3.6 million to nations under embargo and EUR 128 million to countries condemned for human rights violations.
On the other hand, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council control 88% of the global market in arms.
For all of these reasons, it is essential that the European Union adopts the treaty on arms brokering drafted by a group of NGOs and Nobel prize winners, and launches a convention on arms brokers that, , makes any activity with the aim of transferring arms between third parties subject to state authorisation.
The European Union must improve its code of conduct on the transfer of arms, clarifying the circumstances in which it is possible to refuse an authorisation to export arms, extending checks to all military equipment, forcing individual States to bring in legislation in compliance with the code of conduct and to publish an annual report on their respective arms exports.
We cannot forget that it is precisely small arms that are responsible for nearly the entire sum of deaths in conflicts taking place across our world.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Schmit and Mr Michel for their speeches, which I found to be notable fundamentally for their level of commitment.
This commitment â which we all have an interest in making â is demonstrated by two areas of work: firstly, to put an end to the lack of control of the arms trade and, in this regard, we must insist on the need for mechanisms allowing for control from the point at which the weapon is manufactured until the point it is used, that is to say, we must achieve international control.
Secondly, it is fundamental and very important â as other Members have said â that we prepare the conditions to ensure that at the 2006 meeting we can make progress and achieve a genuine international treaty to regulate every aspect of the arms trade.
We Europeans must continue to offer an example.
It is very important that, in the debate we are holding on the code of conduct, we ensure firstly that it become more restrictive and, above all, binding on every Member State.
If we all work in this direction, I believe that Europe will be able to make a modest contribution to putting an effective end to this lack of control, which leads to the majority of the suffering of many populations and to many territorial conflicts.
I would, therefore, very much hope that we can combine our wills in this way so that, within no more than two years, we can put an end to this scourge of humanity.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are all agreed that conventional weapons, and particularly small arms, still cause the largest number of victims worldwide.
They are fairly readily available on the market at relatively low cost, and are far too often an obstacle to sustainable development and reconstruction processes.
It is right that we should examine our own consciences, for in my own country, important arms exports have been set up to conflict areas in the past.
Commissioner Michel is well placed to give you a full account and his assessment.
Let me remind you of the supply of arms to Nepal or the Democratic Republic of Congo where, since August 1998, more than three million people have been killed.
The President-in-Office, Mr Schmit, talked about cutting off the arms supplies.
That is why the Tanzanian project and the construction of an arms factory deserve our undivided attention.
This project must be stopped.
I would repeat with great emphasis the political request made by fellow Members to the Presidency-in-Office to ensure that a political pledge is made that an international treaty on the trade in conventional weapons is drafted.
This treaty on arms trade should come about with the support of the 25 Member States without delay, if at all possible.
Â Â  Mr President, there are two particular proposals from this House that I will take on board and pass on to the Council, proposals which I think the Commissioner has also noted. First of all, the strengthening of the control mechanisms within the European Union itself to make it easier to trace the route taken by arms, since this information helps us to uncover, spotlight and identify the existing and growing export trade in this type of arms.
Secondly, the idea of an international treaty. There are in fact a number of exporters sending large quantities of small arms to all parts of the world, and those exporters are not necessarily Member States of the European Union.
Some industrialising countries have in fact become exporters in this field, and the only way of effectively controlling exports of this kind, which underlie the regional conflicts to which several speakers have alluded, is to have much stronger international commitments and also a sounder and more effective system of control.
The European Union must in my opinion take the initiative with such a treaty and support the Secretary-Generalâs efforts to that end, because we want to play a part there.
As someone has said, and Mr Michel knows this, we want successfully to conduct a peace mission across part of Africa in particular, and peace will only have a chance if we can manage to break the supply lines for such weapons, since they are often the weapons of the developing countries, the weapons of the poor.
As I said, they often put weapons into the hands of child soldiers, and that is one of the most horrible things you can imagine.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe it has been repeated often enough.
It is obvious that preventing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a European Union priority objective.
Equally obviously, it must also be a priority objective of the Member States.
It is particularly regrettable that the European code of conduct is not binding.
At any rate, it is not binding in every country, and I can tell you from personal experience that it only takes one country to refuse an export licence and other European countries are quick to present themselves as candidates to fill the unplaced order.
We should not deceive ourselves.
In my country, for example, the law now makes provision for this scenario, and there is normally a requirement, but obviously it needs to become the norm.
Also, even if we had a binding code, that does not mean that the European Unionâs outside competitors would abide by it.
Having said that, I am of course the first to want to make such a code mandatory.
There are three considerations I would like to mention.
First, traceability is a very important aspect, since it enables us to trace back the entire route the arm has taken.
I would also like to draw your attention to a new perspective that may be interesting.
Research is being carried out in Europe today, not only to ensure that the arm can be traced, but even to disable it remotely.
Research in this area is already well advanced and I believe we should support initiatives of this kind.
I would also like to mention a number of projects and actions being conducted by several of our Member States.
Some of them, for example, are suggesting to populations who own weapons and are prepared to hand them in that they might exchange those weapons for bicycles.
I can tell you that this is the kind of action we should also be encouraging in Africa.
Another consideration is this. I am quite familiar with the African problem and I can assure you that it is not the European Union that is supplying the largest number of small arms to Africa.
I accept that we must show the way and that we must even beat our breasts from time to time, but all the same we should not end up believing that all those arms came from the European Union.
Most of those arms do not come from the European Union, they come from other countries and in particular from the unused leftovers of certain armies.
I could name some countries, but I will not.
But it is obvious that some know, and that they know very well, whom I am talking about.
That is therefore nevertheless a very important factor.
Regarding the treaty on the arms trade, which introduces compulsory national-based approvals for all international arms transfers and puts in place effective machinery for permits and licences, we do of course support such measures and I hope that in a few monthsâ time we will have made that kind of progress.
The explicit restrictions on arms transfers where there is a breach of obligations under international law, in the case, for example, of breaches of UN arms embargos, of customary law, of international treaties between the contracting parties or where there is a failure to observe international prohibitions on certain weapons, such as anti-personnel land mines, the restrictions, too, on transfers based on use where, for example, it is brought to a contracting partyâs notice that the arms being transferred are likely to be used in complete violation of international humanitarian law or of human rights for the commission of genocide or crimes against humanity.
These restrictions are all manifestly important aspects of this treaty.
However, the present text remains very vague in a number of areas.
Its main purpose is to get a sufficient number of governments to agree on the principle of an international legal instrument on arms transfers.
The NGOs are trying to create some momentum around the idea of a treaty before tackling the details.
The treaty has been conceived as a framework convention that may be added to by protocols concerning, among other things, arms brokering or manufacture under licence.
As always in such cases, however, maximum pressure will be required to get all states to subscribe to it, because if it is always the same States which subscribe and the same other States which do not, discouragement is bound to set in.
Finally, given that reference has been made to my personal experience, I would like to end by saying that it is sometimes difficult to judge whether an arms export licence should be granted or not.
In fact, in some cases, MrÂ Staes, where, for example, the army or police of a country that is perhaps not necessarily a democracy asks for access to arms or to buy them and that same government, that same country, is faced with really very dangerous rebels who, for example, make use of human shields when attacking police stations or schools, it is extremely difficult, as a responsible politician, to make a choice.
What I am really trying to say is that you never have the choice between a good and a bad solution, you always have the choice between two bad solutions.
I do know what you are referring to and I can assure you, to answer your question, that if I had my time over again I would take exactly the same decision, because in my heart of hearts I do believe that was the decision I had to take.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on ThursdayÂ 26 May.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0094/2005) by MrsÂ BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of an Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank.
Â Â  Mr President, as provided in the Central Bank Statute and the Treaties, we are required to replace the members of the Central Bankâs Executive Board by rotation to ensure that it has some continuity in the exercise of its responsibilities.
Today, we salute the way in which MrÂ PadÃ³a-Schioppa, the predecessor of the person whose candidature we are to examine, carried out his duties on the Executive Board.
I believe that in his relations with our institution and more widely in his capacity as the Executive Boardâs external representative, he showed great talent and a thorough grasp of these questions.
The candidate whose nomination we are to examine today is MrÂ Lorenzo Bini Smaghi.
Your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been able to question him first of all in writing following the questionnaire procedure with which we are familiar and then verbally at a hearing, where the members of the committee reached a consensus.
We were able to check that there is no doubt as to his expertise and professional ability in the light of the job he will have to do.
He has all the abilities to be a good central banker together with two additional assets I would like to mention: an ability to communicate, which is certainly very useful for a central banker, and also a vision enriched by a multidisciplinary approach.
Whether the mindset of a central banker is enough to make a good Executive Board member, or whether it requires a broader vision and outlook is something we have debated a number of times.
It seems to us that MrÂ Bini Smaghi will be able to contribute this multidisciplinary approach to the Executive Boardâs discussions and that this will make monetary policy more responsive to the needs of the real economy and to the publicâs aspirations.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to begin, on behalf of the Commission, as Mrs BerÃšs has done, by paying tribute to the work carried out by Mr PadÃ³a-Schioppa during his mandate as a member of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.
I believe he has demonstrated skill, respect for his institutional responsibilities and a professionalism that is beyond all suspicion; a professionalism that has also been demonstrated by Mr Bini Smaghi throughout his career.
The European Commission does not participate in the formal procedure for selecting and appointing members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, but it has been lucky enough to work with and know Mr Bini Smaghi for a long time in his role as a highly qualified and very experienced economist in the Banca d'Italia and in his work within the Italian administration and also within the context of his very active participation in the Economic and Financial Committee, within which, until he was appointed as a member of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, he has been chairman of the subcommittee on monetary and financial affairs.
I believe him to be an absolutely ideal person to carry out the duties being entrusted to him and, therefore, although, as I have said, we do not participate in a formal manner, we will be extremely pleased if Parliament supports this appointment, just as the Ecofin Council did.
I would like to make a final comment.
The Commission does not participate in the procedure, but it is the guardian of the Treaties, and we have monitored extremely closely whether the Treaties and the rules in force have been complied with throughout all the stages of Mr Bini Smaghiâs appointment.
They have, in fact; I had the opportunity to say so during the Ecofin meeting that unanimously proposed him as a candidate.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to say that there are still four Member States of the eurozone which have yet to participate in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland and Portugal).
The fact that during the last two replacements of members of the Executive Board of the Central Bank, the institutions have appointed people of the same nationality as the person being replaced in no way prevents the Commission from pointing out that the procedure must not take account of the nationality of the outgoing person, but rather of the professional competence of the new candidate, as has undoubtedly been the case here.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs BerÃšs, we in this House are in agreement as regards the qualities of Mr PadÃ³a-Schioppa, who has left the ECBâs Executive Board.
We are grateful to him for his work and for his cooperation with us.
Having endorsed his successorâs nomination, we are in agreement about his qualifications too; we take a favourable view of him, and wish him every success.
I would like to take this debate as a starting point, by saying that I agree with the Commissioner, that there must be nothing automatic about nominations being made by certain countries, and that it would have been a good thing if we had had several candidates for the seats available, and hence a competing array of qualities, principles, opinions and fundamental beliefs to choose from.
That this was not the case on this occasion is no discredit to Mr Bini Smaghi, but it is something we have to highlight.
Thirdly, it has to be said that the European Central Bank plays a very important role, and does it very well, by virtue of its independence, and also as the euroâs guardian and the driving force behind it.
We would urge MrÂ BiniÂ Smaghi to join his fellow Executive Board members in upholding these principles.
In this respect, the changes to the Stability and Growth Pact will give the European Central Bank an even more important role, in cooperation with the Commission.
One thing I think we should do is to compare the two sets of statistics that we are given, in order to ensure that there are no discrepancies in the way countries are assessed; I am also thinking here of the ECBâs public statements and assessments as guardian of price stability, as regards the size of the Member Statesâ budgets, the things they spend their budgets on and the breakdown of their tax receipts.
What we need is a strong and independent Central Bank, enabling the euro to continue on its successful course.
Â Â  . â In my opinion, Parliament should vote in favour of appointing Mr Smaghi to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), in line with the draft recommendation drawn up by Mrs BerÃšs.
Personally, I feel that I must point out the candidateâs timely support and defence of the Constitutional Treaty.
His appointment offers us the opportunity to reiterate some of the aspects that have proved crucial in the European Central Bankâs approach to the EUâs economic situation and especially its contribution to a swift and solid recovery.
Mr Smaghiâs appointment follows the Councilâs decision that significantly amended the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact and that was intended to improve its procedures.
The ECB is known to have initially been opposed to any changes in the regulations, and even went as far as to threaten to raise interest rates.
It later came to accept the changes laid down by the Council, but always did so tentatively and conservatively.
Whilst it is true that the Stability and Growth Pact comprises a pillar for preventing and a pillar for remedying, it is also true that this political, economic and financial instrument must be implemented across the board.
It is unacceptable that so-called relevant factors and exceptional circumstances, now identified and formalised by the Council, should be reduced to small amendments to the regulations in force.
The reading of the document adopted by the Council is clear and unequivocal, and indeed comprises substantial amendments to the model currently in force.
To ignore this fact, or simply to reduce it to formalities and cosmetic amendments, is completely wrong.
Despite all of the ECBâs efforts to control and keep a lid on prices, and its indisputable success in achieving this aim, the EUâs economy is a long way from showing clear signs of recovery and has certainly not managed to solve the main problem, which is unemployment.
The International Monetary Fund indeed recently urged the ECB to reduce interest rates again.
This forms part of the new framework adopted by the Council for supervising, monitoring and remedying fiscal imbalances.
What is at stake is not wholesale budgetary deregulation, but the EUâs economic and social recovery, for which the ECB must take a great deal of credit.
The ECBâs executive board must not overlook this inevitability and the newly-appointed board Member must ensure that it is on his political agenda.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor to explain why I voted against the appointment of Professor Bini Smaghi.
Although he is a rigorous scholar recognised for being straightforward and highly competent, he has declared himself in favour of policies that are utterly unacceptable.
At the end of the hearing he upheld the need for the ECB not to cut interest rates.
He supported ratification of the Constitution, of course, because in fact it facilitates the work of the European Central Bank.
For us, the ECB is the mother of all usury: it actually deprives the paper money that it allows to be printed of its exchange value and controls the interest rates applied by the Member Statesâ banks, thus subjecting consumers to extortionate terms.
In addition, he said that he supports the Stability Pact, which limits the freedom of the Member States.
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi has publicly stated that the institutions created by the Bretton-Woods Agreements â the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank â hold the stability of the international financial system among their rightful objectives, but he does not agree that, for the sake of such stability, they have contributed to poverty and a widening of the gap between rich and poor.
In our view, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the ECB represent the interests of a tiny minority of technocrats and of big transnational finance, which grows rich on financial speculation.
These are institutions that have decreed the ruin of whole nations: just think of the case of Yugoslavia, first strangled by extortionate interest rates and then crushed, destroyed and dismembered.
We were therefore certainly not voting against the person, who is someone we admire, but against an institution that we cannot accept and in fact positively condemn.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Bini Smaghi on his nomination.
I look forward to working with him.
However, I have some comments.
First, regarding the Stability and Growth Pact, Mr Bini Smaghiâs answers to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs revealed some inconsistencies in judgement, which I wish briefly to point out.
While his commentary on the legal uncertainties of the old SGP is valid, his interpretation of the dynamic conditions leading to the reform of the pact is questionable.
Mr Bini Smaghi seems to imply that the pactâs own rigidities led to certain Member States breaking its rules and that the politics of the SGP made sensible economics impossible.
This is disappointing from someone about to be installed at the ECB.
The truth is that the SGP was torn apart by the political inability of some Member States to conduct sensible economic policies on the basis of the rules agreed to by all, long after they came into effect.
I would remind Mr Bini Smaghi that without effective rules that are equally applicable to all, the EU would be nothing but a loose grouping with weak powers of coordination.
Surely, as a member of the ECB Board, he cannot favour development that would increase economic asymmetry between eurozone Member States.
Secondly, regarding his nomination itself, the rules that govern which eurozone Member States obtain seats on the ECB Board need to be clarified.
They should be based on genuinely open mechanisms of selecting nominees.
The present system too often seems to favour automatic entry for candidates from big eurozone Member States at the direct expense of smaller ones.
Smaller Member States are excluded from the backroom deals that decide the posts.
This is truly regrettable and potentially damaging in the long run.
With these qualifications in mind, I once again congratulate Mr Bini Smaghi on his nomination.
I am not against his nomination but I am concerned about the more general circumstances surrounding it.
Â Â  Mr President, it is to be hoped Mr Smaghi will bring some semblance of financial discipline to the ECB.
Recently, I questioned the fact that the ECB had decided to double its printing of EURÂ 500 banknotes this year â the highest value banknotes in the world and the Russian mafiaâs currency of choice, each one worth seven times a USDÂ 100 bill.
Last year, counterfeit EURÂ 500 notes rose by over 160%, and that is only the ones we know about.
The Commissionâs reply to my questions would have stunned even a simpleton.
It said, âa strong demand for high-value notes could be met only by lower denominations and increasing printing costsâ.
Can you imagine that as a serious answer from a central bank?
The reply went on, âEURÂ 500 banknotes are widely used for hoarding purposesâ â surprise, surprise!
And finally, âthere are no indications that high-denomination banknotes encourage illegal transactionsâ.
Which planet do they live on?
The ECB must be out of its tiny collective mind to encourage the wider circulation of such banknotes, and I believe MrÂ Smaghi has much work to do.
Â Â  Mr President, I would simply like to say a couple of words repeating what I said in my first speech and which coincide with the vast majority of the speeches by the honourable Members.
We wish Mr Bini Smaghi every success, because success in his work as one of the members of the Executive Boards of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank will be a success for the single currency, it will be a success for the economic and monetary union and it will be a success for the progress, happiness and well-being of all the European citizens.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication: Action Plan on the The Hague programme âFreedom, security and justice in the European Unionâ.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has today adopted a draft communication, drawn up by me, consisting of a plan of action to implement and put into practice the priorities of the Hague programme to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice.
The communication contains a first draft of the political objectives and an annex indicating the main practical measures, together with dates by which each initiative must be adopted.
We have prepared a programme comprising 84 initiatives for the whole term of the Commissionâs mandate: 32 of these 84 measures will be implemented by the end of 2005, which will be the most important year for the action plan to take off.
We believe that with this programme we have launched a second stage in Europeâs freedom, security and justice policy.
First of all, we shall be equipping ourselves with the means to organise and plan future actions more effectively.
We are aware, of course, that there may always be some unpredictability in matters of security due to external events, but it is important to work to a strategic plan and to avoid emergency measures.
These are areas â the security area as well as those of justice and freedom â where we should not be thinking in terms of individual, isolated measures, but instead we should be thinking in terms of a European approach that responds to the peopleâs demands and can make a difference, compared to the individual actions of Member States.
Another aspect of our work will be to monitor the way the Member States implement individual initiatives.
We have prepared a specific reference guide, a chapter of the communication concerning the preparation of a yearly report â a kind of management chart.
It would, in fact, be a comparative outline of the measures that are adopted at national level to implement and comply with the orientations given in the document.
I believe that such a report is important, and the first one will be issued in December this year, six months after the Commissionâs adoption of the action plan.
The three major objectives that the Commission intends to pursue are, first of all, the promotion and protection of peopleâs fundamental rights.
We see that as a core aspect of European citizenship, one that we must fulfil organically but which requires that Europe should, both internally and externally in its international actions, be a promoter and not just a passive defender of peopleâs fundamental rights and freedoms.
That aspect is clearly linked to the high-priority need for security, as the people of Europe are demanding.
Security means decisive action against terrorism and organised crime, with particular regard for the victims of crime.
We shall be giving this aspect special attention, but, as I have already pointed out, our measures to strengthen security must not come at the expense of everyoneâs freedoms and fundamental rights.
The guiding principles will be more security, more respect and more protection, as well as the promotion of individual freedoms.
An important chapter is devoted to various aspects of solidarity.
Solidarity means considering issues such as immigration at a European level and no longer at a national level.
We have to separate the aspect of illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, against which we must fight hard, from the aspect of admission rules for legal immigrants, those who are entitled to have proper access to social services â that means a policy of integration based on legality and obeying the law.
In this area, solidarity clearly also means striking a balance between our fellow citizensâ right to be given guarantees against people traffickers and protecting the victims of people traffickers, in other words the immigrants or asylum seekers themselves.
This point is linked to the one on the European area of justice.
I am, of course, summarising these aspects as much as I can, but you will find the details in the communication: civil justice and criminal justice.
We cannot just think about criminal justice, but rather we must emphasise the fact that civil justice and the harmonisation of rules, or at least the solution of common problems, can help the people of Europe with serious problems in their everyday lives.
I am thinking of certain points of family law, such as inheritance among people of different nationalities, or the execution of orders for payment where the creditor is from one country and the debtor from another: in civil law, too, we can find solutions that improve or resolve certain problems in peopleâs everyday lives.
All that certainly requires a commitment by the three European institutional players: Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
It is our intention to work hard to strengthen this action, to strengthen this interinstitutional partnership, and we shall make every effort to expand the areas of codecision with Parliament wherever possible.
In this action plan we have taken account of many points that Parliament had highlighted, and I shall mention just one of them: the greater role of the European Union Court of Justice in certain areas.
We found the Councilâs reaction somewhat problematic at times, but equally we feel committed to continue working until all three institutional players agree on how to put this planâs lines of action into practice.
I am, of course, familiar with the report drawn up by the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, MrÂ Cavada, after a hearing and a thorough debate precisely on our priorities regarding security, justice and freedom.
As you will see, the document takes up many of those recommendations and suggestions.
I strongly hope and trust that on this occasion, in the course of Parliamentâs work, you will be able to find some agreement with the Commissionâs strategy in terms of lines of action.
I shall conclude by saying that of course we are counting on Parliamentâs support.
We are counting on it because freedom, justice and security are among peopleâs fundamental needs, because they are pillars of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Constitutional Treaty in the European Union, and also because they are subjects that have a strong political dimension rather than a bureaucratic one.
That is why the European Parliament, as a political player, will be able to make contributions, proposals and suggestions for additions that we shall certainly take into account.
Â Â  Mr Vice-President, of course we agree with you, our top priority is to protect and promote fundamental rights.
However, your action plan contains only one new programme for citizenship and fundamental rights; do you think that is enough?
We are also concerned about the growing number of measures provided for the repressive arsenal.
Indeed, we fear an extension of the use of biometrics, we greatly fear an extension of the wide access to databases on visas and the Schengen system and we want to know the situation regarding the technical aspects of the use of biometrics in visas.
Do you intend taking account of the European Parliamentâs negative opinion in the new talks with the United States on the transfer of personal data?
Finally, we reiterate our concern to preserve a balance between the protection of privacy and security.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his presentation.
I have a question about the ten priorities.
PointÂ 3 is devoted to migration management as a so-called new balanced approach to migration management.
The problem, as mentioned, is that the decision as to how many migrants coming from third countries can be admitted to the European Union remains a national decision.
The Commission suggested that an area of free movement demands a common immigration policy, and we agree with that.
How will the Commission try to overcome the contradiction embedded in the fact that, on the one hand, the European Union is developing a common European asylum system, a common European visa system and common European border control, while, on the other hand, legal migration, which is a very important part of migration management, remains a strictly national question?
Â Â  Mr President, firstly, I am very pleased to hear that the Commission will not only protect but also actively promote fundamental rights.
That is a step forward.
I have a precise question on passenger name records â they are also mentioned in the action plan â and more specifically in relation to the incident with the KLM plane one month ago.
I have put a written question to the European Commission.
I also raised the matter orally in the debate at the April part-session, but I have not received a reply to date.
We may be looking at an infringement of the agreement between the European Union and the United States, so it is urgent that we receive a reply.
I wonder whether Commissioner Frattini could give us some indications of the direction in which the reply may go.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the subject of citizenship and fundamental rights is certainly one of those that concern us most in this context.
European citizenship will, in my view, be the synthesis of all our common values, the European principles in which we believe and which we have set down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
That is precisely why we are not aiming in the action plan at strengthening the arsenals of repression â that is to say, we want to avoid a merely repressive and punitive approach.
Instead, we are attempting to strike a balance between the need for investigation â the need to identify the perpetrators of crimes, especially terrorists and members of organised criminal gangs â and the protection of individual rights and freedoms.
That means, for example, strengthening legal and procedural rights, and an initial proposal is already before Parliament.
It is not enough, as it is just an initial proposal for discussion, but others will follow to reinforce the concept of protecting peopleâs privileges, freedoms and rights.
Of these, the topic of personal data protection is the one that stands out, of course, and we shall be giving it particular attention.
In this respect, I recently had a meeting with the European Data Protection Supervisor.
I assured him that it was my intention to consult him in advance before submitting proposals, precisely so as to ensure that the various concerns about personal data protection, including those of the so-called Article 29 Committee, could be taken into account.
Such cooperation goes beyond the purely formal aspects, that is to say when the legal basis allows us to acknowledge him explicitly in the procedure, but extends to cases where we want to make sure in advance that the personal data protection rules are being observed.
I have renewed an offer of informal collaboration with the Commission.
That applies to many areas.
It applies to the dossier on the agreement signed with the United States during the last session â by the way, as I mentioned earlier, we are waiting for a decision from the Court of Justice before making our assessment.
It certainly applies to the matter of their complying fully with the existing agreements with the European Union â I am referring to the specific incident that was mentioned today of a KLM flight that was not authorised to cross US airspace.
I shall give an answer precisely about that incident in a moment.
The last subject to have been mentioned is immigration.
The subject of immigration certainly has to be addressed as a whole: illegal immigration on the one hand, and Europeâs integration and legal immigration policy on the other.
The honourable Member who spoke on this subject mentioned national competences.
We all know that national competences only cover the number of people who can be allowed to enter a particular Member State, but there is a willingness among the Member States to agree on certain common rules, and that is the aim of the Green Paper that we issued in January.
Action by the European Union â rather than by individual countries â is therefore needed with regard to legal immigration as well, and not just illegal immigration.
Of course, the number of immigrants to be allowed in is still left to the Member Statesâ discretion, and the Constitutional Treaty itself confirms this principle, as you all know.
Lastly, on the specific matter of the KLM flight, we have received some information which will be the subject of a written reply that will soon be arriving from the Commission, from MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldnerâs office to be precise.
As I have been asked, I can, however, reveal the gist of the information that we have received.
It says that the passenger data for that flight had not been forwarded on a Passenger Name Record (PNR) basis â on which basis the Commission would have been able to intervene â but on the basis of a bilateral agreement between Mexico and the United States known as the APIS agreement.
In such a case, therefore, the Commission cannot interfere in an agreement between the United States on the one hand and Mexico on the other, precisely because the PNR agreement was not invoked, on which basis we could, of course, have intervened.
These are the initial points that I have been given, but the written reply will, of course, be much more detailed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Vice-President Frattini for being here today.
I feel that what he has told us reveals a number of good objectives, but all too often the means for achieving them are not the most appropriate.
I refer in particular to the need to fight illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.
All too often the fight has been carried on by means of summary judgments and expulsions, at times violating the non-refoulement principle and even denying people the right to asylum.
I am referring in particular to the fact that on 14Â April this year MrÂ Frattini met the EU Home Affairs Ministers to strengthen cooperation with Libya for the purpose of fighting illegal immigration.
I have personally witnessed the treatment to which illegal immigrants are subjected in Libya â including those who are sent back there from a European country â and I have witnessed blatant violations of human rights.
I ask whether the European Union intends to make use of such measures to fight illegal immigration.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank Commissioner Frattini for his presentation.
The problem is, Commissioner, that there is a gap between your personal good faith, which I recognise, not to undermine privacy and data protection â and, indeed, the good faith of the Commission that, in the search for security, you will not forego that â and the reality of what is happening on the ground.
Your pledges are under great strain, not least from the culture in European law enforcement communities, which is, at times, somewhat cavalier about data protection.
In the context of the implementation of the principle of availability, of interoperability, of databases, of transfers to third countries â which become transfers to fourth countries â I do not see how you are going to be able to hold the line, because it is not happening at the moment.
We have been waiting for years for rules on data protection in the third pillar, which we were promised at the end of this year.
What can you do to create a climate of truly reinforced respect for strict data protection observances in this context of a huge pressure to dilute it, as we have just heard with regard to the PNR case?
Â Â  Commissioner, I would like to put the following question to you.
Whenever a crime takes place, the victim and perpetrator are in an unequal position.
The state provides for the perpetrator by affording him legal protection, while the victim must obtain help alone.
I am therefore delighted that today you explicitly emphasised your intention to devote special attention to the victims of organised crime.
I am also pleased since the political programme of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and Euroopean Democrats highlights this very issue.
I would therefore be interested to hear how the Commission will ensure more appropriate treatment of victims in the Member States.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the first question concerns Libya, and I can briefly say that the Commissionâs first report on Libya, which I set out to the Home Affairs Ministers precisely on 14Â April, as MrÂ Catania has mentioned, highlighted some worrying factors.
That report is available â it is certainly not secret â but precisely because of the issues and questions that arose during the meeting with the Home Affairs Ministers we decided to send a second technical mission to Libya to visit places where there are people who have been repatriated or are waiting to be able to come to Europe.
The results of this second mission are not yet available, but the mission has already completed its work and I shall be referring to it at the next Council of Home Affairs Ministers on 2 or 3Â June â I do not remember exactly when.
There I shall put forward practical measures which will certainly be based on the need to provide protection â therefore in Libya as well â for the fundamental rights of people who have entered either legally or illegally and who in any case are entitled to be treated with dignity as human beings.
Parliament will, of course, be kept informed on an ongoing basis.
Regarding data protection, Baroness Ludford, you are well aware of the extent to which this subject is a constant concern of mine.
One way to point out the right road is to say that personal data cannot be accessed except for the specific purposes for which access is permitted by law.
We must not allow extensions by analogy: as it is permitted for certain purposes, we can extend it to other purposes too.
That cannot be allowed.
If we start being specific about this and saying, for instance, that only certain authorities are allowed access to peopleâs private data and not others, we will be starting to set out some guidelines.
I shall just give one example, of which you are aware: the Home Affairs Ministers have asked me to give the investigative authorities greater powers to access existing databases.
My reply is that access rights may be extended if in parallel we increase protection for those data through a proposal under the third pillar, which, I assure you, we are going to submit by the end of this year.
In my view, the answer is âwe have to be clearâ.
There are purposes that must be interpreted strictly, as lawyers say, so that if access to the data is allowed for one purpose, it cannot be allowed for another.
That is the initial basis on which I have begun to work.
My final topic is the victims of crime: we shall also submit proposals for giving financial assistance, not directly to individual victims, but for instance to organisations and institutions concerned with providing care â including psychological care â for those escaping from violence or people trafficking or fleeing from traffickers.
There are many forms of assistance, including practical assistance, for individuals who have been victims of crime; we cannot maintain individual financial relationships, but we can develop them through specific institutions and organisations.
We shall concern ourselves precisely with alleviating the effects on those who have suffered the tragic consequences of crime.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0236/2005).
We will be taking a number of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  . I am taking over this question on behalf of my colleague, Mr Mandelson.
As a member of the WTO, China has benefited from the elimination of textile quotas since 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005.
Import figures for the first months of 2005 show that Chinese exporters have availed themselves of the opportunities offered by the elimination of quotas.
Taking account of serious concerns voiced by European textile manufacturers, trade unions and some Member States, the Commission opened investigations on 29Â April, covering a number of products, to determine whether market disruption and disorderly development of trade have taken place as defined under the relevant Community legislation in accordance with Chinaâs protocol of accession to the WTO.
Following these investigations, the Commission may decide to open formal consultations with China.
In that case China will be under an obligation to limit exports to the Community to certain specific levels, with a growth rate of, in general, 7.5%.
Such measures may be effective for a period ending on 31Â December, or for one year, depending on when the consultations have been requested.
They may be reapplied if need be.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
From numerous media reports, it appears that the Commissioner with responsibility for trade is calling for restraint in this affair and has made a plea to avoid what he calls protectionist thinking.
On the other hand, the United States Government has accepted a request from its textile industry to investigate the sharp increase in the import of textiles from China.
The US Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez has promised a swift and fair inquiry.
He said: âWe want to do it quickly and we want to do it rightâ.
What is so very different about EU textiles as to lead to what appears to be a very prudent approach by the Commission, rather than the swift and fair approach of the US?
Â Â  . The Commission is actively defending the interests of the European textiles industry, but the Commission wants to base its actions on facts and the rules of the WTO.
The guidelines that were adopted and published in early April provide for swift procedures for analysing the question of whether or not safeguard measures are warranted in response to a surge in Chinese textile and clothing imports.
These guidelines stipulate that, if justified by the facts, the Commission may open an investigation with a view to analysing whether the conditions for imposing safeguard measures are fulfilled.
On 29 April, the Commission opened an investigation of nine categories of textiles and clothing imports.
The Commission has stated that it will do its utmost to complete this investigation earlier than the maximum period provided for by the guidelines.
In parallel, the Commission will hold informal consultations with the Chinese authorities with a view to finding a mutually satisfactory solution that would provide relief to the European industry and avoid a resort to safety measures.
If these talks are not successful, the Commission reserves its right to request formal consultations with China via the WTO and, possibly, impose safeguard measures, if warranted by the facts.
There have been requests for the application of the emergency procedure provided for by the guidelines.
This would mean going directly to formal consultations with China via the WTO without an investigation, if there is evidence of irreparable damage to the EU industry in the absence of such a course of action.
The Commissionâs services are analysing these requests.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of our main problems with trade with China at present is the currency situation.
Could you envisage the Commission carrying out a study of this or producing a Green Paper showing us what effect market mechanisms in the monetary and financial sphere might have on China?
Â Â  . The facts being taken on board by the Commission at present relate to the import data which became available after the first three months of this year.
The Commission awaited the import data rather than relying on the licensing arrangements.
The second question that the Member asks about the currency situation is something that is not being considered under the current WTO rules.
The United States, in a different context, has being referring to the currency situation in China, namely the Chinese peg, which United States commentators are saying is compounding the situation regarding exports from China.
The question of currencies is a totally unrelated matter to the investigation under WTO rules.
There are different expert analyses regarding what should or should not be done about the Chinese currency.
It is not currently being considered under the rules of the WTO and this particular question.
Â Â  â Madam President, no one doubts that China is an important factor in the world trade system.
I too am one of those who believe that it is preferable for China to be integrated into the disciplines of the World Trade Organisation than to be a free and unruly system.
However, I would like to make three comments:
First, customs cooperation needs to be established promptly.
This would significantly limit imports of Chinese counterfeit products and, more generally, would safeguard compliance by China with the rules and disciplines of the WTO.
Secondly, how efficient is the December 2004 regulation?
Thirdly, what progress has been made with the safeguarding investigation as regards imports of textiles of Chinese origin?
Â Â  . The European Union is abiding by the rules of the WTO, which set out quite clearly what should be done at this particular stage.
That is why Commissioner Mandelson awaited factual information regarding exports from China into the European Union for the first three months of this year.
The Commission has now initiated further action. As a result of this particular action, a number of categories are now being investigated.
However, as my colleague Mr Mandelson has pointed out, under the agreement in the WTO, Member States throughout the Union have had ten years to prepare for this.
Therefore, it should not have come as a great surprise â or any surprise at all â that the Chinese exporters would avail of the opportunity.
Furthermore, irrespective of what action might result as a consequence of the investigation now taking place, it can only last until 31Â December 2008 in any event.
I am not anticipating what decision might be reached as a result of these investigations; however, whatever happens, this can only last until the end of 2008.
Furthermore, the honourable Member raised the question of customs cooperation.
The fact-gathering that the Commissionâs services have done gives details from all the Member States as to what the volume of imports from China has been in the first few months of this year.
There has been good customs cooperation between the authorities in the relevant Member States and the Commission in order to provide that particular precise information on the real data regarding imports.
Â Â  . I am taking this question on behalf of my colleague, MrÂ Barrot.
The Commission is at present studying the issue of airline insolvency.
It has launched a study on the functioning of the internal market for air transport, which covers as a distinct part the issue of bankruptcy.
In addition to providing the Commission with a database containing important information on relevant insolvencies in the EU air industry as of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2000, the consultant has been asked to consider the issue of passengers stranded due to bankruptcy.
It will conclude on the need or not for a protection mechanism for airline passengers and examine possible options.
The study is expected to produce its findings by the end of August 2005.
Based on these conclusions, and if it is effectively confirmed that a large number of citizens are faced with a lack of protection, the Commission will decide on possible future actions.
Â Â  Thank you for that response.
You indicated that this might be ready by August, which misses this yearâs summer holiday period.
I think you will agree with me that most European people expect support if the airline goes bankrupt and they appear to be stranded.
They imagine â or believe â that they will be supported and that the airlines will give them assistance.
They think that they are supported by their travel insurance, when in fact most of them are not; they think that if they have used a credit card to book it or have done so on the Internet, they are covered, but, again, they are not.
Do you feel that the Commission ought to do some sort of publicity drive in advance of this summer holiday period to encourage people to have proper insurance?
If they are not covered, and an airline goes bankrupt, they will be put in a dire situation.
People expect more of the airlines than they are apparently getting at the moment.
Â Â  . The honourable Member is right in highlighting this particular lacuna in the existing legislation.
As he will know, the Package Travel Directive covers travel as part of the total package.
However, as he has pointed out, in the specific instance where a consumer has purchased his or her flight separately from the package, it is not covered.
That means that the difficulties mentioned can arise.
That is why the Commission carried out a study in this particular area.
The first part of the consultancy is being done by Commissioner Barrot, and will cover the general review of regulations in this regard.
The second part will deal with the possibility of bankruptcies and what should be done when they occur.
I should also point out that DG Sanco is carrying out an ongoing review of the Package Travel Directive, which will also deal with this issue.
Since 2000 there have been 40 such bankruptcies, but the method of dealing with them varies between Member States.
Some Member States take it upon themselves to look after their stranded nationals.
Others have agreements with each other.
Therefore, it is necessary that we review this in its entirety.
Hopefully, we will have the consultancy study by this summer.
Commissioner Barrot will then propose some amendments, if he thinks necessary, on the basis of the study.
Â Â  Madam President, does the Commissioner believe that this problem could be resolved if the companies involved were required to take out insurance?
Secondly the situation as regards the pricing structure for flights is currently very unclear, because airport charges and many other levies often have to be added to the prices charged on the Internet.
Do you think that consideration might be given to how consumers might be given real, fixed prices for flights?
Â Â  . I should like to point out that, whether or not one has insurance, it does not necessarily mean the standard passenger involved would be flown back.
He or she might have the insurance to get compensation later, but it would be no use to him or her when the actual event occurs.
The study being done will look at all aspects and I am sure we will put forward proposals to address some of these problems.
As you know, one of the great successes of opening up markets in Europe in recent years has been the airline industry.
People can fly around Europe now for very little, compared to a short number of years ago, and that has been good for consumers in general.
Of that there is no doubt.
All these matters will be looked at in the consultancy study.
Â Â  . In line with established practice in similar cases, the Commission would like to underline that it has been in contact with the Greek Government before sending its letter of formal notice and its reasoned opinion.
The national authorities, including members of the Greek Government, have thus had several opportunities to present their arguments in meetings with the Commission.
Article 15 of the Constitutional Treaty establishes the principle of sincere cooperation between the Union and Member States.
It requires the fulfilment on behalf of both parties of their task described in the Constitution in full mutual respect.
A procedure involving technical discussions between the Commission and a three-member delegation of a Member State government, as suggested by the honourable Member, is not foreseen therein.
Â Â  I was surprised by the Commissionerâs reply just now.
There is no Constitution to use, it has not been ratified by the people of Europe.
Why is he quoting a constitution?
What is wrong with the Treaty?
Â Â  â Madam President, I wish to thank Commissioner McCreevy for the answer which he has given me and also to thank his colleagues.
I would like to say the following:
First, I conclude from his answer that Commissioner McCreevy and the Commission are always open to dialogue and that is a very, very positive point.
Secondly, as far as my reference to Article 1.5 of the Constitution is concerned, of course I too recognise that the Constitution has not yet been ratified; however, the Constitution introduces the principle of dialogue and cooperation which, I note, is something accepted by MrÂ McCreevy.
Â Â  . Of course, the Commission is still open to discussion on this matter with the Greek authorities.
There have been some discussions at the level of my services and I have had meetings with members of the Greek Government.
Of course we would like to bring this matter to a conclusion, but I must point out to the honourable Member and to the Greek authorities that we have been very specific in our request to the Greek authorities.
They know what they are required to do.
We have proceeded on that particular basis.
Â Â  â Commissioner, this issue of the basic shareholder is very dangerous.
If this spreads throughout Europe, it will mean control of the press.
Precisely, the government has problems with the press in Greece and wishes to control it.
At present we have privileged conditions for foreign companies.
The competent Minister said as much: 'Do not concern yourselves with what we are doing in Greece, foreign companies benefit'.
We want Greek companies to have the same facilities as companies in the other states.
If this continues, I think it will be circumventing the major element of justice.
Therefore, protect Greek Companies from the government's position of wanting to control them.
Â Â  . It has been pointed out to the Greek authorities that the Commission believes that this law infringes both the EU directives and the Treaty itself.
We have pointed out to the Greek authorities that neither the article in the constitution nor the law are compatible with either the EU directive or with the Treaty provisions.
We also pointed out that the same applied to the previous law, which was not implemented or executed.
We sent a letter of formal notice to the Greek authorities on 23Â March, they replied on the same date.
From that, we saw the case they had put forward.
Then, on 28Â April, we sent our reasoned opinion.
That is the situation.
Of course, we need to have dialogue with the Greek authorities, but they know our position on this matter.
Â Â  . The Commission strongly supports the ratification of the Constitution and will play an active part in informing European citizens about its content, with the support of the European Parliament.
The Commission is undertaking ten specific communication initiatives.
They range from the wide distribution of the text of the Constitution for free; the Constitution website; training for national and regional journalists; round table discussions with civil society; information actions targeted at universities and schools, such as European Spring Day, and support for the production of radio and television programmes; to targeting the use of the Europe Direct call centre; mobilising our networks of multipliers in various policy areas; undertaking detailed opinion poll analyses and focus group research and, last but not least, supporting the information campaigns in the Member States.
I fully understand the concern of the honourable Member that the debate on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe lacks the necessary clarity.
Precisely because they have been well aware of this risk, the Commission, Parliament and the Heads of State and Government decided to get involved in the debate from the very beginning and to implement in good time information campaigns on the Constitution which, while respecting the national specificities of each Member State, would inform the citizens and encourage them to take part in the debate and the referendums.
We must use every communication tool available to allow our citizens to make informed choices based on the content of the Constitution.
I want the debate to be based on facts rather than the many myths that are circulating.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her response.
I do, of course, understand that you are stating how you are trying to explain to the public what this is really about, but what causes me concern is that information is readily interpreted as propaganda.
If that is the case, you can end up with the opposite effect of what you were trying to achieve.
I would like to ask the Commissioner what efforts are being made to prevent information from being turned into propaganda, in other words to include in the information both the positive and negative aspects of the present draft Constitution.
I think that the public should be given both sides so that they can take the right decision.
Â Â  . We are not involved in issuing propaganda.
I have been very clear that the Commission as an institution should not be involved in issuing propaganda.
That is why we are concentrating on making, for example, the full text of the Constitution, translated into the different languages, available and accessible to ordinary citizens to read for themselves.
In some cases, our material may only be a summary of the text, or the full text.
We make it clear that people can ask questions and that the services are available to citizens.
The rest has to be part of, I hope, an informed debate in each and every Member State, where the âyesâ and ânoâ sides will be fully represented.
We have really made it clear that we should not be issuing propaganda.
We have limited our work to ensure that we can contribute to this informed and factual debate on the Constitution.
Â Â  I wonder whether the Commissioner shares my frustration at the Janus face of Member States on this issue, where on the one hand they complain about lack of knowledge by their citizens of EU activity, and then on the other hand frustrate the European Commission in terms of distributing information.
Now that the British general election is out of the way, will the Commissioner hold new talks with the British Government to discuss how factual information can be distributed in the UK about the work of the European Union, and in particular about the contents of the Constitution?
Â Â  . We have always tried to maintain an open and honest dialogue with the UK Government, not least on information, but we also respect the will and plans and strategies of each and every Member State.
It would be very unfortunate if we were seen to be trying to force upon a Member State anything that would then be seen as propaganda or to be trying to interfere with a debate under way in a specific Member State.
We instead offer our support, our help, the material and all the facts that we can make available to each and every Member State.
I hope that we will continue these talks and see how best we can help the UK Government with information on the Constitution, but the strategy always has to be a national one.
We can assist, help and back up the national strategies, and that is how it has been planned up until now.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, in the Basque Country we have already voted on the Constitutional Treaty and we have voted in favour, but one of the things I have noticed is that those who opposed the Constitution argued that the European Unionâs Charter of Fundamental Rights reduced the rights already enjoyed by the citizens of the majority of the Member States, particularly in the field of housing, work, etc.
I would like to ask you what we could do amongst all of us, including the Commission, to ensure that the citizens of Europe understand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an addition to the rights already guaranteed by the Constitutions of the States and that European citizenship is an addition to the citizenships of the Member States.
Â Â  . Not only that, but by putting it in the Constitution, these rules and fundamental rights will be legally enforceable to European citizens.
That is another argument that has to be put to our citizens.
We try to do it in different ways.
The best way is often to show the text as it is so that people can read for themselves what are actually set out as fundamental rights for European citizens and explain what that means.
We can also do that through information on the web-page or other information materials that we have.
There is a constant dialogue with citizens in trying to explain and discuss it with them.
You did that successfully in Spain.
We are grateful to Spain for that.
You set an example.
In many Member States they actually advertise the full text of the Constitution, including the fundamental rights.
Â Â  . The Barroso Commission has proposed a partnership for a renewed European order to tackle the complex challenges ahead, where vision, leadership and delivery are the key elements for building renewed trust and confidence.
The only way to develop this partnership is by bringing in the European citizens and taking their interests into account.
The first responsibility of the present Commission is, therefore, to connect with citizens.
Let me add immediately that this is not just the Commissionâs responsibility.
In fact, it is very much the responsibility of all players: Parliament, the Council and the Member State governments.
The Commission will, therefore, put forward a White Paper on communication, which will address the role of all involved and which will give the other institutions the possibility to define and organise their input.
The Commission for its part will pursue a new approach on communication, which will focus on the need to interest Europeans in EU politics.
This demand-driven communication approach has to involve a better understanding of target audiences and those who act as multipliers, a better use of modern and effective communication tools and techniques, and a more professional attitude to all our communication work.
What the Commission will have to do first is to improve its listening process.
The Commission needs to make better use of its polling and intelligence services â if I may call them that â in its consultation procedures and to use its communication tools according to the needs and interests of its audiences.
In order to reach people, the communication of political priorities will be adapted to demographic and national specificities, instead of taking the classical one-size-fits-all approach.
Our representation offices in the Member States will have a central role to play here.
The Commission will explain its policies and their impact on EU citizensâ daily lives and communicate the tangible benefits of Europe rather than overload people with technical information.
Last, but not least, the Commission will encourage and support efforts to establish and improve a dialogue with Europeans.
The Commission will, therefore, need to professionalise its communication activities. That involves improving research, planning, coordination and evaluation of communication activities and making better use of the excellent communication tools the Commission has at its disposal and the representations in the 25 Member States.
Communication will be integrated into the Commissionâs working culture and into policy formulation from the very beginning, and this needs to be maintained throughout the whole political process.
Since communication is an across-the-board challenge, all actors â from the European institutions and Member States to civil society and the media â have a role to play.
Interinstitutional cooperation is a key element.
The Commission has kept Parliament regularly informed on the development of the communication strategy, which was also discussed at the last meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information and in the Committee on Culture and Education during the discussion on the Herrero-Tejedor report.
The Commission will invite the European Parliament and the Council to comment on its White Paper.
The Commission will also continue to improve relations with the media, in particular regional and local media in the Member States, as a key element for ensuring that information reaches the citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I think the Commissionâs public information policy has two dangers to contend with: the first is that of excessive reliance on a few major languages, of which English is one, and the second is concentration on Brussels, or centralisation in it.
What is the Commission planning to do to make information less centralised, and to make Commissioners more readily and directly available to the press in the Member States?
There is, of course the âEurope Directâ network of information centres; only this last weekend, I was present at the opening of one in Furth im Wald, and it is splendid.
There are, though, still too few of them, particularly in the new Member States.
I would like to ask whether the network will cover the whole of Europe this year?
Â Â  . Mr Posselt is absolutely right about the risk of this becoming too narrow or too Brussels-centric, and that has been part of the problem until now.
We face a huge challenge in dealing with 20 official languages, and this is something that will remain a huge challenge for us.
In preparing this new communication strategy, we have been guided by the concept of âgoing localâ, that is to say reaching out locally and regionally through our representation offices.
We have to equip those offices in such a way â and work and plan in such a way â that they can âgo localâ and communicate with local media.
Our contacts with the national parliaments will also help.
We have to make sure that European affairs are anchored in local and national political traditions and party systems.
They will have to understand European affairs and how this affects the way they work and their tasks.
I agree with you that these are challenges.
We are already concentrating on trying to solve these two issues.
Â Â  . It is correct that Eurobarometer Special 214 âthe future Constitutional Treatyâ reveals that 67% of citizens have already heard of the Constitution and that 33% have not.
Furthermore, according to that Eurobarometer, 75% of those who know the Constitution well are in favour and even 60% of those who have only a modest knowledge are favourable.
However, the support of those who have never heard about the Constitution so far is only 22%.
The conclusion is clear.
There is a vital need to communicate on this cornerstone project for the future of the European Union.
As you know, the main responsibility for communicating about the Constitution lies with Member States.
Nevertheless, the European Commission is determined to undertake all the actions necessary to inform citizens about the content of the Constitution, but also about its importance for the future of the Union.
We have therefore developed this strategy that I have mentioned before, consisting of ten initiatives which form an integrated concept, and support and enhance each other.
They are: the distribution of the text of the Constitution for free; a Constitution website; training for national and regional journalists; round table discussions with civil society; information to universities and schools; support for the production of radio and television programmes and targeting the use of the âEurope directâ call centre.
Our eighth action involves mobilising our networks of multipliers in various policy areas. The ninth consists in undertaking detailed opinion poll analysis and focus group research, and the tenth in supporting the information campaigns of the Member States.
Through these initiatives, we are seeking to develop an informed debate based on the contents of the Constitution.
Members of the European Parliament and individual Member States also have a crucial role to play.
Â Â  Thank you for that reply, Commissioner.
In Ireland we are obliged to have a referendum.
A former colleague of mine, a Minister, who was campaigning in a previous referendum was told: âIf you donât have those lorries moved from the end of the cul-de-sac, I am not voting.â
That is the extent of the engagement of some people in this campaign.
The two biggest issues around the Constitutional Treaty are firstly, that 60 million Europeans died in the first half of the last century because we did not have an integrated Europe and secondly, not only governments and parliaments but civil society were involved in the formation of this Constitutional Treaty.
The institutions of this Union have spoken.
Never mind the cynics!
