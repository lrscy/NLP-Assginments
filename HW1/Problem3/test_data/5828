The Spanish should be left to manage and settle this conflict between themselves.
In these conditions, an alternative resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was fully justified.
I should, however, have liked the reasoning to have revolved around rejection on principle of the examination of a matter internal to a Member State.
That is why I abstained from voting on both resolutions.
Because the European Parliament has now been genuinely taken hostage by the Spanish Socialists, who initiated this debate, we initially considered abstaining from voting on the two resolutions proposed today.
If we have, in the end, supported the resolution by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is because it states what is our own conviction, namely that ETA has not fulfilled the conditions for becoming a credible negotiating partner.
It hardly needs pointing out that ETA has offered no apology to the families of the 1 000 victims of the attacks and that it has never renounced armed conflict.
On 23 September, it was again committing itself to pursuing the armed struggle, written in blood.
We have voted against the resolution by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and by other groups, not because of its content - bland and unhelpful as it is --but because it is, to all intents and purposes, dictated by Batasuna.
ETA has always tried to internationalise the peace process.
Through the efforts of its political wing and thanks to the Spanish Socialists, this aim has now been achieved in a European Parliament deeply divided by a debate that ought never to have taken place here and now.
As long as ETA has not renounced armed conflict, it will remain a terrorist organisation to be fought and not a political force with which to engage in dialogue.
It is not right that problems of this kind - which have to do with a Member State's internal affairs - be put on the agenda of this House.
With the exception of our Spanish Members, we are not given the opportunity to have a full debate on the subject, which - although certainly important - is thereby degraded to nothing more than a party-political dispute, for it would be absurd for the Members from other countries not to have entire confidence in their group's Spanish Members where this issue is concerned.
In principle, though, I take the view that no region or minority ought, in striving for autonomy, to have recourse to violence, for that way of doing things runs counter to the European values that we have been defending for over sixty years, and this I say in full awareness of my being here as a representative of the German-speaking community in Belgium.
The Basques are in an exceptional position compared to most other European peoples.
At the start of the nineteenth century, Europe was carved up between a handful of large, multi-ethnic states.
The Vienna Congress in 1815 believed it could secure this division of states and relevant borders for ever.
From 1830, two-thirds of today's European states came about either by violent or by peaceful means, as a result of the democratic fight for government and education in the people's own language.
Of the remaining multilingual states, Spain and Belgium have adopted a federal form whose administration recognises the difference in language and culture.
Unfortunately, within Spain, the Basque country is still split between the three major Basque provinces that form one region together, along with the region of Navarre, of which only the western half has a Basque majority.
The demands of the Basques are comparable to those of Catalonia, which have now largely been met.
The response to their demands should not be military or judicial oppression of the kind meted out by former Spanish governments and advocated by the present Right-wing opposition.
We rejoice to see that the independence movement and the Spanish state are finally seeking a peaceful solution together and that most groups in this House are backing this process.
in writing. UKIP have abstained on Resolution on the principle that this is clearly a nation state matter and thus wholly inappropriate for the EU to interfere in or pass judgement upon.
The territorial integrity of a Member State and their approach to tackling terrorism should be left to the discretion of the state, appropriately representing and accountable to their citizens who are directly affected.
UKIP abhors and opposes terrorism in all forms.
in writing. I oppose this EPP resolution criticising Spanish government efforts to negotiate peace.
If the criteria the EPP seeks to apply were applied initially to the Irish process, the IRA would still be engaged in its murder campaign.
As we know, doubts about the commitment of the IRA continued to exist, 10 years on.
But structures have evolved to pressure them and monitor their activities; to ensure that they were disarming and completely committed to politics.
It can be said that, had the process not been in place, up to 1000 further deaths could have occurred in that period in Northern Ireland.
The Spanish government is dealing with one of the most difficult tasks - how to bring internal, politically driven violence to an end.
The view we are asked to endorse is that of the party in opposition in Spain.
This view is contrary to the considered position of the current democratically elected government of the Spanish people.
In the UK and Ireland there is cross-party support for the Irish peace process, even though from time to time parties have been critical of details.
This is one of the reasons it has been successful to date.
in writing. The vote on this resolution has put the PPE-DE Irish delegation in a difficult position.
The Irish Peace Process has been a success and we recognise the support of the EU for that process.
After more than 40 years of terrorism, violence and conflict all parties are now working towards a lasting peace in Ireland.
We would like to see a successful peace process in Spain also and an end to the use of violence for political ends.
However, there are dangers in drawing parallels between the Irish Peace Process and the situation that currently exists in Spain.
To begin with, the Irish Peace process has the support of two sovereign governments and the support of the vast majority of political parties on both islands. In Spain there is still deep political division on how best to proceed.
It is unfortunate that the European Parliament is being forced to divide on such a fundamentally important issue for Spain.
However, with Spanish Members so deeply divided on the resolution before us, it has made it impossible for the rest of Parliament to form a united view on a subject that we really should not be divided on.
Fundamentally, we all want to support an end to political violence in Spain.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. I welcome this resolution on the peace process in Spain and very much regret that the right in the Parliament was not part of the coalition supporting the peace process.
It is sad that they have turned their backs on the very wise words of their own former Prime Minister JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, who in 1998 said "For peace, and its right, we must open our hearts to hope and forgiveness.
In our fight for peace, we will do our best with the help and hope of everybody."
What a pity the EPP could not capture that spirit in today's debate.
(DE) Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the German Free Democratic Party did not participate in the vote on the motion for a resolution.
The motion for a resolution bears the legend 'European Parliament resolution on the peace process in Spain'.
This we regard as a matter to be resolved at the national level, and believe that the European Union should not concern itself with matters over which it has no power and for which it has no responsibility.
We are particularly critical, in this context, of paragraph 3 of the resolution, in which the Council and the Commission are urged to take appropriate action, something that we regard as going against the subsidiarity principle.
It is for this reason that we have refrained from participation in the vote.
(NL) Mr President, I have voted against the Socialist-inspired joint motion for a resolution on the so-called peace process in Spain.
I was so naÃ¯ve as to believe that the European treaties had introduced the principle of subsidiarity, but no, Europe wants to interfere in purely domestic Spanish affairs.
I was so naÃ¯ve as to believe that democrats would not get round the table with murderers and terrorists and bow to their blackmail, but no, it appears that this is the sort of practice Europe wants to encourage from now on.
This does, however, create a dangerous precedent.
It appears that the Left-wingers in this House, followed by quite a few 'useful idiots' in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, consider it normal that the government of one of the Member States should negotiate with a terrorist organisation which is not even prepared to offer its apologies to the families of all the people it has senselessly killed over the years.
If, however, you realise that some of the group chairmen in this House who are tabling this resolution today have in the past personally given shelter to wanted terrorists, including Hans-Joachim Klein of the Rote Armee Fraktion, you should not be surprised by anything emanating from the Left and extreme Left, who are always prepared to take the moral high ground on every other issue.
'Chassez le naturel, il revient au galop'.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to make a personal statement and ask the Member who has just spoken to apologise.
Members who do not vote as you do are not to be referred to as idiots.
(Replying to Mr Martinez, who heckles him)
Whether what was said was 'useful' or 'useless' idiot is scarcely relevant. I know.
I have read as much Lenin as you, Mr Martinez
That being said, I would ask you, Mr President, to ask the Member of whom I was speaking to apologise.
I shall then offer my explanation of vote.
(Applause)
(Replying to Mr Martinez, who heckles him again)
I am familiar with Lenin.
Just because Lenin uses insults, that does not mean that you must do the same ...
Just a moment please, Mr Dillen.
I imagine that you did not wish to call your honourable friends idiots.
I would therefore ask you to correct or clarify exactly what you said.
(NL) Mr President, I did not use the word 'idiots', but actually said 'useful idiots', which has been a frequently-used term in politics for over a century and which, as Mr Martinez reminded us a moment ago, was coined by Lenin.
It is a typically political expression which is often used in political debate and which was certainly not meant personally.
If this is what the speaker thought, then I should like to apologise.
It was simply a political attack and certainly not a personal one.
(FR) Mr President, I do accept his apology, but I do not believe that the addition of an adjective reduces the import of the noun it qualifies.
A 'great' imbecile is still an imbecile, is he not?
I turn now to my explanation of vote.
Like my colleagues in the Union for French Democracy (UDF), I voted in favour of the resolution in support of the peace initiative in the Basque country, adopted by the Spanish Parliament.
Through this vote, we wanted to declare our solidarity with the democratic authorities in Spain at a time when a delicate process is being entered into to eliminate violence and re-establish civil order in the Basque country.
However, we only voted in favour of this resolution because the new wording of paragraph 6 - which Mr Vidal-Quadras rightly called a substantial modification of the initial text - points out very clearly that this issue falls exclusively within the competence of Spain.
It would not have been right for the European Parliament to have set itself up as a supervisory authority for the Spanish Parliament in a matter that has to do with national sovereignty.
Parliament and the European Council are, however, playing their full role by giving the Spanish authorities the moral and political support that they are entitled to expect.
In this connection, it is, to Parliament's ear, illogical, to say the least, for Spain's People's Party to denounce international interference in their country's internal affairs while proposing a resolution outrightly and unequivocally condemning the vote in the Cortes.
In supporting the decisions taken by Spain's legal authorities, Parliament is certainly showing more respect for Spanish sovereignty than it would have done in condemning those decisions, as it was asked to do by the Spanish opposition.
Rather than try to intimidate French MEPs in the centre of the political spectrum, as he did in this morning's Le Figaro, Mr Rajoy would have done better to have questioned the coherence of his own approach and of the approach of his party in Strasbourg.
in writing. The Spanish peace process is a brave and necessary initiative.
While the government in Spain is seeking to end ETA bloodshed through dialogue and negotiation, it is incumbent on all democratic parties, both inside and outside Spain, to offer support to the process.
That does not prevent us from maintaining a critical perspective, with regard to the seriousness of the ETA organisation's commitment to making the necessary compromises.
Incidents such as the kidnapping in Southwest France by the ETA organisation are a test of the process.
There may be other such incidents before the process is concluded.
In these circumstances, it is a matter for the government of Spain to judge whether such incidents indicate a deliberate breach of the ETA ceasefire and to act accordingly.
It is necessary to bear in mind the sensitivities of the victims of terror and their families during the process and in its conclusion.
But the process is primarily about preventing further killing and destruction.
Those victims of terror who support the current peace process are to be congratulated for their generosity and courage.
They, despite their pain, have opted to try and prevent others facing the same trauma in the future.
in writing. (SV) Terrorism, in all its forms, is a detestable phenomenon that, more often than not, hits innocent civilians.
A true democrat must, in all situations, reject and condemn acts of that kind.
Parliament has today debated motions for resolutions by the majority of political groups concerning the peace process in Spain.
The rejection of terrorism and the stand taken in favour of the peace process have, unfortunately, been permeated by a political power struggle that really belongs to Spanish politics.
The issue concerned is one that, in the end, must be resolved in the sovereign state of the Kingdom of Spain.
It is thus very depressing to see the opportunism with which different political forces in the European Parliament are trying to exploit this tragic chapter in Spanish history.
In accordance with the above reasoning, I have today abstained from voting on all the motions for resolutions concerning the peace process in Spain.
in writing. (ES) We are giving our opinion today on a motion for a resolution supporting the peace process in Spain.
The content of this resolution represents unreserved support for the peace process and the fight against terrorist violence in our country in the terms established by the Congress of Deputies in May 2005.
In that statement, the Congress expressed its support for the Zapatero government's plans to begin talks processes with those people who wish to abandon violence, while at all times respecting the law and democratic principles.
I voted against the adopted resolution for a number of reasons.
First of all, it is unacceptable, in my view, that (these or any other) initiatives aimed at putting an end to ETA's terrorist activities are referred to as a 'peace process'.
The choice of words is biased and disingenuous.
There is no war.
Rather, what we have is, on the one hand, a free, democratic country that respects autonomies and, on the other, a people that has suffered from the indiscriminate, unjustifiable violence of a terrorist group.
Secondly, I cannot vote for a resolution that fails to acknowledge clearly that it is impossible to negotiate with a terrorist group that refuses, prior to those negotiations, explicitly to renounce violence.
Lastly, I feel that it is for Spain and the Spanish people to resolve the issue of Basque terrorism as they see fit, but I refuse to support a resolution in Parliament on this issue that makes no reference to ETA's unjustified and indefensible motives.
In addition to the methods to which they resort, namely terrorism, this organisation is worthy of our complete, unreserved condemnation.
In this case, we must condemn the substance of the terrorists' claims, and should give them no succour in terms of a democratic vote.
The terms in which the motion for a resolution was tabled for discussion are offensive to most Spanish people and in particular to the victims of terrorism in Spain.
This has been made abundantly clear by the association that represents the overwhelming majority of the victims, which has referred to the process initiated by the Spanish Government as capitulation.
The very title of the resolution inaccurately suggests the existence of two legitimate sides engaged in a peace process, when what is actually at stake is talks between a government and a terrorist group responsible for murder, persecution and extortion, of which hundreds of Spanish citizens have been the victims.
It must not be forgotten that, following the cease-fire declared by ETA, its Members have issued threats, no weapons have been handed in and news has come to light of attempts at re-arming.
To open unconditional dialogue with terrorists who not only fail to condemn but actually justify the armed struggle and who show no remorse for the innocents they slaughter is tantamount to an incredible surrender on the part of the political authorities of a democratic country.
That is no cause for celebration.
I am appalled by the opportunism shown by the Zapatero government, which has sought to obtain internationally what it has failed to obtain from its citizens.
in writing. While I voted with the EPP and rapporteur on this, I would just like to draw attention to the case of the European City Guides, in which individuals, small companies and even schools have been sucked into a scheme where they have had money fraudulently extracted from them with no clear means of redress.
While I believe this report to be generally of benefit to European businesses, it must also be noted that it could leave the way open for an intensification of the kind of practices carried out by European City Guides.
in writing. (SV) The content of the programme can be brought into question.
In her justification at first reading, the rapporteur wrote that it 'will make an important contribution to the active citizenship of young people in society and thus enhance their feeling of being part of Europe, so that it is likely to deliver substantial European added value'.
We question whether the programme really will make a substantial contribution to this objective.
International youth exchanges are a good thing, but they need to be funded through the efforts of civil society or by the Member States.
We do not believe that the EU should involve itself in this type of activity.
I supported the GrÃ¶ner report, on which Parliament voted today, on the 'Youth in Action' programme for 2007-2013.
I particularly welcome the proposal to guarantee funding for youth-related activities throughout Europe.
This new programme provides for action under five headings: Youth for Europe, European Voluntary Service, Youth of the World, Youth Workers and support systems, and Support for policy cooperation.
In this way, Europe will continue to invest in a youth policy as a way of reinforcing its citizens' sense of belonging to Europe and of developing its young people, on the basis of solidarity and mutual understanding among all people.
in writing.
I welcome the Youth in Action programme, which aims at promoting experiences of European citizenship by young people. This should contribute to solidarity and mutual understanding among young people throughout the European Union.
For the individual the programme should help promote a sense of initiative, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. Finally, it should contribute to fostering youth organisations and activities in all Member States.
in writing. I want to put on record my support for this report.
in writing. I welcome these proposals, which bring together the existing internal education and training programmes, allow for increased coherence and complementarity of Community programmes and should lead to more efficiency and flexibility in the Community's actions in the field.
These programmes have demonstrated palpable success over their lifespan and have contributed to the modernisation of the educational and training systems in Europe.
As the new Integrated Programme is open to some third countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, Switzerland), it has a huge potential for contributing to intercultural understanding.
The Integrated Programme is unfortunately, however, not open to all countries in the Union's neighbourhood.
I believe that establishing and maintaining contacts with the peoples of the Union's Southern and Eastern neighbours through education and training activities is of crucial importance.
I call, therefore, for the programme to be gradually opened to all countries covered by the EU's Neighbourhood Policy.
I would also like to see the inclusion of the Erasmus Mundus programme in the Integrated Programme as of 2009, when the present programme has run to the end.
in writing. (SV) I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the June List's rejection at first reading in October 2005.
It is true that the June List is a supporter of, for example, the Erasmus programme, but there are other parts of the draft component programmes that we need to examine carefully in order to establish whether they are justified on the basis that, under the Treaty, each Member State is responsible for the organisation and content of education and vocational training systems.
Overall, too much money has been appropriated to far too many projects.
We question why some of these projects exist and are funded via the EU.
in writing. I voted for this report and welcome the intention to replace the existing Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, e-learning and other related programmes (which expire at the end of 2006) with a new integrated lifelong learning programme for 2007 to 2013.
I support the creation of four strands Comenius for general education activities in schools, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci for vocational education and training and Grundvig for adult education.
I believe this programme addresses important needs concerning the modernisation and adaptation of education and training systems in the light of the Lisbon goals.
(NL) Mr President, I have voted against the amendments to the report on the Europe for Citizens Programme, because this programme, like its innumerable predecessors, is about as much use as sticking a plaster on a wooden leg.
Attempts are made to bring the citizens closer to the European institutions, but these will never be successful as long as policies are being adopted which, in some areas, are diametrically opposed to what the majority of the people actually want.
One example of this is enlargement policy, and, more specifically, the possible accession of Turkey.
A programme such as Europe for Citizens can be credible only if the European Union does something about the democratic deficit and the lack of accountability towards the European citizens.
What has now been approved by Parliament does nothing to change the essence of the problem, and is therefore yet another way of wasting money.
Even this programme is testimony to the scant attention that the EU pays its citizens.
For a start, the funding amounts proposed are very low, some 60% down on the amount originally earmarked.
It is also true that the programme is ambiguous.
Although there are some worthwhile objectives - for example, the twinning of cities, civic projects, various surveys and studies, art events and conferences - there are others that are indicative of unacceptable political influence, such as excluding fascist crimes from support under new Action 4 - Active European Memory.
As regards the amendments to budget appropriations within the programme, the strengthening of education-related measures is to be welcomed, although such projects will hopefully be incorporated in such a way as to ensure that all opinions on the EU and its policies are heard, and not so as to transform it into yet another platform for propaganda.
We also welcome the inclusion of amateur sports organisations and hope that it is extensively applied.
in writing. (SV) I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate the June List's rejection at first reading in April 2006.
We very much reject quite a few of the positions adopted by Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education where this programme is concerned.
The work on this matter has primarily proceeded from an attitude of incomprehension regarding the low turnout at the 2004 elections to the European Parliament and regarding the fact that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands.
The 'Europe for Citizens' programme has no contribution to make to changing the political situation.
The work involving local amateur sport organisations within the framework of this programme is redolent of contempt for Europeans.
We also note that it is important for the peoples of Europe not to neglect their memories in relation to dictatorships and tragedies in the histories of their countries.
However, this should be done at national level.
It is not something for Eurocrats in Brussels to get involved in.
The June List has therefore rejected the amendments tabled by the Committee on Culture and Education to the result of Parliament's debates on this matter.
in writing. - (FR) As early as at first reading, in April 2006, we came out against this report, so significant were the absurdities that it contained.
This proposal at second reading is no worse. It is quite simply unacceptable.
With a total budget of EUR 190 million, this programme is, indeed, a new propaganda tool in the service of the European Union.
We could, without a doubt, find better uses for this sum - I am thinking, in particular, of the social sphere, agricultural aid and business creation - than to allocate it to this vague and artificial notion of European citizenship.
Couched entirely in black and white terms, the document concerned is brilliant at pointing out to us what is desirable, namely to be an enthusiast of active European values; what is bad, namely to be a passive citizen; and what is worse, namely to be a Eurosceptic.
Whatever happens after the inevitable approval of this report and the wasting of all that money by various associations, we shall all remain, above all, nationals of one country or another and proud to be so.
in writing. I voted for this report, which seeks to address a major challenge facing the EU: how to connect the EU with its citizens.
The 'Europe for Citizens' programme ensures the continuity of the civic participation programme established for the period 2004 to 2006.
The programme provides the Union with an instrument to promote active European citizenship.
It responds to the need to improve citizens' participation in the construction of Europe and encourages cooperation between citizens and their organisations from different countries in order to meet, act together and develop their own ideas in a European environment which goes beyond the national vision.
I welcome this.
in writing. I want to put on record my support for this initiative.
Perfluorooctane sulphonates (PFOS) are toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative substances present in applications such as chromium plating, waterproofing and fire resistance.
This report, in contrast with the Commission's original proposal, proposes the gradual phasing-out of PFOS from the market, with a view to eliminating their use.
Furthermore, some derogations initially laid down - cases of chrome plating of metals and fire-fighting foams for which there are now safer viable alternatives - are to be removed.
By means of a compromise amendment, the administrative threshold has been lowered from the 0.1% proposed by the Commission to a new threshold of 0.005%.
The report also proposes that each Member State draft inventories of all products in which PFOS are used in order to prevent these substances from being released into the environment.
I particularly welcome the amendment proposing that current derogations can only be maintained where there are no safer substances or technologies that are technically and economically viable, and where the best techniques available are put in place in order to minimise PFOS emissions.
The Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs welcome the amendments aimed at preserving the quality of the environment and accordingly endorse Mr Schlyter's report.
in writing. I voted in favour of this proposal, which aims to restrict the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), substances widely used in materials such as textiles, carpets, paper and general coating.
Studies conducted by the OECD, the UK authorities and the Scientific Committee on Health and Environment Risks have found evidence that PFOS are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic.
It seems right that the EU should act to get rid of another substance of high concern.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over two years have passed since we joined the EU.
Yet internal border controls in the EU remain, and that is a cause of profound dissatisfaction for us.
As a representative of the Czech people, I am not particularly interested in the technical and legal problems involved in the introduction of the SIS II system, to which the Commission has recently referred.
The new Member States and their citizens must become fully-fledged members of the EU, with equal rights, at the earliest opportunity.
In this context, any delay to our entry into the Schengen area is utterly unjustifiable.
I therefore voted for the adoption of the Coelho report on the Schengen information system, because its smooth, quick adoption will lead to the fulfilment of the four fundamental freedoms that lie at the very core of the EU.
(DE) Mr President, much as I would like to see improvements to the Schengen Information System, I have nevertheless voted against the Coelho report, believing as I do that an emergency solution to the immediate extension of the Schengen area - as mooted by the new Member States of the EU - needs to be firmly rejected.
My reason for saying this is that the security of the public must take precedence over any sensitivities on the part of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, who, as we know, are bringing a great deal of pressure to bear in this regard, for the ability of the new Member States to actually secure the EU's external border to the east is very much in doubt, not least by reason of the large number of illegal immigrants caught on the eastern border of Austria, the country from which I come.
Premature participation on the part of the new Member States would promote illegal immigration and criminal tourism on a massive scale and should therefore, I believe, be rejected.
in writing. Although the UK is not part of the Schengen Information System (SIS), I welcome this package of three reports for two reasons.
Firstly it is the very existence of SIS that has allowed internal borders in the Schengen area to be removed and this new system SIS II will allow new Member States to be linked up to the system and subsequently allow them to dismantle their internal borders and thus allow their citizens to gain the advantages of full free movement.
Secondly, I welcome this from a UK point of view because, while not taking part in the Regulation, I hope the UK will eventually have access to its information for purposes of security.
The adoption of the Coelho reports created the legal basis for the practical implementation of the second-generation Schengen Information System.
By means of its new electronic interception network on the new eastern borders, SIS II makes the EU a safer place.
Among the new characteristics of SIS II, its storage capacity has been enlarged to accommodate 27 Member States; it facilitates the storage of biometric data and the European Arrest Warrant, the correlation of data and persons, together with, moreover, the improvement of data protection standards.
SIS II opens up new options for the police and the justice system when it comes to searching for wanted persons and also creates the conditions for the free movement of European citizens in a larger area of freedom, security and justice.
For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the adoption of Mr Coelho's reports.
I voted in favour of Mr Coelho's reports because I feel that they are of paramount importance in protecting our citizens' interests and security.
The SIS II system will enable the Schengen area to be enlarged to cover the new Member States as quickly as possible, by updating it, increasing its capacity and introducing the new possibilities offered by the most recent technological developments.
The bottom line, however, is that this system offers greater security in the management and control of personal data, without people's fundamental rights being overlooked, and in so doing guarantees our citizens that effective measures are being taken to combat organised crime, illegal immigration and other crimes that undermine their security and interests.
in writing. - (FR) The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a police cooperation tool, the purpose of which is to centralise, and facilitate the exchange of, information relating to persons and vehicles, or other items, jointly sought by Member State police services.
Some 13 million items of information are at present stored in the current system.
It is proposed that we create a second-generation SIS - SIS II - which would be extended to the new Member States.
That is something to which we cannot subscribe, any more than we subscribed to Schengen I, which arranged for the free movement of persons by removing the Member States' internal borders.
The problem is not one of having a super-computer capable of making an inventory of all the people or goods sought by the police. It is one of ensuring that each nation state is able to establish an area in which security prevails.
Each day, the immigrants arriving in huge numbers on the coasts of Europe prove that what we need to protect are our borders and that it is because these are so porous that we are faced with illegal immigration and lack of security.
What this means is that all the computers in the world could collect as much personal data as is available without altering the fact that the main source of the problems of illegal immigration, lack of security and trafficking of all kinds is the lack of effective control of the European Union's internal and external borders.
The purpose of this report is to broaden the characteristics of SIS beyond its original scope.
It seeks to develop new features, extend access to new authorities, interlink alerts between those authorities and introduce new categories of data, such as the arrest warrant and biometric data, and the visa information system, a technical platform for sharing information.
This extension to the previous system brings additional risks to citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees, given that further elements are added to a database that is also shared by more bodies and accessible to more people, with no guarantee that these data will be able to remain confidential.
There are further worrying aspects in this proposal.
For example, records may be 'kept longer if they are required for monitoring procedures which have already begun'. The question that thus arises is who defines what is 'necessary' and the vague notion of 'monitoring procedures which have already begun'.
Another all too vague area is that of sharing data with third countries, as provided for by the proposal.
The fundamental objective is to make SIS compatible with the new circumstances arising from enlargement and from the dangerous, unacceptable objectives of the current securitarian crusade in the EU.
The report, as formulated with the agreement of the political mouthpieces of capital (Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, social democrats and liberals), adopts as acquis communautaire the creation of a gigantic mechanism for monitoring and keeping files on every European or foreign citizen inside or outside the borders of the ÎU.
The SIS II system abolishes every guarantee of protection for citizens' personal data by granting the right for personal data, including biometric data such as photographs, fingerprints and distinguishing marks, to be recorded and for any person who, in the arbitrary and uncontrolled view of the forces of repression, is suspected of committing crimes or who, according to information from the secret services, is a threat to national security, to be put under surveillance.
These personal data may be kept for an indeterminate period of time by decision of the prosecuting authorities and will be accessible, in addition to the police and judicial authorities, to the secret services, Europol and Eurojust, who will have the right to pass them to third countries or organisations (such as the CIA and so forth).
The famous area of freedom and security of the ÎU is now revealing its repellent and nightmarish form as an area in which basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are throttled, an area of uncontrolled action by the forces of repression to protect the power of Euro-unifying monopolies from the peoples' resistance and the workers' and grassroots movement.
in writing. (SV) The establishment of SIS II is seen by forces critical of the EU as a further step towards building a common EU police force and as part of the web that, in specialist area after specialist area, is forming an EU state.
The EU is in the process of being turned into the ultimate closed 'big brother' state that, at the time of Sweden's accession, many Swedes feared it would become.
This is happening with the blessing of politicians on both the left and the right who, with populist messages concerning, for example, external border controls and the fight against crime, are helping to construct a non-fictional Orwellian society.
The June List is in favour of cross-border police cooperation.
It is necessary to confront contemporary international crime, but this has been done successfully for decades by the international police body, Interpol.
To find the money for a further information system, and one that only applies within the European Union, would, then, be superfluous.
The June List is very sceptical about allowing the Member State bodies responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles to have access to very sensitive personal data.
That type of information should be handled by the individual nations.
All the Member States must be able to guarantee their citizens protection against unauthorised access to their personal data.
The June List is thus voting against all three reports on SIS II and access to the system.
in writing. The assassination of Anna Politkovskaya bring shame to Russia and I hope that at every level the Russian authorities will spare no effort to bring those responsible to justice.
in writing. The murder of Anna Politkovskaya should be condemned, as should all killings of journalists, human rights campaigners and others who seek to expose the truth.
"Freedom of Expression" is still met with death in too many places in our world.
Russia is still a country where freedom of expression is a myth.
The Russian authorities must bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. Greater pressure must be placed on the Russian authorities to guarantee the freedom of the media and human rights organisations on Russian soil.
in writing. I fully support this motion and abhor the fact that, although the EU guidelines for breast cancer screening were first drawn up in 1992, mammograph screening is currently only offered nationwide in 11 Member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom).
For me it is particularly unacceptable that in Ireland, which has recorded the highest economic growth rates in recent years, about 600 women are victims of breast cancer each year, and a sizeable number of those deaths could be prevented if periodic screening and diagnosis identified the problem early enough.
It is a disgrace that in Ireland we are still waiting for the rollout of a national breast screening programme.
However, we do expect that rollout to be completed in 2007, although the cervical cancer screening programme won't be completed until 2008 at the earliest - some 15 years later!
All Member States must introduce - urgently - nationwide breast screening.
The Commission should now work with the new Member States and accession countries to assist them in using the European Regional Development Fund and the pre-accession funds to create a comprehensive health care infrastructure.
in writing. Members of the UKIP-delegation regard EU initiatives of any kind as an undemocratic abuse of power and will not vote for them under any circumstances, even when they seem well-intentioned.
In this case, the EU is attempting to intrude its influence into the sphere of health service provision, which, like all spheres subject to EU intrusion, should remain under the control, which only nation-states can provide, of democratically-elected governments.
in writing. (SV) Are EU measures to combat breast cancer more effective than similar measures within the framework of established, internationally recognised organisations with broad expertise, such as the World Heath Organisation (WHO)?
The June List's answer to that question is 'no'.
The European Parliament must not dictate to what extent the Member States are to implement significant measures such as breast-screening, information campaigns about breast cancer, research into breast cancer, the setting up of cancer registers and the establishment of centres designed to provide information about breast cancer.
It is better for urgent coordination and cross-border cooperation to take place within an organisation such as the WHO than within the EU.
I have thus voted against the current resolution.
in writing. Every year 275,000 women in the EU are diagnosed with breast cancer and the wide discrepancy in care and treatment standards they receive is simply unacceptable.
That is why I voted in favour of this resolution calling for Europe-wide standards for early detection and treatment of the disease.
Breast cancer patients often suffer discrimination in the workplace and I hope that, following Parliament's overwhelming vote, the Commission will now draft a charter for the protection of breast cancer patients at the workplace.
I believe if this report was fully implemented we could improve the quality of life for surviving breast cancer patients and significantly reduce the estimated 88 000 deaths a year in the EU from Breast Cancer perhaps by as much as 35% thus saving 30 000 women a year.
in writing. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged between 35 and 59.
The earlier the diagnosis, the greater the chance of survival.
Most women with breast cancer do not want 'tea and sympathy' but concerted action to improve treatment and tackle the causes.
One simple action which could be taken is to minimise the wait from tests to diagnosis.
From talking to women with breast cancer, it is the waiting which is the most worrying.
We must do all that we can to help and improve the treatment of women at that most concerning time.
Member States must do more to share best practice.
The work of Europa Donna is essential in helping all European women and I want to place on the record my support for this pan-European organisation.
(DE) Mr President, although I have to say that delivering a statement of vote to an empty Chamber is a new experience for me, I would nonetheless like to state why I abstained from voting on the Muscardini report.
Following the demise of the quota system, which had been in place for ten years, there has been, since 2005, a marked increase in the quantity of Chinese leather shoes exported to Europe, as we are all aware, and there is now, understandably, a hail of criticism raining down on the punitive customs duties from China and from those entrepreneurs who benefit from Chinese supplies.
It may well be the case - as the critics of the punitive customs duties suggest - that we will lose for good the European shoe industry, in which, for years, fewer and fewer workers have been taken and more and more workshops have moved to countries outside the EU, but, that notwithstanding, we surely cannot look on and do nothing while a whole industrial sector heads for destruction.
That being so, we should, during the two years during which the punitive tariffs are to apply, use the opportunity to seek out solutions to this major problem for European employment.
We are here to listen to you because an explanation of vote is an opportunity for a Member to explain something he cannot explain with a 'yes' or a 'no'.
Your point is something for the record and not really for the other Members.
It is understandable, but we are here to listen, as long as there are explanations of vote.
(DE) Mr President, I am in complete agreement with you and am obliged for your attention.
in writing. - (FR) Globalisation has been imposed on the peoples of Europe with the assurance that, in the end, they will be the winners because it promotes exports and opens up our competitors' markets just as much as it does ours.
It is quite clear, however, that this globalisation is far from being a 'win-win' situation, and that so-called 'fortress Europe' is full of holes, but that it allows the construction of real fortresses all over the world, particularly in the most promising markets.
The problem, as Mrs Muscardini's report explains, is that the European Union's responses to the improper trade protection practices of certain third countries towards the EU, which are nothing more than disguised, unfair protectionism, are weak, inappropriate or completely lacking.
Mrs Muscardini quite rightly emphasises the need to strengthen the EU's trade defence, but the specific solutions put forward are not up to the challenges, so unshakeably dogmatic is people's faith in the benefits of ultraliberal globalisation and in the virtues of multilateralism.
This system has now reached its limits: the WTO is no longer the solution, but the problem.
It is because the proposals do not reflect the accuracy of the analysis that we are going to abstain on this report.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that free trade is a good thing because it leads to an increase in prosperity for everyone involved.
It is worth noting that, until it joined the EU, Sweden was one of the countries in the world most sympathetic to free trade.
The EU at times conducts a very protectionist policy in order to protect those sectors that are not competitive in the international market.
This approach is exemplified by agricultural aid, whereby agricultural products are subsidised with the result that similar products from other countries - in many cases, developing countries - cannot be sold in the EU market.
An efficient world trade system is extremely important if free trade is one day to become a reality.
The Muscardini report is, however, redolent of protectionism, which is why I voted against it in today's vote.
This report promotes the liberalisation of trade and the principle of reciprocity, and proposes the imposition of retaliatory measures.
Its entire ethos is one of a battle for market quotas in the name of competition, rather than one of cooperation, in which trade has a role to play in development but is not the be-all and end-all.
Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are tantamount to interference in the internal decisions of each country and threats that could be imposed by the WTO.
The losers are the developing. and the least developed, countries.
The report also defends the WTO and the dispute settlement mechanism, and seeks to speed up all of the most offensive (anti-dumping) and defensive (safeguard) trade defence mechanisms.
Speeding up the dispute mechanism and giving it more power will serve to beef up the influence of the major powers in the WTO, because they are the ones with the strength to impose rules.
The crux of the matter is that trade liberalisation runs counter to the idea of fair development.
Each Member State should have the right to decide its economic and social development model, to industrialise and to protect its industries.
This is an alienable, sovereign right, which calls into question the approach of promoting exports and free trade.
in writing. - (FR) The European Union is worried that the industrial powerhouses of China and India are taking protectionist measures against our exports by using trade defence instruments.
The United States, therefore, is no longer Europe's only economic competitor - we are also up against Brazil, other countries in South America and Australia.
The WTO, which should be acting as a global regulator, is not only powerless but complicit.
Thus, the bubble of ultraliberal globalisation is about to burst.
Unlimited, unregulated speculation on goods, commodities and people has now reached its limit.
Having achieved spectacular economic growth, the emerging economies are now consolidating and protecting themselves, with a view to overtaking us one day if we do not react quickly enough.
During this time, the ultra-Europeans in Brussels have been recommending that we open up our borders more and more and keep helping the whole world blindly and with no checks and balances, forgetting our fellow citizens.
We must follow the example of the new world powers by establishing protection and Community preference in Europe and protection and national preference in France.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report, which analyses the use of trade defence measures against the EU by third countries and makes sensible recommendations on how the Community should react, especially in cases where those measures are a disguised form of protectionism aimed at unlawfully restricting access by EU products to foreign markets.

Welcome
I would now like, on behalf of the whole House to extend a warm welcome to our visitors in the official gallery, namely Mr Igor Dodon, Minister for Economic Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Moldova, together with a delegation from the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova.
(Applause)
The delegation from Moldova will be attending our sessions today and tomorrow and will be joining with this House's delegation in a session of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.
I am delighted to see you there and hope that you will find our debates of interest.
Moldova (Transnistria), Georgia (South Ossetia) (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on Moldova (Transnistria) and Georgia (South Ossetia).
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recent developments in Moldova's geographical and political situation have had an impact on the basic state of the Transnistrian conflict.
Ukraine's initiative to resolve the conflict in Transnistria since the Orange Revolution, the involvement of the European Union and the United States in the peace negotiations, and the activities of the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) have strengthened Moldova's unity.
Transnistria has reacted to this by holding a referendum on 17 September. According to the Transnistrian authorities, the referendum resulted in overwhelming support by the people for independence and joining Russia.
The international community, including the European Union, has not recognised this or the earlier referenda in Transnistria.
This was expressed clearly in the declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the EU on 18 September, and also in the EU's positions stated at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in September and within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in July.
In its declaration, the EU condemned the referendum, regarding it as contrary to Moldova's regional integration and its internationally recognised sovereignty.
Moreover, the EU openly cast doubt on the idea that the outcome of the Transnistrian referendum actually reflected the will of the people.
The EU has also discussed the referendum with Russia on several occasions.
Although the public statements made by Russia have given rise to other interpretations, Russia has assured the Union that it respects Moldova's territorial integrity and has denied supporting the referendum.
The activities of the EUBAM are an example of how the Union can best lend real support to the conflict resolution process in Transnistria and bringing the control of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border closer to European standards in general.
Both Moldova and Ukraine have shown gratitude for the transfer of know-how to their border authorities.
It is essential for efforts to resolve the conflict that the EUBAM should have helped to steer the supervision of Transnistrian foreign trade in the direction of the Moldovan authorities.
This, too, contributes to Moldova's national unity.
The decision by Ukraine to start implementing the Ukrainian-Moldovan customs cooperation protocol in March has done much to improve the EUBAM's prospects.
It is the parties themselves which have the key roles in the Transnistrian peace process.
The European Union hopes that the parties to the peace process will return to the negotiating table.
The EU's chances of making an effective contribution to the process are bolstered by the Union's Special Representative, who participates in resolving the Transnistrian conflict in accordance with agreed EU policy objectives and in close coordination with the OSCE.
The European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan between the EU and Moldova is the instrument that will enable the Union to lend purposeful, long-term support to Moldova.
Ultimately, Moldova's development towards a politically and economically stable state may be the key to resolving the Transnistrian conflict.
To achieve this, Moldova must, for example, improve its capacity for administration, extirpate corruption and foster a climate for investment.
Moldova must make itself attractive to both foreign investors and Transnistrian businesses.
The EU is committed to supporting Moldova in these efforts.
Now I will move on to the other topic of our debate.
It has to be said that the European Union is extremely concerned about the tense relations between Russia and Georgia.
This crisis is also affecting the situation in the separatist conflict zones in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
At the informal summit in Lahti last Friday, President Putin even warned that the situation might escalate into bloodshed. He blamed Georgia for preparing for war.
In its conclusions of 17 October, the EU appealed to both Russia and Georgia to do their utmost not only to improve their bilateral relations but also to concentrate their efforts on finding a peaceful settlement to the conflicts.
The Union also urged the parties to comply fully with earlier agreements.
The current situation in South Ossetia is tense.
On 12 November a referendum will be held in the region for the purpose of consolidating the region's independence.
As with the referendum on independence in Transnistria, the European Union does not recognise this referendum. It may increase tension in the region further.
The European Union and the international community are aiding the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia in many ways.
Through its observer status, the European Commission has an important role to play in the Joint Control Commission, the conflict resolution mechanism for South Ossetia.
On many occasions Georgia has expressed the wish that the EU's role should be further strengthened.
It also wants the JCC format to be changed by involving the EU and the United States of America, following the Transnistrian peace process 5+2 model.
More recently, Georgia has called for the peace negotiations to be continued bilaterally between Georgia and South Ossetia.
Additionally, Georgia is demanding that the Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeepers, who in practice are all Russians, be replaced with an international operation both in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, with special emphasis on police activity.
The view of the Georgian Parliament and Government is that these troops are not fulfilling their mandate and that their continued presence is questionable.
The EU is at present discussing internally the question of strengthening its role, but Georgia may have unrealistic expectations of the Union.
The EU is encouraging the Georgian leaders to show restraint.
Hasty decisions on the peace processes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia are best avoided, for they might be a risk to the presence of the United Nations and the OSCE in the region.
This, in turn, would create a vacuum in the regions.
Georgia should undertake not to resort to force.
The EU Member States and the Commission made a significant contribution to the Donor Conference on Economic Rehabilitation for South Ossetia, which was held in Brussels in June.
The conference was held on the basis of a needs assessment conducted by the OSCE.
A significant international programme on economic rehabilitation will be started in South Ossetia this autumn, using funds collected at the conference.
Russia has an important part to play in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Support from Russia is needed in order to achieve results in the peace processes.
The latest espionage scandal, however, has acutely exacerbated the already strained relations between Georgia and Russia.
The EU has on many occasions sent strong messages to the leaders of the two countries, most recently to President Putin at Lahti, on the importance of normalising relations, and it has also offered its services to help reopen their dialogue.
At the end of October, the EU will discuss internally the progress of its role in the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia.
Special Representative Semneby will have an important part to play in maintaining political dialogue between the EU and Georgia.
He may also be able to promote the re-establishment of contact between Georgia and Russia.
During its visit to Tbilisi on 2 October the EU Troika also stated that the EU is prepared to help Georgia resolve its conflicts by means of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
A joint ENP Action Plan between the EU and Georgia has just been drawn up, which the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council will adopt formally at its meeting in Brussels on 14 November.
The ENP Action Plan also contains a separate section on the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, since our last debate there have been substantial developments, to which President-in-Office LehtomÃ€ki has just referred.
I visited South Caucasus in early October as a member of the Troika, when the ENP Action Plans with all three countries were finalised.
They will now be officially signed and adopted in November.
I think that this is a basis for strong operational cooperation.
Before I talk about EU support, I think it is important that we also recall the impact of our relations with Russia.
During recent months, we have seen gas price increases for Moldova, import bans on Moldovan and Georgian wines and water, the de facto support given to Transnistria in the referendum, and the strong reaction to Georgia's expulsion of Russian military officers.
These issues were addressed with President Putin in Lahti and I personally raised some of these issues with Foreign Minister Lavrov only a few days ago in Moscow.
The forthcoming Foreign Ministers' Permanent Partnership Council on 3 November and the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki on 24 November will enable further discussions to be held on these issues.
Let me also mention that the OSCE played a very helpful role in refusing to observe and recognise the referendum in Transnistria and also in returning the Russian officers from Georgia to Russia.
I shall now say a few words specifically about Moldova and Transnistria, and then on Georgia.
I would also like to highlight the very successful EU Border Assistance Mission, EUBAM, which has played a very important role in introducing a new customs regime between Moldova and Ukraine.
This programme was allocated EUR 20 million for two years and over 70 customs officials and border guards were seconded from our Member States.
All major Transnistrian companies have now registered in Chisinau and are working under this new regime.
Combating customs fraud will thus crucially cut the illicit revenue currently enjoyed by the Transnistrian leadership.
While we are happy that high-level talks between Russia and Moldova have recently resumed, we have been concerned about Russia's support for the Transnistrian leadership.
In a recent statement, Minister Lavrov called for 'political recognition of the results' of the referendum in Transnistria, which neither the European Union nor the OSCE recognised. I think this could complicate the task of finding a solution to this conflict.
We are also worried about the insistence by Transnistria and Russia on the need for a so-called transit protocol between Moldova and Transnistria that would recognise the latter as an independent international economic actor.
This issue is the stumbling block in the settlement talks which resumed after a silence of more than six months, albeit not in the full 5+2 format, but with only mediators, with each of the two sides separately, in other words 5+1.
This approach is unacceptable, as we have made clear to Russia on several occasions.
More than that, developments on the ground, with all major Transnistrian companies now working legally with Chisinau, show that such an approach is increasingly out of touch with reality.
We were also worried that the new Ukrainian Government would change track on this issue.
I was very pleased when Prime Minister Yanukovich assured me of the ongoing support of the Ukrainian Government.
We will continue to stress the importance of Ukrainian cooperation at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki in a few days' time.
Some have pointed to the ongoing discussion on railway issues between Moldova and Ukraine as further proof that Ukraine might abandon its earlier position.
The facts, however, do not bear this out.
We therefore strongly encourage both sides to find a mutually advantageous solution to this situation as soon as possible.
Our presence on the ground through the EU Border Assistance Mission provides us with an excellent instrument for following the situation and giving advice and assistance to both sides.
Let me add that under the new ENP instrument, Moldova will see a substantial increase in our funding.
It will also receive a grant under the macro-financial assistance programme to help it address the shocks caused by increased energy prices and the Russian ban on Moldovan wines.
We are highly concerned about the crisis in relations between Georgia and Russia, especially the continuing tensions between the two countries.
We are particularly worried by the expulsion of large numbers of Georgians from Russian territory, which appears in direct contradiction to Russia's commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
I also raised this issue recently with Mr Lavrov.
Georgia also bears its share of responsibility.
During our recent visit to Georgia in the Troika mission, I urged President Saakashvili to display moderation and encouraged him to rebuild trust.
Let me say a final word on South Ossetia.
I think it is disappointing that the recent meeting of the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia was inconclusive.
We understand Georgia's wish to renew and review the Joint Control Commission's composition, but existing peace mechanisms should be fully utilised until new ones are in place and the recent Needs Assessment Study and the June 2006 international donors' conference show that there is scope for a constructive dialogue.
We are pleased that this rehabilitation programme is continuing despite the crisis.
We have made a significant financial contribution to assist a peaceful settlement, including a EUR 9.5 million economic rehabilitation programme in South Ossetia.
Funds for rehabilitation have also been earmarked under the new EC financial assistance programme for the period from 2007 to 2010.
I think the European Union as a whole has a very important role in supporting any peace settlement.
But the most immediate need is to get relations between Russia and Georgia back on a normal track, on a diplomatic track.
We will certainly continue our efforts to achieve that objective.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, tomorrow we shall be voting on the resolution on the Moldovan region of Transnistria.
We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe.
In September a so-called 'referendum' took place in the Moldovan region of Transnistria, aiming at the region's possible unification with the Russian Federation.
This referendum and its outcome were not accepted by the international community and the conflict between the separatist authority of Transnistria and the central government of Moldova has largely contributed to the instability of the whole country and its economic and social development.
Earlier this year we also witnessed the failure of negotiations concerning the status of Transnistria in the 5+2 format as the Transnistrian authorities withdrew from these negotiations.
We are also aware of the fact that the so-called Russian peacekeepers are still in Transnistria.
In this context, we, the European Parliament, should denounce the so-called referendum in the Transnistrian region, which contradicts the internationally recognised sovereignty and territorial integrity of Moldova and can be seen as provocation, which increases the existing tensions and jeopardises the chances for a peaceful settlement of the problem.
We should also call on Russia to discontinue its support for the Transnistrian regime, which threatens Moldova's territorial integrity, and to fulfil the OSCE Summit decision of 1999 to withdraw its troops and arms from the territory of Moldova.
We especially regret the lack of significant progress in the EU talks on visa facilitation and the readmission agreement with Moldova.
The Council and the Commission should speed up the procedure, leading to the conclusion of a visa facilitation agreement with Moldova and ensure its implementation, as the current situation is unfair and discriminatory when Transnistrian citizens holding Russian passports are benefiting from the possibility to travel to the EU more easily than Moldovans.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we are faced with a number of ongoing, frozen conflicts in the common neighbourhood which the European Union shares with Russia.
Unfortunately, it is apparent to us that, years on, we are nowhere nearer resolving them, despite the EU's commitment to a negotiated political solution in a multilateral framework.
We view recent developments in that region with great concern, since a possible escalation cannot be ruled out.
On 17 September, there was a referendum in Transnistria on separation from Moldova, while, last week, the tension between Georgia and Russia surrounding the status of South-Ossetia escalated into a diplomatic crisis of the first order.
Both events are incompatible with the commitment to finding a political solution to these conflicts within the framework of the OSCE.
I think that the EU should hold firm to a plan of negotiations in a multilateral framework whereby the territorial integrity of Moldova and Georgia should be taken as read.
We emphatically condemn unilateral steps, such as organising a referendum or so-called referendum, because we have not seen any evidence of a democratic plebiscite in a free and open environment.
The use of threatening political rhetoric back and forth, or the unilateral announcement of sanctions are just as counterproductive.
They do not bring us any closer to a solution and counteract the effort which the international community is making to encourage the parties to sing from the same hymn sheet.
It has to be clear to all players that a sustainable solution can only be based on a political dialogue, with respect for democracy in the countries and regions involved.
For the European Union, it is a necessary investment to give this process a shot in the arm.
The European Union cannot solve these conflicts on its own.
As long as we decide in favour of multilateral strategy, we can reasonably expect the other parties involved to move within these boundaries and to adhere to previous agreements, such as in Istanbul in 1999.
Moreover, we can expect Russia to exercise a certain degree of caution, since it plays a crucial role in each of these conflicts.
The active support Russia is giving the regime in Transnistria and the referenda, as well as the support to the separatist movement in South-Ossetia and Abkhazia do not, unfortunately, fall within this category.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) As Deputy Head of the Moldova Delegation, I keep a close eye on developments in this part of the world.
The unconstitutional and internationally unrecognised referendum on Transnistrian independence which was recently held in that province was a serious step backwards for all parties concerned.
On 10 October, Transnistria rejected a compromise plan put forward by the OSCE, under the leadership of the Belgian Foreign Minister, Karel de Gucht.
The proposed plan envisaged granting the whole of Transnistria a relatively independent or semi-autonomous status within a Moldovan Federation.
I personally regret the rejection of this compromise because an opportunity to create peace and stability throughout the whole of this unstable region has been lost.
Instead, the deadlock between Transnistria and Moldova will continue to threaten both political and economic stability in this part of Europe.
With the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007, the borders of the European Union will extend as far as Moldova, so it is in our vital interests to invest the necessary time, energy and commitment in future negotiations.
Finally, I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to bring their political clout to bear on fresh negotiations.
Likewise, I call on Tiraspol to sit back down at the negotiating table and put an end to its delaying tactics.
At the same time, I also call on Moscow to espouse more progressive policies in settling this dispute, because a more constructive approach on its part would demonstrate that Russia is serious about establishing a responsible and reliable partnership with the European Union.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, not long ago we were applauding the peaceful revolution in Georgia and encouraging its young leaders to establish true democracy in their country.
Today, as we know, Georgia is experiencing difficulties in resolving conflicts with its separatist regions, and the escalating provocations from both sides are certainly not helping to resolve those conflicts peacefully.
What is worse, armed intervention could embroil the entire Caucasus, which is something of which we are all conscious.
That is why we must strongly urge the Georgian authorities to take a conciliatory approach and to constructively relaunch the peace process in South Ossetia.
However, there are extenuating circumstances in Georgia: its neighbour, Russia, is not playing the conciliation game.
For example, when, in Lahti last week, he compared South Ossetia to Kosovo, Mr Putin was adding fuel to the flames in the Caucasus, at the very time when he was expected to re-establish trust by normalising relations with his neighbours in Georgia.
Whatever Russia may say, it certainly is involved in this conflict.
Did it not issue Russian passports to the Georgian population of South Ossetia?
How valid can a referendum be if 80% of the participants were Russian citizens?
How neutral can we expect the peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia to be when they are predominantly Russian?
I will not even mention the unilateral Russian embargo or the ongoing deportations of Georgians in Russia, which are evidence of a desire to destabilise Georgia.
So, then, the neighbourhood policy and greater cooperation with Russia are, of course, tools for us, but you will forgive me if I cannot share the Council's position on the replacement of the peace-keeping forces.
I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we really do need to ask ourselves how the neutrality and impartiality of these forces can be guaranteed.
We should perhaps - or should I say, definitely - be prepared to make a contribution, should it prove necessary, to the replacement of the peace-keeping forces.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, what is required above all else, when the security and stability of a country or region are at issue, is that all the parties concerned, with their various interests, should do nothing that might make the situation worse, and if the Moldovan constitution makes no provision for referendums, it goes without saying that any referendum that actually is carried out cannot be recognised.
That much is abundantly clear.
Since Transnistria has always been a part of the Republic of Moldova, it follows that it is absolutely justified to demand of our Russian partners - with whom relations are far from poor - that their troops should be withdrawn from the region.
If we do not want matters to get worse, it naturally follows that we must promote trade - and with trade, change - rather than imposing bans on exports or imports.
The Commission and the European Union have taken the line that we insist on the 5+2 negotiations being continued in full, or, indeed, on their resumption, and from this line we must not deviate.
Fair partnership - and I am talking here about ours with Russia - also involves being able to tell one's partner, to their face, with what one is happy and with what one is not.
It may well be that, in the past, thinking of certain of the European Union's own interests, we did not always do that with the necessary firmness.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union we believe in, the European Union of our dreams, the European Union the citizens of Europe want must surely be a Union that defends certain specific values, and does so on the international stage.
As a matter of principle, therefore, we must condemn Russia's behaviour towards Georgia in recent weeks.
I would like to call on all competent European Union bodies to make statements, take action in this matter and to defend Georgia's independence.
I also call on these bodies to stand up for the fundamental principles of international law, such as independence and non-interference in each other's affairs.
We are aware that Russia is inciting separatism in Georgia, but the events of the last two weeks are particularly worrying, as we have noted a tremendous increase in chauvinistic, nationalistic and anti-Georgian statement in Russia.
In the last few days, we have learnt that works by Georgian artists exhibited in Moscow are being damaged.
The hysterical tirades directed by the Moscow media against Georgians living in Russia mean that they do not feel safe on the territory of the Russian Federation.
I call on the European Union, and on this House, to show unequivocal support for an independent, self-governing Georgia, which has every right to feel safe in a united Europe.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
The tensions in the southern Caucasus serve only to strengthen the argument for the urgent opening of multilateral negotiations in order to find a solution to the issue of the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
The conciliatory message that the European Union has recently sent to the Russian Federation regarding stepping up relations on various levels is not, and must not be, separate from an invitation to dialogue and to implementing all possible measures to try to resolve the worst crisis of the post-Soviet era without causing casualties.
Mr Putin's statements on the alleged preparation of a Georgian military intervention, as well as the embargo on agricultural products from Georgia and Moldova and the interruption of key services, from transport to banking, cannot fail to affect the Georgian people, whether those who have emigrated to Russia, of whom a large proportion has been undeservedly and forcibly repatriated over the last few days, or those who live in Georgian territory and are often economically dependent on family members who have emigrated.
Europe must not confine itself to playing the role of arbiter in this matter.
Mr President, in 1996 I was a member of the Lithuanian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe when Russia made a solemn commitment to withdraw its troops from Moldova in 1997.
Therefore, 2007 offers us an opportunity to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of that unfulfilled European commitment by Russia - one of many, of course.
That could be a good time to write and publish a big book of Russia's unfulfilled international commitments.
That is my first proposal to this House as it strives to obtain new commitments.
Russia's policies in partitioning its smaller neighbours have caused loss and suffering to the people and several nations are still asking us to help.
Can we continue to utter empty mantras in the style of the United Nations, while washing our hands of the hordes of refugees expelled from Abkhazia by invading Russians?
It is worth noting here the small note in Security Council Resolution No 1666 of 31 March 2006, on the eventual changes in the mandate of the CIS peacekeeping force in Georgia.
In reality, the force is Russian and has little to do with peacekeeping, but is helping in the annexation of a population given en masse the passports of one foreign country before the land is subsequently annexed.
If you really want peace in that part of Europe, we need real, possibly European, peacekeepers in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The alternative should be to rename these current peacekeepers 'criminality keepers'.
That is my second proposal to Parliament: to make a choice between real peacekeepers and official 'criminality keepers'.
(DE) Mr President, there are people in Russia - officials in particular - who, if they are listening to us, will get the idea that all we in this House want to do this week is bait the Russian bear.
That is not what we want to do, but we do want to make it quite clear to Russia that we should try to resolve the problems that present themselves to us, ranging from energy to the neighbourhood we share, that we should do this together, and that Russia should confirm its commitment to multilateralism.
When criticising America, we are often united when it comes to the unilateralism of that country's actions, but, when a country takes action in its own backyard, it needs to do so multilaterally, and Russia has recently opted for a different approach, and that is absolutely unacceptable.

Firstly, we do, of course, need help from the countries involved.
As we said the last time we visited it, we would like to see Georgia sign the commitment to non-violence.
It is surely not enough to say 'we want to be able to defend ourselves', for that, of course, is something everyone is entitled to do.
Secondly, we would like to see a definite offer made as regards the reintegration into Georgian society of the people of South Ossetia, and of Abkhazia too, for, while we are committed to the concept of a single, undivided Georgia, we do believe that that has to involve specific things being offered to these sections of its population.
Even so, the main responsibility lies, just as it did before, with Russia.
I find it incomprehensible how Russia has still not yet grasped that you do not make friends by supporting small separatist movements, some of which have been infiltrated by criminals, but rather by helping your neighbours to maintain their stability, and that is something that Georgia would surely be equally willing to do.
What we absolutely must reject, though, is the expulsion of Georgians from Russia; Arguing along the lines of 'yes, but they're illegals' has a cynical ring to it.
Expelling the Georgians - especially at a time like this, considering the things that have happened - is every bit as inopportune in terms of timing as the energy price rises in Ukraine before the elections and in Belarus after them.
It is absolutely indefensible and unacceptable.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, South Ossetia is one of those extremely vexing 'frozen' conflicts, and I remember being occupied with it myself when I, Madam President-in-Office, was sitting exactly where you are sitting now, fully five years ago.
But that frozen conflict is now in danger of becoming a hot conflict.
There is an urgent need to calm things down, and my group backs the appeal to both Russia and Georgia to soften their language and their actions.
What has been done to Georgian citizens is wholly unacceptable, as is, of course, Russia's decision to cut all communications with Georgia.
That President Putin has warned of the danger of bloodshed in the presence of Mr Vanhanen, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, must have been deeply embarrassing and is, in any case, totally unacceptable; so is the fact that Russia continues to issue passports to South Ossetians.
That Georgia has threatened to resort to violence is also unacceptable.
If the EU is serious about this matter, then it should be prepared to replace the Russian peacekeepers if that becomes necessary.
This is no light commitment and it should be weighed up very seriously.
But first let us use all the multilateral and European peace mechanisms that are in place.
(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking as a member of this House's EU/Moldova group, I would like to return to that problem and make it very plain that this conflict is not about minorities.
The social system in the Republic of Moldova is open both politically and socially, and characterised by co-existence and tolerance.
If conflicts with minorities are advanced as an explanation, then that is done only with the intention of legitimising support for a Stalinist regime, something that is - and I want to impress this on the Russian Government and on President Putin - both politically problematic and highly dubious.
The conflict over Transnistria is a conflict between Russia and the EU.
I do not believe that peace will return to the region unless the troops are withdrawn, and so the Commission and the Council must exert much more pressure on the Russian Government to get it to do precisely that.
The conflict in Moldova must not be sacrificed for the sake of our dealings with Russia over energy.
(PL) Mr President, the situation in South Ossetia and Transdnistria makes it abundantly clear that Russia has not stopped thinking in terms of spheres of influence.
Sixteen years have gone by, but Russia still has not become au fait with the need to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of independent countries along its borders.
It resorts to trickery, spying, energy blackmail and to handing out Russian passports, in order to weaken Georgia and Moldova, its independent neighbours, and deprive them of parts of their territory.
Contrary to our expectations, Russia is not playing a stabilising role in the region. The opposite is actually the case.
The more political power Russia wields, the more conflicts, tension and even wars there are.
Does all this amount to a policy that is acceptable to the European Union?
Is it possible to develop an unconditional strategic partnership with a country that stoops to these methods?
I trust that this is not the case, and therefore urge the House to support the joint resolution, together with the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
(DE) Mr President, the Republic of Moldova would, in nine and a half weeks' time, be becoming a Member State of the European Union, had it not been for the Hitler-Stalin Pact under which it was separated from Romania, and that shows just how close to us this whole business is.
Georgia - which is a member of the Council of Europe - fell victim to Russian or Soviet colonialism on two occasions, the first time under the Tsars, and the second in the 1920s, when Soviet troops smothered the nations of the Caucasus at birth.
What we have today is a post-colonial situation in which Russia is unwilling to make restitution for what it did to the region in the days when it was a colonial power or when it was the totalitarian Soviet Union, and is instead engaged in a post-colonial policy of dominating nations and extorting their raw materials from them, which involves it in either exploiting conflicts between nationalities or, to some extent, artificially creating them.
It is for that reason that there is only one response; as Mr Landsbergis said, we have to be prepared to have a structured, peace-keeping presence - be it international or European - wherever in the world conflict arises, whether in Transnistria or Abkhazia, South Ossetia or Chechnya, so that the situation can be brought under international control once and for all.
If Russia has an interest in allowing transparency to prevail, then that is the right solution, but that is not what Russia wants.
What Russia wants, now as in the past, is for its policy of dominance to be carried on in the shadows, and that is why I, too, find it regrettable that this report is being held after the summit rather than having been held before it, as we had wanted.
What Mr Putin wanted was for the spotlight to be upon him as he nurtured illusions, and, now, in the shadow of the summit, we are sweeping up the pieces.
All I can do is to appeal to the Council and the Commission to at length get round to talking about Russian policy in an unambiguous, frank, and rational way with explicit reference to human rights.
Let no bones be made about the fact that that sort of forthright talk is the only language Russia understands. We have here not only enough material for a white paper on Russia's broken promises, as Mr Landsbergis said, but also enough for one on the West's self-deception.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the Transnistria question is largely a question of the European Union's relations with Russia.
The problem is in stalemate, but it is in Russia's power to solve it, but if it is to do so, it must implement the promise it made at the OSCE Istanbul summit in 1999; that is, to withdraw its troops from Moldovan territory.
This is something it should have done as long ago as 2002.
Good friends must be bold and forthright.
In Russia such friends are valued.
We here have been fearful and have beaten around the bush.
Thus, as of 1 January we will acquire a serious source of instability right beside the European Union.
I would like to reiterate three facts about Transnistria.
First of all, the Transnistrian regime does not seek independence, but rather union with Russia, which lies 800 km away.
The region has belonged to Moldova and Ukraine, but never to Russia.
Secondly, the inhabitants of Transnistria are not a uniform ethnic group.
Most of them are Moldovans, making up 40 percent of the population, with Ukrainians at nearly 28 percent, and the Russian ethnic group occupying third place.
Third, the inhabitants of Transnistria would certainly enjoy more democracy and freedom under the government in Chisinau than they do at present.
Chisinau has never persecuted the non-Moldovan population of Transnistria.
Russia will take no action without pressure from us.
We should not be afraid of exerting pressure.
And our relations with Russia should be a two-way street that is mutually beneficial for both sides.
We may need Russian energy, but Russia needs favours from us too, not to mention our European market.
It is time to remind Russia of what we have given, and to demand favours in return.
Finally, the 5+2 negotiations must continue at all costs.
We have a good resolution, so let us adopt it.
Mr President, in my opinion, among all the reasonable political considerations referred to in the current text, there is one significant omission: the real-life situations of the individuals living in the areas concerned.
Those condemning the issue of Russian passports for the residents of these regions would do well to remind themselves of the circumstances under which these people found themselves as citizens or non-citizens of newly independent states formed from the former Soviet republics.
These are republics whose borders, in the case of the Caucasus, were arbitrarily drawn by Stalin, or, in the case of Transnistria, were changed under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
After the dissolution of the federal state, the USSR, no sequential transition period was set out during which people could have resolved issues such as family reunification, citizenship, and so on. These people mostly need Russian passports to travel to Russia, not to the EU, as was claimed.
. - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia's desire to influence the fate of those of its neighbouring states that have turned to the Western model of development, is apparent both in its intervention in Ukraine's internal affairs and in the case of Moldova and Georgia.
The European Union has an interest in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict between Russia and Georgia.
To that end, firstly, since CIS peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia are not able to carry out their task, they should be replaced by international peace-keepers.
Secondly, Russia ought to refrain from military exercises in the close vicinity of Georgia's territory.
Thirdly, there must be an immediate end to violations of the rights of Georgia's citizens, which are beginning to verge on ethnic cleansing, and also the blockade on Georgian goods.
Fourthly, respecting the integrity of Georgia's territory, the lawfulness of the issue of Russian passports in Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be reviewed, in order to prevent a repetition of the Transnistria scenario.
Finally, both states should refrain from activities and statements which might foster any worsening of relations.
Mr President, as far as the background to this debate is concerned, we need a very strong EU commitment in the form of peacekeeping forces to try to prevent the spread of those dangerous conflicts.
Let us be clear: these quasi-breakaway regions, or frozen conflicts, are being systematically used as leverage by the Russian Government to retain its influence over the post-Soviet neighbourhood.
Without the continued presence of Russian troops - as has been stated by my colleague, Mrs Mikko - the conflicts we now have to deal with would probably have disappeared.
Part of the problem seems to be fear of the possible spreading of 'Rose revolutions' and fear of genuine democratic change in Russia itself, which is long overdue.
We therefore need to react to acts by the Russian Government which defy all norms of international behaviour, such as cutting off communications, economic blockades and launching waves of xenophobia in Russia itself.
The EU of 25 should declare such acts absolutely unacceptable, especially by the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council of Europe.
In the European Parliament's resolution we call on Russia finally to accept the new realities that have emerged after the end of the Cold War and to stop thinking and operating in terms of exclusive zones of influence.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to speak about Moldova.
Moldova is a country whose problems are due to historical factors, its geopolitical position and its current situation, which has arisen as a result of the balance of power within the country as well as external influences.
It should be clearly understood that the problems relating to Moldova's security in its broadest sense, and also to its development, cannot be resolved by Moldova's efforts alone.
A joint effort is needed, involving not only Moldova's neighbours, such as Ukraine and Romania, but also vital aid from the European Union and the United States.
Of course, Russian goodwill is essential, too.
Clearly, the imposition of an embargo on the import of agricultural produce and the problems concerning the energy supply are clearly related to Moldova's positive stance with respect to integration with the European Union.
Therefore, we cannot abandon Moldova.
Morally, it is entitled to our aid and we can certainly afford to provide it.
(PL) Mr President, I fully support the draft resolution drawn up by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group concerning Transdnistria, which is part of Moldova.
I wish to express my admiration for the Georgian nation, which desires to independently decide the direction of its own foreign policy.
In this matter, it should and must rely on the solidarity of the Member States of the European Union.
The Georgian authorities are rightly demanding that the rights of their small nation be respected by the large Russian nation.
However, it would be good, and here I differ somewhat from the previous speakers, if these authorities also turned their attention to upholding the rights of minorities within their own country.
I have in mind religious minorities, for example.
Allow me to refer to the recent attacks on Catholics in Tiblisi.
There is no other way to describe the assault by 60 individuals on a brand new church built to serve the Assyrian, that is to say, the Chaldean Catholic community.
This assault was the work of members of the Orthodox Church, who mostly identify with Russian culture.
In another area of Tiblisi, members of the Orthodox Church are putting pressure on the authorities to prevent the opening of a Catholic church.
Sadly, there have been many instances of religious intolerance in Georgia in recent years.
The victims have included not only Catholics but also Baptists, Pentecostalists, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
I trust the Georgian authorities will take strong action against these acts of violence that are damaging Georgia's reputation on the international scene.
I am sure that most political groups in this House will be of a similar opinion.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, firstly may I say thank you for this wide-ranging debate.
We have been talking in this Chamber today since the morning on relations between the European Union and Russia.
The sheer scope of these relations is reflected in the fact that now even at this point in the proceedings it is EU-Russia relations that have figured prominently in Members' speeches.
Relations between the European Union and Russia have a valuable feature: these days we are able to discuss everything round the table, including the difficult areas and the commitments made by Russia.
The next excellent opportunity for such discussions is in November, when the Permanent Partnership Council meeting of EU and Russian Foreign Ministers is held, and after that at the end of November at the EU-Russia Summit.
The summit held between the EU and Ukraine the day after tomorrow in Helsinki will undoubtedly feature talks on these issues.
As I said in my opening speech, Union action on Moldova and Transnistria is specifically intended to aid and firm up Moldovan unity.
In this the European Neighbourhood Policy is a crucial instrument.
As part of this cooperation we in the Council are expecting a Commission proposal to begin talks on visa flexibility before the end of this year.
Relations between Georgia and Russia were last discussed yesterday on the COPS Committee with reference to the proposals by the Special Representative to find new means of supporting a peaceful solution to this difficult situation in the best possible way.
Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that dialogue between Georgia and Russia is to get under way, as the countries' Foreign Ministers intend to meet in Moscow at the beginning of November.
That is a very positive start to what will hopefully be the resumption of talks.
The basic principle that the European Union will endeavour to promote a peaceful solution to the crisis between Georgia and Russia and can do so in many ways applies to this crisis in just the same way as it does to many other crises around the world.
Unless the parties themselves actually commit to a peaceful solution, however, they cannot be forced to do so from the outside.
Mr President, that was a very interesting discussion on both subjects.
I thank Members for their comments, which we shall, of course, take into account as much as we can.
I think Parliament could enhance its efforts and thus complete and complement what we are doing concerning Moldova, with its counterparts in the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.
We need to continue to encourage Moldova to press on with key reforms on democracy, the rule of law and human rights and to improve the business climate.
We must help Moldova to become more attractive for the population, even in Transnistria.
With regard to the question of macro-financial assistance, we have just prepared a package of EUR 45 million that will be allocated to Moldova, because it is highly important that we give them special assistance.
Let me say that since 1991 the whole assistance programme has amounted to some EUR 230 million.
Our annual assistance budget has increased over the last few years and will increase further under the ENPI.
On visa facilitation for Moldova, we are just working towards the proposals for negotiating directives and also for the readmission agreements.
We have encouraged the Member States to set up a joint visa application centre in Chisinau.
Once established, this should be an effective facilitation mechanism for Moldovan citizens, who would then no longer need to travel to neighbouring countries to apply for visas.
Let me also say that if there is a possibility of coming up with a mandate at the end of this year, then the visa fee would stay at EUR 35 and not go up to EUR 60, which would be very important for the very poor people of Moldova.
On Georgia, we had a lengthy discussion with Foreign Minister Lavrov.
The most important thing is that both sides tone down their public rhetoric as a first step and then both sides try to come up with diplomatic dialogues -again, back to normal.
The Georgian leadership must avoid any actions that could heighten tension.
That is what we told Mr Saakashvili.
With the help of our special representatives and, of course, all of us, we hope that the situation will return to normal.
Export of toxic waste to Africa - Use of criminal law to protect the environment (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the
statement by the Council and the Commission on the export of toxic waste to Africa,
oral question to the Council by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on environmental protection: combating crime, criminal offences and penalties B6-0438/2006) and
oral question to the Commission by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on environmental protection: combating crime, criminal offences and penalties B6-0439/2006)
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is very concerned about the environmental disaster that came to light some time ago in the Ivory Coast in connection with the vessel Probo Koala.
As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland believes that it is very important that this regrettable event be looked into thoroughly.
Once again the world is made aware of the serious threats posed by moving waste to the developing countries.
This is a problem that has to be addressed through decisive action.
The European Union has stated that it is prepared, in collaboration with the United Nations, to help protect human health and the environment wherever the effects of the incident are particularly serious.
Recent events in West Africa have also been a reminder to us of how important it is to implement agreements on transboundary movements of waste and the supervision of waste management effectively.
These are essentially the Basel Convention and the amendment to it tabled in 1995, the Marpol Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, and local maritime conservation agreements.
The amendment to the Basel Convention banned the export of hazardous wastes from EU and OECD countries, as well as Liechtenstein, to other countries.
It is obviously just as important to monitor compliance with these agreements.
The Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes is to be held at the end of November in Nairobi.
The European Union's position at this conference is at present being drafted by the Council in respect of all the issues on the agenda.
These include illegal movements of waste, the unloading of ships, funding the agreement, synergies between the waste and chemicals clusters and monitoring the strategic plan to implement the Convention.
Part of this preparation work took the form of a wide-ranging debate by the Environment Council on 23 October, that is to say the day before last, at the end of which the Chairman gave his conclusions on the EU's preparations for the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention.
These take the view that it is important to intervene decisively and effectively in illegal transboundary movements of hazardous wastes.
It is important that, in addition to the countries that have now ratified the amendment regarding the export ban on hazardous waste, as many other countries as possible do likewise, so that it might enter into force worldwide as soon as possible.
As you know, the ban is already in force in all the EU Member States, because it was implemented in its entirety with the Regulation on movement of waste.
Almost all the EU countries have also ratified the amendment.
The reformed EU Regulation on the movement of waste, which comes into force next July, also contains provisions which may help improve cooperation on the implementation of the Regulation at both Member State and EU level.
A directive has also been issued on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, compliance with which may also be relevant to the Probo Koala case.
In a debate the day before last, Ministers of the Environment also highlighted the fact that effective implementation of existing legislation is a primary aim of the EU.
Crucial to the prevention of illegal movements of waste is increased harmonisation of laws on the environment and navigation, especially at international level, and enhanced cooperation between authorities.
What is most important is that all types of waste are treated in a way that is environmentally acceptable, regardless of where this takes place.
This must be the priority goal too when vessels are scrapped.
The Chairman's conclusions also stressed that developing countries need external help in their endeavours to implement the Basel Convention and manage waste in a way that is environmentally acceptable.
Developing countries also need to make waste management part of their strategies for reducing poverty and for sustainable development.
At the Environment Council meeting the Presidency also met a delegation from the Ivory Coast, which gave an update on the situation.
The magnitude of the catastrophe is staggering: in addition to the loss of many human lives, there is a huge number of urgent health problems.
The disaster also has major implications for the ecology, livelihoods, human habitation and community action.
At present, the key areas of importance are the cleaning up of polluted areas and sewage networks and attending to the damage caused to people and businesses.
In the Ivory Coast an international and national report are being compiled on what took place, including a criminal investigation.
Moreover, in certain countries, such as the Netherlands and Estonia, a criminal investigation has been started with a view to taking a thorough look at the circumstances connected with the Probo Koala case.
I will now move on to deal with the oral question put by Karl-Heinz Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
The Member States of the European Union think it important that laws and cooperation should be developed within the EU framework to prevent and investigate environmental crimes and enforce penal responsibility.
Environmental crimes are by nature international, because the effects of illegal emissions extend a long way across national frontiers.
As the honourable Member says in his question, the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 13 September 2005, however, overturned the Council Framework Decision of 27 January 2003 on the protection of the environment through criminal law.
On 25 November 2005 the Commission submitted a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council on the consequences of the judgment passed by the Court of Justice.
The Court's judgment and the Commission's communication were discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs held in Vienna in January 2006 and they were examined by the Council in Brussels on 21 February this year.
In these discussions the Commission said it wanted to think more about how to proceed with regard to the framework decisions taken earlier by the Council, decisions that might need re-examining in the light of the decision by the Court of Justice.
This line of reasoning would also apply to the Framework Decision that was overturned by the Court already referred to.
That being the case, the Council is awaiting a reaction from the Commission.
It may deliver an amended version of the proposal it put forward in 2001 and of the proposal for a directive it amended in 2002 or it may put forward an entirely new proposal
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, the recent incident of the dumping of toxic waste in CÃŽte d'Ivoire has drastic consequences.
At least 10 people died and thousands were poisoned and needed hospital treatment.
Although the actual circumstances under which this repulsive environmental crime was committed have not yet been clarified, there is now an even more urgent need for the strict application of the ban on exports of dangerous waste to Africa.
The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, the United Nations and the authorities in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, is seeking in various ways for the damage caused to be restored and for suitable action to be taken to combat the illegal activities which may have taken place.
When the incident occurred, representatives of the Commission - and special teams from the Member States - visited the scene in order to assist the victims and help to protect the natural environment.
The Commission is closely monitoring developments in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and is in constant contact with the country's authorities.
On Monday I and the Presidency met the delegation from CÃŽte d'Ivoire, which included three ministers.
The institutions and the Member States of the European Union need to examine every possible means of supporting the victims in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and of doing the best they can to eliminate the pollution.
Criminal investigations are being carried out at the moment in various Member States, with which we are in contact.
I personally, following the return of the Probo Koala to the European Union, went to the port of Paldiski in Estonia on 28 September in order to support these investigations and obtain the latest information.
If we look beyond the incident in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, we shall see that there is a serious vacuum in compliance by the Member States with the European Union regulation on movements of waste.
This regulation contains clear rules banning exports of dangerous waste to developing countries.
These rules are to become even stricter and, as of July next year, the Member States will be obliged to conduct on-site controls and inspections and to cooperate in the event of illegal movements of waste.
However, the mere fact that rules exist does not mean a thing if they are not also correctly applied in practice.
The legal loopholes must be plugged with strict complementary measures pertaining to its proper application.
Environmental crime is one of the most serious problems which the Community is called upon to combat.
The environmental damage which may be caused is huge.
It is often part of international organised crime, which makes it difficult but imperative to stamp out.
Provision for effective sanctions, including criminal sanctions, is necessary for the proper application of Community environmental legislation.
That is precisely why urgent action is needed at Community level.
In 2001, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on environmental protection through penal law.
The objective of this proposal was, on the one hand, the introduction throughout the Community of a minimum number of criminal environmental offences and, on the other hand, the punishment of such infringements with effective criminal sanctions in all the Member States.
It is a sad fact that the Council did not adopt the Commission proposal.
The proposal was based on Article 175 of the Treaty and was to have been approved under the codecision procedure.
The Council did not agree with the legal basis and decided to issue a framework decision on the basis of the third pillar, rather than the directive we had proposed.
In the opinion of the European Commission, this choice of means was not legally correct and would have made it impossible to control the transposition into national law of the framework decision and the application of it by the Member States.
In clear opposition to the Council, the European Parliament fully supported the Commission proposal and also supported the Commission in the matter when it was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
I wish to highlight the particular importance of this good cooperation between our institutions and I trust that we shall continue in this way as the matter develops.
With the ruling by the Court of Justice, it has now been clarified that measures of a penal nature needed in order to safeguard the effective application of environmental policy may be adopted within the framework of the first pillar.
The Council's framework decision infringed the Community's powers on the basis of the Treaty and had to be reversed.
The European Commission is particularly satisfied with this ruling by the Court.
This is not a ruling regulating a simple technical point; it is of decisive importance in clarifying the rules of the Treaty as far as the dividing line between the first and third pillars is concerned.
It has major institutional repercussions, because it clarifies that the measures at issue must be taken under the codecision procedure, which means the full participation of the European Parliament.
Similarly, within the framework of the first pillar, national application measures come under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which does not apply to third pillar measures.
A directive on environmental protection through penal law - within the framework of the first pillar - will provide better environmental protection and, at the same time, is a more democratic method in the legislative procedure.
Unfortunately, in the meantime, valuable time has been lost.
Environmental crimes are still being committed and we must adopt the necessary legal measures to combat them.
We have analysed and discussed in the Commission the various options for following up the Court ruling.
We examined two options in particular: for the Commission 2001 proposal to stay as it is and for us to call on the other institutions to continue the codecision procedure or for a new Commission proposal to be submitted.
We preferred the second option, in order to take account of the Court ruling.
The initial proposal dates from 2001, since when numerous changes have been made to environmental legislation; consequently, the proposal needs to be adapted accordingly.
Finally, there have been new developments in the field of European cooperation on penal law matters, which also need to be taken into account in the proposal.
We must ensure that the proposal is in keeping with other penal acts adopted at European level.
Today we are at the state of preparing the new proposal for a directive on environmental protection through penal law.
The first step was, as I said, to examine in detail the Court ruling and its repercussions and for a detailed comparison to be made of the various acts which already apply.
We then prepared an impact study comparing the pros and cons of the various options.
Following that, the proposal will be finalised and I hope that it will be approved before the end of 2006.
author. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the dumping of toxic waste on CÃŽte d'Ivoire is not only scandalous, but also a truly revolting act, and we are, of course, at liberty to do no more than commiserate with the victims and lament the serious injuries caused to people, but if we do not, in the same breath, ask questions as to what lies behind this, that is no more than hypocritical, and you can count me out.
That is why I want there to be no doubt about the fact that this is a humanitarian and environmental disaster and scandal.
I never cease to be astonished that, while we in this House have introduced the 'name and shame' principle to apply to others, for example to those engaged in the production of meat, so that, if someone misbehaves, his name is made known and appears in the newspapers, the same does not happen with the Member States of the EU, and that is most remarkable.
The President-in-Office of the Council did, of course, put these things in their proper chronological order, while it was Commissioner Dimas who explained why Europe's legislation does not work, the actual reason being that the Council is too timid, and when I say that I certainly do not mean the President-in-Office or her country, but I do mean to say that, in matters affecting more than one country, one must - as she has rightly recognised - summon up the nerve to take cross-border action with the aim of prosecuting and punishing offences.
If, then, the Commission makes a proposal to that effect, whilst the Council is graciously pleased to cast doubt on the legal basis for it, and both the Commission and this House are subject to it, since the Council, with its blocking minority, does not allow the law to come into effect, that is something that a representative of the people, that is to say one of those who are meant to keep an eye on what governments are doing, cannot but find extremely vexatious.
That must not be allowed to happen, and there must be no more timidity from the Council in this matter.
I really do implore you to tell your colleagues that the chairman of the committee is very angry, for complaints after the event are of no avail if we have not done our homework beforehand - which we have, yet you have, so to speak, drawn a line right through it.
That is not acceptable.
I think the Council would do better in future to concern itself once more with the transposition of European regulations.
I have now been a Member of this House for a very long time, and in that time we have discussed and adopted a very large number of things, but when it comes to actually implementing them, we seem to lose our nerve.
I live on the border with a neighbouring country, that loveable place called the Netherlands, and it took us an incredibly long time to come to an agreement as to how we might catch criminals.
We have, fortunately, moved on from that, but, where the prosecution of waste crime is concerned, we have not yet emerged from Noah's Ark, and that, Madam President-in-Office, is something you must not be content with.
You need to use the last months of your presidency to get seriously stuck in to supporting the Commissioner and motivating him to do something about this.
There are many areas in which implementation and transposition are lacking.
I would very much like to know whether the country in which the toxic waste was dumped actually gave its consent to that being done, for if it did not, this poisonous stuff ought not to have been brought there in the first place.
There are so many rules and regulations applicable to this, and all that is needed is for us to implement them with courage and understanding.
It is also worthy of note, by the way, that this is a scandal not only as regards health and the environment, but also in terms of competition.
If we do not close this loophole in our own laws and in the Basle Convention, we will thereby be encouraging people who are less than particular about compliance with the law to make the contamination of the environment an exportable commodity, and to do so is hypocrisy, for while we in Europe talk about our high standards, we also open up any number of loopholes that make it possible for this stuff to be exported, and it is Commissioner Dimas - the poor chap - and, with him, the Commission, who has to carry the can for it, even though I have to tell the President-in-Office that the Commission, in this instance, is quite utterly blameless.
Our two institutions were on the right track.
We would ask you to act on the suggestions that the Commission and this House have made in this matter, for they are good ones.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Ivory Coast is an unstable country that has been made more unstable by environmental crime which has flowed from our continent down to Africa; with a Dutch ship and Dutch port authorities, a Greek-owned ship flying the Panamanian flag, then Ivorian companies and trucks dumping petrochemicals, killing - according to the United Nations - 12 people, and resulting in 104 000 people - again according to the United Nations - having medical care needs.
That ship unloaded 500 tonnes of chemical waste into trucks which dumped it in 15 separate sites around Abidjan, a city of 5 million people.
The United Nations Environment Programme has said that this is clearly a crime, although they say they do not yet know who was responsible, or the actual nature of that crime.
What we do know is that the Basel Convention should have stopped this crime and has failed to do so, and we need to know why.
The Ivory Coast is a long way away; most countries in Africa do not have strong laws to protect human and environmental health from the effects of hazardous waste, but that is no reason for us here in Strasbourg to walk away from this case and its lessons.
We want safe disposal, not toxic parcel-passing.
We want - and I say this directly to you, Commissioner - those countries that have not yet ratified that convention, to ratify it; they include Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta and Slovenia.
I hope you will pursue them and I hope the Council will pursue them, too.
Crime and responsibility and judgment are matters for the courts, but investigation and the plugging of legal loopholes are our responsibility; so is helping ACP countries to meet high standards in hazardous waste disposal; so is helping the victims of these appalling events - we think particularly of the children in the Ivory Coast who have been made to suffer because of them; so is ensuring that the Commission and the Dutch authorities and the EEA and the Government of the Ivory Coast all do their best to identify and pursue the perpetrators of this crime.
If the law is defective, then it must be amended.
If the law is adequate, then it must be enforced.
We know, though, that the law is flouted in too many cases.
We know that it is too easy to avoid the cost of responsible safe disposal by dumping, by going outside OECD countries and by using national and international cowboys, and that is what we must ensure is brought to an end.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament warmly endorses the views expressed by the previous two speakers.
How is it possible that the Proba Koala was not stopped from causing so much pollution?
Although this incident should have set all the red lights flashing, the Dutch Government, which should ultimately carry the can, is instead washing its hands in legal innocence.
It refuses to honestly admit to mistakes, is reluctant to set up a fund for the victims in Ivory Coast, is passing the buck, and is refusing to take moral and financial responsibility.
This is how the disappointing conduct of the Dutch Government can be summed up.
That is why I would ask the Commission whether it is prepared to bring pressure to bear on the Netherlands to grant legal support to Ivory Coast and also to ensure that, in consultation with the UN, an emergency fund is set up for the victims of this disaster.
My African parliamentary counterparts have the feeling that the Netherlands and Europe, despite the Basel Convention, failed to guard them from this criminal behaviour.
It is apparently acceptable to use Africa as a dumping ground.
This creates a sense of inferiority which undermines a credible partnership between Africa and Europe, and has dealt our relations a huge blow.
What steps do the Finnish Presidency and the Commission intend to take in the direction of Ivory Coast and the African Union?
Is the Commission prepared to draft proposals for measures to put an end to this dumping if possible, and where rules apply, to get them implemented?
Is the Commission prepared to draw up a black list, annually, of countries and transnational companies that are involved in the illegal dumping of chemical waste in developing countries?
Are the Commission and Council prepared to make legislative proposals in order to plug the loopholes in the Basel Convention, among other things, with the obligation on ships leaving Europe to leave their bilge water with the responsible authorities in the last EU port at which they call?
Finally, is the Commission prepared to take the necessary steps to assist developing countries in the identification of harmful substances and to guarantee that bilge water that is produced at sea is processed safely?
I count on the Commission's support and I hope that the Council will call the Netherlands to account about its responsibility; the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to do the same with the Council.
We have had plenty of fine words, now we want to see them translated into practice, and the laws enforced.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) This year, the European Union reviewed the Sustainable Development Strategy, which was adopted in 2001 and enhanced with an external dimension in Barcelona in 2002.
The European Union's cooperation policy in support of development enables poverty to be fought and developing countries gradually integrated into the global economy.
How do we pursue these objectives?
What we want is the growth of developing countries, environmental protection and reduction of the greenhouse effect, but what do we do to this end?
Due to toxic waste pollution in Ivory Coast, 85 000 people suffered ill-health and eight died.
Toxic substances were shipped from Amsterdam by the Dutch company Trafigura Beheer BV.
They, in Amsterdam, were aware of the waste's toxic nature; nevertheless, due to high costs, the cheap alternative of disposal in Ivory Coast was chosen.
Most African countries have no regulations concerning the protection of the environment against hazardous waste.
Used computers are stored in Nigeria, radioactive waste in Somalia and chlorine in Cameroon, despite the regulations adopted by the EU in 1994 and 1997 to prohibit the export of waste.
In 2002, this House approved the Directive on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law at its first reading.
However, the first reading was also the last.
We must therefore resume debate on the Directive as soon as possible.
The Commission and the Netherlands must investigate the case of Ivory Coast, find the perpetrators, eliminate the effects and pay compensatory damages to the victims.
Without serious measures the EU development cooperation policy for the support and sustainable development of developing countries will be hard to implement, and the EU stands to lose face.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) It is a tragedy that has struck CÃŽte d'Ivoire, and we all express our sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the criminal behaviour engaged in by European companies.
The victims must be given all the support that can be offered to them as events unfold.
Ever since 1997, we have had a ban on exports of hazardous waste to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
It is time to ensure that it is properly implemented.
It is unacceptable that the Dutch authorities should not have taken responsibility when they had the chance to stop the vessel.
All credit to Estonia, which did what needed to be done.
I wish to thank Commissioner Dimas for quickly having realised how serious the situation was.
A proposal by the Commission is now needed quickly in the interests of more stringent compliance with the rules.
We need to make sure that every time someone undertakes to transport hazardous material, there is someone to take personal responsibility and to sign an attestation of liability.
The board of directors and managing director must also be given greater personal responsibility.
Otherwise, traditions with unclear and complicated conditions of liability will make it difficult to get to grips with irresponsible transporters and shipowners.
Africa has suffered enough under colonialism and slavery and from the exploitation of its natural resources.
If we are to call ourselves civilised, we must now put a stop to this latest form of neo-colonialism whereby we dump our waste in poorer countries.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) My group strongly endorses all that has been said so far, as well as the resolution that draws attention to the toxic waste scandal involving the Proba Koala in Ivory Coast, which has, so far, claimed dozens of lives and as a result of which tens of thousands of people were hospitalised; the implications for the environment and public health are as yet incalculable.
There is still much uncertainty as to what will happen with the poison and the contaminated crew.
Scandalous practices of this kind that show no respect for the environment or citizens, and whereby governments and parties responsible, consciously or unconsciously, wash their hands of their obligations, must at any rate be addressed at every possible level.
Member States, in this case the Netherlands, must be called to account.
My observer, who travelled to Estonia on my behalf, totally agrees with Commissioner Dimas when he says that this is only the tip of the iceberg.
This type of toxin should never have left the European Union in the first pace, and European and international rules have been flouted.
Having been denied the opportunity to speak with the crew of the Probo Koala on several occasions, despite prior permission, I can only conclude that various authorities are playing a very underhand game with human lives.
Transparency is vital to the public.
Tough tit-for-tat policy is necessary in order to prevent, or discourage, repetition.
I would argue in favour of drawing up a black list of waste dumpers and publicising agreements concluded with developing countries in the area of waste processing.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I concur with the views of all previous speakers.
What came to pass in Ivory Coast with the waste from the ship Proba Koala is appalling and should never have happened.
What is beyond doubt is that this involved the illegal transport of waste.
The Basel Convention contains an express ban on the transport of harmful waste to non-OECD countries, which has thus been flouted.
That the adherence to current legislation concerning the transport of waste substances is leaving a great deal to be desired comes as no surprise.
Random tests in Great Britain and France show that rules are flouted in 75% to 100% of all waste transports.
For the European Parliament, whilst effective enforcement and stricter controls were a tough bargaining point during the negotiations in the run-up to the new resolution on the transport of waste substances, our wishes have only partly been granted.
At the moment, we are not so desperate for fresh rules or a European minimum penalty for infringement, as Commissioner Dimas suggests.
What we need first of all is the enforcement of existing rules.
The Commission and Member States would do well to do something about this once and for all.
(DE) Mr President, we will soon be getting back several thousand tonnes of contaminated material along with the 500 tonnes illegally dumped in Africa, so that many times the original amount of toxic waste will be finding its way back to Europe, and this is something for which preparations need to be made.
Generally speaking, what is known as the Basle Convention appears to be working reasonably well.
Officially, we are told that there has been a considerable reduction in exports of toxic waste to Africa, but that is contradicted by spot checks carried out in European ports, in which half of all the declarations of the non-toxicity of loads of waste turned out to be false, and so what is called for in this area, if the problem of the black market in toxic waste is to be got under control, is more checks and more cooperation.
We will also have to grapple with the problems surrounding the burgeoning trade in electrical waste and maritime wrecks, for which as yet no international conventions exist.
In order to deal the ultimate blow to the waste mafia, we will no doubt have to have a blacklist of the businesses that are involved in schemes of this kind.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this toxic waste affair is certainly criminal - it is as if the South was the North's dustbin.
And if we call it a crime, there must be guilty parties and punishments, but so far impunity and apathy are winning the day.
It is true that the EU has legislation on the transport of toxic waste - the export of such waste has been banned since 1997, under the Basel Convention - but up to now this ban has been systematically flouted.
This laissez-faire attitude is criminal, and the dead of Abidjan are its victims.
The Union now needs to act, and act fast, to put a stop to the irresponsibility and the impunity.
It must enforce the existing legislation, in particular the directive of July 2006 that requires the Member States to establish inspection networks.
It must strengthen this legislation where necessary, to enable fast and effective sanctions, as both the Commission and the European Parliament have been demanding since 2001.
Finally, it must help countries in Africa to draw up protective legislation.
Commissioner, we support your proactive statements, but we now have to move on to concrete action.
That is what we expect from the Council, in particular.
(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, what a mish-mash!
The few citizens who take an interest in our debates will find it very difficult to understand why, this afternoon, we are mixing up a debate on pollution in Ivory Coast with another on a judgment that tramples over the subsidiarity principle.
The fact that the judgment of 13 September 2005 was issued on the subject of an environmental directive does not change the fact that it is actually worded as a judgment on the principle of the communitisation of criminal law.
This is tantamount to a constitutional revolution, because, as we know, at least nine other competences are in the process of being absorbed by the European Union, with no treaty, including criminal law on immigration and intellectual property law.
There certainly is pollution, ladies and gentlemen - the Court of Justice's judicial pollution of the European treaties.
In this confused and ill-thought-out judgment, there are no textual references and no clear legal principles.
Far-fetched and poorly explained considerations of questionable relevance lead to a hasty and slipshod conclusion.
We know how it works: fuzzy conclusions demand the indefinite extension of the European Union's competences, then justify the interpretation of the Commission, which, finally, legitimises the transfer of powers from the States to the Court.
Those who, like us, were wary of the substantial extension of the EU's objectives in Article I-3 of the draft Constitution were quite right to be concerned.
The Commissioners and the judges have no intention of bending to the will of the people, and have decided to disregard their refusal to ratify a draft Constitution that transferred criminal matters into the ordinary Community legislative procedure.
This judgment is a distortion of the will of those who signed and ratified the European treaties.
It is a judicial coup d'Ã©tat.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming up to some important deadlines.
Our people are watching us and will soon be calling us to account.
Will there be any sincere democrats here to stand up to this shameless tyranny?
(NL) Mr President, it is forbidden to export waste to developing countries.
That is beyond question.
The ban does not, however, apply to normal ship's waste and bilge water, but it is equally clear that the bilge water on the Proba Koala was not normal.
The fatalities, thousands of injured and the enormous upheaval in Ivory Coast are testimony to this.
It was already clear in Amsterdam that its bilge water was not normal, because someone had collapsed and there was an unbearable and unusual stench.
It is clear that the ship with its contents should never have left Amsterdam without warning the authorities at the next European port, which was in Estonia.
That is why a judicial inquiry is currently underway in the Netherlands, and rightly too, in order to find out how it was possible for the toxic ship to leave the Netherlands in the first place, and whether the port authorities or inspectorates are in any way to blame.
What we should now focus on, though, is the question as to how disasters of that kind can be prevented from happening in future.
I have three questions I would like to put to the Commissioner.
In Estonia, you stated that the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast was only the tip of the iceberg.
What was the basis for this statement?
Secondly, would you agree that ships that leave the EU should be obliged to surrender their waste water and waste at their last EU port?
Finally, what measures is the Commission able, and willing, to take in order to tighten up checks on the export of harmful waste?
(DE) Mr President, Africa has for decades been undergoing a process of transformation into a hazardous waste dump as a result of the export of toxic laboratory chemicals, solvents, superannuated pesticides and sewage sludge.
There are a few people in Europe and Africa for whom the criminal trade in toxic waste is a very profitable business.
Knowing though we do, that the actions of this Dutch firm in Abidjan were quite manifestly contrary not only to the Basle Convention but also to EU law, we have to ask ourselves how quickly our European institutions can respond if this is not to happen again in future.
We take a favourable view of Commissioner Dimas' announcements, and we hope that this time the Member States and the Council will see how serious the situation is and realise the necessity of taking real action on this front instead of always merely regretting these things after they have occurred.
What is really required of the Member States of the European Union is some evidence of their willingness to do something about them.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express my congratulations on this initiative.
We note with concern that the Basel Convention is infringed at least 10 times a year, with toxic waste being sent to Africa.
The recent incident involving the Probo Koala pricked consciences in the European Union.
The Union needs to proceed with the criminalisation of illegal practices in connection with movements of toxic waste.
At the same time, the attention of the European SeaPorts Organisation needs to be drawn to the strict application of rules governing movements of toxic waste by its members.
In particular, the need should be emphasised for information for the public, internal agreement and information between the departments involved and the operation of the register for recording qualitative and quantitative data and quantities of waste moved and produced.
All this must be transparent and accessible to whomever it concerns, in order to prevent the tendency for the economies of Africa to develop into various toxic waste industrial management sectors.
(NL) Mr President, what we are actually talking about today is an example of environmental crime of which we are unsure whether it will be prosecuted or not.
Moreover, I would say to my fellow MEPs that I would not like to be in a Green-Leftwing alderman's shoes when discussing the Proba Koala file; the question is therefore whether prosecution will follow and if so, whether it will also cover Member States.
This is the very reason why we have insisted on legislation with regard to criminal law if we want to enforce environmental policy effectively.
We therefore feel that condemnation is certainly called for but that the Member States should be able to decide for themselves in what way those sanctions should be imposed.
That is how we would like to go forward.
A legislative proposal was submitted six years ago.
At the same time, the Council produced its own framework decision, which the Commission and this House suggested should be thrown out, which is exactly what happened a year ago.
Last Monday, the Commissioner announced he will produce a fresh proposal, but perhaps the Commissioner could be more specific as to this proposal's exact content, for this was left a little vague last Monday.
I should also like to know from the Council - as I used to be rapporteur - whether the Council is happy to accept a fresh proposal to address environmental crime, for that is the most important question on the agenda here.
As there are plenty of examples, a proposal does indeed appear necessary.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, questions of the environment are extremely important and a priority area, and for that reason it is good that we have been able to discuss them here today in Parliament.
The Council takes a very serious view of illegal movements of waste and the risk which they pose to the immediate environment and people's health.
The prevention of such illegal movements is a very demanding task, as has been made very evident in this debate.
It requires very diverse sorts of action and effective cooperation at many levels, the limits of competence exercised by the authorities notwithstanding.
We must also honestly recognise the fact that there is much room for improvement in the way movements of waste in the European Union and away from it are controlled, according to the surveys that have been conducted.
We also have to remember that, as regrettable as these individual events that attract so much public attention are, the recent incident involving the Probo Koala in the Ivory Coast being a case in point, we must remember to give attention too to the everyday incidents and situations that cause harm to health and the environment, of which there is still an abundance.
An example is the scrapping of ships in unsatisfactory conditions in developing countries.
Work is to continue with regard to these important questions at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention in Nairobi at the end of November.
We should also see, recognise and acknowledge that there are considerable differences in national criminal laws on the environment between the Member States.
In some Member States there are some very up-to-date penal provisions for environmental crimes, while in others there might well be a need to review such provisions to reflect the current risks and counter them.
Actually, one might say that there is still a lot to do in all the Member States in the area of implementation of these penal provisions and, especially, increasing the likelihood of catching offenders.
The Council takes a very serious view of environmental criminality and its prevention.
As for the proposal being drafted, it is obviously difficult for the Council to take a position on something that does not yet exist.
We first have to look at the proposal and then adopt a position.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety, Mr Florenz, and all the other speakers for their very positive contributions to today's debate.
I would like to add to the list of nationalities that Mr Bowis referred to.
This was a Greek-owned ship, under the flag of Panama, but it was time-chartered to a Dutch company, which operated it from Switzerland, with a Russian crew, financed by British and international banks and with a variety of nationalities on the board of the company and as shareholders.
Happily, it was blocked by Greenpeace in Estonia and the Estonian authorities thoroughly investigated the case.
I should like to assure the rapporteur that first proposal, which contains a minimum level of penalties, will be merged with the framework decision of the Council and basically it will be along the lines of what you proposed, with certain amendments at first reading.
With regard to the question of whether a ship carrying hazardous waste is allowed to leave a European Union port, if the waste is hazardous it is not allowed to go to a destination outside the OECD.
That also applies to slops - the ship's own waste water - that contain hazardous substances.
I will continue to follow closely all developments in the criminal investigations and proceedings that are currently being conducted in the Netherlands and Estonia regarding the toxic waste dumping in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
The Commission is also in the process of collecting any information available in other Member States concerning the vessel Proba Koala and its journey.
I hope that we will soon be able to draw conclusions from that and find the best way forward in preventing such incidents in the future.
We must keep in mind that the tragic incident in CÃŽte d'Ivoire is just the tip of the iceberg.
We know that is so from inspections carried out in Member States by their network of implementation and enforcement agencies, IMPEL.
In 2005, 51% of the waste shipments checked were found to be illegal.
Most of the cases do not make big headlines but they can, nevertheless, pose a serious risk to the environment and human health.
We must make it very clear that our society does not tolerate environmental crime and that we are determined to take all possible steps to fight it.
But legislation that we have adopted to better protect our environment and the health of our citizens will not achieve its objectives if we do not take the necessary measures to ensure that it is properly enforced.
I can assure you that the Commission is determined that environmental legislation should be properly applied throughout the Community.
We are already taking a number of specific initiatives in order to ensure that the European Union waste shipment regulation is correctly applied and illegal waste shipments are prevented and reduced.
This includes the preparation of guidelines to be adopted in connection with the application of the new waste shipment regulation next year and the organisation of awareness-raising events in Member States.
The Commission meets representatives of national authorities responsible for waste shipments on a regular basis.
This takes place within a well-established framework and includes multilateral meetings in Brussels, as well as bilateral contacts, but these initiatives need to be supplemented by measures to establish effective sanctions.
One of the many measures taken by the Commission for this purpose was to propose a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law.
As I have already said, it is regrettable that the Commission's proposal was not taken up by the Council, due to a difference of views on the correct legal basis.
Now, however, the Court of Justice has confirmed that the Commission's views were correct.
The Commission is preparing a new proposal for a directive which will give effect to the Court's judgment and should be adopted soon.
It has taken some time to produce the amended proposal, because the Commission has very carefully analysed the Court's judgment and made a comparison of the original Commission proposal as amended after Parliament's first reading and the Council's framework decision.
In addition, an impact assessment is being carried out to analyse the various options for action.
The Commission thinks it is necessary to amend its proposal of 2001 after the Court's ruling, to ensure that all criminal law measures necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the Community's policy for the protection of the environment are included in the proposal.
The Court has made it clear that the parallel adoption of a directive and a framework decision, as was done in the past, is no longer possible.
Also, after five years, the Commission's proposal needs to be adapted to legislative developments.
I would like to clarify that the Commission does not want to harmonise national criminal laws fully.
The aim is that only those steps which are necessary for the effective implementation of environmental policy should be taken at Community level.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again the importance of good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in the forthcoming codecision procedure for the adoption of the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law.
We have the same goals, namely to protect the environment by establishing minimum standards for the sanctioning of environmental offences and to try to eliminate the possibility of safe havens for environmental offenders in the European Union.
Acting together, we can take a big step towards achieving these objectives.
Finally, as regards the ratification of the Basel Convention, I have sent letters to more than 50 countries around the world asking them to ratify the Convention.
To avoid any wrong conclusions, I should clarify that the Basel ban is mandatory, legally binding, for the European Union Member States, even those that have not ratified the Convention, because we as the European Union have signed and ratified the agreement.
To wind up the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 103(2) and two motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The dumping of toxic waste by the Dutch firm Trafigura in the city of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast is a disgrace which requires full investigation and tough action.
There can be little doubt that this dumping was in breach of EU law and the Basel Convention.
This environmental crime will once again create the view that the rich North regards poor Africa as a suitable dumping ground.
I welcome the Commissioner's statement which tries to counter this view, but statements are one thing: only action will convince Africans that we are serious about dealing with this.
Apart from all the other issues that have to be investigated we need to know how it was possible for this ship to leave Amsterdam.
Are the Dutch authorities reviewing their inspection methods?
Will the Commission raise the whole issue of inspection and enforcement at next month's Basel Convention Forum?
What has occurred in CÃŽte d'Ivoire brings shame on the European Union.
In this Parliament we are often at the forefront of the campaigns for better environmental protection.
We are fond of stating that pollution does not respect borders.
And yet, in 2006 we are witness to a situation in which 500 tonnes of toxic waste is transported from an EU Member State and dumped upon the long-suffering people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
The immediate impact has been a number of deaths and tens of thousands of people needing medical attention.
We have all seen the grim estimates of what the longer-term impact could prove to be.
If our grand statements on environmental protection are to mean anything, then the Commission and the Dutch authorities must make a full investigation in pursuit of the culprits in this crime.
Clearly current legislation does not offer sufficient protection against unscrupulous people who care nothing for the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire and other African states.
In the EU, we must act to ensure that our legislation on toxic waste is such that we can guarantee to people in Africa that their countries will not be dumping grounds for our hazardous waste.
(NL) Mr President, the disaster in Ivory Coast calls for a rapid response from Europe, with compensation for the victims and for the damage done to the environment, whereby the polluter pays principle must apply.
If Europe wants to make headway, it will need to explain to its citizens where the added value for them lies.
The incident in Ivory Coast is a perfect example of where Europe clearly has a responsibility.
Shipping is known for its complexity in terms of ownership and management, and is almost by definition an international affair.
After all, over a two-month period, the Proba Koala called at the ports of Gibraltar, Algeciras, Amsterdam, Skagen, Paldiski, Dover and Venkspits.
Moreover, the ship sails under a Panama flag, is owned by a Greek company, is chartered by Trafigura BV, which has a postbox in the Netherlands, from Great Britain and has a Russian crew.
Something as complex as this requires clarity and transparency in legislation.
If the European Union wants to act effectively, it will need to meet these conditions promptly.
Only by adopting a firm stand can Europe demonstrate why further European integration is important to each and everyone of us.
EC-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs De Keyser on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs containing the European Parliament's recommendation to the Council on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Syrian Arab Republic, of the other part.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for her presence here today.
The EU-Syria Association Agreement is the missing piece in the Barcelona process, but it is also the Godot of the European Parliament: continually heralded, but never concluded.
The negotiations on this agreement started in 1996, before Syria withdrew from Lebanon.
They were difficult, but they nevertheless resulted in a much-revised draft that laid down, for example, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism.
The agreement was signed in the Council in October 2004, but the ratification process was interrupted by the appalling assassination of the former prime minister Mr Hariri on 14 February 2005.
We all know what happened next.
People in Lebanon and all over the world immediately pointed the finger at the government in Damascus.
An investigation, led initially by Mr Mehlis and now by Mr Brammertz, was carried out in situ, and Resolution 1559 called for the withdrawal of Syrian troops and secret services from Lebanon.
The presumption of innocence is one of the pillars of our legal systems, but we must also bear in mind the precautionary principle.
Although Syria made haste to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, it was initially hesitant about cooperating with Mr Mehlis.
Europe therefore cautiously distanced itself from the Damascus Government.
Is this caution still acceptable today, when various events both on the international stage and within Syria's internal political system should encourage us to reopen dialogue?
The Council will be the judge of that, but I, for my part, am in favour of dialogue and the Committee on Foreign Affairs supported me in this by a large majority.
This dialogue could ultimately lead to the signing of the agreement, but that question is still premature and is not the purpose of the recommendation.
So, then, what are these events?
First of all, there is the renewal of effective cooperation with Mr Brammertz's investigation, as attested to in his latest report.
Next, it has become apparent that our isolation of Syria has been counter-productive in terms of democracy within the country, and has failed to weaken a strong government.
Our empty-chair politics have contributed to destabilising a reforming tendency that was cautiously raising its head.
What is more, the voice of Europe, which in the past has been raised to defend activists and political prisoners, is now hardly to be heard.
Finally, and this is my third point, the tragedy in Lebanon has been a terrible lesson.
The war between Israel and Lebanon was proof, if proof were needed, of the danger and uselessness of force.
