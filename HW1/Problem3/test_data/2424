Â Â  .I decided to abstain from voting on the Eurlings report, even though it is a harsh report.
Admittedly, it marks a turning point in terms of our becoming aware of the reality of the relations between the EU and Turkey, but by implying and confirming, after the rejection of certain amendments, that accession is an end in itself, it remains too unilateral.
The undeniable slowing down of the reforms in Turkey, despite the Commissionâs opening accession negotiations, should, on the contrary, give added weight to the option of a privileged partnership.
The fact that the opening of these negotiations has not speeded up the reforms is worrying, and our response must consist of a demand for results and not of the idea that accession will take place no matter what.
That is why it was necessary to point out that the normalisation of relations with Cyprus must be a prerequisite for any accession.
The fact that Turkey has still not ratified and implemented the Ankara Protocol, which is a minimum - only just acceptable - legal form of recognition, is inadmissible.
Finally, I endorsed the amendment on the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for this possible accession, because we are not talking here about a symbolic point but about a moral obligation and a historic demand that are incumbent on the Turkish authorities.
Â Â  Turkey has a very long way to go before EU membership can be an imminent possibility.
I have previously voted against beginning membership negotiations with Turkey because it will be a very long time before it meets the requirements for EU membership.
It is not possible to maintain a negotiating process over a 20-year period.
The pressure to relax the membership requirements would be in danger of becoming irresistible.
It is important to make clear demands of Turkey.
The Copenhagen human rights criteria must be fulfilled.
The sovereignty of Cyprus must be respected, and the 1915 genocide of Armenians and Syrians/Assyrians must be acknowledged.
Before Turkish membership of the EU can become an imminent possibility, the voting strength of each Member State must be changed so that a small number of densely populated Member States will not dominate the EUâs decision-making.
The financial consequences of possible Turkish membership of the EU must be investigated carefully.
The EUâs common agricultural policy and regional policy must be reformed before Turkey can become a member of the EU.
The EUâs budget should be limited to one per cent of the Member Statesâ total GNI, and possible Turkish membership should not lead to that ceiling being exceeded.
It is important to note that the fact that negotiations with Turkey have been embarked on does not automatically mean that Turkey will become a member of the EU.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  â The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Darfur.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is concerned about recent developments in Sudan, especially the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Darfur.
The Presidency, together with EU High Representative Javier Solana, has been working closely with EU partners and the international community to try and set common objectives and to cooperate in order to build lasting peace in Darfur.
Furthermore, Pekka Haavisto, who was appointed EU Special Representative for Sudan in summer 2005, is continuing to monitor the general situation in Sudan and the coordination of EU action, and to take part in discussions with Sudan in his capacity as EU representative.
The Darfur Peace Agreement, which was signed in May by the Sudanese Government and Minni Minnawiâs rebel troops, the Sudanese Liberation Movement, was regarded as an opportunity for peace.
The Peace Agreement was expected to end the three-year long conflict, which has claimed almost 300Â 000 lives and driven more than two million people into exile. Four months on, however, security and the humanitarian situation in the region are rapidly deteriorating.
Violent attacks on villages and refugee camps, both in and outside the country, have increased, particularly in the last few months. The Sudanese Government has reinforced its military presence in Darfur.
Both the Sudanese Government troops and the rebels are in breach of the ceasefire agreements. Owing to deteriorating security, the number of refugees and people in need of humanitarian aid has gone up.
At the same time, it has become harder for humanitarian aid to get through, with help reaching only around 50% of those who need it.
If the Darfur Peace Agreement were implemented â and barely any progress has been made on this â it would have an immediate impact on the lives of some six million Darfurians.
It would make it possible for the refugees to return to their homes and a normal life. It would make it possible for agriculture to get going, which would help ensure a supply of food, and for schools and healthcare to be established, and it would help guarantee the basic essentials of life, to name just some of the benefits.
All this depends on improved security.
In order to ensure that the Darfur Peace Agreement is viable and that it can be implemented, the groups that have not signed up to the pact need to be included in the peace process.
In order to improve security, it is vital that the parties involved in the conflict commit to the ceasefire and that the ceasefire is monitored.
The EU has repeatedly called on the parties involved in the conflict to comply with their obligations under the Peace Agreement and the Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement signed in NâDjamena in 2004.
The European Union, and in particular its special representative, MrÂ Haavisto, has also been active in trying to involve those not party to the Agreement in the peace process, and to persuade them to sign up to the Darfur Peace Agreement.
The European Union is worried about the effects of the Darfur conflict on the peace process in Sudan as a whole.
The conflict will have serious repercussions for regional stability in East Africa and the Horn of Africa, especially in Chad and the Central African Republic.
To support the Darfur peace process, in 2004 the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) was set up.
The EU has supported AMIS since the launch of its operation through the African Peace Facility (APF).
In all, the Unionâs financial support for the AMIS operation has added up to around EURÂ 242Â million.
In addition, the Union has provided material, logistic and planning aid and support, as well as personnel.
The Member States have also lent support to the operation with major bilateral contributions.
AMIS, the first peacekeeping operation in the history of the African Union, has done excellent work in extremely difficult circumstances.
Its capacity and resources are nevertheless insufficient to confront the enormous challenges that Darfur presents.
In spite of the huge sums of money from the EU, the operation has also had serious financial problems.
From this, it is clear that the only possible and realistic solution to peacekeeping in Darfur is a UN operation.
The EU strongly supports ResolutionÂ 1706 adopted by the UN Security Council on 31Â August. This expands the UNMIS peacekeeping operationâs mandate in South Sudan to cover Darfur, to continue the work begun by AMIS.
The main task of the UN operation would be to support the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement.
The protection of civilians and monitoring the ceasefire would be essential elements in the operationâs mandate.
As AMISâs biggest supporter, the European Union is very concerned that the Sudanese Government has not agreed to the UN operation in Darfur.
The UN operation is vital to improve security in Darfur and to implement the Peace Agreement in a way that is sustainable.
Darfur cannot, however, be left in a âsecurity vacuumâ.
For that reason, the EU takes a positive view of the decision taken by the African Union in New York on 20Â September that AMISâs mandate should be extended until the end of the year.
The EU has undertaken to provide AMIS with support during this âtransition stageâ too.
The EU is still insisting that the Sudanese Government should agree to AMIS coming under the supervision of the UN, in accordance with UN ResolutionÂ 1706.
On more than one occasion, the Union has expressed its concern about this issue and has discussed it with the Sudanese Government.
The EU has also urged other international players to take action to convince the Sudanese Government of the usefulness and necessity of the UN operation for the peace process in Sudan generally.
It was with this in mind that the Finnish Presidency, EU High Representative Javier Solana, EU Special Representative Pekka Haavisto and the Member States discussed the matter in depth at their meeting during the Ministerial Week at the UN General Assembly in New York.
The EU is very anxious about human rights violations in Darfur.
In particular, women and children have been the victims of physical violence, including rape.
The Union backs the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights to improve the human rights situation.
The EU has repeatedly reminded the Sudanese Government of its responsibility to protect its citizens from all forms of violence and to guarantee respect for human rights.
The EU is one of the main providers of assistance in the reconstruction work following the civil war in Sudan.
At the Oslo Donorsâ Conference on Sudan in April 2005, the Commission and the Member States together promised substantial aid to cover immediate needs and start reconstruction.
When the Darfur peace process starts in earnest, the EU is also prepared to aid reconstruction in Darfur. The Union will also give Sudan and Darfur substantial humanitarian aid.
It is important that the EU should have a conspicuous and active role in Sudan and Darfur.
The situation in Sudan and Darfur is one of the most crucial issues with regard to Africa and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and will stay high up on the agenda during the Finnish EU Presidency.
The matter will also be raised at all the main conferences and meetings with third parties, including high-level meetings.
If no proper action is taken, Darfur will be at risk of getting caught in a new spiral of violence. And that is something we cannot afford.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ LehtomÃ€ki, as everyone is aware, we are at a critical moment in Darfur.
The humanitarian tragedy is continuing and even worsening, resulting in more death and suffering.
Darfur is liable at any moment to lapse back into all-out war, with unpredictable and incalculable consequences for the stability of both the country and the region.
The peace in the south of Sudan could be jeopardised.
Several neighbouring countries, such as Chad, the Central African Republic and Uganda, and even countries further afield, such as Somalia and the Republic of Congo, could be forced to suffer the effects of this.
Although we are at the height of the crisis, there is still a chance to avoid the worst of it, and to restore peace and stability.
The Commission takes a positive view of the decision taken by the African Union to extend its mandate until 31Â December.
That will help prevent a security vacuum in Darfur, at a time when violence is erupting once again and when the process launched by the Abuja peace agreements is at a standstill.
We regret, however, that the Sudanese Government has not yet accepted Security Council Resolution 1706, which defines the framework within which the African Unionâs military responsibilities would be transferred to the United Nations.
It must be pointed out that the African Union itself had already decided on this transfer back in March.
The Commission regards this transfer as key to the restoration of peace in Darfur.
It is therefore important to convince Khartoum to accept it.
There can be no peace in Darfur if Khartoum does not agree to the transfer, and especially not if it opposes it.
Khartoum has denounced this transfer by speaking of a plot devised by the West.
At times, there has also been talk of a Zionist plot.
This is unfounded.
There is no agenda on the part of the international community to undermine Sudanese sovereignty or, worse still, to overthrow the Sudanese regime.
This shows just how urgent it is, on both sides, to succeed in swiftly re-establishing a calm dialogue on Darfur and on the issue of the transfer, in order to resolve the misunderstandings that could still exist in relation to this matter.
That is the main purpose of the current intense diplomatic activity in which the Commission is taking part.
Let us remember that the aim of the transfer of responsibilities from the African Union to the United Nations is to restore security and stability in Darfur, as well as to protect its civilians and to enable the humanitarian organisations to carry out their work.
It must be pointed out that 13 humanitarian workers have been killed over the last few months.
This transfer is key to restoring a climate of confidence among the protagonists and to enabling the Abuja peace agreement genuinely to be relaunched for Darfur; to making the non-signatory States sign; to supporting the actual implementation of the agreement; and to preventing the structure resulting from the North-South peace agreement from being undermined.
All of these aspects are also in Khartoumâs interests.
The present excessive talk, like the increased fighting, lead nowhere.
Those extremists who think they can win by following the worst-case scenario and radicalisation approach are mistaken.
They are greatly mistaken.
This approach can only backfire on them.
The conclusions of the last General Affairs Council send out a very clear and very firm message both to the rebels and to Khartoum regarding their own responsibility.
The Commission believes that there is still a possibility of de-escalation and a space in which a genuine dialogue can be resumed.
It is important to act quickly, however, before this space closes up.
It is in this frame of mind and with a desire to listen that MrÂ Barroso of the European Commission and my fellow Commissioner, MrÂ Michel, intend shortly to travel to Khartoum and meet PresidentÂ Bashir with the aim of taking forward the process of transition from the African Union to the United Nations and of relaunching the Abuja peace process.
Â Â  Mr President, I have to say that in both the Council and Commission statements I detect a rather worrying element of complacency.
You cannot talk of working with General Bashir and hoping that in the future we can persuade him.
I have followed the situation in Sudan for many years and I can confirm that would not be realistic at this time in particular.
The future of the people of Darfur is now in the balance, just as much as it was before the agreement on maintaining the AU force until 30 September 2006.
The government of Khartoum is answerable to nobody.
It is patently failing to allow humanitarian access to some three million people in Darfur.
What will the international community do?
You are not telling me what you will do to hold the government in Khartoum to account.
In three months, or even earlier, the UN force must be ready to deploy, because the AU will start to pull out.
The confusion about the future of the African Union is very serious: it is underfunded, overstretched and finding it very difficult to operate.
A United Nations force must be deployed as quickly as possible, with a stronger mandate than it has now, and it must be capable of protecting the vulnerable and traumatised people of Darfur who are currently under such terrible threat.
No deadlines have been met by the Sudanese.
Their genocidal strategy is moving forward.
There is no ceasefire to monitor any more.
It is pointless to talk about the peace agreement: it is finished.
We said ânever againâ in 1994 after Rwanda, and what we face now is the first genocide of the 21st century, unless we end this complacency and do something.
You talked about the key players. There are key players: China, Russia and the Arab League are also complicit in this.
One last important point: you did not talk about the need for the imposition of a no-fly zone.
There have been 13 UN resolutions, each of which has called for a no-fly zone.
Not for a moment has this been imposed.
What are you going to do, Council, what are you going to do, Commission, to ensure that those Antonov planes do not continue to fly over the villages of Darfur dropping bombs on those innocent civilians?
I urge you to think seriously about the imposition of a no-fly zone.
Could you not consider using the French jets that are currently in neighbouring Chad to monitor the airspace and stop the Sudanese from terrorising the people of Darfur?
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, for three years now, and under the gaze of a powerless international community, Darfur has been the victim of a terrible tragedy.
As you have said, the conflict has caused the deaths of 300Â 000 civilians.
Two million people â or one third of the population - have been displaced within Darfur; 200Â 000 have crossed the border in order to flee to Chad.
ThreeÂ million people are entirely dependent on international food aid.
Each day, children and families are attacked, displaced and killed.
The humanitarian crisis is getting worse.
In the majority of Darfur, humanitarian organisations are banned from coming to the aid of some 350Â 000 people who need medicines and food.
Owing to the state of malnutrition and lack of water, cholera and hepatitis E epidemics are multiplying in the camps.
Those in charge of the NGOs are they themselves also victims of this conflict: twelve of them have been killed in the last two months.
Insufficient as it is, the peace agreement signed in Abuja on 5Â May has not helped to end the violence but has, on the contrary, given rise to a fresh outbreak of violence.
The fighting and the civilian massacres have resumed.
100Â 000 people have had to flee the violence since May.
Thousands of soldiers from the Sudanese army have been deployed once again in the region, and the aerial bombardments have resumed.
In the meantime, more than two million people are trying to survive, cooped up in camps, surrounded by their enemies and regularly attacked.
Hundreds of women are raped each month as soon as they leave the camp and walk a few metres to go and find some wood to burn for heating or to use for food.
The only job that these millions of people used to have was that of working the land; they now find themselves deprived of this basic right and are reduced to cultivating â when they can â a few dozen square metres around the camps, running the risk of being attacked by the very people who destroyed their villages.
They are all 100% dependent on international aid, which is not particularly generous.
Some months, the food rations are halved, because there are no subsidies, because the donors did not materialise.
These camps, ladies and gentlemen, are truly open-air prisons.
We can no longer remain indifferent to what is happening in Darfur.
Europe has a humanitarian, political and moral duty to impose peace in this part of the world.
There can be no military solution to the Darfur crisis.
There is an urgent need to reopen a negotiating space and to work on a political agreement to which all of the parties concerned would fully contribute.
That is essential if the population of Darfur is to support the peace process.
This agreement will have to provide for the people of Darfur to be represented at the various levels of government, for a genuine guarantee that the Janjaweed militias will be disarmed and for a guarantee that the two million displaced persons and the 200Â 000 refugees will be able to return safely to their lands.
We also call for humanitarian officials to be guaranteed free and secure access to all of the conflict zones, and we appeal to the Commission and to the Council to ensure that the European Union significantly increases its humanitarian aid.
We also call on the Sudanese Government to end its armed offensive and to immediately accept the Security Council decision to deploy a UN peacekeeping operation with the aim of putting a stop to the violence.
It is now that Darfur needs Europe.
We here, in the European Parliament, do not have the right to turn our backs on this issue.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, unfortunately, where Darfur is concerned, the resolutions and the declarations have been following on from one another for several years now with, it would seem, little to no success.
As has been pointed out, the abuses continue, the acts of violence are on the increase and the women and children are the main victims of these crimes and these atrocities.
This situation is totally unbearable.
Faced with that, there seems to be a growing sense of powerlessness or fatalism, but we have a duty to get involved now so that we can make genuine progress on the ground.
In fact, the more time that goes by, the more the government in Khartoum thinks that it can act with impunity and says to itself that, in the end, by digging its heels in and by gaining time, it will achieve its ends.
If we want to act, then, it seems that there are three priorities to fulfil.
Firstly, the top priority is to gain access to the refugees because, right now, thousands of people are in fact suffering from hunger and violence, and no one can gain access to these populations: it is this situation that must be improved as a matter of urgency.
The second priority is the fight against impunity.
It is unacceptable that, despite the declarations and the vague desire for sanctions, nothing has ended up being done.
The criminals and those who are growing considerably richer continue to go about their business as though nothing were wrong, and little has been done in that regard.
The third and final priority is, of course, the establishment, as quickly as possible, of a United Nations force that can go and strengthen that of the African Union, which is all the same playing an important role that should be consolidated.
So, admittedly, here we are now obliged to call on China and Russia to play a positive role in this affair, even though everyone knows that China and Russia are perhaps not examples of the ideal to aspire to when it comes to respect for human rights or for the populations affected by such conflicts.
Furthermore, we must, at the same time, call for a general dialogue, as the previous speaker pointed out.
Finally, I have a few words to say about the role of oil in this affair.
We are not burying our heads in the sand.
We know only too well that oil stirs up conflicts, excites envy, enables people to buy weapons and also leads to standstills, particularly on the part of China - which has very important interests in that area â and of all those, and the superpowers in particular, that are now searching ever more feverishly for oil resources to which they can have easy access.
We will therefore have to integrate this issue of access to oil into a much broader, European and international, context.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the humanitarian and political situation in Darfur is getting worse from one day to the next.
According to Jan Egeland, the UN coordinator for humanitarian aid, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated since 2004: entire regions of Darfur have been left without any humanitarian personnel because the Khartoum government is preventing international agencies from gaining access.
The persecution of the civilian population by the notorious Janjaweed â armed gangs financed and supported by the Sudanese central government â now looks very much like genocide.
The international community cannot just stand by and look on, now that the forces sent in by the Organisation for African Unity to protect the civilian population have practically failed.
Their lack of any political and military credibility is now beyond doubt.
That is why we support UN intervention under Security Council Resolution 1706, which the Sudanese Government stubbornly disregards.
The peacekeeping troops proposed under Resolution 1706 now need to be deployed in order to protect hundreds of thousands of women, men and children who for too long have been suffering attacks from the Janjaweed, even though previous UN resolutions have rightly called for them to be disbanded.
It would be even better, of course, if the Sudanese Government approved the deployment of the UN force; I hope it will, and I also think that the Arab League countries should put more effective pressure on Khartoum to accept the UN resolution.
At the same time, however, any kind of Sudanese veto against the United Nations would be unacceptable: there are hundreds of thousands of innocent lives at stake, and we need to do something for them.
Otherwise, the entire credibility of the international community will be called into question.
It is therefore crucial that the UN be allowed to send its humanitarian personnel into the whole Darfur region; otherwise it will be impossible for humanitarian aid to be distributed properly.
Sudan has to realise that it must cooperate with the United Nations in order to be fully accepted into the international community.
Â Â  . Mr President, there certainly is unity in this Chamber this afternoon on what should be done regarding Darfur.
Three hundred thousand people have been killed and two and a half million driven from their homes.
In the last month alone, 50Â 000 people have been driven from their homes.
This really is a human catastrophe on a massive scale.
The only solution is to put in place a proper United Nations force with a very clear mandate.
The only way we can get that is through aggressive diplomacy.
How can it take 30 days, a period of time criticised at that stage as too lengthy, to get a UN force in place in Lebanon, yet with Darfur we are talking about three years?
It is because we are not as committed to this problem as we should be.
Yes, people blame the Sudanese Government, and it is to blame.
Its crimes have been outlined by previous speakers so I will not go over them.
It is hiding, for trade reasons, behind the governments in China, Russia, India and Malaysia, which said that they would protect the Sudanese Government and veto sanctions against it.
We must put pressure on these governments to make sure that they do not allow this to happen.
They and everybody must help to try to stop what is happening in Darfur. It is an absolute catastrophe.
We need a UN peacekeeping force at least 20Â 000 strong on the ground in Darfur if we are going to stop it.
The present force of 7000 African Union troops is ill-equipped and, when you consider that the area they are covering is the size of France, it is quite impossible for them to police it.
A proper UN force is needed and it is needed quickly with a proper mandate.
Sudan requires a political solution very fast.
The UN and the EU must act.
We must confront genocide and do everything we can to facilitate peace in the region.
It has been ignored for too long, it is an absolute outrage and the Government in Khartoum cannot be allowed to get away with it any longer.
It cannot hide behind other countries which say that they will veto any action taken against Sudan.
We must act to make sure what is happening is stopped.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, there is no doubt about it: the Darfur crisis is the result of the governmentâs policy of Arabisation, as well as of its willingness to arm the militias engaged in the civil war in southern Sudan.
The results of that policy are to be seen â as already emphasised in this debate â in innumerable deaths and millions driven from their homes, leaving swathes of land unpopulated.
Despite that, President Omar al-Bashir denounces it as a lie that Sudanese Arabs are attacking Sudanese black Africans, and claims that human rights organisations that decry the present state of affairs are doing so only in the hope of attracting more donations.
It is evident, then, that what Sudan would prefer is to be left to itself and its civil war.
The best hope is that it will agree to the extension of the mandate for a peace mission by the African Union, although those with inside knowledge describe this as not only badly equipped and under-motivated, but also â quite simply â as completely out of its depth.
Although the deployment of the UNâs 'blue helmets' promises to bring much greater success, this is rejected as neo-colonialism.
Perhaps, then, this genocide might be halted if there were an agreement to send a multinational peace-keeping force composed of Africans and Muslims, in other words a joint intervention by African Union and UN troops.
Â Â  Mr President, Darfur continues to be a humanitarian crisis.
More than a quarter of a million innocent people have been killed since 2003, and a further 2.5 million people have been displaced.
The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 last month calling for the deployment of more than 22Â 000Â peacekeepers in the region.
However, the Government of Sudan remains opposed to such a force, accusing the UN of an exercise in neo-colonialism manipulated by Washington.
This is nonsense talk and it is nothing more than the Sudanese Government playing politics with peopleâs lives.
The mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan has been extended so that the UN now has three more months in which to reach an agreement with the Sudanese Government on the need for a more effective multilateral force to protect civilians.
However, in the likely scenario of Sudanâs continuing to resist UN efforts, the UN must take a stronger stance. The UN may need to consider, for example, military intervention under Chapter 7, given its responsibility to protect civilians where national authorities fail to save their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and/or crimes against humanity.
The Sudanese Government has shown no willingness to protect internally displaced persons.
In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that it has assisted and sponsored attacks on refugee camps.
For the time being, support for the 7000-strong AU force is essential and the UN has agreed to give logistical and material support.
The Arab League has finally pledged some economic support and EU Member States also need to be generous in this regard.
The EU has a responsibility to make Darfur an ongoing priority for the UN.
More pressure is needed on China and Russia in particular to play a more positive role in Sudan.
More civilians have died in Darfur than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.
We all have blood on our hands because of the slow international response to what has happened to date.
This is the toughest resolution that we have seen on Darfur, but it is action that is needed.
I hope we will not be looking back in a yearâs time at another 100Â 000 dead.
Â Â  â Mr President, at this time when we still want â although I do not know whether we are able â to remain hopeful about the peace agreement signed in May, we are witnessing the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the region, which many other Members have already described.
The European Parliament is once again issuing its opinion on the situation in Darfur and, in my particular case, I am adding my voice to that of the victims: the civil population, the women and the children of Darfur.
Since the armed conflict broke out three years ago, the appeals from the humanitarian agencies have become increasingly desperate. They have been entirely in vain.
The more than 50Â 000 dead, the two and a half million internally displaced and the 500Â 000 refugees illustrate the tragedy of a region in conflict better than anybodyâs words could.
In its resolution, my group introduced its grave concern about the violation of the rights of children and the generalised rape of women as a weapon of war.
This has unfortunately not been included in the compromise resolution, as if it were of no importance.
Hundreds of thousands of children killed, disappeared, sexually abused, kidnapped, displaced, used as soldiers and then abandoned etc. can be counted and identified and, furthermore, have no access to humanitarian aid.
We are all to blame, not just the Khartoum government and the military and guerrilla factions.
There is complete impunity despite the fact that Sudan had ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocol on children in armed conflicts.
We also have specific data indicating that, last August, more than 200 women were sexually assaulted in one single camp, and that is something that humanitarian organisations had been warning us about.
This information is telling us more and more about the infernal spiral into which Darfur is being plunged and in which, once again, the bodies of women and girls are often the favoured battleground of the soldiers and guerrillas.
With regard to things that are happening today, in another camp of displaced people, rather than being protected, women have been raped and are being prevented from reachingÂ âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, the situation in Darfur is extremely grave.
The Government of Sudan is pouring its troops into the region and the extension of the African Unionâs mandate by three months is only a breathing space.
The population of Darfur still faces the prospect of so-called security being provided solely by the Sudanese Government, with no international protection.
Those of us from Parliament who visited Darfur in 2004 saw with our own eyes razed houses scattered with empty shell cases.
That was all that was left of a village bombed by the Sudanese Government in the name of security.
Even as recently as last week, a Sudanese Government Antonov plane was bombing villages in north Darfur.
If there is no international presence in Darfur there will be a total massacre, notwithstanding all the hand-wringing and assertions of ânever againâ after Rwanda.
That is why the presence of the UN force, as authorised by Resolution 1706, is so vital.
There is no more urgent task for international diplomacy than to work with Russian and China to isolate Sudan and impose a UN presence in Darfur.
The EU-China statement on 11 September was encouraging, but it needs to be built on.
I would ask the Council what steps it is taking to achieve that.
For its part, the African Union has said that an Africa-dominated UN force in Darfur is absolutely necessary.
On the worsening humanitarian situation, a growing number of places have become no-go areas for NGOs because of the current fighting.
At the same time, the number of people dependent upon humanitarian assistance has risen to nearly 3 million.
This month more than 30 new cases of cholera have been reported.
Without true peace, the humanitarian effort will collapse and hundreds of thousands of people who fled their homes to save their lives will now once again face death.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to repeat what has just been said about the situation in Darfur in all its frightful cruelty.
What I do want to say right now is that I am less than convinced by what has been said by the presidency, the Minister, or, indeed, by Commissioner Frattini.
For as long as those responsible within the European Union â by which I mean you, you in the Council and the Presidency â cannot even realise that what is going on at this very moment is genocide, and while you only talk about how we are going to play our part in reconstruction once peace is established, and so on and so forth, I wonder why you do not call this by its name, for what matters most of all is that this genocide â which is what is going on here â should be brought to a halt, and once that is done we can get on with the rebuilding work.
There is a need for clarity, not least within the European Union, the dilemma in the Security Council is that China and Russia are preventing anything being done.
It is clear, then, that the right of veto in the Security Council must be abolished.
No country on earth must be allowed to use a veto to allow genocide to continue.
Secondly â and this is something we Europeans can do â we have to spell out the fact that, under such tragic circumstances, the so-called sovereignty of the Sudanese state is very definitely negotiable.
It is human security, the protection of human life, that is the ultimate good, rather than the alleged sovereignty of an undemocratic, brutal and failing state.
Let us just recall the debates we had about sending troops to the Congo and then to the Lebanon â this time we are talking about 22Â 000 soldiers.
We cannot respond to the news that there will be an extension until December by saying âhoorayâ and hoping that by then 22Â 000 soldiers will have been found for a UN force; that will not work.
It would mean that we would, until December, remain passive spectators of genocide and would only then get around to grappling with the issue, without having already done anything about it.
Europe cannot adopt such a policy!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the situation in the Sudanese province of Darfur is quite obviously terrible.
People are being driven from their homes, brutally, in what Jean Ziegler described as a âdreadful tragedyâ, but it is pretty easy to say that troops should be sent, as provided for in the UN resolution.
You all know what this UN Resolution says; it says that the Sudanese Government â as is customary â must give its consent, and that is precisely what the Sudanese Government is not going to do.
What that means is that what is needed in this situation is a political solution rather than the calls for troops or for preparations for their deployment that we hear from within NATO.
The European Unionâs part in this really is what the Council and the Commission have described it as being.
It is very easy to say that we want the troops. The problem is that there are certain ground rules that must be complied with, and they do indeed say that the relevant government must give its consent, and this one has not done so.
I want to underline once more what the honourable lady Member from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance said; particularly in Southern Sudan, there are certain economic interests that play an essential part in this conflict â reference has already been made to oil â and this involves not only China, but also, without doubt, European states, such as the country from which I come, for Germany, too, is heavily involved because of the plans for the building of a major railway line there.
The call for people to be helped sounds wonderful, then, and it is one that I certainly endorse, but it should be realistic and should actually result in more humanitarian aid being provided.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would prefer not to speak at all, in protest at both your and our ineptitude.
Yet China needs minerals, oil, markets, water and land.
What we are witnessing is the Chinese colonisation of Africa.
The Sudanese Government, a partner or constituent part of Al-Qaeda, longstanding home to Osama, staunch ally of Al-Tourabi, literally practices ethnic cleansing, raping and impregnating tens of thousands of women in the cause of Arab-ness and membership of the League of Arab States.
The Russians supply the arms.
The mission of the African Union has reached breaking point.
Our glorious African intervention leaves two million people in exile and half a million dead.
I should like to ask the Council and the Commission what they are doing in order to provide immediate support for a substantial United Nations mission under Chapter VII?
What actions are they taking to finally implement the no fly zone called for in 13 completely pointless resolutions?
What are they doing in order to ensure that they put an end to the impunity of all those who rape and kill completely innocent civilians?
It shames me that as a member of Parliamentâs Investigation Committee I took on more responsibility when I visited Darfur and AbÃ©chÃ©, and yet today all I can do is prattle on, if you will excuse the expression.
Commissioner, imagine looking into the eyes of a young woman who is caring for a baby and asking her the childâs name.
She cannot answer you and she says she does not know, because the child was born out of rape.
How do you think you would feel?
Â Â  â The al-Bashir Government has been the main perpetrator of the strategy of genocide against the people of Darfur.
The EU cannot remain under any illusions on this issue.
The Commission, the Council and the European members of the United Nations Security Council must, as a matter of urgency, confront Sudan by sending UN forces to the Darfur region with a robust mandate under Chapter VII of the Charter.
There can be no more excuses or dithering.
The Sudanese Government must be punished if they persist in thwarting the efforts of the international community in Darfur.
As a matter of urgency, bank accounts must be frozen, and members of the Sudanese Government and others already identified by the International Criminal Court as being the ringleaders of the atrocities must be prevented from travelling.
If China and Russia continue to drag their feet as regards an embargo on Khartoum, the EU must get together with the United States and declare a trade embargo, especially on weapons and oil, and a complete freeze on the financial transactions of the Sudanese Government.
Military measures are also urgently required.
A no-fly zone over Darfur could be operated from eastern Chad to block the Sudanese air force from attacking the population of Darfur, as I and other Members of this Chamber witnessed near Al Fashir in September 2004.
A multinational force must be sent immediately to eastern Chad to protect the refugees, to prepare the UN force in Darfur, to control the border between Chad and Sudan and to restore some stability in the region.
That stability is also threatened by the heightened tensions in Somalia on account of the Ethiopian intervention instigated by the Bush Administration, which has had the disastrous outcome of strengthening the Islamic courts in Mogadishu.
Lastly, the EU must not remain silent over the role of China, Russia and the Arab League in supporting Khartoumâs strategy of genocide.
After the UN enshrined the principle of the responsibility to protect, Moscow, Beijing and Arab capitals have shamed themselves by seeking to sweep the lessons of Rwanda, Bosnia and Congo under the carpet when it comes to Darfur, where a Muslim population is being massacred by Muslims.
Â Â  Mr President, when back in August the United Nations humanitarian aid coordinator, Jean Egeland, pointed out to us that the situation in Darfur was the worst it had been since 2004, he was also reminding us once again that it has long been time to resolve this situation.
It is true that the UN is insisting that a United Nations mission be sent to the area, but it is also true, as has been said, that the Sudanese Governmentâs opposition makes that more difficult.
Nevertheless, as the International Crisis Group points out so often, it is our obligation to apply what is known as the responsibility to protect.
We have the responsibility to protect and we cannot shy away from it.
Three very specific things can be done with regard to Darfur: firstly, very directly, we can impose sanctions aimed directly at any actor, including the government, which is currently breaching the ceasefire or directly attacking humanitarian operations and, as has also been said specifically, and I would emphasise this, attacking the civil population, particularly women.
Secondly, the African Union can and must be used to a greater extent, in order to ensure that the different parties accept at least part of the Darfur peace agreement, but, to this end, the support of international partners, including the European Union, is also needed.
Finally, and this is the most important thing, the United Nations Security Council must speed up the process of deploying United Nations forces on the ground, in accordance with the clear mandate of ChapterÂ 7 of the United Nations Charter. Otherwise, it will be difficult to halt this massacre.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Darfur is a humanitarian disaster.
This tragic region has reached crisis point and we need to give it our full attention and take swift action, as MrÂ Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, said just a few days ago.
It would be hard to disagree with his views.
The whole world is aware that the region has continuously been at war since 2003.
As a result, 300Â 000 people have died and over 2.5Â million have been displaced.
Alarm bells have been rung in recent weeks by humanitarian organisations working in Sudan.
ThreeÂ million people in Darfur depend on international humanitarian aid, including food supplies, medical aid and shelter.
It is becoming almost impossible to provide this aid as a result of the escalating conflict in the region.
Twelve international aid workers have been killed in Darfur since the beginning of May alone, which is more than those killed over the last two years.
Although the African Union is to remain in the area until the end of the year, it is clear that it cannot put an end to the war on its own.
We should remember that this is an under-equipped and under-financed 7Â 000 strong contingent, covering an area the size of France.
Even if it were to be reinforced by a further 4Â 000 soldiers, it would be unable to assist the millions of civilians under attack in the region or to guarantee the security of international organisations and protect refugees.
A number of solutions to the problem are currently under consideration.
They range from deploying UN forces in the field, through substantial UN support for the African Union in terms of logistics and equipment, to NATO commitment to resolving the conflict.
As I see it, one thing is abundantly clear. African countries and their leaders should be much more involved in finding a solution to this pressing problem.
They are experienced, are familiar with the area and have established strong contacts there.
We should therefore encourage our African partners to become more strongly committed to finding a solution to this conflict.
Â Â  MrÂ President, everyone is saying: âDarfur is on the brink of the abyssâ.
The parties involved in the conflict continue to kill and to rape.
The civilian populations are their daily targets.
Humanitarian workers are abandoning the area under the pressure of the acts of intimidation and, indeed, murders, since 13 have been killed over the last few weeks.
The conflict is threatening the entire sub-region, extending, as it does, to Chad and to the Central African Republic.
It seems that all is now set for the final assault.
All is set for a massacre.
The government is playing a cat-and-mouse game with the international community.
It is a very cruel game that is paid for each day in hundreds of human lives.
Since 2004, the Union has spared no financial efforts, and this commitment has certainly helped to prevent carnage.
However, a firmer political commitment is now vital.
The priority is to act as quickly as possible and to deploy, in accordance with ResolutionÂ 1706, a United Nations peacekeeping force with a mandate to use force if necessary to protect the civilians.
However, the only way to protect the populations is to do so quickly, here and now - by forcing the Sudanese authorities to stop their current offensive and to apply the peace agreement to Darfur; by strengthening the mandate and by giving the material resources to the African Union forces that are on the ground and that, at the moment, do not constitute a solid enough shield to protect the civilian populations; and, as my fellow Members have said, by immediately introducing the no-fly zone provided for in United Nations ResolutionÂ 1591.
Furthermore, if appeals to reason are not enough, well, let us clear the way for sanctions: an oil embargo, an international arrest warrant, and individually targeted sanctions against the perpetrators of atrocities and, in particular, against the 51 people whose names appear on the list passed on to the International Criminal Court.
Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament will not allow the first genocide of the 21st century to take place, in silence and practically in front of its very own eyes.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of my speech is to strip away the last veil of hypocrisy surrounding the Khartoum governmentâs stance.
In 2000, I went on a visit to Sudan together with the Members of this Parliament who also sit in the ACP Assembly.
MrsÂ Kinnock and I were able to talk to Ibn al-Turabi, who was then in prison; he was an old companion in arms of Omar al-Bashir, one of the leading figures of Islamic fundamentalism in Sudan and one of the men who had organised hospitality for Osama bin Laden in Sudan.
Back then, in 2000, he spelt out to us what the Khartoum governmentâs âArabisationâ strategy consisted of.
It was a strategy to Arabise â and I mean just that: not to Islamise, but to Arabise â an area inhabited by what many official Sudanese Government documents termed the âDarfur monkeysâ, in other words the people of Darfur.
Well, if Europe acknowledges this, it now means once again that we must not simply play along with the government in Khartoum by asking to mediate between hypothetical opposing sides, because there are no opposing sides.
There is no civil war in Darfur: there are just murderers and victims.
There are just murderers acting hand in glove with the men that give the orders in Khartoum, who use them to pursue a demented ideology that is no longer likely just to lead to genocide, but will ratify a genocide that has been going on for a very long time.
It is therefore crucial for Europeâs institutions to adopt emergency measures, such as those described just now by MrsÂ Carlotti, in order to bring on board everyone who cares deeply about the lives of a generation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Darfur peace agreement was concluded in May 2006, and not one single deadline in this treaty has been met since then.
There is no less fighting, no less violence against the civilian population; indeed, both are on the increase.
Rape, carried out systematically, is still being used as a means of waging war, and a sharp increase in the number of rapes was recorded over the last three months.
The Sudanese Government is still opposed to a UN mission, which would have significantly more resources, troops and powers than the present African Union peace mission, which is largely ineffective.
Much as the expansion of the African peace mission to 11Â 000 police officers and soldiers in the Western Sudan is to be welcomed, the African Unionâs continuing and collective support for UN troops shows that this can be seen as no more than a transitional measure.
It is evident that the Sudanese Government is already planning to send its own troops to protect the region.
Amnesty International warns that âthe prospect of soon being âprotectedâ by the same government soldiers that had driven them from their homes and mistreated them, is spreading panic among the peopleâ.
Aid organisations active in the region fear that they would have to close their operations down completely if the government troops were again to come up against the bands of secessionist rebels that have not yet signed the Abuja peace treaty.
We therefore call on the Sudanese Government to comply with ChapterÂ 7 of the UN Charter and accept the presence in Darfur of a UN peacekeeping force of the kind provided for in Security Council Resolution 1706.
Sudan is standing on the brink of disaster.
Every attempt must be made to prevent another genocide on the continent of Africa.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as two Sudanese survivors told me, we need to break the silence suffered by the victims of the genocide.
It is on behalf of these silent victims of the genocide under way in Darfur that I have taken the floor today to direct an urgent appeal â a cry of distress â to you.
It is not only an MEP, but also the chairman of an international NGO that is very involved in Darfur, who is addressing you.
I belong to a generation that vowed that, after the Holocaust, there would never again be anything like it.
The words ânever againâ are uttered repeatedly, but here we are again having to talk about this issue.
Are we going to wait until all of the populations have been exterminated before we mourn for them?
How many people need to die before we intervene?
Is there a minimum threshold of people who need to be sent to concentration camps before we intervene?
In fact, I believe that there are some victims that will never be very popular.
Darfur is one of them.
MrÂ Annan declared that Darfur was hell.
Yet, it is impossible to imagine just how hellish it is for the populations tortured by the genocidal militias that are in the pay of an illegitimate government.
Are we going to add to what is a crime in itself the crime of indifference?
No!
The torturers need to know that we will not leave them alone because we cannot say that we were unaware of what was going on.
We are aware, but we are not taking action.
Europe has a powerful role to play.
Europe must put real pressure on and show itself to be more offensive in demanding an end to the atrocities and the massacres and in demanding the deployment of the United Nations forces in order to protect the civilian populations in Darfur.
This can only be achieved by means of diplomatic efforts and very strong international involvement.
For once, the army can intervene in a positive way in order to come between the murderers and the murdered.
We must demand a solution to the militias and we must call for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
As a number of my fellow Members before me have said, let us waste no time, for we are actually witnessing the first genocide of the 21st century.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, unfortunately the war in Lebanon and the clash in the Middle East have taken up international interest and the international news at the expense of tragic developments in Darfur, where there is a humanitarian crisis, genocide, ethnic cleansing and a criminal war.
We have UN Security Council Resolution 1706, which we are calling for to be applied.
With Resolution 1701 on Lebanon we had international action for its full application.
Five resolutions later, however, in Resolution 1706, we unfortunately find â as regards its application âinternational indifference and international hypocrisy.
Two sets of standards for this major humanitarian crisis which is ultimately also undermining our common European values and principles.
I believe, Commissioner, that the European Union basically has a moral responsibility, not only a political and strategic responsibility, to take initiatives.
The bureaucratic resolutions of the Council of Ministers alone do not suffice.
On 20Â October we have the summit.
What is needed from your side also is for the European Union to take an initiative in the Security Council, so that there is a common stand by all the members of the Security Council on the resolution of the problem, on the application at long last of Resolution 1706 and, because we need to speak honestly, there is an obligation for initiatives to be taken on China.
China is one of the countries which is responsible for the prolongation of this impasse, of this crisis.
The Arab League has the same responsibility.
So take initiatives towards the Arab League, the Islamic conference, China, Russia and even the United States.
The bland statements by MrÂ Bush and the US Congress do not suffice and, finally, Commissioner, the of international law relating to the right of international intervention when human rights are being trampled underfoot must be applied.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have all witnessed the crimes against humanity committed on Sudanese soil over the last three years.
They include genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing.
While we watch helplessly from our ivory towers, the Sudanese state is failing to fulfil the basic duty required of any state, namely to ensure the security of the population of a given territory.
We gaze down from Brussels and Strasbourg on events in Sudan, despite the fact that the European Union arose from a political and moral protest against crimes of that nature.
Each successive enlargement was heralded by the same clarion call: never again, never again will we allow such crimes against humanity, never again will we permit ethnic cleansing, never again will we tolerate genocide!
In the statements made today by representatives of the European Union, I did not detect such strong commitment to ensure that the European Union actually does all that lies within its power to stop the widespread slaughter in Sudan.
What steps should be taken?
Over the coming weeks, the Union should focus on exerting effective pressure on the government in Khartoum to ensure that it agrees to the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops on Sudanese territory.
Should that endeavour not be successful, and should the government in Khartoum continue to refuse to countenance the presence of UN peacekeepers on its territory, then it would be appropriate to further increase the logistical and material support provided to the African Union mission to Sudan.
If all that fails to impact on what is happening in Sudan, we should consider calling on NATO forces to ensure that the African Unionâs military mission is in a position to guarantee peace and security across the territory of Sudan.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an excellent, robust debate.
I can assure you that the Council does not view the situation in Sudan and Darfur apathetically.
We all agree that developments there have been very worrying, and we must do everything in our power now and in the future to improve the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur.
We are constantly doing everything in our power, or at least a good deal.
We are maintaining active diplomatic contact with the various parties and third countries in order to gain the widest possible support for the UN Resolution and its implementation, and to be able to step up the pressure on the Sudanese Government.
Special Representative Pekka Haavisto has an important role to play in Sudan in ensuring that all parties there commit to this peace process, as otherwise there can be no lasting peace.
It is very important, and a positive sign, that the African Union has, through its AMIS operation, shown itself to be strongly committed to resolving this crisis.
That dedication has had the support of the European Union, and this continues to be the case, as the EU lends support to the AMIS operation in the form of logistics, material aid, planning assistance and other similar measures.
The African Union has decided to increase its peacekeeping presence â that is, its AMIS operation â by an additional 4Â 000 troops, meaning there will be a total of 11Â 000 troops stationed in the region.
When the UN operation is finally underway in the region, the easiest way to promote its acceptability in the eyes of the Sudanese Government may be for it to be made up of African and Asian troops.
We also have to remember that the other neighbouring countries in the region have a very important role to play when it comes to border issues and refugee problems.
The human rights situation in the area is very worrying, as has been mentioned in this debate.
The European Union has highlighted these human rights issues by including them in the agenda of the UN Human Rights Council now in process.
With regard to the issue of genocide, and the use of this term in particular, we should remember that the International Criminal Court is investigating this at present, and the European Union supports the work it is doing.
There is not just one key to a solution on Darfur and Sudan.
It is very important that we make progress along all the paths open to us in an effective, broad-based, and coordinated way, and in a spirit of cooperation.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree entirely with the conclusions expressed by the Minister, who is representing the Presidency.
I do not think anyone in this Chamber is in any doubt about the catastrophic scale of the Darfur tragedy, just as there cannot be any doubt that it really is genocide.
Today's debate, however, touches on a much more general political problem that is extremely important for this Parliament and for the European Unionâs institutions in general: the Unionâs role as the promoter and defender of fundamental rights outside its borders.
We often wonder whether the European Union can and must (I personally think it can and it must) be a standard-bearer throughout the world for the fundamental rights primarily of respect for human dignity â human dignity that has been utterly destroyed in the Darfur tragedy.
For it to play that role, however, the great political debate that we must address is how Europe can take these values beyond its borders and uphold them when there are other parties like the Sudanese Government, which tolerates and encourages fundamentalism and the most violent, horrible excesses committed by the militias.
Well, many of you have said in no uncertain terms, âLet us go in with troops and weapons to implement Article 7; let us send in a military force that can use force to put an end to this catastrophic situation.â
I am well aware that this is one of the options provided for in the international treaties, but then I remember that, when promoting human rights around the world, we Europeans have often talked of guaranteeing the so-called principle of ownership: in other words, we cannot decide here in Strasbourg or Brussels on the right path for another country or continent to follow and simply impose it on them.
We have to work with the local institutions and, in my view, the first part of the solution will be to work with the African Union, strengthening its role and ensuring that it gets the practical help it needs.
We do not want Europe to be seen as aloof one moment and suddenly in there the next, deploying troops and weaponry and playing a role that, if anything, the African Union ought to be consolidating and strengthening.
As the Presidency has just pointed out, that is the first step.
The second step along this path will be to provide logistical assistance on the ground.
That is a job that we â the European Union and its institutions â can do, and the Commission can also provide economic aid.
How can we guarantee that the humanitarian aid will actually reach its intended destination: the suffering population and the NGO workers on the ground who are risking their lives?
Logistical assistance on the ground is thus another area where we, the European Union, can make a difference.
The third step, which has not really been given enough weight by some people, is how to work with the Arab League.
Ladies and gentlemen, we come up against the sensitivities of Islamic or Arab countries in many parts of the world.
In some cases they are our staunch allies, as in the fight against terrorism, for instance.
In other cases they prove so extremely sensitive that it is advisable for us to reach agreements before intervening.
What is the difference between Darfur and Lebanon?
The difference is that in the case of Lebanon there was an agreement, and the troops went in as peacekeepers because the Lebanese Government and the Israeli Government both accepted it.
The Sudanese Government, on the other hand, still rejects the idea.
Do you believe that it would be possible to intervene unilaterally without a strong role for the Arab League?
Do you not think that, without a strong role for the Arab League, such action would send out an extremely negative signal to that enormous population â which unfortunately harbours the most fundamentalist ideas in the world?
Would that not strengthen the extremists and fundamentalists, who would then have a further argument in their propaganda arsenal?
The third part of the solution, therefore, is the Arab League.
We are working to encourage the Arab League to distance itself from the Government of Sudan and to withdraw its consent and support; as you know, this is happening to a certain extent, but we have to do more along these lines.
Then there is another point that somebody mentioned: what if the Khartoum Government does not listen to the international community?
I have always been of the opinion that military action must only be used as a last resort, even if humanitarian intervention is justified under ArticleÂ 7 of the Treaty.
There are some other middle paths.
In this context I heard somebody mention a âno-fly zoneâ; that is a measure that could be explored, adopted and proposed.
You realise that, if we proposed action under ArticleÂ 7 to the Security Council, China, like it or not, would probably use its veto and so nothing would happen.
I wonder, therefore, whether it might not be better to work on an initiative â which might not solve the problem but it would help â such as stopping aircraft from overflying the area and killing people with bombs and air strikes.
That is another concrete possibility.
I shall end my speech with two remarks.
First, President Barroso and my colleague Louis Michel will be going to Khartoum.
They will be sending the highest echelons of the Sudanese Government a strong message explaining that the European Union intends to take strong diplomatic action, as well as action on the ground to help the people who are suffering.
The message will refer to the isolation to which Sudan would be consigned if it continued to refuse to listen to the international community.
Such isolation would be particularly devastating for Sudan itself: being isolated from the rest of the international community would not be in Khartoumâs interests; that, then, ladies and gentlemen, would take away President Bashirâs excuse for maintaining such a negative attitude.
Another very important point that the Commissionâs action will address is the role of women and children.
We talk about this subject all the time here in Europe: we worry about the victims of human trafficking and forced prostitution and we have even set out a European roadmap for childrenâs rights.
Naturally, we cannot shut our eyes to the rights of women and children outside Europe in such a tragic case as Darfur.
Personally, therefore, I hope that this Parliament will stand firm in its measures on Darfur precisely so as to provide special protection for women and children, who are, as always, the victims most at risk.
Â Â  â I have received 6 motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 103 (2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Mr Sajjad Karim, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the EU's economic and trade relations with India [2006/2034(INI)], (A6-0256/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, as the geopolitical centre of gravity shifts to Asia in the 21st century, if you look at India you see the future.
Considering its size and complexity, Indiaâs stable and vibrant society remains a monumental achievement.
Its commitment to democracy, pluralism and the rule of law guarantees consistency in trade relations.
Yet, for a country approaching a fifth of the worldâs population, India counts for less than one fiftieth of world trade.
As Indiaâs largest trading partner and principal source of foreign investment, the EU is poised to help India reap the benefits of liberalisation.
With our shared history and commitment to secular government and religious pluralism, the EU and India are natural partners.
We became strategic partners in June 2004, yet it was another year before a joint action plan was agreed.
Even today, the Commissioner lacks the authorisation to turn the work of the high-level trade groups into a concrete deal.
In the meantime, President Bush has succeeded in brokering a quite frankly worrying US-India nuclear deal.
The Commissioner claims India as his destination of choice â and of course I mean Commissioner Mandelson here â yet has fuelled EU obsession with China.
India poses equal, if distinct, challenges for the EU and the Commission must reflect that as it lays out its new strategy by working with stakeholders to mirror its China consultation.
The Doha round remains the chief mechanism for shaping equitable globalisation.
The multilateral trading system is a most just and effective way of expanding and managing trade and it shields the weak from the use and abuse in the unilateral scramble for trade domination.
However, a Doha deal does not preclude bilateral WTO-plus arrangements.
Only through greater openness to partnerships that go beyond what a lowest common denominator WTO deal could now provide, will the EU begin to address the global competitiveness agenda of the future.
A free trade agreement with India must be central to the Commissionâs new global Europe strategy.
This House must back the Commissioner 100% as he makes the case to the Council for a negotiating mandate to deliver bilateral FTAs, opening markets and securing fairer trading conditions in new areas of growth throughout Asia.
India must match our resolve and bolster its promises for Helsinki.
India has proved itself adept at juggling global players to boost competitiveness.
It is time for a deal with its most obvious partner.
Deadlines must be set so that we can achieve common ambitions in the areas that will dictate the terms of the 21st century: protection of intellectual property rights, open markets for services and investment, and effective trade defence instruments.
No strategy for economic growth is complete without addressing the growing crisis of climate change.
The impact of growth in Asia on energy supply is phenomenal.
Indiaâs future growth is dependent on meeting spiralling energy needs.
Severe shortages and over-dependency on petrol and coal are driving up costs and pollution.
An effort to develop nuclear energy is symptomatic of that crisis.
However, even if India did develop nuclear energy it would meet only 2% of total energy requirements.
It would also constitute a climb-down from Gleneagles pledges to halt climate change and promote energy conservation.
Both India and the EU have long traditions of promoting renewable energy.
India has built the worldâs fourth largest wind power industry, developed biogas digesters and solar cells and supported the development of renewable energy in Asia.
We must work together to define the global energy architecture through innovation and sustainable energy development whilst meeting climate change benchmarks.
Indiaâs economic growth is booming at 8% and is set to double in a decade.
Dotcom benefactors make up Indiaâs rich list, cashing in as India becomes the global hub for ITC development.
Yet Indiaâs economy remains full of paradoxes.
The uneven distribution of the benefits of globalisation has left nearly four million people living on less than one dollar per day.
The EU must ensure that the benefits of our trading relationship are shared with Indians â all of them.
International trade can be a powerful driver of economic growth and poverty reduction but it is not a silver bullet.
To continue to lift people out of pockets of poverty, Indiaâs trade reforms must complement development policies.
Linking external and internal policies is not aided by Indiaâs infrastructure, which displays characteristics of a developing nation while seats of enterprise dominate the skylines of Mumbai and Bangalore.
Investment must focus on rural areas, providing better water supplies and sanitation, improving transport links and the quality of grid power output.
India is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and its own five-year plan exceeds UN expectations, but there is increased doubt that India will meet four out of the eight goals on schedule.
Serious concerns remain over child labour and the spread of HIV/AIDS has a potential to disrupt Indiaâs progress.
Trade relations cannot be divorced from human rights and development concerns.
We have a duty to India to reverse those trends.
EU assistance must be directed to lagging regions and under-represented social groups.
Capacity-building efforts must focus on the poorest states, enabling them to use funds effectively.
Foreign investment must provide funds for education and rural health.
As India moves from developing to developed, it bears regional responsibility and sustained growth.
It must take its neighbours with it.
SAFTA will bring manifold expansion in the region.
True, it has not been smooth sailing and Indo-Pak disputes have stalled progress, but strong leadership in the region has led to trade now being used as a confidence-building measure, particularly over Kashmir.
Europe must look at Asia and consider its astonishing growth as an opportunity rather than a threat.
The EU needs more confidence about its ability to manage change and remain competitive.
Inevitably it will require some restructuring and a change of mindset.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karim, and the International Trade Committee, for the excellent work that has been done.
The report is comprehensive, addressing almost all possible aspects of EU-India economic and trade relations.
This report is also timely, as it takes place ahead of the forthcoming EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October 2006, and we will take its recommendations into consideration.
Our cooperation with India is manifold and it is difficult to address it exhaustively in this speech.
Therefore, I will point to some of the main features that respond to your concerns and also update the House in more detail on the trade and investment issues.
Generally, our cooperation is good and is making progress.
Regarding the environment, for instance, last year India hosted the first EU-India forum on waste management, which was followed by various visits by and meetings of the working party on that issue.
The holding of the second Environment Forum is under discussion.
Regarding employment and social issues, the Commission and the Indian Labour Minister agreed in a bilateral meeting a work programme for 2006 and 2007 based on the Joint Action Plan.
A draft memorandum of understanding is to be signed, or initialled, at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit.
More broadly, following a bilateral meeting between Commissioner Almunia and the Indian Finance Minister, the launch of regular macroeconomic dialogue has been proposed.
The business side has not been forgotten and thanks to Commissioner Mandelson, who pushed forward the idea with his counterpart Trade Minister Nath, the EU-India CEO Round Table, allowing active business-to-business dialogue, is now ready to be launched at the Business Summit on 12 October 2006.
Our development cooperation is concentrated on sector support for elementary education, health and family welfare.
Poverty alleviation has been the central objective in all projects.
The Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2007 to 2013 reaffirms that commitment with an approximately 65Â toÂ 70% allocation to the health and education sectors.
Encouragingly, our State Partnership Programmes with Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, amounting to a total contribution of EURÂ 160 million towards supporting water management, education and health, have been signed and can now be implemented.
Turning to trade and investment relations with India, I welcome the fact that the conclusions of the report adopted by the International Trade Committee fully support the Commission's approach.
More specifically, the Committee has called on the European Union to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with India.
India is keen to launch a free trade agreement with the European Union as soon as possible.
This has been the Indian position for a long time, pushed by Prime Minister Singh himself.
I welcome the committee's first comment that negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) are not incompatible with bilateral WTO-plus negotiations.
The European Union seeks to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral WTO trading system with a new generation of bilateral FTAs, in particular with key growing markets in Asia.
The European Union continues to see the WTO as the fundamental platform on which to build global liberalisation.
There will be no retreat from multilateralism.
An EU-India FTA can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement markets, competition policy and regulatory harmonisation, that are related directly to EU trading strengths not yet fully addressed by WTO rules or standards.
We have made sure that the economic case for an EU-India FTA is watertight and that there is a similar level of understanding and ambition on India's part, which is necessary for any negotiation to work.
To that end, I welcome the committee's support for the High Level Trade Group's work.
On 19 September 2006, the High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the EU-India Summit on 13 October 2006, which recommended that an expanded-trade partnership be developed through the negotiation of a broad-based trade and investment agreement.
The summit will recommend that both EU and India move towards negotiations for such an agreement.
Although we will not be launching an FTA at the summit, we will, however, be making positive signals that we are heading in that direction.
We do not just want to launch but to prepare the ground for successful negotiations.
This may mean further work on some of the more sensitive issues after the summit, so that we improve understanding of each otherâs expectations and possibilities for movement.
Accordingly, I share the committeeâs views that there is a need to deepen discussion on services negotiations, intellectual property rights and public procurement.
Finally, I also share the committeeâs concern about the low level of intra-regional trade in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its recommendation to SAARC to review opportunities to expand trade and investment in the region.
We are following closely the problem of Pakistanâs non-implementation of schedules under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement and addressing this informally with this country.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to warmly congratulate MrÂ Karim on his excellent report on India.
It is a complex report, as is only to be expected, since presenting an overview of economic and commercial cooperation between the European Union and India, whilst also highlighting the challenges facing the latter, is a complex task.
I believe the rapporteur has dealt with it very well.
I appreciate the significance of the economic and commercial issues contained in the report, but I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for supporting the opinion of the Committee on Development, and viewing India not just as a country undergoing dynamic economic development, a country with great potential and an important trading and economic partner for Europe, but also as a country with a particularly complex social structure, and a country of great inequalities in terms of development levels and in the distribution of profits gained.
At the same time, India is a country struggling with major problems that are typical for developing countries, such as poverty or illiteracy.
As I emphasised in my report for the Committee on Development, the main thrust of the strategic partnership between the European Union and India must continue to be work aimed at attaining the Millennium Development Goals and the war on poverty.
I would like to draw attention to two significant development policy issues which affect cooperation between the European Union and India.
Economic growth in India has averaged 6% a year over the last tenÂ years.
Nonetheless, almost 30% of Indiaâs population, some 400Â million people, are still living below the poverty line, existing on less that a dollar a day.
The level of illiteracy is almost 40%.
It is vital that economic and trade cooperation between the European Union and India helps to redress this unfortunate imbalance.
Our efforts must be directed at improving the lot of the poorest sections of society and at promoting best practices in the regions with the highest economic growth.
Cooperation in the fields of health and education should also be deepened.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this document is basically economic in nature, but it contains a far broader message for both partners. That message relates to political, social, educational, scientific and developmental matters.
We overcame minor differences between political groupings to reach common positions which were often the result of compromise.
India can assume from this resolution that the whole of Europe is united in its desire to cooperate with a country with such a great historical heritage and economic potential.
Of course, for our part, we shall highlight the difficulties affecting the people of India.
In line with European standards, however, these difficulties should be openly discussed and gradually resolved.
In order to achieve successful cooperation involving entrepreneurs and citizens, shared common values and aims need to be established.
If that is not the case, all that will emerge will be declarations signed by governments and politicians, and we have seen plenty of ineffective documents of that sort drawn up by this House.
We are hoping for genuine cooperation that draws on the experience of past relationships, mainly between the United Kingdom and India.
We trust, however, that it will develop into a cooperation partnership , free from the fetters of the past, which may be read as a reference to colonialism.
This document will serve as a basis and a springboard for a healthy exchange benefiting both partners.
As shadow rapporteur, I move that it be adopted as it stands.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, and also thank the rapporteur for this excellent report, which touches on all the issues that are relevant when talking about India.
The Commissioner mentioned one specific point to which I think we should give in-depth consideration, and that is that India might finally become a geopolitical centre in the 21st century.
I think he is right about that and the European Union and the Commission will have to make up their minds.
You cannot say âeither India or Chinaâ; that is not the right approach.
But we will certainly have to focus, because to deal with both countries and many more countries to come as regards bilateral agreements might be something that is impossible for the Commission whilst making sure that the multilateral round flourishes.
So I would like to point out to the rapporteur and the House that my Group will be a little more cautious when it comes to a free-trade agreement.
We are not against a free-trade agreement; quite the opposite.
We already argued in favour of a free-trade agreement and regional agreement in 2002, when I presented my own report to this House, but I think we should first have an in-depth debate and discussion on the issue.
The Commission will produce its new policy report on 4 October, in only a few weeks.
So we will not support a free-trade agreement at the moment, because we want to have a debate in our Group first and we want to be clear that Parliament will be fully involved in the debate and the consultation process.
It is important and relevant to see a shift from the multilateral to the more bilateral agreement and to make sure that there is some coherence when it comes to trade policy.
That is one of the reasons why tomorrow we are not going to support the idea of a free-trade agreement at this stage.
I am happy also that Mr Karim touched on the various high-tech issues.
I think it is absolutely essential that we focus more on India and cooperate more closely with it.
Now, everything I said is not on behalf of Glyn Ford, who is the shadow rapporteur.
He apologises to MrÂ Karim for not being here.
He has to go back to England, but he will certainly follow up the issues and discuss them in detail.
Â Â  I would like to thank the rapporteur for clearly emphasising the importance of the financial sector to the development of the Indian economy.
This is a factor which is crucial for Indian and European Union economic cooperation.
The volume of investment is quite dependant on the confidence of investors in the target countries and applied standards of regulation of financial markets and accounting.
Thus it would be a good idea to invite the Indian business community to take its cue from the accumulated expertise of the European Union in ensuring proper investor protection.
I would like to ask the Commission to further promote the experience we have acquired and the European Union financial regulation model that we have been developing and applying so that the Indian business community can take advantage of our expertise in the field.
To that end, the work of the Commission must be further coordinated so that Commissioners working in different fields can communicate on a larger scale and so that cooperation with third countries would not only be a task for those engaged in the field but also for all other Commissioners.
One of the major challenges is that the Indian financial sector is not sufficiently liberalised.
It requires huge investments, especially for expanding business activities to rural areas.
Without development of rural areas, Indian progress is simply unfeasible.
But the development of the Indian financial sector will not be possible without input from the major world and European banks.
Therefore, we should promote cooperation and invite the Indian regulators to take part in joint European Union and third country expert groups in drafting relevant legislation to ensure that appropriate conditions for common work are provided for in the early stages.
I would also like to support bilateral dialogue, full-fledged economic cooperation between the European Union and India, and reaching common agreements, particularly since multilateral negotiations do not always properly take relation-specific requirements into account.
Â Â  MrÂ President, during our previous part-session, we had a report on EU trade with China in which we were severely critical of Chinaâs human rights violations. Today, the subject is trade with India.
The report is excellent.
I was able to concur with most of what it said, and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will, of course, vote in favour of the report.
I wish, however, to concentrate here on one big issue: that of why human rights problems are not accorded importance in the report.
They are discussed, but in very general terms.
Moreover, the worst problem - and probably one of the worldâs most extensive human rights problems â is almost not mentioned at all.
I am thinking, of course, of the Dalits, who are casteless.
They are mentioned, but in conjunction with the Adivasis, as if all that was at issue was a general problem involving minorities.
The Dalits are a despised underclass in several countries, but they are, in particular, Indiaâs problem. They are not only poor and socially excluded.
The situation is worse than that. They are treated as if they were not human beings at all.
They are untouchable, detested by the other population groups and at the bottom of the pile socially.
They do have rights, but only on paper.
In reality, they have no rights, and they do the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. That, moreover, is of course what is interesting in this case.
It is they who, in industry and agriculture, work with chemicals so poisonous as to be banned in most of the world.
Without instructions or protection, they spray the fields with deadly neurotoxins. In factories, they stand bare-footed in acid baths and colour our textiles.
No one else would tolerate these things, but the Dalits are forced to do so.
What is more, the EU deals in Indian products without asking candid questions about how they were made.
It is a nasty business for India, but it is almost more awkward for Europe, which is well aware of what is happening.
Often, we ourselves have sold them the dangerous products.
Thousands of people are harmed and many die, and they are Dalits.
The Dalits have no voice and no trade union. We ourselves are obliged to be their voice if the outrages are to be brought to an end.
The problem needs to be on the EUâs agenda, and it is disgraceful that it is not clearly included in this report.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I offer MrÂ Karim and all the Committee on International Trade my heartfelt thanks for the excellent work that they have done on this report.
India is the worldâs most populous democracy and, with a growth rate of 9% in 2005 alone, its rapid economic development as well as its geopolitical characteristics represent yet another challenge to the European Union on the worldâs markets.
In many respects it is a fascinating challenge and it may bring potential benefits for Europe, but there are also possible risks.
In India, 400Â million people live on less than a dollar a day.
Sixty-five per cent of the population work in the agricultural sector, with its antiquated structures and methods.
Nuclear power is used just as a deterrent in the long-standing war with its neighbour Pakistan, but it is little used to promote ecologically sound development, and that makes the country dependent on energy from abroad and forces it to look around the world for the energy sources it needs for its development.
India is a country of great wealth and great poverty, and even today it is difficult for women to find work, apart from the most menial duties, and particularly skilled work, which means that it is difficult for women to be accepted as entrepreneurs.
It is not a simple matter to talk of India on account of its vast size and all the variables that that entails, but India also represents a major hope for improving the distribution of international trade.
India is also a great country with an extremely fast-growing GDP and a highly competent class of people able to keep up with the new international challenges in the field of advanced technology.
The economy is moving ahead in many regions, and the gates have been opened to foreign investment, although Europe seems so far to have been excluded.
India only accounts for 1% of Europeâs total trade.
Hence we see a need to form a strategic partnership between these two great blocks, in order to create a more fertile climate for cooperation, with better mutual understanding to bring down the barriers between us by adhering to mutually agreed rules.
The recent disagreements in the Doha Round in Geneva led to a few difficulties, but India and the European Union should accept the responsibility of revitalising a multilateral framework.
As a country at an advanced stage of development but with profound social imbalances, this Asian giant needs a stronger European presence that can help it achieve more balanced growth.
On the European side, there has to be a fair, open approach aimed at reinforcing Europeâs presence in India and duly supporting our initiatives in that part of the world.
What is happening, as should also happen in connection with the growing economic expansion of China, is that Europe is seeking a strategy for itself in relation to the rest of the world.
We must not, however, ignore the scourge of child labour, in many cases involving very young children.
This is extremely common in the Indian economy, which lacks minimum standards of social protection for the weakest sections of society; the caste system also makes it difficult for part of the population to live and to grow.
Therefore, while we have the utmost respect for the traditions of this great country, we need to call on the Indian political and economic classes and the companies that operate in India to adopt a highly responsible position and to use every means to fight the problem of children who work rather than study, promoting instead the expansion of literacy, which is the real hope for people in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, economic analysts are of the opinion that, by 2015, India, which is considered to be an âAsian tigerâ, will have become the fourth most powerful economy in the world.
India will therefore become a strong counterbalance to China in trading terms.
In the first quarter of this year, the rate of growth of the Indian economy increased to over 9%.
As it moves on from being a developing country and comes to be recognised as a developed one, India is aspiring to catch up with China and take the lead in Asia.
We should, therefore, attach particular importance to trade relations with India.
The European Union is already Indiaâs main trading partner. Trade with Member States of the European Union accounts for over 22% of exports from India.
Indiaâs industry has risen to global challenges and welcomes science-based development as a business strategy.
The large numbers of young, well-educated Indians who are cheap to employ and speak competent English represent a great asset to their country.
They should become an advantage in terms of our bilateral relations.
There are other factors, however, that the Union ought to draw to Indiaâs attention.
Over 390Â million Indian citizens are living on less than a dollar a day and the statistics for child labour in India are amongst the highest in the world.
This has to change.
The war on poverty must become a key feature of the strategic partnership between the European Union and India.
We should also strive to ensure that India is better represented at the IMF.
In addition, it would be appropriate to launch an initiative aimed at drawing up a free trade agreement with India. This would strengthen our strategic trading partnership for many years to come.
MrÂ Karim has drawn up a good report that deserves our support.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, and I should like to congratulate MrÂ Karim on the welcome approach taken in his report.
As a representative of the European Parliament and a member of the Committee on Development, I can only be delighted that India has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and that, through its actions, the Indian Government has shown for some time that it can be a reliable partner for possible future interaction and collaboration, not least in the commercial arena.
I feel, however, that the efforts made so far in the fight against child labour, dumping â especially in the textile and footwear industries â and piracy, and to steer development along ecologically sound lines have been feeble and insufficient.
The Union has a duty to support and encourage India so as to resolve such substantial problems by means of long-awaited and far-reaching structural reforms.
Asiaâs largest democracy has a responsibility to implement well-defined social reforms in order to overcome todayâs caste-based society, which has considerable adverse effects both on access to education and services and on the more general condition of womenâs lives.
Fairness and equal opportunities should, therefore, be seen as targets to be achieved in the medium term through serious commitment and a tangible effort, while the economic field requires suitable financial reforms that will abolish non-tariff barriers and import duties and open up the market.
If the system were improved, it could and should lead to the development of long-term peaceful relations with its neighbouring countries, not least by increasing trade with Pakistan.
It should also encourage trade on the internal market as well as synergies among the various regions, which are today characterised by enormous socio-economic disparities.
On these bases and within this framework, we have to promise our full, staunch support for this country.
Having been on its knees for a long time, it is now ready to get up and play its part on the world stage.
Â Â  â Mr President, the size and dynamic rate of growth make India an important trading and economic partner of the Union.
As we all know, India is the only large, dynamically developing economy in Asia where the European Union has a leading position in terms of foreign trade and outgoing foreign investments.
Nonetheless, bilateral trade is uneven, as India is only the Union's tenth trading partner.
At the same time, however, it should be stressed that India is the biggest beneficiary under the Generalised System of Preferences, with preferential access to the Union's market.
Despite the spectacular increase in bilateral cooperation, the volume of trade and investments is below the current potential.
In my opinion, the results of exploratory contracts on a bilateral trade and investment agreement are a positive development.
However, an actual agreement will depend upon strong political will on both sides.
Under no circumstances, however, should such a bilateral agreement be interpreted in terms of a negation of our attachment to multilateralism.
Within this framework, attention will need to be paid, among other things, to the high import duties and extensive technical barriers maintained by India.
Issues of common interest, such as more effective protection for intellectual property and geographical indications are especially important.
Finally, one important parameter of the broader strategic partnership is further support for synergies in the sector of science and technology.
In addition, as the Commissioner mentioned, the prospects for strengthening intraregional relations between the Union and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation need to be investigated and broadened.
To close, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Karim on his creative contribution to the work of the Committee on International Trade and the European Parliament in general.
Â Â  Mr President, let me add my congratulations to Mr Karim on an excellent report.
As his report clearly demonstrates, when we are discussing India, the first problem is to decide which India we are discussing.
Is it the India with nearly four million households earning over EURÂ 150Â 000 a year and with more graduates than any other country?
Or is it the India with 390 million people living on less than a dollar a day, where two out of five of people are illiterate and where the so-called IT revolution only touches one in fifty Indians?
I hope, as a Parliament, we are interested in both.
If India overcomes its infrastructure problems, most notably its persistent power cuts and poor transport networks, then I believe that within a generation it has the potential to be Europeâs largest trading partner, more important than China or the United States.
I therefore welcome what Commissioner Borg said about the High Level Trade Groupâs recommendations.
I believe we should intensify our trade and investment relations with India.
However, at this stage, I agree with Mrs Mann and Mr Papastamkos that we should stop short of a free-trade area, because we would not want India to be used as an example to denigrate the prospect of a successful DDA outcome.
We must put our eggs in the DDA basket first and foremost, and anything else should be seen as a digression from that.
Mr Papastamkos rightly points out that 77% of Indian goods come into the EU market duty-free through the GSP.
The GSP places an obligation on India to improve its core labour standards.
India must do more to tackle child labour and bonded labour, and must sign up to ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and the right to collective bargaining.
India signed up to the Millennium Development Goals and the EU, with our cooperation, should help by facilitating universal education, Eurohealth programmes and policies to get young people from poor areas into work.
I believe that trade and development go hand in hand, but only if we work at it.
It will not be automatic.
We must have the political will to deliver on both.
I welcome the reportâs emphasis on both those aspects of our relations with India.
Â Â  Mr President, the economic and trade relations between the European Union and India are of paramount importance for both partners, and it is for that reason that both the EU and India must make every effort to remove any unnecessary obstacles, not least in the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
India must do all it can in the G-20 in order to restore the Doha Development Agenda.
The fact is that the multilateral trade system offers a country such as India enormous potential.
That is why that country will need to make a reasonable offer in the form of a reduction of its import tariffs.
Moreover, the issue of import tariffs must certainly be raised at bilateral level.
Time after time, the Commission has underlined the importance of sound bilateral agreements, and that is what I am doing now.
Both tariff and non-tariff-related obstacles constitute a considerable barrier to European enterprises.
I would call on the Indian authorities to end this protectionist policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU is Indiaâs biggest trading partner, and as such has a natural interest in the countryâs economic development.
Recently, the news has been good.
Indiaâs economic growth has been rapid, there has been commitment to a reduction in child labour, and India is one of the most proactive countries as far as action to combat dumping is concerned.
India is also trying to reform its financial position, and is planning to remove restrictions on the rupee.
Furthermore, the current human rights dialogue between the EU and India has got off to an encouraging start.
Indiaâs National Human Rights Commission has been working meticulously.
At the same time, there have also been worrying developments.
The gulf in living standards between the cities and the countryside is growing, and the environmental load is increasing.
Nearly 400Â million Indians, approximately a third of the countryâs population, live on an income of less than a dollar a day.
The massive growth in the economy is very unevenly spread: 40% of the population are illiterate.
Ever-continuing discrimination based on the caste system in the country contributes to the unequal distribution of wealth and even the dwindling opportunities for economic growth.
The worst off are the casteless Dalits, whose rights the authorities do not monitor closely enough.
I appreciate the fact that the worldâs largest democracy is actively aiming to correct these shortcomings that can be seen in its society through legislation.
Positive discrimination is an example of this.
Legislation is not enough, though: there also needs to be more effort put into implementation.
Good policy decisions should be systematically put into practice by the local authorities.
If the situation continues, much of the Indian peopleâs potential and many of their skills will remain untapped.
At the same time, I would make a serious request to the Council that it should put the following issues on the agenda of the EU-India Summit in Helsinki: the status of Indiaâs disadvantaged, its environmental problems and how prepared it is to cope with natural disasters.
Furthermore, the dialogue on energy which was begun in the spring should continue, because the main determining factor in Indiaâs future economic growth is its ability to meet its demand for energy, one that is growing at a staggering rate.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with only a few weeks to go before the next EU-India summit, we must pay tribute to Europeâs commitment to put more effort into its cooperation with India.
This great democracy is not only one of our privileged partners in Asia, but it is also an actor with ever greater responsibilities, both regionally and internationally.
It is for that reason that I am grateful to my fellow Member, MrÂ Karim, for pointing out that our relations with India are not limited merely to the commercial field, but that they are bolstered by extensive cooperation in a vast number of areas.
India has embarked on major reforms in relation to the promotion of the Millennium Development Goals, even though that may at times appear insufficient.
It has committed itself to protecting the environment, to applying the international standards on labour law and to combating poverty and AIDS.
Initiatives such as those must be encouraged and supported by a strong political will and by financial resources that are sufficient to meet the needs of this continent country.
Enhanced university cooperation between India and the European Union is indeed crucial, but we must ensure at all costs that we counter any possible brain drain, as that would deprive this country of its greatest asset.
Let us not forget that our relations must be guided by the notion of partnership and of mutual exchange.
We therefore cannot regard India merely as a huge pool of cheap labour.
The optimistic view that we have of our future cooperation with India must not conceal an ever difficult reality.
As this report highlights, certain sectors of the Indian economy are very fragile.
I am thinking, in particular, of the farming sector, which is suffering from the effects of the uncontrolled liberalisation of trade.
That is why I am surprised â and I agree in this respect with what various Members have said â that the conclusion of a free trade agreement should have been proposed.
Not only would a decision such as that be premature, but I must point out that the European Union has committed itself to acting first and foremost within the context of the Doha Round.
To talk from now on about supporting bilateral negotiations would run counter to the principles that we have been upholding for months and would be a very bad sign for the multilateral structure that we earnestly desire.
I shall conclude.
If our aim is indeed to have trade work in favour of development, then our trade relations will have to be conceived in a concerted and gradual manner within a rational and solid framework with our partner.
Â Â  Mr President, the EUâs strategic partnership with democratic India is of vital importance for both the EU and India.
I welcome the strengthening of political and economic dialogue and engagement as well as discussions on human rights at the India-EU Summit on 13 October.
However, given the astonishing recent growth of Indiaâs economy and its emerging global big-power status, our partnership must now deepen.
Therefore I strongly favour a bilateral India-EU free trade agreement.
That would have mutually beneficial results as our economies are complementary, as India needs our high-tech finished products and we need their services and basic machinery.
We are already Indiaâs biggest trading partner, at some EUR 40 billion annually, and we collaborate now on high-tech projects such as Galileo and ITER, demonstrating the sophistication of Indiaâs 8% annual growth economy.
I also call for enhanced regional cooperation and economic integration of India and Pakistan with SAARC and SAFTA, which enhances the confidence-building measures between the two states which, until recently, were on the verge of war.
The line of control between the divided regions of Jammu and Kashmir could eventually be just a line on the map, if people, goods and services could flow freely.
Pakistan should desist from its restrictive positive list of freely traded goods and change to a more liberal negative list as expected by MFN and SAFTA rules.
India is fast becoming the prime south-Asian geopolitical player and it is high time that the UN Security Council admitted the largest democracy in the world to its ranks as a permanent member.
China is our second largest trading partner, but the EU does not share the same fundamental values with it as we do with India.
That fact needs greater recognition in this House.
Coming from Britain, with our traditional links to India, I commend the Karim report and call on the Commission to develop a much deeper political and economic India-EU relationship culminating in a bilateral free trade agreement.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too wish to take my turn in congratulating MrÂ Karim on the truly important report which he has presented to us.
However, I should like to touch on another matter.
Obviously we all support the development of a strategic partnership with India.
India is a strong emerging economy, a new geostrategic pole in Asia as a whole.
However, if this relationship is also to be to the benefit of the European Union, it is not enough for us to welcome the statistical advantage which the European Union has over India in terms of balance of trade, in terms of direct foreign investment and in terms of the transfer of technology. We also need a common strategy for the European Union which will go beyond the individual national interests of the Member States.
The recent Mittal-Arcelor case demonstrated that we must not continue at European level to follow this division between the individual interests of the European Union.
India, as we have said, is a very important factor.
However, we must also see the other side.
India at the moment has signed a nuclear energy agreement with the United States, which shapes a new framework and a new power correlation in Asia.
We must call for India to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is vital to our future relations with India.
On the other hand, we must understand that India bears a serious share of the responsibility for the failure of the Doha Round within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
It is India that is abusing the anti-dumping rules; it is India that is using social and environmental dumping.
All these issues must be put to India if we really want an operational, effective and democratic multilateral trade system.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Karim on the excellent and extensive report on the EUâs economic and trade relations with India.
We neglect the relationship with India, with its opportunities for both India and Europe, to our mutual cost.
In the future, if the EU concentrates more of its efforts on economic policy instead of other distractions, I see the potential for a massive free-trading alliance.
The United Kingdom, with its historic links, will play a key role in this development.
I am therefore delighted that the British Conservative Leader, David Cameron, is devoting particular attention to relations with India.
He seized the opportunity while with the business community in Mumbai recently to set out his views on globalisation.
He also touched on the challenge of terrorism.
Terrorism is the curse of our age.
If afflicts many European countries.
It has become a tragic fact of life in India as well, not just in Kashmir but in Mumbai where 200 people were murdered in July and in Malegaon on 8 September 2006, where some 40 people were killed.
The precise responsibility for these attacks is still unclear, but there is strong suspicion of external involvement.
Post-9/11, Pakistan has helped the democracies to fight terrorism along its western border with Afghanistan, but it has done precious little to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on its eastern border with India or to control the extremist madrassas that provide the hotbed in which terrorists are cultivated.
In order to proceed with the welcome and ongoing peace process between India and Pakistan, Pakistan must implement the solemn assurances it has given to stop all cross-border terrorism and to deliver on the words of President Musharraf in this Parliament on 12 September 2006.
As one of the great democracies, India attracts the rage of extremists.
This threat can be defeated only by the concerted efforts of our nations and agencies working together in close cooperation.
I welcome the opportunities we have for deep engagement with India and for Indiaâs wider regional role.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur most sincerely for his report.
Two years ago, Parliament and the Commission opened a new chapter in relations between the Union and India, calling them a strategic partnership.
At that time, I represented the European Parliament on a mission to India to prepare for the summit, confident that India was to become a strategic partner for us.
It seemed an obvious choice.
The two largest democracies in the world account together for over 1.5Â million people, and are in a position to create a new world economic order.
At the time, we promised each other growth in terms of mutual investments, trade exchanges, youth exchanges and cooperation between businesses and institutions of higher education.
That all seemed eminently sensible.
Are we working towards it?
The European Union wants to keep its place at the head of the world pack, though it is currently falling somewhat behind.
Surely, therefore, its most important partner and market ought to be a country with a population of a billion, sustained economic growth above 7%, and where 50% of the population is under 20Â years of age?
Has this become a reality?
Unfortunately, it has not.
What became of our strategy for youth exchange and investment?
It never came about because a couple of countries took it into their heads that Russia should be our strategic partner.
Russia is a country with a population of over 150Â million, where the average age is close to 50; a country that is prepared to blackmail Europe by threatening to cut off gas and energy supplies.
I call on Parliament and the Commission to review their policy and remain true to the agreements signed within the framework of a strategic partnership between the Union and India.
Â Â  MrÂ President, despite economic growth of between 5% and 7% per year, India remains a country of great contrasts.
Sixty-five per cent of the population are farmers, and almost 70% of them live in rural areas.
Although India comes close to the top of the list in terms of gifted engineers, IT specialists and scientists, about one third of its people are illiterate, and a large proportion of them are living in poverty.
From the point of view of cooperation, these contrasts represent a unique mix of advantages for India, as it can draw on both an unskilled and a highly qualified cheap labour force.
India has a population of over 1Â billion and is the fourth largest economy in the world.
Therefore, it ought to be an attractive partner for the Union where trade and investment are concerned.
This potential is not fully exploited by European Union companies, which seem to have a strong preference for China.
The Unionâs trade with India amounts to less than 20% of its trade with China.
These figures suggest that there is a great deal of under-exploited potential, but it is essential for the high duties on goods imported into India from the European Union to be lowered and for non-tariff barriers to be reduced.
The Union has already declared itself in favour of significant concessions within the framework of WTO negotiations.
The Indian authorities should strive to limit bureaucracy, as it hampers foreign investment.
The lack of investment in transport and energy particularly hinders development, although these could be attractive areas for foreign investment.
The Union could draw on its past experience to help resolve the problems associated with the significant imbalance in regional development in India, where the west and south of the country differ greatly from the east and the north.
As we develop trade relationships, we must also promote respect for human rights in India. This is an important subject which should be raised at the forthcoming summit in October.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, direct foreign investment is an important factor in any countryâs development.
I come from one of the new Member States and I can definitely confirm that direct foreign investment has played a significant role in the current dynamic economic growth that we have experienced in Central and Eastern Europe.
Indeed, the same applies to India, which is the third most attractive country in the world in terms of foreign investment, with Europe being one of the biggest investors, accounting for investments of more than EURÂ 1Â billion in 2004.
Despite this positive trend and many other improvements, however, foreign investors in India continue to face considerable problems.
They have to struggle with municipal, regional and national bureaucracy, with oblique and frequently changing regulations, to the point where they are completely unable to invest in many sectors, one example being agriculture.
I should like to call on the Indian authorities to alleviate this situation and to make it easier for foreign investors to enter the Indian market.
As evidenced by the successful example of Central and Eastern Europe, this will be beneficial not only for investors but also for the countries into which investment flows, which in this case means India.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for your comments, from which it is clear that we all attach great importance to comprehensive relations between the Union and India.
Only last week, on 19 September 2006, the EU-India High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the 13Â October 2006 EU-India Summit and concluded that an expanded trade partnership should be developed through the negotiation of a broad-based trade and investment agreement.
This forms the basis for the High Level Trade Group's recommendation to the EU-India Summit.
It augurs well for an agreement at the summit that there is a strong case for launching bilateral FTA negotiations and that the parties are ready to take the necessary steps to start negotiations.
The areas forming the basis of bilateral EU-India relations, as covered by the three EU-India Subcommittee meetings, range from economic policy, dialogue and cooperation, including on industrial policy, science and technology, finance and monetary affairs, the environment, clean development and climate change, energy cooperation, information and communication technologies, civil aviation, maritime transport, space technology, agriculture and marine policy, customs, employment and social policy, business cooperation and development cooperation, to trade and investment and the bringing together of peoples and cultures.
Many of those areas will no doubt form the subject of discussions at the EU-India Business Summit on 12Â October 2006 and the Political Summit on 13 October 2006, with a view to making progress in all areas of EU-India relations.
It is in our mutual interest to build on a rich history of experience and partnership with India.
The issue of the free trade agreement with India presents us with a number of possibilities.
An agreement with India would present various advantages, such as the consolidation of the European Union's privileged position in an important and growing market.
India is the only major emerging economy with the European Union as both its largest trading partner and its largest investor.
Whilst there have been sizeable reforms, access to India's market is still very restricted, with applied tariffs in certain sectors at over 30% and many caps on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector.
The reduction of tariffs for EU companies and the liberalisation of trade in services would secure access to a rapidly growing market and thereby contribute to competitiveness.
A secondary benefit would be to lock in India's economic reforms to the advantage of its and the region's long-term economic growth.
The visibility and economic benefits of an FTA with the European Union would support India's programme of reforms and provide a more stable investment climate.
The Doha development agenda does not preclude bilateral free trade agreements, and the conclusion of such free trade agreements does not and would not prejudice the completion of the Doha development agenda.
The European Union and India remain committed to the rules-based multilateral trading system.
The successful outcome of the DDA multilateral trade negotiations remains their foremost trade-policy priority.
India and the Union will continue to collaborate closely on mutual interests and to play leading roles regarding the DDA.
In the speech which Commissioner Mandelson delivered in Berlin on 18Â September 2006, he indicated that the central strand of the October trade policy review would argue that the EU should seek to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral trading system with a new generation of bilateral free trade agreements with key growing markets.
While Europe continues to be highly competitive in global export markets, European companies are losing ground in the highest technology products and the fastest growing markets.
In rapidly growing regions such as Asia, the European Union is underperforming.
There is now a case for new bilateral free trade agreements designed to deliver more open markets.
FTAs can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement and competition policy, that are not yet fully addressed by WTO rules.
In this respect, the deepening of EU-India bilateral trade relations supports the larger multilateral trading regime.
Finally, as many of you have said during the discussion, strengthening EU-India relations represents a great hope: that of reducing the wealth gap existing in that country, of improving the conditions for workers and ensuring better standards of protection for all workers, in particular for women and children, and of improving the quality of life of the Indian people in general which, as has rightly been pointed out, is still such that 190Â million people live on less than USDÂ 1 a day.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12Â noon.
The sitting is now suspended.
You may come to the Conference of Presidents, which starts at 5.30 p.m. and is open to all Members, in order to hear an exchange of views with the Prime Minister of Lebanon, MrÂ Siniora, on the situation in the Middle East.
Â Â  First, let me congratulate MrÂ Karim on his report on EU-India trade relations.
In contrast to last monthâs debate on EU-China relations, his work and report have been a model of cooperation and consensus and my Group and I will be supporting his report.
I only have to apologise that I will be absent for tomorrowâs vote, as I will be attending the Labour Party Conference in Manchester.
I have one general comment and two specific points on the report.
First, we in the PSE Group do not want any hint that a bilateral FTA can substitute for a successful completion of the Doha Development Round.
We know India is committed in this regard, but not all MEPs share that commitment.
Secondly, while I offered a guarded welcome to back liberalisation, I share some of Mr Markovâs concerns as to the social impact on small farmers and businesses as preferential lending will end.
If Mr Markovâs amendment had been more judiciously phrased it would have gained my support.
Thirdly, I do not welcome Indiaâs involvement in ITER.
I believe the whole ITER Programme is mistaken and would have been delighted if it had gone to Japan so they would have wasted more of their money and we less of ours.
I can only commiserate with the people of India.
Â Â  Given the strong ties which exist between my own Member State and India, I am naturally keen that the EU does all in its power to help India realise its enormous potential for economic development.
Having had the privilege to visit India on a number of occasions, I have been deeply impressed by the rate of economic development there over recent years and particularly in key 21st century industries such as information technology.
I am pleased at the progress which was made in building dialogue at the sixth India-EU summit last year.
Improving economic and trade relations will prove to be of mutual benefit to both the EU and India, but it is essential that a key objective of our contribution to economic development is the eradication of poverty.
This must be maintained as a top priority of our strategic partnership.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0254/2006) by MrsÂ Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on perspectives of women in international trade (2006/2009(INI)).
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, I would take the liberty of tabling a procedural motion at the start of our debate on MrsÂ Breyerâs report.
My remark concerns the translation, into the various official languages of the European Union, of the motion for a resolution on women and international trade.
I have worked with the Slovak, English, German and French versions, and there are a few paragraphs that have been translated in a totally different way.
I would be pleased if the services could usefully check the quality of the translations.
Â Â  Thank you; that is, of course, a very important point.
The services will check to see that everything is indeed in order.
Â Â  . â Madam President, I can do no other than endorse the point of order, for there are considerable differences between one translation and another.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I would have liked the Commissioner with responsibility for trade policy to be here to listen to this eveningâs debate, for the subject is very much one of his own, I do hope that this will not be the last time that it is debated in this House.
Globalisation and the liberalisation of world trade are not gender-neutral, and so I am glad to be able to present this own-initiative report on âperspectives of women in international tradeâ on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
The relationship between gender and trade is a new subject not only for women, but also for governments and those who make trade policy, and also for us in this House, so it is high time that we address it and debate the question of what influence global trade has on equal opportunities policy and vice versa.
In the report, you will find many suggestions for practical things to do about the gender blindness of international trade, and I would like to emphasise the fact that the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality adopted it unanimously.
It highlights the need for coherence between the objective of European equality policy and the goals of trade, development policy and aid programmes if equal opportunities for women and men are to be promoted.

Of all the poor in the world, 70% are women; their gender means that they do not have the same opportunity to acquire property, land or education, and they suffer many kinds of discrimination on the labour market, and their situation can only be made worse by market liberalisation and the extension of international trading relations that take insufficient account of the structural discrimination against women.
To well-educated women, globalisation has brought new vocational opportunities, but liberalised markets have made poorer womenâs living conditions even worse.
Microcredit and development aid will amount to no more than a drop in the ocean if we do not make a start on making fundamental changes to these global economic structures.
Trade policy involves the EU in representing the interests of the Member States at many levels and in negotiating treaties, for example as part of the WTO negotiations.
Although it, in the past, set milestones for equality of opportunity in Europe, there is a yawning gulf when it comes to realising this principle in global trade policy.
The Committee on Womenâs Rights is unwilling to tolerate this silence any longer.
As a first step, we demand gender mainstreaming in international trade policy, with explicit monitoring and assessment mechanisms, the latter of which might, for example, involve ranking the Member States in terms of their promotion of gender equity on the labour market.
In order that the objective of equality should not be voided of all meaning, a department for gender equity and trade should be set up within the Commission, with one of its functions to be the provision of gender-disaggregated statistical data.
We call on the Commission to present an annual progress report on equality in international trade, and also to set up a fund to help women get access to loans and education.
Politicians without money are no more than poets, so, as a responsible trade policy can be brought about only by transparent flows of funds, we demand the introduction of gender budgeting, that being a budget policy that takes gender justice seriously, something we regard as indispensable at every level of trade policy.
The Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality intends to organise a hearing on the subject next week.
The intention is that the EU should become a beacon of equality in international trade policy, just as it has already become for equal opportunities for women in Europe, and that the Commission should play an active part in countering discrimination against women, which will involve ensuring that European companies with overseas production centres and also benefiting from EU market access programmes do not have a hand in the inhumane exploitation of women.
It is also important that the EU, before entering into trade agreements, should undertake a gender-specific analysis of the position of women.
We in the EU must not promote businesses that use women while committing flagrant breaches of their rights.
We know that international trading organisations, businesses and structures are dominated by men.
If women are to achieve equality with men in terms of their access to power and occupying of decision-making positions, then quotas are still indispensable; effective quotas that represent more than lip-service will help to establish gender parity in international trade relations, and so I am glad that the Committee on Womenâs Rights has drawn on an initiative taken in Norway, where companies quoted on the stock exchange have been required, with effect from 2006, to increase to 40% the percentage of women on supervisory boards.
If this House adopts the resolution on women in international trade, it would be a great triumph and an important step on the road to gender justice.
We will have to bring pressure to bear on the Commission to get it to do as Parliament demands.
I wish to thank all Members for their positive attitude towards this report, their support for it and their suggestions, and I hope that we may be able to achieve a satisfactory outcome when we vote on it tomorrow.
Â Â  Madam President, my colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, regrets not being able to be here for this very important debate, but he has had to travel to the United States for multilateral discussions.
The European Commission welcomes the report of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
For the European Union, the purpose of global governance is to make possible development that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable.
That is why we wish to promote policies that provide sustainable responses to gender-based issues, whether they are countriesâ domestic policies in some cases backed by international aid, common policies such as those forming the building blocks of the European Union, or international commitments.
Trade liberalisation has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and in many cases reducing the gender gap in wages, leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society.
Nonetheless, the rapid changes in national economies that can result from globalisation also provide challenges to policy-makers to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of globalisation are maximised and the short-term costs in certain sectors are minimised.
The European Commission believes that clear social conditions underpin sustainable productivity growth and promote the efficient production of high-quality goods and services generating a net added value.
Policies that mitigate the adverse effects of a changing economy on specific groups of people or regions, good social services and social protection accessible to all, social dialogue, the respect for fundamental social rights including core labour standards, minimum standards for working conditions and for ensuring workersâ upstream involvement in managing change â all these play a crucial role.
The European Commission promotes core labour rights in EU trade policy.
Core labour standards are defined by the ILO to include Convention No 100 on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, and Convention No 111 on discrimination in the workplace.
In the multilateral context, a reference to core labour standards was included in the declaration of the first World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Singapore in 1996.
Regrettably, WTO members did not agree to include this issue as part of the Doha Development Agenda.
Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development, core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and the International Labour Organization, both in the EUâs own trade policy review and the trade policy reviews of other countries.
As part of this process, the International Convention of Free Trade Unionsâ reports on core labour standards are prepared ahead of each trade policy review.
The Commission is also strongly in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO.
The European Commission has also pursued social development objectives in regional, bi-regional and bilateral arrangements.
All its most recent agreements recognise and promote social rights as part of the universal objective of decent work for all.
The Commission has, for example, entered into dialogue and cooperation with countries such as Chile, South Africa and bi-regionally with the ACP countries, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mercosur and other regions.
The European Commission remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes and it rejects any unilateral sanctions-based approach.
The objective is to further social progress with a view to promoting benefits for all.
Since 1998 the EC has also been granting trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences, special incentive arrangements to those developing countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO and comply with international recognised standards on sustainable forest management.
Currently, some 180 developing countries and dependent territories are granted GSP.
In the framework of the new GSP scheme, adopted on 27 June 2005 by the Council, a GSP-plus initiative for sustainable development provides additional tariff preferences for countries that have signed and effectively implemented UN and ILO conventions on human rights and labour rights, including those on gender equality.
A total of 15 countries have ratified the core conventions and received GSP-plus status.
A gender helpdesk currently operates under the RELEX family of the Commission.
The services of the gender helpdesk are part of a larger effort to build capacity and knowledge to promote gender equality and fully implement the strategy of gender mainstreaming.
A tool kit has also been published to give practical help to Commission staff on how to mainstream gender issues.
The EC is also developing a close relationship with the International Labour Organization on trade-related matters aimed at promoting core labour standards through assessment, capacity-building and enforcement in developing countries.
In 2005-2006 the Commission has been funding an ILO pilot project aiming to develop decent work indicators in developing countries for examining the relationship between decent work and trade liberalisation.
Case studies have been undertaken in the Philippines and Uganda.
The data gathered include disaggregated statistics on employment, wages and working hours for women and men.
These data provide a more sophisticated picture of decent work than previously available.
The Commission will explore the potential to use these indicators in future aid programmes with developing countries to help them manage social adjustment to globalisation, and the report will be submitted to the European Parliament.
The European Commission will also look into the potential for using decent work indicators as part of trade sustainability impact assessments.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I am grateful to our fellow Member, MrsÂ Breyer, for her motion for a resolution, which was unanimously adopted within my committee.
The globalisation and liberalisation of the economy do not just make successes out of people.
That is why I ask what place the weakest have in society and what resources there are to promote a solidarity economy.
Politicians and economists must be creative in their efforts to ensure that men and women can really flourish and must promote the common public good without excessive government interference, which would harm the national economies.
ParagraphsÂ 15 and 26 mention the classification of the Member States.
That is provocative.
However, since 1951, this classification has appeared in the International Labour Organisation conventions signed by the Member States of the European Union.
The paragraphs that deal with the relations with third countries emphasise that women, as economic players, must be recognised in all of the activities they carry out in terms of personal, family and educational development and in all of the duties they perform within society.
The unpaid and informal work done by women deserves greater recognition in European policies.
This resolution also reminds us that we, in the West, must avoid at all costs any form of neo-colonialism and that we must respect the cultures of our economic partners, while ensuring the abolition of all forms of discrimination between men and women.
That is why I encourage my group to endorse this resolution in the hope that, in the not too distant future, the political declarations on equality between men and women will finally be reflected in economic life.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, as a result of the roles and duties traditionally ascribed to women and men in certain societies, women continue to be deprived of access to education and proper health care.
They are also being denied the means to improve their financial situation.
This is supported by statistics, according to which 70% of those living in poverty in the world are women, which is a very high proportion.
In spite of these figures, many people still fail to appreciate that a lack of equality between the sexes clearly has a negative impact on development in the long term.
This is because lack of equality between the sexes means that women do not have equal access to the market means of production and that, in relation to social and political issues, they are not part of the decision-making process.
This situation has a negative impact on long term development.
International trade can also help to ensure that the economic potential of the whole of society is exploited by promoting the involvement of women in the economic, social and political spheres.
In this respect, cohesion between the aims of European policy on gender equality and the aims of its trade and development policy is particularly important.
Ensuring that women can play their rightful part in the economy is crucial if we are to strengthen the position of women and overcome structural discrimination.
To this end, the European Commission should strive not only to include the issue of gender equality in international trade strategies, but also to introduce transparent systems for their monitoring and control.
By setting a good example, which I trust will become the norm in time, the European Union can demonstrate to third countries that women must not be treated as second class citizens and must have the opportunity to benefit from full access to the market, to credit and to capital goods.
In addition, it is important for both the institutions of the European Union and the Member States to include gender equality and equal opportunity issues in the aims identified within the framework of all European funding programmes.
The Member States should make an effort to develop national political measures that will foster gender equality and increase female employment.
The Norwegian Governmentâs decision to bring in a law requiring 40% female representation on the boards of joint stock companies is a splendid example to follow and should be emulated by other Member States.
It should also become the subject of a regulation at Community level.
Women must have an equal right to participate in economic life, especially in the poorest countries.
Potentially helpful measures include universal access to so-called âmicro-creditsâ, which would help to combat poverty amongst women, promote self-sufficiency and raise their social status.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that it is important to ensure that women are appropriately represented at government level in the Member States of the European Union and in international organisations.
This would ensure that gender issues and problems which primarily affect women are taken into account within the framework of trade negotiations at global level.
I should also like to sincerely congratulate MrsÂ Breyer on a very well prepared document.
Â Â  Madam President, one of the basic truths of our society is gender inequality.
This gender power structure is present in every aspect of our society and it hampers growth and every kind of sustainability.
Of the people living in poverty in the world, almost three out of four are women, so equal opportunities for women and men is not just an issue of human rights or some sort of luxury.
When every other problem is solved it is crucial for our common future.
This report by my colleague Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, is a very good starting point for the urgent work ahead in the specific area of trade relations in the world.
As she points out, women in general experience more difficulties in gaining access to education, property, credit, other resources and factors of production, as well as political decision-making bodies, and these inequalities restrict womenâs ability to use the advantages of trade liberalisation.
For instance, a large number of women throughout the world are denied opportunities to improve their economic and social conditions and, at the same time, many of them have the added responsibility of caring for children and the household.
A majority of the farmers in the world are women!
A structural change in the EUâs common agricultural policy is an important strengthening of these women in third world countries.
However, gender inequality is not just something that exists in poor countries: the representation of women in politics and business is also very low in the Member States of the Union.
In order to raise the discussion of quotas to a new level, we must consider that this instrument can be used in a number of different ways.
As I see it, the quota instrument should be used only when every other way has been tested and proved unsuccessful.
Like the rapporteur, I welcome the Norwegian Governmentâs decision to impose by law a 40% quota for female representation on the boards of joint stock companies.
But, basically, this report addresses a number of issues concerning the systematic and thoroughly unjust gender inequality affecting international trade relations.
It includes a number of very precise suggestions, which I believe could really make a difference in a political world so much characterised by words and empty promises.
It will make for good reading in the Commission and in the Council.
Finally, let me just say:
Â Â  I should like to offer my sincere thanks to MrsÂ Breyer for her excellent report and for the fact that she has raised an incredibly important issue concerning trade and the ways in which WTO and GATS agreements, together with IMF decisions, affect people's lives and ability to provide for themselves.
In the same way as the agreements are often beneficial to industrialised countries and harmful to developing countries, women and men are, in different ways, placed at, respectively, a disadvantage or advantage by trade agreements.
By tradition, world trade is menâs arena.
The board of the IMF consists entirely of men, and 91.7% of the World Bankâs board is male.
Trade and gender are connected in a host of ways that we need to study if we are to understand how people in different places, of different genders and from different social classes are affected by trade agreements.
Gender is relevant because gender relations affect the distribution of, and access to, resources, work, income and power.
