For that reason, I voted against Amendments NosÂ 6 and 22, which were however adopted (by, respectively, 382 âyesâ votes, 82 ânoâ votes and 20 abstentions and 392 âyesâ votes, 71 ânoâ votes and 33 abstentions).
Â Â  Mr President, with reference to Mr Poignant's report, I voted against the notion that the EU flag should appear on all EU vessels.
The diversity of the European Union is something to celebrate and not to eliminate.
I look forward to the day when an independent Scotland will have its flag on its vessels and in many other places, choosing if and when it is appropriate to have the EU flag alongside.
I do not believe that this is one of the occasions when that is either appropriate, necessary or desirable.
Â Â  . In principle Conservative MEPs welcome the proposal for a regulation on the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers within the Community and accept that it will improve cooperation between the administrators of maritime registers in the Member States.
Proposals that make it easier for ships from an EU Member State to move in and out of Community ports, thus facilitating the free movement of goods, are to be welcomed.
However, Conservative MEPs voted against amendments calling for Member States to display the emblem of the European Union i.e. a circle of 12 gold stars on a square blue background â in the corner of their flags because these amendments will do nothing to improve maritime safety and could even make EU-registered ships potential targets.
Â Â  . â We supported the amendments seeking to improve maritime safety.
We are in favour of extending the scope of application of the regulation to passenger ships, of coordinating with the other Community tools and of strengthening cooperation between national maritime administrations.
At a time when the European Union is enlarging to include Malta and Cyprus, making it the worldâs largest shipping power, these changes are urgent and essential.
The two island States must at all costs raise the moral standards of their flags, which are real flags of convenience at the service of the âhooligans of the seaâ.
But we must also denounce those countries which, like France, have created a âsecond flagâ.
French shipowners now only use the flag of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.
Their vessels are registered in France (making them eligible for the relevant aids and subsidies), but up to 65% of the seamen on board are of foreign nationality.
Their pay and working and living conditions obviously depend on their country of origin and bear no relation to their qualifications.
This exploitation means that huge profits are reaped at the price of the dignity, rights, health and sometimes even the lives of crews that come in the main from the poorest countries on earth.
That is the real scandal of the shipping register.
Â Â  .In light of both the oil tanker disaster and of the proposal approved by this House, at the initiative of the signatory, to create a Community programme aimed exclusively at developing mechanisms to protect the EUâs external borders, in particular its maritime borders, I have followed this debate with great interest.
Any measures taken in the name of maritime safety are to be welcomed and correspond to a correctly identified general need.
It is appropriate to focus not only on accidents but also on the main sources of maritime pollution, which are the systematic contraventions of legislation in this field.
This also displays political awareness of the environmental problems affecting us.
I therefore voted in favour of the reports on maritime safety, with the exception of the Pex report, as I do not agree with the rapporteurâs proposal to create a European Coastguard.
The EU has an obligation to promote maritime safety and must not, under any circumstances, be relieved of this obligation.
The creation of a European Coastguard would be a step too far, however.
We would be better advised to encourage closer cooperation between Member States, which would in turn foster greater interoperability and compatibility of the resources available at intra-European level and would avoid wasteful duplication and overlapping.
Â Â  .
I believe that the approach taken by this report, regarding the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between EU Member State registers, manages to strike the right balance between the various elements involved.
While the 1991 Regulation succeeded in its aim of reducing administrative duties regarding changes of flag within Member States, the rapporteur, and the European Commission in its proposal, have not lost sight of the indispensable need for safety, tragically confirmed by the oil tanker disaster in 2002.
I believe it is possible to make it attractive to fly the flags of Member States â the EU needs to have a considerable fleet â without being negligent on matters of safety.
Shying away from centralising everything, the rapporteur chose not to suggest creating a single EU register.
While such a register might cut costs, this would only be valid if the EU register could replace national registers completely, which according to experts does not appear to be feasible.
Cooperation and in particular establishing reciprocal responsibilities between national maritime authorities are preferable and will certainly contribute towards establishing regular interaction.
This would also be reinforced by the rapporteurâs suggestion that the Commission draft a report to the EP and the Council regarding the implementation of the new rules.
Â Â  Mr President, today's vote on nuclear waste is most timely, given that research recently showed that over half the UK sites identified as potential nuclear dumps are located in Scotland.
My Group today voted against the nuclear package because it offers nothing in terms of environmental safety.
Furthermore, my party will continue to fight against Scotland becoming a nuclear dustbin.
The Scottish National Party's vision of an independent Scotland is one of a clean, green Scotland profiting from our natural heritage and healthy environment.
London, by contrast, seems to think that the rule when considering nuclear-waste dumps should be 'the further away the better', and regards Scotland as the ideal place.
The people of Scotland will simply not stand for this treatment and my party will continue to fight against this filthy industry.
Â Â  . â In the Vidal-Quadras Roca report on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste and in the SeppÃ€nen report on the safety of nuclear installations, we supported all those amendments that sought to impose stricter safety requirements on the operation of the installations, and on the treatment and storage of radioactive waste.
We did not, however, support the amendments that removed any timetable for improving safety, sometimes for technical reasons, but ultimately letting the Member States do as they please.
Without denying that nuclear power has its intrinsic dangers, it is the fact that we cannot trust those in power, because they always put the financial interests of private groups before the human interests of the public, that is still the worst danger.
Â Â  . We believe that the need to find acceptable solutions to radioactive waste management is one of the main problems, if not main problem affecting nuclear energy.
The Commission feels that current policy in most Member States and candidate countries does not effectively address the problem of nuclear waste.
It is imperative that Member States develop appropriate strategies and prepare detailed, timetabled programmes for the long-term management of all types of waste within their jurisdiction.
The aim of the Directive is to encourage progress to this end, while stressing the importance of the various elements of the question: identifying and preparing disposal sites, carrying out important R[amp]D into identifying and implementing the best technical waste elimination solutions and technologies that will enable significant reduction of the amount and danger level of waste generated during the process of producing nuclear energy.
Member States must be encouraged to work together on waste management, without losing sight of the principle that each country must deal with its own waste, except in special circumstances, and no activity in this field must endanger public health or the environment.
I welcome this Directive, which appears to be fully justified.
There are certain proposals in the report that do not appear to be essential and some did not deserve...
Â Â  . Nearly thirty years after the publication of the 1975 EEC Directive on the management of solid waste, the institutions of the European Union have finally decided to address the subject of the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.
In reality, the proposed directive, apart from rehashing a few general terms which apply to all waste, contains no material reference to the special and sensitive nature, as far as public health is concerned, of radioactive waste.
The proposals to create deep geological disposal facilities by specific deadlines are so poorly substantiated that they are in fact no more than idle chitchat.
The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy endeavours to support the inadequate text of the directive with comments which are either neutral or even negative.
For example, the report accepts the export of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste to third countries, something with which we disagree radically.
The proposal for a directive and the report by the Committee on Industry confirm yet again our assessment that there is a huge gap between the seriousness and acuteness of the environmental problems created by the uncontrolled action of big business and the measures taken to deal with them.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the relevant texts.
Â Â  . â The proliferation of radioactive waste is a major problem for the environment and public health.
Nonetheless, countries like France are relaunching their programme to construct new nuclear power stations, which are no better than the old ones in this respect.
At the same time, the liberalisation mentality brings social dangers as well as ecological ones, in particular because of the increasingly widespread practice of outsourcing the maintenance of nuclear installations.
In this context, the Vidal-Quadras Roca report, as amended, admittedly claims to contribute to better monitoring of nuclear waste, but it presents serious shortcomings in two respects: it maintains the possibility for a State to export its waste to a third country (even though, and this is an improvement, it provides for, âthe prior written informed consent of Statesâ) and it advocates the deep geological disposal of radioactive waste, a practice that is strongly opposed by those who live nearby and by many scientists.
That is why we voted against this report.
The nuclear sector confirms that it is prohibitively expensive and benefits from scandalously advantageous conditions compared with sectors that produce âcleanâ energy.
We need to reverse this way of thinking.
We therefore express our solidarity with the joint demonstration calling for us to abandon nuclear power that will be taking place on Saturday 17Â January in Paris.
Â Â  . When, in the fifties and sixties of the last century, nuclear fission was promoted as an inexhaustible source of energy for the future, scarcely a thought was given to the waste.
The radioactivity of that material takes a long time to diminish and can last for tens of thousands of years at a lower level.
This insoluble problem of waste should be a compelling reason to refrain from any further use of nuclear fission.
Instead, pressure is mounting to increase underground storage capacity for this hazardous material, for example in the underground salt domes in the Dutch province of Drenthe.
In JuneÂ 2003, I asked the European Commission for clarification on the subject of plans to make it compulsory for Member States of the EU to use geological disposal sites for the permanent disposal of the most hazardous forms of radioactive waste from 2018.
In reply, I was told that a study on the evaluation of the functioning of geological containment systems had shown that all the European countries have a suitable subsoil of suitable clay, salt or crystalline rock strata.
In addition, the possibility now seems to be left open of regarding this waste as a commodity that must be allowed in to all Member States of the EU without an import licence by virtue of the free movement of goods.
Since Parliament does not have the authority to prohibit this, the only remaining way of contesting imports is via the Court of Justice of the EC.
As far as I am concerned, this is reason enough to vote against this whole directive.
Â Â  . In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy, I opted for what I consider the most prudent political line for those who, like me, are in favour of this energy source, provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained.
This would mean safe installations â not only working installations â and safe spent fuels and radioactive waste â both at the final destination and at every stage en route to the disposal site.
All Member States produce radioactive waste from nuclear processing plants, research reactors and various medical and industrial applications.
It is bad enough that these materials are stored in temporary facilities but, worse still, there are no immediate plans to build permanent disposal facilities in any Member State.
In its proposals, the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes, adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules.
It is this concept of obligation that sets these proposals apart from the international conventions already in place.
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals.
Â Â  .
All Member States and candidate countries produce radioactive waste, the most radiologically toxic forms of which are currently held in temporary storage facilities.
No Member State has access to permanent storage, and nor does any Member State have plans to build any such facility in the near future.
It is therefore a matter of the utmost urgency that we provide workable solutions.
The rapporteur was right to favour a two-stage approach, which would be more feasible and more effective than a single timetable.
Firstly, each Member State should, by 31Â December 2006, set its own deadlines to prepare and submit to the Commission a detailed programme for the long-term management of all types of radioactive waste under its jurisdiction in line with international standards.
Once the programme has been submitted, each Member State must set its own deadlines to put the programme into practice, choose a site, build the disposal facility and begin operations.
Working in this way will make it possible to achieve the stated aim, ensuring the flexibility needed to address the various situations in the EU in this regard.
This solution, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, is an important step towards responding to European citizensâ concerns for regulation in this sensitive field.
By setting deadlines, timetables and targets, it also creates an effective framework of liability.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  We Moderates give the highest priority to the best possible level of safety for nuclear energy.
We believe that the Swedish safety organisation, in conjunction with the work done by the IAEA, WENRA and other existing organisations properly fulfil the requirements for devising safety regulations and monitoring compliance with these.
We are, however, doubtful as to whether the EU has the required Treaty-based competence to take decisions on directives concerning the safety of nuclear installations, at least where the SeppÃ€nen report is concerned.
In the final vote, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report since it has not been possible to vote on the proposed legal basis for the directive and since the report is clearly much better than the Commissionâs proposal.
Â Â  . It is essential that we create a legally binding legislative framework in the field of the safety of nuclear installations, given that there are still major discrepancies between nuclear safety measures in the various Member States.
The aim is to ensure that high levels of nuclear safety are maintained in the EU, given that the system to be implemented will fall within the competencies of national safety authorities.
The purpose of the Community system is to complement national systems.
Community monitoring will consist of verifying the way in which national authorities are carrying out their work.
The intention is not to undertake on-site safety inspections of nuclear installations.
The Commissionâs proposal would appear justified.
Some objections, however, might be raised by Member States that feel that the Commission is interfering in matters of national sovereignty, in terms of competence to take decisions concerning conditions of securing and operating nuclear installations.
This is why so much care is being taken in the wording of provisions on interaction with national safety authorities and the form that Community monitoring will take, which we believe to be the right approach.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy, I opted for what I consider the most prudent political line for those who, like me, are in favour of this energy source, provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained.
This would mean safe installations â not only working installations â and safe spent fuels and radioactive waste â both at the final destination and at every stage en route to the disposal site.
All Member States produce radioactive waste from nuclear processing plants, research reactors and various medical and industrial applications.
It is bad enough that these materials are stored in temporary facilities but, worse still, there are no immediate plans to build permanent disposal facilities in any Member State.
In its proposals, the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes, adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules.
It is this concept of obligation that sets these proposals apart from the international conventions already in place.
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this important report, for the same reasons I expressed in my explanation of vote on the other reports in this ânuclear packageâ.
Views on this sensitive issue differ substantially between Member States.
Similarly, the level of acceptance of nuclear risk on the part of the citizens varies markedly from Member State to Member State.
Fortunately, however, emphasis appears to have been placed on the crucial issue of promoting and sharing âbest practiceâ in many areas of European life.
The Commissionâs aim, with this proposal, is to ensure that best practice in the field of nuclear safety is implemented in all Member States and in all civil nuclear installations.
I believe that the intention of this proposal is not to replace the Convention on Nuclear Safety â concluded under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency â to which all EU States are party.
It is rather aimed at maintaining a high level of minimum safety, under the auspices and responsibility of the Member States, on the basis of closer cooperation and greater solidarity, thus resulting in âbest practiceâ.
I would vote against the proposal currently before us if it implied a shift towards shared competences from what has hitherto been traditionally and exclusively a matter of national competence.
This is a very reasonable concern on the rapporteurâs part, one which has always been something of a âwarning signâ and a clear delimitation of the legislatorâs spirit.
Â Â  I chose to vote in favour of Amendment NoÂ 29 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, designed to clarify and tighten up the wording on protecting the general public when radioactive material is handled.
Moreover, I also voted in favour of Amendment NoÂ 30 on removing obstacles in the energy market in the interests of fairer competition between nuclear energy and other energy sources.
Â Â  . The question before us is whether the 77/270/Euratom Decision, which empowers the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations, must be adapted to suit the circumstances of certain third countries about to join the EU, in which such investments are clearly of considerable significance.
There does not appear to be any place for technical nuclear considerations in this proposal for an amendment.
Whether or not the principle of these loans is acceptable is another matter.
This is a question, however, which would arise regardless of the amendment currently before us.
It should be noted that the mechanism of loans was introduced in 1977 and at the time covered only Member States.
It was amended in 1994, when the question emerged of the EUâs contributing towards encouraging safety improvements in nuclear installations in third countries, in particular Soviet-designed reactors in former Eastern Bloc countries.
Â Â  . My stance of absolute opposition to the use of nuclear power is well known.
I respect the right of each Member State to decide on its own energy policy.
However, that choice must fully respect the choices made by other states to be nuclear-free.
The activities of nuclear power stations and reprocessing plants have implications that go beyond borders.
As a public representative for the east coast of Ireland, I am at all times conscious of the threat posed to my constituents and our environment from nuclear installations on the other side of the Irish Sea, in particular the outdated, decrepit and accident-prone Sellafield plant in Cumbria.
If Member States which persist with nuclear generation want to reassure their neighbours, they must give full access to information to the appropriate authorities in those neighbouring states.
The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has recently stated that it has become more difficult to obtain information on Sellafield from the British authorities over the past couple of years.
This surely neither is good neighbourliness nor reflects an .
It is hypocritical to spend EU funds on prolonging the life of dangerous facilities.
Plants that cannot meet rigorous international standards should be decommissioned.
Â Â  . Euro-optimists often declare that there was an enormous increase in the powers of the European Parliament in the nineties.
This is true as regards the number of subjects where codecision applies, but not as regards final decisions.
In a normal parliamentary democracy, the parliament has the right of initiative and also the last word on legislation, budget and the forming of coalitions.
This proposal clearly reveals the democratic deficit within the European Union once more, now that the increase in the ceiling for Euratom loans, from EURÂ 4Â 000Â million to EURÂ 6Â 000Â million, appears not to fall within the competence of Parliament, but only of the Council.
The most positive element in this proposal is the extension of action to improve nuclear safety from just the Member States of the EU to Russia, Ukraine and Armenia.
A difference of opinion remains over the form this action should take.
Some want nuclear power stations that are more modern; others want these closed down for good.
I agree with the rapporteur, MrsÂ Breyer, that the purpose of loans for the financing of nuclear power stations should no longer be to expand nuclear power, but to abolish it.
The vote in the specialist committee has practically reversed the direction of this report, and, as a result, I, like the rapporteur herself, can no longer support it.
Â Â  . â Let us hope that this Parliamentâs startled reaction to the Breyer report will not only mark the final shot in the dogmatic campaign of the anti-nuclear ayatollahs, but will also usher in a period of calm reflection that will herald a real change of direction.
In fact, only nuclear energy â enriched with spectacular research progress which already makes abundant high-quality energy available perfectly safely â is able to respond not only to the concern to safeguard the environment but also to the need for energy independence and the formidable challenge represented by the growth of emerging countries.
Is it in fact reasonable to think that the demand for energy, the corollary of development, can be satisfied by renewable energies in countries like India and China?
Is it responsible to condemn nuclear energy to be abandoned in Europe when we alone can contribute, by virtue of our experience and excellence in this field, to making new installations really safe, installations which will not wait for the Union to give the green light before being built in these third countries?
The energy issue, a sensitive one for the European Union, a vital one for three quarters of the planet, will only be resolved by adopting a dispassionate and pragmatic approach, far removed from the idle dreams and fantasies of ecological fundamentalism.
Â Â  . In the vote on the three reports on nuclear energy, I opted for what I consider to be the most prudent political line for those who, like me, are in favour of this energy source, provided that the highest levels of safety are maintained.
This would mean safe installations â not only working installations â and safe spent fuels and radioactive waste â both at the final destination and at every stage en route to the disposal site.
All Member States produce radioactive waste from nuclear processing plants, research reactors and various medical and industrial applications.
It is bad enough that these materials are stored in temporary facilities but, worse still, there are no immediate plans to build permanent disposal facilities in any Member State.
In its proposals, the Commission argues that whenever nuclear energy is exploited for commercial purposes, adequate safety levels must be guaranteed and that countries must accordingly be obliged to enforce a series of rules.
It is this concept of obligation that sets these proposals apart from the international conventions already in place.
I too therefore voted in favour of these proposals.
Â Â  . I agree with the proposal for a Decision currently before us.
I also feel that the increase in appropriations must be directed primarily towards improving safety in existing reactors.
Unlike the rapporteur, however, I feel that this should not exclude financing projects aimed at securing or improving existing equipment.
Such is the case of the Euratom loan under active development for the completion of a reactor designed and built in Romania by Canadian, French, Italian and US companies â Cernavoda 2.
I am therefore opposed to such restrictive measures aimed solely at decommissioning facilities.
Like all European citizens, I am concerned about the safety of installations â especially following the socio-political changes in Eastern Europe after November 1989 â and about current decommissioning programmes.
Support for this proposal for a Decision arises from these concerns and from the idea that economic and social cohesion in Europe must also contribute more actively towards revitalising the economies of many of the countries where these installations are located, to which energy safety and sufficiency will certainly contribute a great deal.
Â Â  I voted in favour of Amendment NoÂ 19 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (which was voted down by 235 votes, with 71 votes in favour and 11 abstentions).
This amendment emphasises that inhabitants of potentially affected areas in neighbouring countries must have the same rights as people in the country in which the installation is situated, for example in the event of public consultation when loans are to be given from the Community budget.
It is a matter of urgency that the Espoo Convention should be applied in practical terms.
Â Â  . The Commission has, at the request of Parliament, submitted two framework directives.
As these are within the competence of the European Institutions, we have voted to approve them, even though we do not agree with everything that they contain.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democratic delegation has today voted in favour of a series of amendments which, in terms of safety and the environment, will tighten up the original proposals.
We finally chose, however, to abstain from voting in favour of these reports as a whole, because we do not think that the proposals go far enough regarding safety and environmental protection and because we are generally opposed to the use of nuclear energy.
Â Â  . It is indeed important that we address the specific problems faced by the farming sector in Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions of Finland, Sweden, Scotland, Austria and Estonia.
The cold climate of these regions means a shorter growing season and higher costs both for arable and livestock farming.
Cereal harvests are similarly low and lacking in variety.
In addition to the adverse climate, and partly as a result of this, there are also difficulties in terms of transporting and marketing produce.
I therefore endorse the need, already highlighted by various European Councils, to ensure the sustainability and redistribution of agriculture throughout Europe and to maintain not only the picture postcard image of the rural landscape, but also the vitality of the countryside as a whole.
Speaking as a staunch advocate of genuine convergence and of fighting against regional discrepancies, particularly in the outermost regions, I endorse recognising the special status of northern regions.
I believe that the EU has a duty to encourage a balanced approach to farming areas, based on criteria of proportionality and suitability, without overlooking national identities or the side effects of agriculture.
Since I am constantly referring to the specific characteristics and problems of Portuguese farming I am obliged also to recognise the specific problems faced by other Member States.
Â Â  . As I have advocated on many occasions, the terms of the regulation and implementation of EU legislation (and operating rules of EU institutions) need to be as clearly worded as possible.
If this is achieved, those operating in the sectors subject to this discipline will be afforded greater protection and so too will the citizens.
We speak a great deal about bringing Europe âcloser to the citizensâ, whereas in reality it remains distant from them.
The most effective contribution we can make towards bridging this gap is to simplify the rules and make them easier to understand.
This would also guarantee the appropriateness and proportionality of community-level actions, while, of course, adhering to the principle of subsidiarity.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her work, which, among other things, emphasises the importance of reviewing the legality of the European âexecutiveâ agencies, those with certain responsibilities for managing Community programmes.
I support in particular the requirement that these agencies must comply with the principle of transparency and with rules governing access to their documents.
Lastly, I welcome the suggestion of a hearing of those nominated to head the agencies before the competent parliamentary committee and the idea that, on the committeeâs recommendation, Parliament should deliver an opinion on the proposed candidate.
This role of âex-anteâ political scrutiny played by Parliament would be the natural complement to the âex-postâ political scrutiny, in the form of the discharge for the implementation of the budget.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Commission statement on the prospects for the Doha Development Round after the World Trade Organisation General Council meeting of 15 December 2003.(1)
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Lamy and Commissioner Fischler, I would like to pick up on two brief comments that the two Commissioners made this morning.
Commissioner Lamy remarked that we were, so to speak, passing from the technical stage to the political stage of the negotiating process, since officials had, in December, come to a sort of agreement as to how negotiations were to be proceeded with, although it is still not yet clear how the political negotiators can actually put that into an active working calendar.
The second comment that I found very interesting was from Commissioner Fischler, who said what we would do, and added that it would not be at any price.
That is, of course, an allusion to the European agenda and to the issue of how our thinking can have any influence in the context of the WTO negotiations.
What, though â if I may make so bold as to ask the two Commissioners â does that actually mean in concrete terms?
Next year is an election year and a difficult one; you two will still be here in its first half, then things will get critical, and then â so to speak â you will no longer be there.
We do not know who will be.
The situation is similar on the American side â Bob Zoellick will not be coming back again either â and nor is the geostrategic situation straightforward; look at the way things are shaping up in India, look at China or at Brazil.
So I ask you both: what do you now expect to happen, and how are you preparing yourselves for it?
What is in your calendars for January, February, and March, and when do you think the political stage will begin?
Now for my second question. Where is the pain barrier?
Where do we really think it is?
What is the ânot at any priceâ issue?
The Singapore issues?
I think not.
Agriculture?
Perhaps, but I have seen the draft working document on the market organisation for sugar.
Will you, Commissioner, produce a final draft by the end of your term of office?
You see, where is our pain barrier?
If we know a bit more about that, I believe we might perhaps be able to be a bit more proactive in steering the process that you all and we all want.
In relation to that, please allow me to put a final question to the two Commissioners: what do you now, really, think of Bob Zoellickâs latest venture?
I heard brief indications that you take a positive view of it, but could you go into more detail about just how positive?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, among the many failures that marked the history of the European Union in 2003 â the split on Iraq, the rejection of the euro by Sweden, the wreck of the Stability Pact and the fiasco of the draft constitution â the rout of the Commission in CancÃºn, which we debated in this very House just a short time ago, could in the end have been regarded as a minor incident.
The vast majority of countries and people were actually glad that the CancÃºn Conference collapsed.
The earth did not stop turning as a result and neither, moreover, did the world of trade.
We could have left it at that and therefore preserved our way of life, because that is what this is all about, the covetousness of multinational markets.
But we were reckoning without the Commissionâs being so proactive; without you, Commissioner Lamy, being so proactive, if I may say so.
In fact, this proactive stance owes nothing to any economic or social imperative â we have not heard anyone lament the failure of CancÃºn â but is actually due entirely to your desire to exercise and defend the Commissionâs monopoly on representing the EU and negotiating on its behalf in the field of international business and external trade.
The relentless pursuit of this goal that you are proposing to us is in fact not at all guided by the interests of Europe, but by the specific interests of the Commission in Brussels, at a time when the danger threatening our external trade, Commissioners, is not the lack of new outlets for our products but quite clearly the insurmountable and intolerable handicap imposed on us by an introverted European Central Bank, which delivers the most expensive, and by no means the strongest, currency in the world.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I should like to say to the two Commissioners here â one of whom was in CancÃºn â how well and hard they worked to get a solution to the WTO negotiations.
Where do we go from our new position?
Mrs Mann said, quite rightly, that we will have new people, both from America and from the European Union.
We must make sure that people understand the position in which the European Union has put itself.
Commissioner Lamy said in his speech that we have correctly reformed to move forward.
How right he is.
One of the reasons for the failure of the CancÃºn debate was its use and misuse, for example by NGOs.
I have two press releases, one from Oxfam and the other from Friends of the Earth, one of which states that the G21 today refused to accept European plans to expand the WTO and bring in new negotiations to liberalise investment.
Mr RÃŒbig talked about small and medium-sized enterprises, the very things that are needed within the European Union and within the developing countries to help them.
They are the backbone of their future.
The other press release mentions bullying.
Could I ask this august House whether our two Commissioners look like bullies?
Have they been throwing their weight around the WTO trying to bully the emerging democracies into submission?
Not at all.
We reformed.
Commissioner Fischler worked hard on the reformation of the common agricultural policy.
That is the way forward.
We must get the message across: the European Union is there to negotiate.
Commissioner Lamy has put forward 'everything but arms' in the new proposals that are helping these underdeveloped countries.
We must get these points across and make sure that we have multilateral discussions with EU involvement.
At this point, I must say how well the European Parliament meetings in CancÃºn were received, and how well we were supported by some of the developing countries.
It is important that we play a strong and future-oriented role in the next negotiations.
I rely on the new negotiators, whoever they may be, to make sure we get that point across.
Â Â  â Mr President, on 30 August last year, an important decision was made.
On the eve of CancÃºn, the United States, the EU and the developing countries agreed to flesh out paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration, which has to do with the production of medicines for developing countries undergoing serious health crises.
The agreement is not brilliant, but it is a start, although we now have to think about implementing it.
I have meanwhile gleaned from the press that the United States is backtracking from it.
That is why now is the time for the European Union to take a few convincing steps.
So far, though, the European Union is showing little initiative.
An opportunity to carry out in practice the decision of 30 August was recently lost with the review of legislation on pharmaceuticals.
The Commission appears to be of the opinion that this matter belongs in Community and national patent legislation, but that is insufficient.
The Community patent is still some way off and does not involve existing patents.
Moreover, the Community patent does not affect data protection in any way.
The health crisis in Africa is an urgent problem.
Last month, it became known that AIDS has claimed five million casualties over the past year.
It is beyond me why the EU has not so far been prepared to do what the EU agreed upon prior to the Conference of CancÃºn.
Commissioner, what I want to know from you is when the European Union will have taken the legal measures in order to speed up the production of generic medicines for developing countries.
What pledges can you make to Parliament today?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will develop a few ideas regarding the sector that is most dear to meÂ âÂ agricultureÂ âÂ because, whilst I support the policy to guarantee the greatest benefits of the expansion of world trade to developing countries, I would like to stress that the European Union has already granted these and so many trade preferences to become the main market for the export of agricultural products.
I would like to again consider the further concessions and the proposal for duty-free access, because this does not, in my view, constitute the most effective means to help farmers in these countries, whilst it would permanently jeopardise many strategic European products.
As a negotiating tactic, I would strengthen the argument in defence of the Community system, to guarantee stability mechanisms on the world market, knowing that stability of world prices is beneficial to all members of the World Trade Organisation.
In order to do this, and not cause a structural crisis in the agriculture sector, I am adamant that the results of the WTO negotiations should not go further than the decisions taken in Berlin in the context of Agenda 2000 and supporting prices and markets should remain a fundamental element in the common agricultural policy.
Following changes to the United States support system that were, in my view, very intelligent, we need to review our internal support to examine to what extent the GATT agreement is being respected and to assess the effect of aid on market prices and the competitive positions of commodities.
Finally, it is important that the issue of the great challenges posed by enlargement for the European Union is raised during the WTO talks.
This is a process of worldwide significance that must, in my view, be recognised at the negotiation table.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioners, thank you very much for being here today, and I will take this opportunity to speak about cotton, which is a problem for Spain and Greece, but which I would like the whole of Europe to take on board.
Cotton cultivation in Europe, in fact, only accounts for 1% of the world's surface area and 15% of European needs.
The remaining 85% is imported mainly from the poorer countries, without tariffs.
Furthermore, we have other third countries, such as the United States, which is the world's largest exporter of cotton, or China, which dominates the market by being the world's main producer, the main consumer of industrial cotton and the main exporter of textiles.
Despite the insignificance of cotton in Europe, however, there have been certain statements against Community policy on the sector, which I believe to be entirely demagogic, since in the European Union export refunds are not given and goods are imported freely, without tariffs.
Specifically, France led the proposal on the part of four African countries at the WTO ministerial conference in CancÃºn to remove aid for cotton and has subsequently presented a European initiative on cotton which attempts to promote a Commission-led action programme in favour of the African cotton-growing economies and, at the same time, includes a reference urging reform of the system of aid for cotton, partially decoupling it from production.
I would like Commissioner Lamy to hear me: Commissioner, I believe that this attitude can only be interpreted as a wink or a gesture of rapprochement by France to these countries and the powerful interests of French capital in the African cotton sector by means of the French Company for the development of textile fibres and its subsidiaries in Africa, with the French State as the main participant in its capital.
In no way can this justify the belligerence allowed by the Commission in CancÃºn, with a proposal which it was inappropriate to present in that forum and which unjustly condemns Community policy in this sector.
Neither does it justify the reform of the Community system of aid for cotton as suggested by the Commission, the approval of which would mean the social and economic death of many communities, without â and this is more serious â as a result resolving the problems of competitiveness of the sector in Africa.
Finally, with regard to European agriculture in general, I would like to point out that the objective agreed at the G20 is to achieve an agreement on the dismantling of aid for exports, as well as a significant reduction in tariffs and direct aid which distort the market.
Nevertheless, it appears, Mr Lamy, that in your meeting with the G20 countries, held in Brasilia, the European Union would have accepted the demand to define the criteria relating to the green box in a more restrictive manner.
I would like you to either confirm or deny this information because, Commissioner, agreeing to discuss it goes further than the mandate that you had received, but, above all, it directly affects the very principles of the reform of the CAP which we approved six months ago and not just that of cotton which we are discussing here.
It is all very well to adopt measures in favour of the least-developed countries, but what benefits them more, and they say this themselves, is greater viability for their exports rather than a growth in the volumes exported, which in reality benefits the marketing companies based in the most developed countries.
For example, sugar producers believe that export quotas for sugar at guaranteed prices are more profitable for their economies than the possibility of exporting without restrictions.
I would urge you to consider all of this very carefully and to listen to the supposed beneficiaries of all these policies.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the recent statement by the American representative in the WTO is without a doubt the only new piece of information that we have learnt since our last discussion.
I think it is an interesting statement, because it seems to indicate a change of attitude on the part of the United States and suggest that it will be possible to relaunch the negotiations in the WTO.
It also comes on top of the initiatives that the Commission itself has taken with a view to relaunching these negotiations.
But relaunching them does not mean letting go, facilitating does not mean abandoning everything, and I have to confess that after listening to this morningâs interventions I am a little concerned at the attitude expressed by a number of our Members, in particular on the Singapore issues.
We have always said here in the European Parliament that we are in favour of regulated trade facilitation.
We are in favour of liberalising trade subject to certain standards and rules, and it is clear that the Singapore issues will force the World Trade Organisation to lay down a number of rules.
It is regrettable that they omit certain aspects.
Personally, I would have liked social issues to have been taken into account in this context, but in Doha we were obliged, under pressure, to abandon the corresponding standards.
What worries me is that we now seem to want to abandon the Singapore issues too.
What chance do we have, if we adopt this position, of seeing social issues and the like reappearing on the negotiating table, if the few areas that had been accepted as a potential basis for negotiation are abandoned today?
I believe that the European Union has, through you, taken a series of initiatives with a view to facilitating matters.
I think that we should leave it at that.
The purpose of todayâs debate is not to reopen the Doha negotiations but to apply all of the agreements, including those on the issues that concern us and that affect the kind of globalisation that we want to develop.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioners, Mr Lamy said this morning that, in order for the world to be a better place, we need Doha.
I completely agree with this statement and therefore, just as I regretted the failure of CancÃºn at the time, today I must regret the lack of progress at the Geneva meeting in December, while acknowledging that the simple fact of having resumed talks is positive, although, as the President of the General Council has recognised, those talks have only served to provide a clearer view of the key issues and to make us aware of the difficulties we are going to face, as well as reaffirming, on the part of the members of the WTO, the commitment to the Doha programme and, above all, the multilateral trade system, which, in itself, is of sufficient importance.
The time has now come to show flexibility in our positions, so that we can move on from words to actions and furthermore do it at the pace that the calendar set at Doha requires.
I therefore believe that we should thank Commissioners Lamy and Fischler for their efforts to open up channels for dialogue with everybody and between everybody, as well as the work done with the clear objective of moving the Doha agenda forward without losing sight of the European Union's legitimate interests.
To this end, I completely agree with the analysis and the proposals contained in the Commission communication, particularly with regard to industrial tariffs and the need to achieve certain levels of commitment, particularly on the part of the emerging countries, which are much higher than those proposed in the Debray document and, in any event, equivalent to those of the European Union.
With regard more specifically to tariffs for textile products, the Commission's document talks about negotiating new reductions which are as close as possible to zero, a proposal I totally agree with, provided that this does not mean - and I hope the Commissioner will clarify this â that the European Union will be obliged to reduce its tariffs, while others have not achieved an equivalent level for theirs.
I would like to put a final question, Mr President.
This morning, Mr Lamy also referred to the European Union becoming more flexible in environmental terms.
I would like to ask him how far he intends that flexibility to go, because there is no doubt that the high costs in the environmental field are one of the causes of the relocation of many Community companies, but there is only one planet Earth, and the legislation demanded in order to achieve environmental development at planetary level must also be planetary.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief.
I would like to express my gratitude for the constructive contributions, of which we have heard a great many during the course of today.
I would simply like to comment on the issues relating specifically to agriculture, and then my fellow-Commissioner Mr Lamy will round off the discussion.
It was asked whether there are signs that the USA is now showing more flexibility on the cotton issue.
Well, as you know, Bob Zoellick has sent a letter to all WTO members in which he specifically addresses the issue of cotton.
In fact, he devotes a whole chapter to it, and from the way he presents it, there are indeed signs of more openness on this issue.
At any rate, he shows that he is open to reforms not only on export subsidies â that these should be eliminated, also as regards market liberalisation and the adoption of a less trade-distorting system of domestic support â but he also indicates that ways of providing better support to the very poor countries, which are wholly dependent on cotton production, should be developed through development assistance.
Let me comment on what Mrs GonzÃ¡lez said about cotton cultivation and the importance of cotton for Europe.
I must stress, yet again, that it is true that European output only amounts to around 2% of the global market.
It is also true that we do not apply any export subsidies and that we have completely opened our cotton markets to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) through the EBA decision.
Indeed, as you know, there is a proposal to amend our cotton regime, which would result in less trade-distorting measures for cotton; in other words, a mix of blue box and green box measures.
I am working towards the adoption of a decision on this issue in the Council of Agriculture Ministers in March.
On Japanâs rice policy, we all know that rice is a very sensitive issue for Japan and it has always been viewed as such.
However, we have seen that Japan has recently commenced bilateral negotiations with a number of WTO member states.
The rice issue is indeed included on the agenda for these bilateral negotiations and is an element of the negotiations, and one outcome is that the Japanese have generally started to adopt, shall we say, a more constructive or less rigid position on this issue in Geneva.
It was claimed that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime.
In fact, this is quite simply wrong; our mandate states quite specifically that we can indeed propose this for various products.
Mrs Mann asked me about progress on our sugar proposal.
We are working hard on preparing a proposal and I have already said that I am aiming to submit the proposal to the Commission in mid 2004 and then present it to Parliament and the Council.
Let me make one final comment; I would like to ask this House to play a part in intensifying the dialogue that we proposed in our opening statement.
We need more, we need more intensive talks, and I would ask you in particular to deepen the discussions with the NGOs, for some of the NGOs sometimes come up with ideas that are quite contrary to Europeâs interests.
I would ask you all to consider that waiting is in any event bad for us, for the European Union, and also for European agriculture.
Please consider this: the very positive reactions to our reforms around the world will fade away as the gap between the adoption of these reforms and the progress of the WTO negotiations widens.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, in my turn I should like to thank the speakers from the European Peopleâs Party, European Socialist and Liberal Groups, who expressed their support for the proposals that Mr Fischler and I have developed and for the paper that we have tabled both in the Council and here in this House.
Our main objectives in these negotiations remain the same: firstly, an additional phase of market opening; secondly, better rules to govern multilateral trade and, finally, better integration of developing countries, which so far have had only a very unequal share in the benefits of increased international trade.
If we try to translate all of this into an answer to your questions â what needs to be done, what has to be our objective for 2004 â then it is quite straightforward.
Our objective for 2004 is to achieve before the summer what could not be done in CancÃºn; in other words, it is to complete two thirds of the negotiating process.
That is our political objective for 2004.
Well then, you will say, given what you said in your introduction to the debate on how the work is progressing in Geneva, such an objective will no doubt require energy and acceleration.
The current work rate and the pressure in the Geneva boiler will have to be increased and, like others, we intend to stoke up the Geneva boiler to get things moving.
With this in mind â I have said this and I will say it again in response to MrsÂ Mannâs question â the letter that my American counterpart has circulated in recent days and on which he commented in the press yesterday is good news, because it gives the lie to a theory that was gaining currency and according to which 2004, an election year in the United States, was going to be a lost year.
Well, it is not! 2004 may very well not be a lost year and it is important that two of the major players in world trade, the United States and Europe, support this idea.
To achieve this we are of course going to have to get moving and we are going to work, as we have started doing since our mandate was renewed, with the G20, the G90, the United States and Japan, to mention just the main players of the moment, within a system of variable geometry that will enable us to put forward our own position in the best conditions.
As Mr Fischler rightly said, in our efforts to work on this process and drive it forward, if we are going to raise the temperature, we are going to need you and the contacts that you maintain with your colleagues in each of the major blocks that I have just mentioned.
That is what I had to say in response to the support expressed by a large majority during this debate.
I will now respond briefly to a few criticisms.
MrÂ Lannoye reproaches us, basically, in two respects: firstly, we did not redraft our mandate, we only repositioned it and, secondly, within this mandate traces of the so-called Singapore issues survive.
Yes, MrÂ Lannoye is right that we did not redraft our mandate and that we repositioned it.
And if there is a lesson to learn from what has happened between CancÃºn and now, we should bear in mind that no one around the WTO table has asked to renegotiate the programme of negotiations that was adopted in Doha.
It is this programme that is on the table and it is this programme that needs to be negotiated.
As for the Singapore issues, it is true that we have adopted a more flexible position. We see our priorities as facilitating trade and introducing greater transparency into public procurement, for reasons that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance should understand, being so keen on transparency.
In a number of cases this would actually be very beneficial to facilitating trade, in particular for small and medium-sized companies, which often, alas, do not have the resources to pay for the trouble-shooters that the major multinational groups can afford to employ to speed up decisions and ensure a smooth passage through procedures, customs and other networks.
To MrsÂ Figueiredo and MrÂ DÃ©sir, I will simply say once again that their fears about public services are unfounded.
My mandate on this point is clear and completely unambiguous.
I have never strayed from it and what is more I have no intention of doing so.
I will now turn to two specific points in response to comments made by MrsÂ Ferrer and MrsÂ Corbey.
MrsÂ Ferrer, on the textiles sector, we are prepared to reduce our textiles tariffs and therefore what remains of our industrial protection, but obviously on one condition, and that is that others do the same, which is part of the negotiations.
MrsÂ Corbey was enquiring about where we were on access to medicines: we are working on this in the two arenas where this work is now being followed up.
The first of these is Geneva, where we need to transpose the terms of the August agreement into the TRIPS Agreement, and we are working hard on this.
It is not as straightforward as it would seem, because the balance that was struck in August between the various different parties and the various different requirements needs to be reflected faithfully in a text that will now be a legal text and, clearly, this requires a little work.
We are also working on this within the European Union, because we want, as it were in anticipation, to amend our own provision on obligatory licensing in European legislation to bring it into line with the new WTO agreement and possibly allow easier access in a number of developing countries.
We are going to do so by tabling a proposal for a recommendation in the Council of Ministers because, pending the entry into force of the European legislation on patents, which has been adopted but will only take effect in a number of years, the only way of implementing this agreement on access to medicines is to amend existing national laws one by one.
We are therefore going to have the Council adopt a recommendation, if it agrees, and we have every reason to think that this will be the case, to ensure that the necessary amendments are made to each of the national laws, pending of course an update to the European provisions, which, I would remind you, will only come into force in a few yearsâ time.
Those are the answers that I wanted to give at this stage and I would like to thank you for your attention.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  . â Is the European Commission deaf?
That is the question that inevitably springs to mind when you read its policies for relaunching the Doha Round of the WTO international trade negotiations.
It actually seemed clear to us as soon as CancÃºn had failed â and we said so in this House â that the fact that the negotiations had reached deadlock showed that it was necessary to review the objective of global free trade and return to the idea of a form of globalisation that was controlled by the people.
In fact, the Commission programme recommends a revision of the strategy to achieve the EUâs objectives in the form of a new negotiating position.
This internally contradictory sentence states that there will be no in-depth review, just some tinkering around the edges.
The Commission retains its priority objectives of free market access, free global competition and free investment (the so-called Singapore issues), which are certainly of interest, but it should now give other concerns their rightful place, in our interests as well as in the interests of the developing countries.
We now need to lay down the rules for a form of international trade that better respects the sovereignty of nations and is more compatible with safeguarding the environment and public health.
Â Â  . â Has the Commission taken account of the CancÃºn Conference?
Reading its communication, tabled with a view to a possible relaunch of the negotiations on the Development Agenda that began in 2001, it is difficult to tell!
Its supposed âflexibilityâ on the Singapore issues is just tinkering around the edges; the call for a balance between rights and the market and its avowed intention to adopt more flexible positions in no way weaken neoliberal European policies.
Contempt, a lack of self-criticism and a reluctance to question remain at the heart of the Commissionâs creed.
Faced with Commissioner Lamyâs statements â rubberstamped by the Council â the poorest countries neither wish to sign up to the supposed new proposals nor are they awarding full marks to the policies implemented since Seattle.
On the contrary, the people of the South are organising themselves and resisting European ambitions and the WTO.
The opening up of trade in services provided for by the GATS and the no less sacrosanct opening of the market â put forward as a clear benefit for developing countries! â have been clearly identified as dangers by the countries of the South.
International relations, which are based on cooperation and trade between equals and are respectful of individual and collective fundamental rights, deserve better.
A public debate, relayed by elected representatives, to show the fallacy of this way of thinking is now unavoidable.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0355/2003) by Mr De Rossa, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on Petition 461/2000 concerning the protection and conservation of Great Apes and other species endangered by the illegal trade in bushmeat (2003/2078(ÎÎÎ)).
Â Â  . Mr President, obviously it will not be possible in five minutes to do justice to the issue.
I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate.
It is important that a petition signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe should be given a hearing in this House.
For a while that looked unlikely, so I thank everybody who worked so hard to ensure that it did.
I want to thank in particular Mr Corrie, the rapporteur for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, who also helped to prepare this report, because this was an enhanced cooperation report shared by the Committee on Petitions and the Development Committee.
At this point I would like to make clear that this report does not deal with hunting in Europe.
Therefore the three amendments tabled are not necessary and I would ask colleagues not to support them.
'Bushmeat' or 'wild meat' describes the food product of wild animals, whether consumed locally or traded commercially.
Although the overuse of bushmeat is a fast-growing problem everywhere, this report concentrates on Africa because the bushmeat problem there is the most significant and best-described in the literature.
However, the illegal trade in the meat of wild animals is not limited to Africa.
In Asia many species are unsustainably exploited, either to provide food for the pet trade or because people believe that eating specific animal parts can cure disease or strengthen their sexual capacities.
The trade in wildlife in South America is also growing and wild animals such as monkeys, birds, capybara and other large rodents, as well as tapirs, armadillos and deer, are for sale.
In principle any wild animal can be used to provide a market with bushmeat.
In Africa more than 50 species are for sale in markets and restaurants, including antelopes, monkeys, apes, pangolins, pigs, large rodents, elephants, reptiles â such as snakes, lizards and crocodiles, invertebrates â such as snails and insects, and birds such as hornbills.
However, the bulk of the trade is made up of mammals, usually weighing more than one kilogram.
Current estimates show that bushmeat is being consumed on a massive scale across the humid tropics, particularly in Africa.
The most recent estimates of the annual wild meat harvest are 23 500 tonnes in Sarawak, 67 000 to 164 000 tonnes in the Brazilian Amazon and between one million and five million tonnes â off the bone â in the Congo Basin.
This results in overexploitation.
In Africa, in 2000, at least one species of red colobus monkey probably became extinct due to hunting, and many other species are expected to follow shortly.
Livelihoods and biodiversity suffer as a result of overexploitation of wildlife for food.
Of the estimated 1.2 billion people who live on less than the equivalent of one euro a day, about 250 million live in agriculturally marginal areas, and a further 350 million live in or near forests, of whom an estimated 60 million are indigenous people living in forests.
A recent study by the UK Department for International Development has estimated that 150 million people â one-eighth of the worldâs poorest â regard wildlife as an important livelihood asset.
Therefore it is clearly not an easy problem to get to grips with.
Human population growth, poverty, bad governance, and the commercialisation of consumption and distribution of poached animals are the underlying causes of the bushmeat problem.
Natural resources cannot replenish themselves in the face of growing demand.
Small stable rural communities could subsist on the natural resources in their environment without depleting them.
However, the human population explosion, combined with an expanding urban â and world â market system, has changed this.
The exploitation of natural resources has become unsustainable, with the developed industrialised nations dominating the acquisition of resources.
Poverty inevitably outweighs concerns about conservation and makes enforcement measures seem unjustified and hard to implement where people depend on bushmeat to survive.
Many of the underlying causes of the unsustainable bushmeat trade also cause poverty: weak local governance and unfavourable terms of trade.
It is therefore important that the conservation and development communities should work together with indigenous populations and civil society on this shared agenda in order to address the underlying causes of poverty and biodiversity loss.
I have listed about 20 issues which the Commission should address.
Resources are obviously required.
We have avoided putting a figure on those resources, but the Commission should commit a specific amount of resources to ensure that this matter is dealt with effectively and that it is possible to work with the relevant organisations and with the people on the ground who either depend on bushmeat for income or for protein to survive.
Â Â  . Mr President, addressing the bushmeat crisis is of the utmost importance.
As you know only too well, poaching and unsustainable levels of hunting threaten the existence of some of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom: the gorilla species, chimpanzees and other types of apes.
This matter is clearly of concern to the general public, as nearly twoÂ million signatures to the petition suggest.
It is also a matter of great concern to the Commission, in line with the global commitment to stop biodiversity loss by 2010.
We therefore welcome the report from Mr De Rossa, which I find balanced and to the point.
We are working to address the issue in a number of different ways, but I must first emphasise the need to distinguish clearly between the bushmeat crisis â which threatens certain species of animals â and the everyday consumption of wild meat, which forms an essential part of food security for poor people in the developing world.
We are well aware that there are several aspects related to bushmeat which go beyond the development agenda; these include health issues in Europe, some trade issues as well as scientific issues.
But since most over-exploitation of bushmeat takes place in developing countries, the best solution is to provide support for these countries through our development cooperation efforts and address the bushmeat crisis at its origin.
This crisis can be taken up in the context of natural resources, rural development or governance issues, or as a cross-cutting issue to be addressed through Environmental Impact Assessments and Strategic Environmental Assessments.
These assessments should identify risks and possible mitigation measures with respect to bushmeat for all development activities.
In this respect, I am happy to inform you that the manual for âIntegrating environment concerns into development and economic cooperationâ will be finalised and made operational during the first half of this year.
The revised manual should go a long way to ensuring that proper attention is given to bushmeat issues in environmental assessments and therefore in all our relevant development activities.
The mid-term reviews of our cooperation strategies this year will be used to strengthen the integration of environmental concerns, in particular through promoting a more systematic use of Country Environmental Profiles, Strategic Environmental Assessments and as previously mentioned, Environmental Impact Assessments.
All this is fine; it may not constitute a very direct reaction but nonetheless provides the background necessary for proper consideration of the issue.
National ownership is very important.
In fact, activities aimed at curbing over-exploitation of bushmeat mean if the bushmeat countries themselves do not take the lead.
We can help with appropriate support-building capacity and with injecting the views expressed when we are revising country strategies, but the ownership of the problem is crucial.
I would like to add a special point which is that peace is essential.
If we look at the conflict in the DRC and in other countries in the region over the past 10 years, the reality is that these conflicts have been blocking any attempt to create even a minimum of governance in relation to the problem we are discussing.
Soldiers and internally displaced people, refugees, have had no restriction, no incentive, no guidance, no punishment, no governance whatsoever on how to behave in this regard.
It has been an area outside law and order and we have seen the terrible consequences.
I would make this number one on the list of priorities and, in fact, I regard a peace dividend for the environment and for the bushmeat crisis as one of the many important aspects for securing peace in the DRC and elsewhere in the region.
The Commission is not convinced that a specific action plan would be the best way to address the bushmeat crisis, and this reflects what I said about ownership.
Both the EC strategy for integrating environmental into economic and development cooperation and the Biodiversity Action Plan for development cooperation are being reviewed this year.
It is preferable to ensure that bushmeat issues are properly addressed in these two strategies, rather than to put together a specific bushmeat strategy which would require a lot of resources in terms of staffing but may not necessarily lead to additional action to address the problem.
Considering the multi-sectoral implications of the bushmeat issue, such an approach would not be the best one.
Many Community projects in East, South and West Africa take on this challenge in very practical terms.
Although spending on the environment as a percentage of the total aid programme is quite low, we have invested considerably in environmental protection and management in key countries.
For example, in Central Africa since 1992 the Commission has invested approximately EURÂ 67 million in the Ecofac programme for Central African forest ecosystems, which pilots innovative, protected-area management in crucial Great Ape habitats.
The Commission is also funding work to control hunting and poaching in private forest concessions, and promoting eco-tourism in the region as part of its responsible management of the initiative.
Furthermore, we are working at political level to address the bushmeat crisis.
For example, we recently provided a EURÂ 500Â 000 grant to help launch the Africa Ministerial Process for Forest Law Enforcement and Governance.
Although the primary objective of this process is to improve forest-sector governance and combat illegal logging, the inclusion of several important references to bushmeat and wildlife in the conference declaration will help to raise the profile of this issue.
We very much welcome the initiative of presenting this broad-based engagement on the part of the public to Parliament.
This, in my view, is a very constructive way of giving this issue the attention it deserves.
Â Â  . Mr President, any petition which receives 1.9 million signatures deserves to be treated seriously.
I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his excellent report and the way in which he presented it today.
Firstly, can the Commissioner confirm that the action plan only covers tropical areas, and in particular the continent of Africa, and does not in any way impinge on hunting in the European Union, as some people are interpreting it?
Sensible action is vital and urgent for three reasons.
Firstly, as Mr De Rossa has said, at least 150 million of the world's poorest people regard wildlife as a vital livelihood asset.
Commercial hunting, the exploitation of timber and the opening-up of the forests are destroying the ecological balance and depriving local inhabitants of their food and livelihood.
Secondly, the totally indiscriminate killing of great ape species will wipe out gorillas and chimpanzees, which in countries such as Rwanda are a major sustainable tourist attraction and source of income that will be lost forever.
The devastation of forests will also obliterate an ecology if logging is not urgently brought under control.
There is a third even more important point.
The illegal exporting of bushmeat to all corners of the globe could have a devastating effect on health that would make SARS look like the common cold.
Many gorillas and chimpanzees carry SIV, the animal equivalent of HIV, which can jump to humans â and has done so.
That would be bad enough, but if ebola-infected meat reaches the world market, we could see a catastrophe far worse than HIV.
Recently, 2Â 000 monkey noses were found in a suitcase at Amsterdam airport, showing that the illegal trade is thriving.
This resolution urges the Commission to adopt a series of measures, which I hope it will.
However, making Heads of State in bushmeat countries aware of the situation and getting them, as the Commissioner has said, to take the lead in action to safeguard ecosystems and the wildlife they support would be a major step forward.
Â Â  Mr President, I support the ideas behind the proposals in Mr De Rossa's excellent report and congratulate him on it.
One of the issues we need to address is the definition of bushmeat.
It is insufficiently precise.
We know or believe that we are all talking about the same thing: primarily, endangered species, in particular the great apes.
There is, however, a delicacy trade, which is for the consumption of bushmeat outside Africa.
It is clearly enormously difficult, both in Africa and in South America, to prevent people who are starving or who have extremely limited amounts of food from 'poaching' in their neighbouring jungle.
However, there are species both in South America and in Africa that can be managed and could form the basis of an organised trade, with the appropriate safeguards.
My concern is that there is a large market in Europe for bushmeat.
Every year several thousands of pounds in weight of illegally-imported bushmeat is seized at London Heathrow airport alone, most of it in an appalling condition.
There is a reasonably large number of residents and citizens from the European Union, and from African and South American countries who, perhaps legitimately, want to consume this if it can be provided on a sustainable basis.
This demand will not go away any more than the demand of Mr De Rossa's Irish compatriots for Guinness will go away, wherever they are based.
The risk is that we will drive it underground even further than has been the case.
One of the options that the Commission needs to look at most earnestly is the proper management of the trade, which would involve extensive and, unfortunately, expensive, surveys of animal populations, control of selective killing and, as far as the export trade is concerned, proper regulation for public health.
As Mr Corrie said, driven underground, the implications of this trade for public health are appalling.
It is a scandal that, in the interests of land management, American multi-millionaires can shoot elephants that need to be culled, whilst people of African origin are not allowed to buy and consume bushmeat in a managed trade.
I thank Mr De Rossa for his assurance that this report does not and cannot refer to deer and elk management in Europe.
I would also point out that any references to high-powered rifles are unnecessary.
There are approximately 20 million AK-47s in Africa, and any control we have over rifles in the European Union will make no difference.
However, like other colleagues, I urge the Commission to take action soon.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his report on the protection and conservation of great apes and other species endangered by the illegal trade in bushmeat.
This report, as we have been told, arose from a petition signed by 1.9 million people EU-wide, which led the Committee on Petitions to produce its report.
This was not, may I say, without resistance from certain political groups in this House.
The Christian Democrats, many of whose press releases extolling the virtues of the DeÂ Rossa Report are today littering the press centre in Strasbourg, initially voted against the report being prepared.
We in the animal welfare and conservation movements welcome the late conversion of British Conservatives to the side of animal welfare in this regard.
The same is true of the Green and Liberal Groups who to begin with also voted against the report being prepared.
In the interests of public health, public safety and the protection of endangered species, we will be supporting the demands for the EU to use both carrot and stick to encourage conservation of these endangered species in their indigenous habitats, to enable local communities to find alternative food sources and to prevent the illegal importation of bushmeat into the EU.
Mr Corrie's mention of the recent seizure in Amsterdam of 2Â 000 monkey noses indicates all too well the extent of the trade and the suffering and devastation occasioned to these animals.
We will not be supporting any of the three amendments, which we believe are misconceived and â deliberately or not â mischievous.
Mr De Rossa's report is concerned with the illegal hunting of endangered species and in no way poses a threat to hunting in the European Union, as the EDD Group amendment claims.
Apart from Gibraltar, where safeguarding the apes might be a welcome way of deflecting a Spanish threat, Europe has no great apes.
Equally, the ELDR Group amendment is a contradiction in terms: there is no such thing as a sustainable level of hunting for critically endangered species.
Â Â  Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr De Rossa for his report.
For the record, Mr Ford, the formal proposal to the committee to prepare this report came from me.
It therefore cannot be said that the Greens opposed it.
I should like to highlight a couple of issues, one being the role of logging companies.
There are proposals within the report as to how we could help them to face up to their responsibilities, given that, at times, they use bushmeat as an apparently cheap and readily available food source for their workers and their vehicles are used to carry poached meat.
The proposal is to incorporate this into the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade process, which I welcome.
Secondly, the issue of importing into the European Union and the highly questionable and grim circumstances surrounding it has already been raised.
We could do more at this end, in terms of educating consumers and suppliers in the Union, to help them realise what the effect of their actions is on the ecology and development in the countries of origin and to stop people from regarding bushmeat as a luxury delicacy, whereas what we are really looking at is the potential extinction of animals in certain places.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, before introducing the amendment that I have tabled, I should like to state that my group supports the protection and conservation of the great apes, particularly in Africa.
Although the great apes are already protected by the Washington Convention and cannot therefore be hunted, they should nonetheless be monitored more closely to prevent poaching, following the example of the ABAC programme (Alternatives to Poaching in Central Africa).
But, as the rapporteur explains, hunting is not the only reason why these species are dying out, far from it.
The massive, mechanised deforestation of equatorial Africa and the population explosion across the continent as a whole are key factors in the destruction of the Great Apesâ habitat, without forgetting the unprecedented devastation caused by the Ebola virus in recent years.
That is why I believe that we need to redefine the notion of the bushmeat crisis, so that it stands for more than just excessive removal of animals from the wild.
There are many different underlying causes for the disappearance of these species.
The definition of wild meat is not acceptable either as it stands, in my opinion, because it introduces confusion as to the origin of game.
I think that in a legislative text â to respond to MrÂ Ford â any clarification is always useful and I think that in all cases it is extremely important to define the scope very strictly.
In this report, which concerns tropical and equatorial areas, we should confine ourselves to the term âbushmeatâ.
The generic term âwild meatâ is much too vague.
It also encompasses the species of game that are present in the Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by again thanking the rapporteur for this very necessary report.
I regret that Mr Ford wants to make this a political matter, because I believe this is something on which all political parties could work together for the greater good in order to stop this horrible trade.
As we meet here in Strasbourg, great apes, gorillas, chimpanzees and monkeys are all being hunted to extinction for bushmeat.
At the current rate, people are paying a premium to eat more great apes each year than are now kept in all the zoos and laboratories of the world.
The shocking statistic is that if the slaughter continues at its current pace, the remaining wild apes in Africa will be gone within the next 15 to 50 years â a long time, but it will soon go if we do not stop this trade.
I pay tribute to Dr Brian Carroll of Bristol Zoo, in my own region, who has worked with zoos across the UK to collect a stunning half a million signatures as part of the Europe-wide campaign.
We are facing a catastrophe that affects both the survival of our closest relatives and the people who rely on forests for their livelihoods.
The biggest challenge now facing conservationists is to reduce the demand for bushmeat.
It is essential that we maintain an education programme that will keep people from buying and eating great apes through greater understanding and awareness.
However, we can do more here in Europe.
I am horrified by the scale of this sickening trade every year.
Tonnes of bushmeat are confiscated at Europe's airports.
We must have stricter controls at all EU ports and airports to stop such meat getting into Europe â witness, colleagues, the devastation caused by foot-and-mouth outbreaks across Europe.
We had our own inquiry.
Foot-and-mouth is prevalent in parts of western Africa.
Smuggled bushmeat could not only spark a new outbreak in Europe, it could also expose our livestock to diseases and epidemics on the African continent.
Every kilogram of smuggled meat in the EU food chain poses a real threat not only of animal diseases, but also human ones, such as Ebola.
Colleagues, your support for the conclusions of this temporary committee into the outbreak, and its demand for tougher measures to prevent diseases entering the EU was overwhelming, yet in my own country we have only six sniffer dogs to seek out this hideous trade.
We are not taking this threat seriously enough and all Member States could do more.
Endangered wildlife and habitats are a precious and irreplaceable asset.
We must stop this barbaric trade before it is too late.
Â Â  Mr President, I think we should establish from the outset that the reasons why this lucrative illegal trade is flourishing are exactly the same as those at the root of both the illegal narcotics trade and of illegal arms trading.
Analysis of these activities demands a better understanding of the contribution which, as the Commissioner said, conflict and weak governance in particular make to this problem, and we in the European Union, as donors, should perhaps be more serious about supporting conservation and biodiversity projects.
Running alongside this, the efforts we make on conflict prevention and the peace facility proposed for the African Union, etc. will play their part in addressing some of the concerns raised here today.
This is an issue which has been regularly debated in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and which has consistently received the support of our ACP parliamentary colleagues.
They tell us, and we have had discussions with them, about the importance â also emphasised by the Commissioner â their governments must attach to the priority of making sustainable management and conservation of natural resources a clear part of their national indicative programmes.
That is something in which we have a role to play in the JPA, and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and elsewhere, because, unless governments make this a priority, I am afraid we are whistling in the wind.
It must also be said that bushmeat provides a major source of protein.
In some parts of Nigeria, up to 84% of protein is obtained from bushmeat, which plays a significant part in people's lives.
Where access to wildlife is restricted, people will have to adapt and continue to adapt in ways that entail even greater risks.
It is much better to talk about controlling the trade than to suggest we stamp it out.
If we talk about stamping out the illegal trade in bushmeat, all we will do is drive it underground and make it much more difficult to deal with.
The importance of bushmeat in the livelihoods of poor people has never been assessed.
We have made a lot of pronouncements this afternoon, but there has been no clear assessment of the importance of bushmeat in people's livelihoods.
I would end by saying that better management of the trade might contribute in no small way to our objective of meeting poverty eradication targets.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr De Rossa for this very important report.
The illegal bushmeat trade is devastating endangered species and habitats in many developing countries.
I welcome and endorse one recommendation in particular: to step up measures to detect and prevent illegal imports of bushmeat into Europe.
Incredibly, smuggling illegal meat into Europe through ports and airports is still relatively easy despite the fact that this almost certainly caused the devastating foot-and-mouth epidemic in 2001, to which Mr Parish referred.
The European Union must set an example here and send a clear message to smugglers that any bushmeat they bring to ports of entry will be detected and they will be prosecuted.
Regrettably, this violent, profitable trade continues unabated and thousands of tonnes of illegal bushmeat, from West Africa in particular, is slipping undetected into Europe each year, with organised gangs going unpunished.
It must be said that the United States is showing us the way here: anyone who has recently travelled through a US airport will undoubtedly have been confronted by a hardworking beagle sniffing every piece of luggage for imported foodstuffs.
I implore the European Commission to get tough with Member States.
Finally I also urge colleagues to reject irrelevant amendments to this report which seek to defend local European hunting practices and will inevitably weaken its recommendations.
Â Â  . Mr President, we lacked the imagination, when preparing my statement, to include the aspect of hunting in Europe.
I see that quite simply as being outside the scope of what one would normally expect this initiative to cover and fully agree with Mr De Rossa, Mr Corrie and others who have addressed this misunderstanding.
We have enough real problems to cope with.
The remarks made by Mrs Mathieu and others about hunting not being the only threat to these species are very important to bear in mind.
There are two separate aspects: that of a deliberate threat, driven by greed, and that of a threat that is driven by people's need to survive.
Both are equally dangerous for the species we are talking about.
In this discussion I see a parallel with the difficult issue of the need for Africans to change and move from a pastoral lifestyle, where they roam the countryside grazing their cattle, but in which there is an imbalance between the number of people and cattle and the square kilometres available.
It is this pressure on land use, reflecting urbanisation and population growth, which many people do not expect to be a problem in a place as big as Africa.
However, when one looks at the environmental constraints, such as access to water, Africa is not so big.
The pressure on forests is one such systemic, ongoing and dramatic pressure which presents perhaps the greatest obstacle to establishing a sustainable alternative because the issue has to do with poverty and with real problems.
We should mount a strong front to tackle the problem of criminal acts driven by greed.
Trying to convince logging companies to act within the law and to adhere to regulations, and for this to be more widely recognised by governments, is part of the drive to create a minimum of decency in matters relating to forestry in African countries.
This is quite clearly part of the action and our policy.
Finally, there are many aspects to the trade issue.
One is quite simply our own legitimate defence of our health standards.
We stopped imports of Nile perch from Lake Victoria for a number of years until we successfully managed â and this is one of my pet cases â to create an effective phytosanitary control.
These exports are now up and running again and we have recreated thousands of jobs on a sustainable basis.
I find it a little strange, however, that we have not done anything similar when it comes to bushmeat.
What people have said in this debate is quite correct: ebola is one threat and there are many other very difficult aspects of this trade which require considerable attention.
At the same time, many people depend for their survival on being able to hunt and eat bushmeat in their normal, traditional environment.
We should respect that.
We have had the debate about the brain drain.
Maybe we can start discussing the protein drain, where the temptation to get our hands on exotic protein should be countered by focusing greater public attention on the issues involved.
I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for this initiative.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr Ford has the floor for a personal statement in accordance with Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order, it was suggested by both Mrs Lambert and more indirectly by Mr Parish that I misled the House when I claimed that the PPE-DE, ELDR and Verts/ALE Groups had tried to block the De Rossa report from appearing on the agenda.
While I accept Mrs Lambert's personal enthusiasm for this report and the fact that she proposed that it be drawn up, my criticism was of her Group's attitude and that of the other Groups.
The matter was raised by the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions at a meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs some time last autumn.
They were opposed to the Petitions Committee using the Rules of Procedure to produce this report.
The matter was referred to the meeting of the Chairs of the Political Groups, where initially the only vote in favour of the report was that of Mr BarÃ³n Crespo from the PSE Group.
It took considerable heavy lobbying of the other Groups to persuade their chairmen to change their minds and allow this report to be produced on the important subject we have in front of us today.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on EU aid to Iran following the earthquake.
Â Â  . Mr President, the magnitude of the Bam earthquake and the degree of devastation that it caused prompted an appeal from the Iranian authorities for international assistance and a massive international and European response within hours of the disaster occurring.
The toll has now risen to 30Â 000 dead, with a similar number of people injured, 45Â 000 homeless, and 85% of Bam destroyed.
The Commission has been active in providing emergency humanitarian assistance in coordinating the efforts of search-and-rescue teams from EU Member States and from the EEA, candidate and accession countries.
On Saturday 27 December 2003, the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office ECHO, adopted a primary emergency decision for EURÂ 2.3Â million to address the most urgent needs arising from the earthquake.
EURÂ 1Â 452Â 129 were granted to the Red Cross family â the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Finnish Red Cross and the German Red Cross â to support the relief efforts of the Iranian Red Crescent Society with the provision of food parcels, tents, blankets, heaters, kitchen sets and hygienic kits, and to address health needs through the establishment of a field hospital and basic health units.
Another EURÂ 813Â 577 were allocated to the and for health care and related activities, and finally EURÂ 34Â 294 were provided to to set up a satellite-based communication network to facilitate communication and coordination between the relief agencies working in the disaster region.
Alongside the humanitarian aid response, the EU Civil Protection Monitoring and Information Centre, hosted by the Commission, had initiated, after agreement from the Iranian authorities, the dispatch of urgent response teams.
Immediately after the earthquake, in the morning of 26Â December, the EU Civil Protection Monitoring and Information Centre offered assistance to Iran and distributed an advance warning to its 30Â Contact Points in countries participating in the Civil Protection Cooperation Mechanism.
On 26Â December, the first teams left their respective countries and by 27Â December, the EU coordination of the search and rescue efforts, headed by the Italian civil protection unit, was operational in Bam.
In total, 18 countries participated in this joint effort with assistance ranging from search and rescue teams â sniffer dogs, firefighters and other specialists â to the provision of relief items â field hospitals and other equipment.
As the search-and-rescue phase of the emergency response came to an end, the attention shifted to ensuring that the basic humanitarian needs of the survivors of the earthquake are covered in the next few months.
On 8Â January 2004, both the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and the UnitedÂ Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs launched appeals to assist in the relief and recovery response in Bam.
Following a first assessment mission which took place between 29 and 31 December, ECHO dispatched a second expertsâ mission to Bam between 5 and 8 January to review the situation, assess further needs and coordinate with the other agencies present on the ground.
As a result of this second assessment, a number of sectors stand out as priority areas for intervention: health; sanitation and hygiene; psychosocial support and tracing; and a focus on vulnerable groups, notably children and the elderly.
On the basis of its own assessments and of the UN and Red Cross Appeals, the Commission is considering taking a second decision in favour of the victims of the Bam earthquake in the next few weeks.
By responding as we did, we were able to use the first EURÂ 2.3 million to cover all the requests that we had at the time and can now consider new requests.
It is extremely important that the international community be able to do something that goes beyond the very immediate assistance required in situations such as this.
Â Â  â Mr President, the earthquake on 26 December virtually destroyed the city of Bam.
The extent of the devastation and the resulting human suffering have deeply shocked us all.
However, one positive thing has come out of this tragedy: the prompt, rapid and comprehensive assistance from all over the world, including the EU, its Member States and even the USA, which Iran accepted.
Only the assistance offered by Israel was rejected.
This House wishes to express its gratitude to the Commission for acting so promptly on 27 December.
This shows the Iranian Government, but above all the Iranian people, how much human solidarity there is with them in their present plight, regardless of the political relations with their country.
I am convinced that this is also a response to Iranâs signing of the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus fulfilling the international communityâs expectations on this key issue.
At the same time, however, there is still much cause for criticism on our part, especially on the human rights situation, although we welcome the fact that the EU/Iran human rights dialogue has commenced.
I myself attended the last meeting in Brussels; it was an open dialogue, not only between the EU delegation and the Iranian side but also within the Iranian delegation itself.
However, we in the European Parliament were already voicing our concerns back in autumn about the possibility of a crackdown on reformist parliamentarians in advance of the February elections.
Sadly, that is exactly what happened this week: more than 80 parliamentarians and hundreds of candidates were disqualified by the Guardian Council, including the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mirdamadi, the main interlocutor and host of a European Parliament delegation which visited in Iran, who was here with a delegation last year.
I think we should make it clear that just as we show human solidarity in response to natural disasters, we must also show political solidarity with the reformist movements in Iran which â within the limited parameters that currently exist there â are pressing for more democracy and freer elections.
That is an important point and I assume that the High Representative, Mr Solana, who is currently in Iran, will find the words to make this position clear.
I think it would send out the wrong signal if the European Union were to carry on regardless and adopt a business as usualapproach in this situation.
That would be very discouraging for those who want to hold a relatively free election in February, which is just next month.
What is needed now is not only solidarity with the victims in Bam but also solidarity with the reformers in Iran.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I wish to express our deep sympathy and solidarity with the Iranian people.
This dreadful tragedy has not only destroyed a region and a city; it has also impacted on an entire country and its people.
I am very gratified â and would like to state this very clearly to Commissioner Nielson â that the Commission, but also Europe as a whole, has displayed this solidarity and responded so swiftly and effectively to the tragedy.
I also think, however, that in light of this dreadful disaster, it is especially important for Iran to show that it is united and working towards the future.
My group and I myself are very concerned that in advance of the polls, pre-election disqualifications have occurred which prevent voters from making their own choice.
The whole point about democracy â and Iran is very proud of its democracy â is that the voters themselves choose who they want to represent them in parliament.
I very much hope that there is still an opportunity for Iran to reverse this decision and confirm to the public which candidates will be standing for election.
The choice must then be the Iranian peopleâs.
This is neither the time nor the place to get involved in a discussion about reformist versus conservative movements; I just want to make it very clear, on behalf of my group, that the public must decide.
I do not think that anyone in Iran should be alarmed about letting the people choose.
The Iranian people are intelligent enough to make the decision for themselves.
Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to the fact that Iran â not least in response to the initiative by a number of European foreign ministers â has signed the Additional Protocol at the International Atomic Energy Agency.
I do understand the fears in some quarters in Iran and the desire to possess the latest nuclear technology.
After all, some countries in the vicinity already have nuclear weapons and have established nuclear technology research programmes.
I am thinking particularly of India, Pakistan and Israel.
However, the region will not become more secure if even more countries have nuclear weapons.
After all, we are in favour of disarmament across the board in all these countries, and I think that Iran is doing the right thing by abandoning its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons and is instead developing a different, more rational and, one could argue, a European concept of security.
We will certainly be very willing to give our support to Iran in this context.
I know that Iran is making very positive and constructive contributions to regional development; I know this is true of Lebanon and it also seems to be the case in Iraq.
Naturally, I wish the same could be said of its stance on Israel and Palestine.
As someone who is always criticising the Israeli Government, I still take the view that all countries in this region and beyond should make their contribution to peace in the Middle East.
With this in mind, I would like to conclude by reiterating my groupâs solidarity with the Iranian people, but would also request and urge the Council to do more to encourage the development of democracy and human rights to their full capacity in Iran, in that countryâs own interests.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Nielson, it was naturally with great consternation that we heard the appalling news of the earthquake in Bam.
Right in the middle of the Christmas holidays, the TV screens were filled with horrific pictures of dead and injured people and of thousands of people desperately searching for their relatives in a city in ruins.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I wish to express our condolences to, and deepest sympathy with, the Iranian people at this difficult time.
Naturally, the EU should continue its work with the Iranian authorities to help those affected obtain care, roofs over their heads and other necessities.
We should also help with the reconstruction of the beautiful historic city.
Our concern for, and solidarity with, the Iranian people also extends to their access to democracy and human rights.
The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about these areas.
There is still a lot to be done, because the Iranian regime is anything but democratic.
Serious attacks on women, minorities, opposition members and dissidents are unfortunately part of everyday life.
We are extremely concerned about the latest development and the Council of Guardiansâ involvement in the forthcoming election.
By not accepting thousands of candidates throughout the country â more than half of those who have put their names forward â Iranâs Council of Guardians is again showing its unwillingness to reform the Iranian system of government.
Classifying the rejects as a bunch of criminals in view of the fact that they have had contacts with, for example, a number of groups disliked by the Council of Guardians rings hollow.
On that logic, a quarter of the legislators already sitting would be criminals.
If Iran wants ever to be counted among the democratic states, it must accept that political legitimacy is obtained from the people in free elections, not through the ayatollahsâ capricious interpretation of the will of God.
Just like everyone else, the Iranian people wants democracy and human rights.
We in the ELDR Group would call upon the Iranian leaders not to interfere in the election but to allow the candidates to stand so that the election is as fair and open as possible.
In that connection, I want, like my fellow MEPs, to call upon the Commission to strengthen and develop the human rights dialogue with Iran.
It must be something more than just polite chit-chat.
If it is to be meaningful, it must be clear, persistent and consistent and also be evaluated on a regular basis.
I hope that you, Commissioner Nielson, together with Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana, will be able to act in such a way as to inject new life into these discussions, partly in the light of the work on getting Iran to ratify and implement the Non-Proliferation Agreement.
Â Â  Madam President, last Sunday I returned from Iran following a political visit by Irish Members of Parliament to that country.
During that visit we met the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr Kharrazi, and other members of the government and parliament to discuss broader EU-Iranian relations at this time.
The Iranian Government and Iranian Parliament have expressed their gratitude to the EU and to the broader international community for the assistance they have been given to help in the reconstruction of Bam and to help the thousands of displaced persons in this region.
Basically, the tragedy in Bam was totally horrific, with tens of thousands of people dead and the infrastructure of this very historical city destroyed.
The bottom line with regard to the reconstruction of Iran from an EU perspective is the following: it is going to take months and years to reconstruct the city and help to rebuild the lives of thousands of people which have simply been destroyed by this horrific earthquake.
I strongly urge EU governments and the European Commission to make available long-term financial assistance to help the Iranian Government with these difficult regeneration tasks.
The European Union has committed over EUR 200 million in recent years to help rebuild Afghanistan, and the European Union must take the decision financially to support the Iranian Government for a number of years so as to ensure that the basic social infrastructural and educational needs are addressed in the reconstruction process of Bam.
Short-term financial assistance simply is not enough.
Longer-term financial assistance is required, and EU governments must take the political decisions to make these broader financial commitments available to the Iranian Government.
On a separate matter, I believe that political dialogue should recommence between the European Union and the Iranian Government.
We are all aware of the difficulties that the international community has had with the Iranian Government concerning its compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
However, the Iranian Government has signed protocols to this treaty, measures which we welcome.
Negotiations should restart between the Union and the Iranian Government in the context of a trade and cooperation agreement between us, and a structured political dialogue between our respective partners should also be set up.
In building close relations between the Union and Iran â which has a population of over 70 million people â it is best to build on the basis of dialogue and consultation rather than on the basis of political assumption, political prejudice and political coercion.
Finally, I totally support paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the resolution.
It has come as a horrible shock to learn of the decision to prevent people from standing for election.
We cannot accept that.
I am sure that Ayatollah Khamenei will reverse the decision â as it should be â in favour of those who are trying to bring peace and reform to Iran.
Â Â  Madam President, I congratulate the Member who exceeded the speaking time, because I believe that exceeding useless restrictions is a good thing.
I will begin by saying that we are astonished, we are shocked and that we want to fight against a majority of those elected to the current Iranian Parliament who were notÂ âÂ so to speakÂ âÂ previously banned and who have implemented a truly terrible policy since 1997, on the pretext of shortcomings due to the excess fundamentalist power of the Ayatollahs.
The problem is that this IranÂ âÂ of candidates and elected representatives who have not been bannedÂ âÂ is an Iran that is second only to China in terms of the number of cases of capital punishment.
President Khatamiâs Iran is an Iran where, according to official data, not only do they continue to stone men and women to death, but where, on 3Â February 2003, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahrudi said to Chris Patten that, at the moment, Iran does not provide for an alternative to stoning to death, and he said this to us!
Now, if you will allow me, it is of course a terrible outrage in terms of democracy to prevent these candidates, the afore-mentioned reformists from being elected, but what concerns me is that, if they are elected, they will continue to live with stonings, unjustified death penalties, hypocritical moderatism.
We in Europe are with Khatami, who acknowledges stonings and more, whilst we are shocked, ladies and gentlemen, that in NigeriaÂ âÂ where there is more than a hint of democracyÂ âÂ there was the real risk of just one woman being stoned; and no more have been stoned.
So, I would merely like to plead with those tabling this resolution to accept a type of oral amendment, inserting figures on death penalties and those executed, welcoming the fact that those condemned have not been executed.
I hope that tomorrow we either gather 32 signatures or we accept the oral amendment.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, Iran has just endured two seismic shocks in the space of a few weeks.
The first, the earthquake in Bam, had 40Â 000 victims.
The second, which was of a political nature, disqualifies more than 3Â 000 candidates from standing in the elections of 20Â February.
Is it improper to compare these two events, one of which is a natural disaster and the other, quite simply, a politico-religious attack?
I do not think so.
The Bam disaster moved the entire world.
The European Union has, for its part, already released humanitarian aid worth EURÂ 2.3 million and is planning further aid projects.
We support these unreservedly, whatever happens, to ease the suffering of the victims and express our solidarity with all of the people of Iran.
The world is aghast, however, at the decision to ban 3Â 000 reformist candidates from standing in the next parliamentary elections.
Europe, confident in the process of democratisation that had been put in place by the Iranian Government, had made progress in bilateral negotiations and agreements were coming into view.
Admittedly, it is not for us to dictate policy to a country or to interfere in its domestic affairs, but we reserve the right to choose our friends, those with whom we wish to collaborate and who have our confidence.
If a fair solution is not found to the current crisis, one that is accepted by the Iranian people as a whole, it will not have an impact on the humanitarian aid, but it will have a profound and lasting effect on relations between Iran and the European Union.
This would be another disaster with incalculable consequences.
Â Â  Madam President, first we should congratulate the Commissioner and ECHO for the aid provided.
Criticisms of EU aid are frequently unfair, and all the reports from Iran suggest that the EUR 2.3 million deployed by the European Union within 72 hours using the primary emergency decision were both well received and well targeted.
Despite the gravity of the losses, a thousand lives were saved by more than a thousand international search and rescue teams, and this Parliament should join with the head of the UN team in Bam who has described it as the best disaster response he has seen in 20 years.
When we talk about south-south assistance we should at the same time congratulate the Iranian Red Crescent for mobilising more than 8Â 000 relief workers, and, despite what Robert Kilroy-Silk may say in the UK, Arab countries, who have offered 400 million for the reconstruction of Bam.
It is not surprising that a humanitarian disaster at Christmas time provoked such a huge public response amongst the peoples of Europe, but it is right in this debate that we draw attention to the neglected emergencies which have not commanded the same media or public attention â in Angola, for example, where the UN appeal has raised only half of the 300 million sought, or Mozambique, where the figure is 12% of just 1.6 million needed, or Zambia, where only 10% of the required amount has been raised.
Commissioner, at the very least we need your assurance today that no money to benefit Iran is diverted from these countries, where human lives are just as much at risk.
Finally, it is right to include in our resolution a message to the Iranians that our international solidarity must be matched by their commitment to international human rights and standards of democracy.
The procedure agreed by the Iranian Guardian Council for the screening of election candidates does not meet those standards.
Of course, we in Europe do not seek to attach conditions to our help, but we do join with the many Iranians whose lives have been saved in wanting and expecting free and fair elections for their country.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by saying to Mr Howitt that I can guarantee that we are not diverting money from Angola, Zambia and the other places mentioned to Iran.
For ECHO, in administrative terms, this is not a dramatic or difficult situation to respond to.
I have taken note of the political remarks made during the various speeches.
Politically, I agree that there are other disasters.
I am also encouraged by what has been said in a number of the contributions here.
On balance, the attempt to step up dialogue makes a lot of sense.
It is very important that we continue to keep humanitarian assistance separate from politics.
We will be discussing with the Iranian authorities how to secure access for all aid workers, issue visa waivers to the various NGOs working there both now and in the next few months, and ensure normal access for the benefit of victims and others in the country.
Those are some of the points we will be raising as part of the process of delivering humanitarian assistance.
Political dialogue with Iran â the other part of this afternoon's debate â will be pursued and taken up in the various relevant frameworks.
I would stress my remark about keeping the issues separate, in order to be consistent, because from time to time we are faced with even more difficult situations where it is even more important to keep to the humanitarian mandate.
I welcome the remarks made in the course of the debate.
Finally, as Mr Howitt correctly pointed out, this is one case which illustrates the ability we now have â given the changes made in recent years to the way in which the Commission handles administration â to respond very quickly.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I have received six motions for resolution to wind up this debate.(1)
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A5-0412/2003) by MrÂ Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the tuna fleet and industry: situation and future prospects in the EU and worldwide (2003/2017(INI)).
Before I give you the floor, MrÂ Varela, I have to tell you that, in accordance with the agenda drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, at 5Â p.m. precisely we are going to interrupt the debate to give the floor to the representative of the Commission to make an announcement on services in the internal market.
As the timing of this agenda is precise and this announcement has to be made at 5Â p.m. on the dot, we will interrupt the debate on MrÂ Varelaâs report, which will be resumed after the Commissionâs announcement.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would ask you not to count what I am going to say first as speaking time because I would like, on behalf of all my colleagues, to make a slight protest at this situation.
I know that it is not your fault, Madam President, but this is an irritating situation because the debate was initially scheduled for the morning, then it was changed to the early afternoon and now it has been left for the night, and this often happens to us with fisheries.
I would ask that this never happen again because clearly it entirely breaks up the debate.
I am going to speak until 5 p.m., and I hope that you will at least allow the rapporteur time to speak properly, because I do not believe the Commissioner will have time to answer me.
He will have to do so at 9 p.m.
In any event, the members of the Committee on Fisheries believe that this is not good and we hope that it will not happen to us again in the future.
Thank you very much.
My political group asked for this report because it believes that the Committee on Fisheries should focus all its attention on the study and analysis of certain fisheries, analysing their situation, their functions, their problems and their future.
This could be done with various fisheries, but we have decided to begin with tuna fisheries for the simple reason that it is the most globalised species on the planet, both in its extraction and in its processing and marketing.
This means that it involves great interests and complex problems at international level.
In the case of tuna there is a very clear inter-relationship between fleet and industry, and the role of the European Union is essential since our market is the world's top market for this species, and our fleet is also the biggest in the world, and tuna represents 60% of total production of canned fish, the European Union currently being â with a production of some 400Â 000 tonnes of canned tuna â the worldâs top producer.
This generates a very significant number of jobs â which furthermore is highly localised â in peripheral maritime regions highly dependent on fisheries.
For specific data I would refer you to my report.
Our intention is to provide a technical and political consideration of the whole of the sector, both extractive and processing, to analyse its position within the European Union and the world in order to draw conclusions which we can deliver to the Commission and the Council in order to increase awareness and sensitivity towards this important industry and finally to propose a series of specific measures to improve its defence.
We have begun by defining the species the report is directed at, focusing essentially on tropical tuna, which constitute 90% of what is processed by the canning industry.
We call for the defence of sustainable and responsible fishing, as the very basis for its future.
We defend fishing which is respectful of other species, such as dolphins.
We therefore support the labelling of the AIDCP, the intergovernmental body which includes the European Union amongst its members; we call for transparency and clarity for consumers; we condemn illegal fishing â IUU â the flags of convenience which shelter it and we support the regional fisheries organisations and the Commission's role in them, we propose the creation of other new ones and we also request the maintenance and extension of the network of international tuna fishing agreements, given the highly migratory nature of these species and the guarantee that these international fisheries agreements represent for responsible fishing in the face of private agreements.
I believe that the consensus reached in the Committee on Fisheries, in which the rapporteur accepted amendments from all political groups and proposed specific compromises, which have been incorporated, as in the case of the support for the amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, demonstrate our genuine interest in supporting fisheries which must be sustainable both ecologically and economically and socially.
I thank all the Members for their cooperation.
To greatly summarise the contents of the report, we are calling for assistance for the Community fleet to prevent it from losing competitiveness in the globalised tuna world and we advocate a specific register for this fleet which will not receive aid from a structural point of view following the reform of the fisheries policy.
It should be given incentives to retain the Community flags in the face of the temptation to take flags of convenience; that a census be created, authorised by the respective RFOs, and that illegal fishing and landings by these fleets be effectively controlled in order to put an end to unfair competition.
To this end, we are calling for a specific unit within the Fisheries DG on highly migratory species with adequate resources and personnel to defend European interests in these fora at all times.
We also call on the Commission to create a specific Advisory Committee on tropical tuna.
With regard to our important canning industry, we are calling for a stable legal framework which allows it to better plan its activity and safeguard its investments.
And we call for the same requirements for the Community industry as for the industries which export its product to our markets in order that we may compete under equal conditions within a very liberalised Community market which is continuing to open up with concessions to third countries, in particular in South East Asia.
To this end we also call for the creation of a network of European reference laboratories in order to control the quality of products and technical and sanitary conditions, to which the European Unionâs strict rules on the origin of goods must be applied.
In view of the globalisation of the tuna market, we are facing very complex issues which require constant and priority attention, as happens in relation to the supply of raw material to the Community industry, and we therefore call for a new study of the real supply needs which allow the Community administration to take the appropriate decisions at all times.
Our report, Commissioner, attempts to help the Commission to act correctly.
We are therefore asking for specific things, such as: a specific action plan, a global framework for structural support, a defence plan to deal with third States and, to this end, the creation of units and advisory committees as I just said in my speech.
This is therefore our opinion, it is the European Parliament's opinion, and we hope that the European Commission is now sensitive to it and will act accordingly.
We in the European Parliament have begun our work and from now on we are going to demand compliance with our requests.
Â Â  â Thank you, MrÂ Varela.
I have obviously taken careful note of your protests in response to the announcement that this debate will be interrupted.
I must also reassure you: the time that you took to express your legitimate protests was not included in your speaking time, so no problem there.
Moreover, since Commissioner Bolkestein has not yet arrived, I have the pleasure of giving the floor to Commissioner Fischler so that he can respond to your comments straight away.
Â Â  . Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Varela, very warmly for producing this excellent own-initiative report.
I generally endorse your analysis of the situation in the tuna industry.
I take the view that all actors in the tuna industry â from the fishermen to the processing industry â are a chain, and a chain, as we know, is only as strong as its weakest link.
From the Commissionâs perspective, three issues are especially important in supporting the interests of the tuna industry.
Firstly, we will continue to need access to tuna stocks in third countriesâ waters in future.
Secondly, we must defend the interests of the tuna industry through our mandate in the regional fisheries organisations, and thirdly, we want to utilise our market policies in order to create a safety net for stakeholders.
On access to tuna stocks in third countriesâ waters, our fishing industry can only benefit from the new form of partnership agreements, which this House also supports.
In your resolution, you call for a study on the state of tuna resources.
The Commission is at present producing a kind of framework agreement for the assessment of the tuna fish chapters of the various fisheries agreements, and I will gladly take up your proposal within this context.
On the regional fisheries organisations, I can confirm that I am determined to defend the Communityâs interests in sustainable fishing within the regional fisheries organisations.
We are pursuing several priorities in this context, which also match the priorities set by this Parliament.
Firstly, we want to clamp down on illegal fishing, because it is nothing but unfair competition and the destructive exploitation of fish stocks.
Our Community action plan for the eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing was supported both by this Parliament and the Council.
This is a political priority for the Commission and we have already launched appropriate initiatives in various fisheries organisations.
Secondly, we must adapt the fleet capacity to match the fishing that is available.
The Community cannot accept an aggressive expansion of third countriesâ fleets at a time when its own fleet is undergoing cuts.
Thirdly, we need a mid- to long-term strategy for sustainable resource management.
At our instigation, multiannual framework programmes have been adopted in various regional fisheries organisations.
Examples are the management plans for Northern bluefin tuna and swordfish in the Atlantic, and the capacity restrictions on the tuna fishing fleet in the Indian Ocean.
This brings me to market issues.
First of all, I would like to make it clear that the compensation payments within the framework of the common market organisation must remain a regulatory instrument for crisis situations; they cannot become a kind of long-term intervention mechanism.
I would also remind you that a separate tariff exemption applies to tuna imports that are processed by Community industry.
By contrast, imports of canned tuna and semi-processed products, such as tuna fillets, are subject to a tariff rate of 24%.
This is the highest tariff in the fisheries sector and has been bound and applied for more than thirty years.
Furthermore, canned tuna and fillets are classified as a sensitive product in international negotiations, which is why very few commercial licences have been granted for them.
The combination of Community tariffs and trade preferences has clearly enhanced the competitiveness of the tuna industry.
As you are aware, the Community has already introduced a ban on the import of products derived from illegal fishing.
The Commission attaches great importance to a multilateral approach here.
That is why we are also complying with the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations.
Secondly, it is also important that we apply the rules of origin and the health rules to imports without discrimination.
The Commission is keen to continue working with the sector in identifying gaps in the veterinary control system.
However, the responsibility for control primarily lies with the Member States.
My final point is this: product labelling is intended to guarantee fair commercial practices.
In this context, we must distinguish between the responsibilities of the market participants and the competence of regulatory authorities.
The Commission intends to take up this issue again soon. We will of course consult Parliament and the tuna industry as part of this process.
I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Commission is keen to engage in dialogue with all the interest groups.
To this end, we are holding preparatory meetings on the negotiations on fisheries agreements or when determining our positions prior to the meetings of the regional fisheries organisations, which also involve the industry itself.
This approach has proved extremely successful.
Â Â  Madam President, I hope you will not penalise my speaking time if I add my protest to that of Mr Varela.
As Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I am fed up with the Committee's items being kicked around on the agenda from one day to the next.
It was on the agenda for this morning's debate and here we are now, with half the members of the Committee who have asked to speak in the debate having to come back this evening.
What way is this to organise diaries?
Firstly, I congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent own-initiative report.
It was Mr Varela's idea that the Fisheries Committee should conduct in-depth investigations into some of the major species of fish, and what could be more appropriate than starting with tuna, a species of global importance now worth in excess of USDÂ 2Â billion per year.
World production of canned tuna is over twoÂ million tonnes a year, while the trade in fresh tuna is also burgeoning.
We held a special hearing in our Committee on this issue, with many industry experts giving evidence.
In addition, the Sustainable Development Intergroup organised a seminar in Brussels last November entitled 'Tuna Fleet and Industry: Prospects for the Future', at which we had a wide range of international speakers.
I wish to concentrate on one important aspect of the report, namely the AIDCP â or Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program â to which the EU is a signatory, as is the United States and most of the tuna-producing nations of Central and South America.
It is the most reliable method for ensuring that tuna is dolphin safe.
I am grateful to Mr Varela for highlighting this in his report in a very positive way. He said in his report, 'the system for protecting dolphins in purse-seine fisheries established by the AIDCP, ... is far removed from other private certification schemes which have hitherto been introduced.'
I thoroughly endorse that analysis.
One of these private certification schemes, promoted by the Californian NGO Earth Island, has dominated the canned tuna market for some years.
It is estimated that over 97% of all canned tuna in Europe carries their 'dolphin safe' label.
However, their 'dolphin safe' label is not turtle safe or shark safe.
The method of fishing supported by Earth Island, in its current form, causes the death of countless turtles, sharks and other species and also kills thousands of young yellowfin tuna, discarded dead into the sea because they are below marketable weight.
I very much endorse the support that Mr Varela's report has given to the AIDCP label and hope the Commission will push for this label to be used exclusively on canned tuna in the EU.
Â Â  Madam President, I regret that the report we are discussing this afternoon, being an own-initiative report, is not subject to the corresponding legislative procedure in the Commission and that the Council of Ministers is not going to give its opinion on it.
I believe it is an excellent description of the problems worrying the Community tuna fleet, as well as its processing industry.
It is true, as we have acknowledged many times in the Committee on Fisheries, that tuna is the most globalised segment of the fisheries sector, and that the Community market demands more product â both fresh tuna and processed tuna â than its fleet and its canning sector can provide.
We therefore believe that Mr Fischlerâs commitment to unreservedly defend our tuna sector, our fleet and our canning and processing sector is important, just as the governments of third countries promote actions in favour of their own fisheries sectors.
By acting in this way, the Commission will defend the European social model and the economic and social cohesion of regions such as mine which largely depend on this industry.
We join with the rapporteur, Mr Varela, in calling on the Commission to draw up a strategy in relation to tuna, the preservation of the most threatened species, such as bluefin tuna, and of the most vulnerable fishing grounds.
We want fishing and marketing to respond to sustainable and environmental criteria, as well as food safety principles and that, therefore, control mechanisms be established at borders so that imported products have the same phytosanitary guarantees as those originating from our own fleet and industry.
This Community strategy we are asking the Commission for is all the more urgent if we consider the vulnerability of our sector to possible unfair competition and the precariousness of many thousands of jobs in our industry, the majority of them carried out by women.
We therefore urge the Commission to continue exerting pressure at international level in order to ensure that the principles of this responsible fishing are respected, and that it continue to promote controls and inspection, but we hope that in relation to tuna what we have seen on other occasions does not happen: that what weaves by night is unravelled by by day.
We therefore hope that the criteria which Commissioner Fischler has expressed today turn out to be those which win out.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr Varela's report is on a very important and interesting subject â that of the tuna industry.
I would also like to thank him for taking on board many of the Verts/ALE Group's suggestions.
Many lessons can be learned from the way in which tuna fishing is managed.
For instance, regional tuna management bodies such as ICAT have made great progress in combating fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience.
Another example comes from the Pacific Ocean, where the regional body, the IATTC, has succeeded in dramatically reducing certain types of by-catch, namely dolphins.
Finally, several tuna bodies are in the throes of establishing limits on the capacity of the fishing fleets that are allowed to be involved in the fishery.
The initiatives mentioned in Mr Varela's report are very good ones, but the report does not get rid of the remaining problems, especially the overfishing of several species such as bigeye and bluefin tuna, as well as the unacceptable amount of by-catch involving a wide number of species taken via so-called FAD fishing â the favoured method used by EU vessels.
I believe it is essential that the EU clean up these aspects of its fisheries if it is to be committed to a sustainable fisheries policy.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would first like to congratulate MrÂ Varela on his excellent work.
My group does, of course, fully support his report.
I would like to highlight two points that we consider to be particularly sensitive: consumer health and employment in the fisheries sector and in the tuna processing sector.
After years of tests, scientific analyses and expert opinions, we all know that fish consumption is on the increase: fish is healthy, the consumption of fish productsÂ âÂ either fresh, smoked, frozen or canned fishÂ âÂ by European citizens increases year after year, and is also due to several effective advertising and information campaigns.
We also know only too well that in the Member States various requirements, especially those relating to health and hygiene, must, rightly, be met in order to market canned fish products produced in Europe.
In order to adequately protect consumer health, the same requisites should also be extended to products from third countries where, unfortunately, health regulations in this area are often too lenient or even, in some cases, completely lacking.
We therefore support and strongly insist on the requests made in points 8 and 10 of the motion for a resolution, which point out, respectively, the need to intensify inspections on third-country productsÂ âÂ which are, moreover, already provided for by Directive 91/493/EECÂ âÂ and the need to create Community laboratories to uphold quality, food safety and consumer safety against what is known as food piracy.
TheÂ âÂ equally importantÂ âÂ issue of competitiveness and, therefore of employment, in the tuna fishing sector and the canned tuna industry, is linked to the sensitive issue of protecting consumer health.If, in order to adequately protect the consumer, certain requirements are imposed, including those that I just mentioned relating to health, which involves a considerable amount of money being invested, and if the same requirements are not applied to products from third countries then, with the inevitable entry into the Community market of products at very low prices compared to European products, then competitiveness in the fishing industry and the European canned tuna industry will be unfairly harmed.
There is a grave risk of job losses in a sector that has already been hit hard in recent years by a worrying socio-economic crisis.
As a result, we would point out the need to support, with every possible regulatory and economic means, the sector in question, which is an important source of employment also in other Mediterranean regions, including Sicily, where fishing and bluefin tuna processing has for centuries provided economic support to a considerable percentage of the active population.
With this message of hope we also want to see an assurance of something tangible.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, the excellent own-initiative report by MrÂ Varela means that we now have a reference document on an activity whose importance tends to be underestimated by Europeans, despite the fact that we have the largest fishing sector in the world.
This activity generates a huge number of jobs, directly and indirectly, both in Europe and in the developing countries with which we are linked through international agreements and where European industry has made significant investments.
In fact, what emerges from the very comprehensive analysis carried out by our rapporteur of the various different Community policies that impact on the sector is that we are very far from having an overall and coherent Community strategy of encouraging the development of this activity. On the contrary, it is as if the Community were doing its best to penalise its own tuna fleet and its own processing industry and to favour the fleet and industry in third countries.
As an example, at a time when we are seeing considerable growth throughout the world in unregulated fishing capacity flying flags that show little respect for international maritime law, the Commission has proposed banning all public aid for new constructions in Europe and making the construction of new vessels dependent on old ones being destroyed without any compensation of any kind.
It seems to want to encourage Community shipowners to fly third-country flags that they would not otherwise choose.
In addition, we are lowering customs tariffs considerably on canned tuna from third countries and at the same time subjecting our own processors to ever more requirements, without taking into account the impact of these constraints on the competitiveness of our industry.
It is therefore time to review these Community policies, which threaten to compromise the future of a sector that has nevertheless enjoyed exemplary success.
We must not allow this to be threatened by these inconsistent policies and by the lack of an overall vision and definite strategy.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Fischler, we must indeed compliment MrÂ Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, who carried out this excellent work which, at least according to the Commissioner, will also meet with approval in the Commission regarding the aims and objectives that we have set.
This is certainly something that consoles and encourages us.
The issue of fishing gear and environmental sustainability in this extremely important fisheries sector were well dealt with, and there are two further issues whereÂ âÂ and here I would like to appeal to my fellow MembersÂ âÂ we must try to maintain a balance.
Within the fisheries sector, tuna fishing is extremely important for the European Union in the two areas that it includes: on the one hand, extractive fishingÂ âÂ fleets that fish tuna in our waters and those outside the European UnionÂ âÂ and, on the other hand, the important pillar represented by the processing sector, which processes tuna of European origin but also, as has been mentioned, tuna originating, in particular, in the seas of Asia and other seas.
We must, of course, focus on safety, in particular as regards these productions, butÂ âÂ and on this matter I am glad that the rapporteur agreed with me that we must not proceed rashlyÂ âÂ we must also be very careful as regards customs regimes.
With this report we are calling for a study and for the Commission to carry out an assessment.
I agree with the Commissioner that one of the preferences is a regime which has to date given results whilst, compared with other countries, we have one of the highest customs duties.
So, balancing the two pillars of the European fisheries industryÂ âÂ processing and fleets that fish tunaÂ âÂ is an objective that we cannot abandon and which we must focus on.
I believe that, with the wisdom that distinguishes this HouseÂ âÂ and the report currently before us is proof of thisÂ âÂ we will succeed in guaranteeing both aspects and, thus, a more prosperous and more sustainable tuna fishing industry in the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, tuna is one of the most popular fish in the EU and also one of the most commercially valuable.
Most people's experience of eating tuna is through access to the canned product.
However, fresh tuna has become more popular and is readily available to consumers in my country, Scotland.
That is why paragraph 11 in the resolution, stating that the product's origin should be identified and that there should be full and accurate information for consumers on the type of tuna packed and on the ingredients, is so important.
As many of my colleagues have said, the accurate labelling of dolphin-friendly tuna is important in order to reassure consumers that what they are eating does not damage vulnerable species.
This directly links in to the recent proposal by the Commission on cetacean by-catches and the resulting protection of these at-risk species.
The protection of dolphins and other cetaceans is of concern to many of my constituents, especially many schoolchildren whom I meet.
That is why inspection of third-country products is important not just in terms of health, but also in terms of consumer information.
This report highlights conservation-friendly approaches and I welcome it as a basis for sustainable fishing.
Â Â  Madam President, may I firstly say that I do not blame you personally, but many colleagues have not been able to speak in the debate because they have left the Chamber while we wait for another Commissioner.
Commissioner Fischler is sitting patiently, listening to our debate, and half our colleagues have been unable to contribute to it.
This is no way to organise business.
This debate should now be finished and persons on the list should be recalled to speak.
Before I make my points to the rapporteur, I would ask you to deduct the 38 seconds I have just spoken for.
I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his comprehensive report.
Many of the points he raises are certainly to be welcomed.
I was particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on the need to prevent incidental mortality among dolphins and other species associated with tuna fisheries.
Aside from tuna fishing, many dolphins are being washed up dead in my own area of the South-West because of pair trawling.
This is therefore an important issue.
I was also happy to hear the rapporteur insisting that products from third countries should meet the same food safety and quality standards as our own.
This is something for which we on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have campaigned hard with regard to farm products.
The same should naturally apply to fisheries products.
Our consumers have a right to safe food, and third-country imports must be of the same high standard.
Commissioner Fischler spoke about third-country agreements.
I am always worried about these agreements because, although many new agreements include conservation measures, there is little conservation to be seen in reality.
What is happening off the coast of Africa is much more than exploitation of waters.
I believe we are threatening the indigenous fisherman.
If there are going to be third-country agreements, they will have to be much better monitored and we must be sure that fish are being caught safely and that our money is being spent wisely.
My final point is that, with regard to labelling catches as tuna-friendly and purchasing dolphin-friendly tuna, we must be sure that practices are genuinely tuna- and dolphin-friendly, that there is no huge by-catch with caught tuna and that people do not purchase such products because they think they are both conservation-friendly and by-catch-friendly, when, in fact, a large number of turtles, sharks and dolphins are evidently being caught.
This is misleading, and we have to be very careful when using the 'friendly' label.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the critical situation facing the tuna fishing industry, the European Parliament has decided to proceed with an own-initiative report in order to protect both the EU fleet and the tuna processing industry.
With its abundance of species, tuna has become a commercially and socio-economically significant fishery resource, to the extent that it has recently shown strong growth rates.
To put this into figures, tuna accounts for more than 60% of canned fish production in the EU, with more than 40Â 000 people directly employed in the industry.
With Spain, Italy, France and Portugal leading the way, the European tuna fleet is the most productive in the world, as it accounts for more than 20% of the total catch.
This is an industrial activity with strong historical traditions.
Parliamentâs sole aim in producing this report is to call for a detailed and through-going study of the current situation and to set out the future prospects for this sector of fishing.
The report thus begins by focussing on two fundamental problems facing the tuna fishing sector: the loss of competitiveness of the fleet and of the industry in the EU faced with imports from third countries and the sustainable conservation and management of resources.
It should be recognised that these characteristics are not confined to tuna; they are widespread and apply to almost all types of fishing.
To ensure that the EU shows unequivocal support for the industry, this report calls for a specific action plan and a structural support framework for the tuna sector.
With this instrument, the EU must demand that products from third countries meet the same health standards for quality and for food safety as products from the Community.
Similarly, the European Union once again calls for more frequent product inspections in order to ensure that rules on conservation are adhered to in full.
As regards the conservation and management of fisheries resources, tuna is a migratory species that is particularly vulnerable to illegal fishing in international waters.
Consequently, the EU must prevent the transfer of EU-owned vessels to countries flying flags of convenience.
The capacities of the fishing fleet must also adapt more effectively to the resources available.
Finally, in conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, which will certainly make a positive contribution towards setting out future prospects in this sector.
Â Â  Madam President, I suppose that those of us who have remained can be thankful to Commissioner Bolkestein for being late.
At least that has allowed us not to have to come back after 9 p.m.
I am sure Commissioner Fischler is also pleased about that.
However, this sort of thing should not happen in this House and we should organise our debates more efficiently.
I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur on producing it.
As others have said, tuna is as important to the southern regions of Europe as cod and hake is to the northern ones, and those of us from the northern region can therefore understand the concerns.
A very significant percentage of the catch goes to the processing industry, meaning that there are very many dependent jobs both at sea and on shore.
Up to 60% of the fish caught are canned, as Mrs Stihler has said, and much of that is eaten by us in the northern hemisphere.
I, like many people, am very fond of it.
However, there are major issues at stake here and they are of concern to me.
We can only support sustainable and responsible fishing. I agree with Mr Parish and others who expressed concerns about dolphins.
That is something of concern to many people in my constituency.
Ultimately, however, our fleets must remain competitive in the long term.
We must have quality control and the size of fish caught must be closely monitored.
The Commissioner mentioned three important points, one of which is access to third countries.
If we are going to have access to third countries â which is probably needed â it must be closely monitored and there must be tighter controls.
Above all we must rule out illegal fishing and protect those species under threat.
We need a mechanism for both long- and short-term strategies for the industry, but these must take into account the requirements of the industry and be sensitive to the issue of biomass and tuna stocks.
We must work for a more sustainable industry in the future.
Â Â  â Commissioner Fischler, I do not believe that you wish to respond.
The debate is therefore closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I should like to remind Members who would have liked to speak this afternoon but who are absent on account of the slight confusion in proceedings that they may submit their speech in writing.
Those Members that are present may wish to inform their absent colleagues of this possibility.
As Commissioner Bolkestein is still not with us, the Commission communication on services in the internal market cannot be made now.
Given that this is the case, we are going to have to amend the agenda.
I therefore propose that the Commission communication on services in the internal market be postponed to 9Â p.m. this evening.
To amend the agenda adopted by the Conference of Presidents, I am bound, pursuant to RuleÂ 111(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to submit this proposal to the House for approval.
We have finally done as you desired, MrÂ Varela, and I am glad: your report has been examined in full.
Â Â  . â It is a fact that tuna is the canning industryâs most important product, not only in this Community, but also worldwide.
A number of countries belonging to this Community have a traditionally strong position in the tuna sector and are vulnerable to changes in the market.
It is clear, not only from the Committee on Fisheriesâ hearing, but also from what my colleague Mr Varela has said, that the time has come to act.
Third countries, particularly those in Asia, have recently sought to secure for themselves a major chunk of the tuna market, which is a lucrative one.
I see one explanation for the success of our non-European competitors as being the fact that they have an advantage in terms of costs over the owners of ships belonging to the Community fleet.
European shipowners have to comply with Community regulations on hygiene, supervision of fishing activity, production conditions, protection of the environment, and social security for their workers.
Important and right though that is, it costs money.
In order to prevent shipowners from abandoning the Community flag for the sake of competitive advantage, I call for defensive action.
Firstly, there is a need for coordination of the Community policy measures that affect the tuna fleet and the canning industry; secondly, additional fisheries agreements are needed; thirdly, if third countries want to sell their products on the EU market, compliance with health and hygiene regulations must be an absolute requirement; and, fourthly, duties on canned tuna must be maintained until such time as import and trade restrictions are lifted.
What this boils down to is that the EUâs strategy must be a coordinated one and conceived at international level.
Â Â  he next item is Question Time (B5-0002/2004).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, in a Europe in which there is an acute demographic problem and the number of elderly people is increasing constantly, it is clear that new problems of policies relating to the elderly will arise.
I would remind you that the European Commission has already taken account of the age factor in the directive which was tabled and accepted by the Council in 2000 on dealing with all forms of discrimination in the workplace on the basis of age.
Similarly, I would remind you that, in Article 25 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights, there is a clear reference which recognises the right of the elderly to a dignified life and their right to participate in economic and political life.
When we come to the more specific matter of violence against the elderly, something which is now a fact of life in several European countries and has to do to a great extent with the change in the family model and with the population of elderly people, which is constantly increasing, I would say that it is very difficult for us to find a legal basis on which to proceed with legislation.
I should like to remind you that, during the course of discussions in the Constitutional Convention, a huge effort was made to integrate a legal basis into the new Treaty which would give the European Union the possibility to legislate on questions of violence overall, be it against women, children or the elderly.
In the end no agreement was reached and there is at present no reference even in the Convention proposal for a legal basis for violence.
So as far as the legal question is concerned, this comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States.
As far as policies and programmes are concerned, the Commission has the Daphne programme, with a more global approach to questions of violence, and we have a number of important initiatives in the Member States which relate to violence against the elderly.
The Commission's intention is to fund the Daphne programme as much as it can.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply.
You are right, of course: it is indeed the Member States that are primarily responsible here.
As a member of the board of the European Senior Citizens Union (ESCU), I have focussed very intensively on these issues recently, and it has emerged â for our organisation now has members in twenty European states â that there is a growing debate in all the European countries about the situation in homes for the elderly.
Our question is this: would it not be possible to produce some kind of recommendation on how contracts should be concluded with these homes?
We are aware of homes where residents are very often treated with very little respect, are even confined to cots against their will, are prevented from going out, are served their evening meal so early that they very soon feel hungry again but have no chance of getting anything to eat after 8 or 9 p.m., and where if they soil themselves with or without an incontinence pad, they are often left to lie in their own filth for hours at a time, or are treated in an unfriendly manner by staff, are abused verbally and even subjected to violence.
I believe that guidelines for contracts for homes are essential.
Â Â  You know that this is Question Time.
It is not a time for statements or debates, but we have listened carefully to Mrs Flemming.
I do not know whether the Commissioner wishes to respond in any way.
Â Â  . As I said, the Commission does not have the facility to make this sort of intervention.
It is not justified by any legal basis.
I think, however, that it is important that, in future, Article 25 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, especially the reference to a dignified life for the elderly, will also constitute a basis for the associations of the elderly to which Mrs Flemming referred, so that they can take recourse to the courts and so that the European Union and, of course, the national authorities, have the facility to intervene in certain cases.
Â Â  I welcome Mrs Flemming's question and would also suggest to the Commissioner that there is a way through.
There is a sphere of competence within the European Union and it is that of health promotion and illness prevention, which includes the illnesses and suffering that can be caused by elder abuse.
I suggest we take a look at this.
When I was responsible for this policy area in my home country, we did a lot of research, and a lot of research was done in the USA and other countries, to see how elder abuse could be prevented.
Very often elder abuse is committed by evil people who are perpetrating crimes, but very often too it is committed by people within families, carers and professional helpers who reach the end of their tether because they do not feel supported.
People who would never have believed themselves capable of elder abuse suddenly find that the explosion has taken place, and that they have struck out and hurt someone they love.
I suggest therefore that we look to pool the experience we have in the different Member States in order to establish good practices in this field within the sphere of competence to which I have referred.
Â Â  . I feel that we can definitely identify areas of cooperation in healthcare policy.
I would like to inform you that we have already started implementing the method of open coordination in the care of elderly people.
This is a very good opportunity.
Member States are already working together in this area.
Although such measures do not take the form of recommendations, they reflect our final goal.
I have tried to respond to the specific issue of violence.
That is rather a different matter. It could come under problems in the field of healthcare, but it is a problem not merely confined to healthcare.
Â Â  . It is true that unsolicited commercial e-mail, or 'spam', has reached worrying proportions: over 50% of e-mail traffic, according to many experts, is now 'spam'.
The Commission also agrees that 'spam' undermines not only privacy and consumer protection, but also productivity at work and overall productivity growth.
Consumer confidence in e-mail is falling, according to some studies.
It is, however, a prerequisite for the successful development of e-commerce and the information society in general.
The Commission is reacting on several fronts.
Firstly, the European Union has acted on the legislative front by adopting, in 2002, the directive on privacy and electronic communications â as Mr Paasilinna will know because he made a considerable contribution to the discussion.
Infringement proceedings were launched in November 2003 against a number of Member States that had failed to take the necessary transposition measures.
Secondly, the Commission knows that legislation is only part of the answer.
The Commission has discussed with interested parties a series of actions for Member States, industry and consumers to take.
