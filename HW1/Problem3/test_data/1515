In fact, quite the opposite is the case.
It reflects the fact that the new Member States are catching up with the developed economies of the old Union.
Thirdly, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the definition of stability applied by the Commission and the European Central Bank in convergence reports is different to the definition of price stability used by the European Central Bank in the field of monetary policy.
Meanwhile, the Treaty text only contains one definition of price stability and we cannot have two different interpretations of this term.
The inflation criteria currently means that some of the new Member States may not be able to join the eurozone for many years.
This permanently divides the Member States into two categories, namely the eurozone countries and those which remain outside the eurozone.
This situation threatens the cohesion of the Union and is at odds with the spirit of the Treaty.
The convergence criteria were drawn up 16 years ago, in entirely different circumstances.
They should be adapted to the current situation.
I appeal for an in-depth debate on this subject.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Langen, the rapporteur, for the excellent work he has achieved despite the short length of time available.
In fact, on 16 May 2007 the Commission adopted its convergence report on the criteria for Malta and Cyprus to join the single currency and on 25 May the European Parliament was invited to express its view on the proposal for a Council decision on the adoption by Cyprus and Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008.
Because of the short time available Parliament was not able to make a thorough assessment of the situation of these countries and the reports put forward by the Commission.
I would nonetheless express a favourable opinion on the adoption by Cyprus and Malta of the single currency, since the convergence criteria have been met.
In fact, with regard to Malta, in the last 12 months the inflation rate has been 2.2%, which is less than the reference value of 3%.
The excessive deficit has been corrected through a sustained reduction in the budget deficit under the threshold of 3% of GDP and the debt rate is falling, coming close to the reference value of 60% of GDP.
Until March 2007 Malta's average long-term interest rate was at 4.3%, which is below the reference value of 6.4%.
The Maltese economy is highly integrated into the European Union and the balance of payments deficit fell to 6.3% in 2006, partly thanks to direct foreign investments.
With regard to Cyprus, in the last 12 months the inflation rate has been 2%, which is lower than the reference value of 3%.
For 2007 the forecasts made by the Commission in spring this year are for an unchanged deficit of 1.4% of GDP.
Since its entry into ERM II, the European exchange rate mechanism, the Cypriot pound has been exchanged in a stable manner at a satisfactory exchange rate.
In the last 12 months the average long-term interest rate has been 4.2%, which is below the reference value of 6.4%.
The Cypriot economy is highly integrated into the European Union's economy.
The Commission considers that economic integration has been achieved, despite the increase in the balance of payments deficit.
In order to avoid problems arising again in the future on procedural timetables, it is necessary to improve the method for consulting the European Parliament, by setting up interinstitutional cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
This will make it possible to have the time necessary to make a proper assessment of the proposals by the Commission and the European Central Bank.
On this point, I believe that the exchange of views with Commissioner Almunia and the reply by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, to the letter sent to him by Mr PÃ¶ttering, President of Parliament, were fairly positive.
The Commission ought to notify Parliament very early of all requests for convergence reports submitted by the Member States and should decide together with Parliament and the Council on the timetable for the procedure.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, by taking the floor in the debate on expanding the eurozone to include Cyprus and Malta, I would like to draw your attention to the following issues.
First of all, the Commission is once again reminding us of the need for the new Member States to meet all the Maastricht criteria before joining the eurozone.
At the same time, it is turning a blind eye to the fact that, when the euro was introduced, many of the old Member States did not meet these criteria.
Secondly, despite the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission has remained lenient towards the biggest Member States in terms of their adherence to the Maastricht criteria.
In the past, the Commission has tolerated, and appears to still tolerate, significant budget deficits and a level of public debt in particular, which often exceeds 60% of GDP.
Statistics confirm this.
In 2006, public debt in the countries of the old European Union was as high as 63.3% of GDP and, in as many as half of the eurozone countries this debt exceeded 60% of GDP.
Thirdly, the Commission's attitude towards countries wishing to join the eurozone varies greatly.
Very recently, Lithuania's application to join the zone was rejected, in spite of the fact that it had met the Maastricht criteria, and its inflation rate barely exceeded 0.1% of the reference value.
Therefore, the Commission's quick approval of Cyprus and Malta's membership of the eurozone might seem surprising in view of the fact that both countries' public debt clearly exceeds 60% of GDP.
In 2006, Cyprus' public debt amounted to as much as 65.3% and Malta's debt stood at 66.5% of GDP.
Moreover, both countries are finding it difficult to provide Eurostat with statistics pertaining to their financial situation.
In spite of the doubts I have just expressed, I would still like to congratulate both Cyprus and Malta on joining the eurozone.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both Malta and the Greek part of Cyprus meet the Maastricht criteria.
It is therefore logical to enlarge the euro zone to include both countries.
If it were up to me and my group, more Member States of the European Union would be welcome to join the euro zone, provided that they met the criteria.
That can only be good for the European Union.
This event is, however, tinged with sadness and I should like to explain why: unfortunately, in Cyprus an opportunity has been missed to involve both parts of Cyprus in the euro zone and to blaze the trail for a reunification of the island of Cyprus on the basis of a bicommunal and bizonal solution.
That is very regrettable, because as a result the wall in Cyprus will be reinforced rather than weakened.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic experts seem to agree that the euro zone is enjoying a general economic upturn.
They are even talking about a sustained rise in employment.
It is my belief, however, that all too often it is only a rise in part-time employment - or the new forms of work, as they are euphemistically known - that has been recorded, which can hardly compensate for the full-time jobs that have been lost.
Under these conditions the dwindling birth rate should come as no surprise.
You cannot feed a family on a McJob!
Enthusing about an upturn is a slap in the face for every single one of the millions-strong army of jobless in the EU.
It mocks all of those millions of people who are labelled as the working poor.
We are facing a problem that should not be underestimated: the fact that existing differences within the euro zone are widening, for example the southern European countries are seeing a continual worsening of their competitive position.
The fact that the euro is not a universal remedy is proved by the example of the United Kingdom alone.
As we know, the British economy is in good shape, even without the euro.
The United Kingdom has the sixth largest manufacturing sector in the world and the eighth largest services sector.
For this reason alone, no EU Member States should, in my opinion, be forced to introduce the euro.
Fears about, for example, handing over sovereignty to the European Central Bank should be treated just as seriously as the price rises feared by consumers.
Many millions of citizens have in fact found the euro to have inflationary powers, since it has been a decisive factor in the increased price of everyday necessities.
Neither official statistics showing the contrary nor image campaigns will do anything to change that.
Any EU country that is considering introducing the euro should as a general rule, in my view, always let the sovereign power, that is the people, decide.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their positive report on the integration of my country, Cyprus, and of course of Malta into the eurozone.
I also wish to thank Mr Almunia for the assistance he has given Cyprus all this time in achieving this objective.
Despite the tight timeframe which the Commission allowed Parliament and despite the reactions voiced, Mr Langen has demonstrated a huge sense of responsibility, has circumvented procedural issues and, I repeat, has demonstrated his ability to get to the heart of the matter in his positive report.
My thanks once again to Mr Langen.
The European Parliament is today rewarding Cyprus's long-term efforts to put its economy in order and converge with the indicators of the European Union.
The European Parliament is giving the third institutional green light to the adoption of the euro in Cyprus.
The adoption of the euro in Cyprus will bring the euro to the Middle East and forge a monetary link between Europe and Arabia via Cyprus.
The monetary area of the European Union will extend from Brussels to the far end of the Eastern Mediterranean.
Cyprus has always had a strong economy; even during the difficult years after the military invasion and the occupation of the north of Cyprus by Turkey and the loss of its basic economic resources, it has managed to develop a strong economy.
Thus, everything that needs to be done by 1 January 2008 on the part of Cyprus for full economy integration and convergence will have to be done and you can be sure that it will be done.
As far as Eurostat's comment on the provision of imperfect data is concerned, Mr Almunia's clarification satisfies us.
I trust that by 1 January 2008 the necessary basis will be in place for a proper resolution of the Cyprus problem and for Cyprus to reunite politically, socially and economically, so that the euro becomes the currency of all Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish alike.
The European Union has an obligation to take an initiative in this direction.
(FR) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, this is actually the fourth time that the European Parliament has been called upon to make a decision on the euro area, in its initial setting up or on the occasion of its enlargements.
The issue of the euro is no small matter for our fellow citizens: it is, in their hands, one of the European Union's most valuable assets.
Since last year, however, since the opening of the debate on the accession of Lithuania, we have had the impression that it has become a debate from which any political issue must be removed and where only purely technical arguments can be raised.
In this debate, the European Parliament is asking to be able to come to a decision of this kind in the normal way.
For that to happen, like any other institution, it needs time.
That is the spirit of the letter that our President sent to the Presidents of the other two institutions.
The answer we have received from the President of the Commission springs from a spirit of cooperation and conciliation, we appreciate that.
On the Council's part, it is a work in progress.
We need to go beyond that, Mr Gloser.
We need you to show the same spirit of consultation and conciliation as the Commission, otherwise we shall find it difficult to carry on in this way.
Beyond the technical arguments, I should not want the whole of the discussion to take place without at any time our raising the problems of governance of the euro area.
What situation are we in today, after all, with two countries that have a permanent opt-out clause and countries that have to sign up and belong to this area, without at any time our questioning the governance of the area?
We are approaching the time when rotation of the authorities of the European Central Bank (ECB) takes place.
It is a mechanism that we have criticised here, in this Parliament, and that, I think, we continue to criticise.
We think also that the functioning of the Eurogroup is not quite satisfactory and that we must do even better.
Tomorrow we shall have the accession of Slovakia and then after that, until 2012, our timetable will be noticeably lighter.
Let us take advantage of this time to improve the governance of the euro area, otherwise our fellow citizens will no longer have confidence in their own currency, the geographical extent of which is being enlarged without first of all improving its functioning.
With your permission, Mr President, I shall say a word finally about the inflation criterion.
I know that this criterion was defined in 1992, at a time when Europe was very different from what it is now.
If, however, we want to revise the Maastricht criteria on a strictly economic basis, independently of any political conditions which would allow this debate to be reopened, then there are other aspects of the Maastricht criteria that ought to be revised.
Mr President, the eurozone is another important institution, bringing European nations closer to each other and further connecting our people's wellbeing and prospects in the common future of a united Europe.
For this reason, the citizens I represent as a Cypriot MEP rejoice at the decision of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to approve the Commission's proposal to proceed with the adoption of the euro by Cyprus on 1 January 2008.
I of course note with regret that paragraph 7b of the report's explanatory statement somewhat erroneously states that the Cypriot Government has infringed the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 501/2004 of 10 March 2004 on providing Eurostat with full information on quarterly accounts for general government.
Yesterday, I wrote to the Cypriot Finance Minister and to the Commission on this subject.
I welcome the speedy correction made by Commissioner Almunia, both to me in writing and here this morning.
I wonder whether it would also be possible for a suitable correction and clarification to be made in the report, even at this late stage.
I should appreciate the assistance of the rapporteur in doing this.
Cyprus's adoption of the euro will, in addition to everything else, have two further beneficial effects.
Firstly, it will bring Turkey closer to Europe as, on a practical level, the euro will replace the Turkish lira as the currency used in the Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus.
Secondly, it will bring Europe closer to the United Kingdom, as the euro will be the currency used by the civilian population living in the two British colonies in Cyprus, Akrotiri and Dhekelia.
In these areas, the pound - albeit the Cyprus pound, a colonial version of the mighty British pound - will be replaced by the euro.
These colonies will be the first official British territory on which the euro will be the currency of general use.
In the future, the euro may even gradually extend from the colonies to the British mainland, undoubtedly to the joy of all the British MEPs in this House, of whom, incidentally, I do not see many.
In conclusion, I call on all my colleagues to support this report and I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to you all to visit Cyprus in 2008, to enjoy Cypriot hospitality and to spend your euros freely in the sun.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will confine my remarks today to the procedure and will not comment on the many other points that have been addressed.
In terms of substance I can quite frankly echo Mr Langen's assessment of Malta and Cyprus and his comments on Parliament's approval.
I will therefore concentrate on the procedure.
Here I will simply take the words of the Minister of State, Mr Glosar, as my starting point.
He said that we should not primarily consider the procedure.
There was talk of sympathy, requests and considering.
For the next procedure I should like to say: we will sympathetically consider Council and the Commission's requests to make our decisions quickly.
Next time, however, we will also use the procedure that Parliament provides for such matters.
We fully understand the Council's constraints with its meeting schedule.
The Commission's constraints too, and the 1 January deadline: all of these things are well understood in Parliament.
However, if there is no understanding the other way round, that we in Parliament also have a particular procedure and that we are now unable, and not for the first time, to observe one of the basic rules of that procedure properly, for example the translation deadlines, then next time round there will be consequences.
We can therefore only press for an appropriate agreement to be adopted between the institutions.
Otherwise the Council would have to see to it that Parliament were no longer consulted in the future.
It has of course been mentioned that this is enshrined in the relevant Treaty, and if it is enshrined in the Treaty then it has to be respected.
The German Foreign Office and all European foreign ministries have made repeated attempts to stop Parliament becoming too powerful.
This, however, applies to other fields.
Nevertheless, one area that is very important to me is data provision.
That is why we in Parliament want to have sufficient time to deal with this.
We have seen what happened with Greece and Hungary.
We hold the Commission responsible for guaranteeing that the data on which the decision for an accession is based is also scrutinised as thoroughly as possible, so that we can assume that it is correct.
I need only refer to the comments of the Hungarian Finance Minister, who, following what happened in Hungary, publicly philosophised about the various possibilities that are actually open to a finance minister when supplying data to Brussels.
The ECB President, Mr Trichet, has also pointed out that collecting data in the European Union is problematic.
For us it is crucial that the Commission does not pass the buck to Eurostat in such cases but that it takes responsibility itself.
However, we should also like to strengthen the Commission vis-Ã -vis the Member States.
It is unacceptable that the Commission should have to comply with such requests when the Member States continue to use all of the means at their disposal to restrict the Commission's supervisory powers in areas where they really do need to be exercised.
(MT) Thank you Mr President, today's vote is a significant one for Malta, because aside from the important and legitimate arguments that have been put forward regarding when would have been the best time to adopt the euro, there is, notwithstanding, a political consensus and a commitment to ensuring that the changeover happens on 1 January 2008.
Once the European Commission has accepted the statistics and methodology put forward by the Maltese authorities, then these will be accepted by all European authorities when the same basis is used by successive governments.
In the next few years, considerable work will have to be carried out on the sustainability of the public finances if the Maastricht criteria are to be complied with.
As both the Commission and the European Central Bank have stated, the Maltese Government has, until now, resorted to the one-off sale of public assets, while continuing to add fiscal pressure, mainly on the workers and the middle class.
This is not sustainable.
The National Committee is doing a good job in preparing for the changeover to the euro, but more has to be done to directly involve consumer representatives in fighting the perception that the euro will lead to a higher cost of living.
More basic information needs to be given, including information on interest rates.
The 'FAIR' initiative, which allows individual businesses to enter into agreement on dual pricing, should be praised.
However, currently little more than half of Maltese and Gozitan enterprises have taken part in this scheme.
I strongly urge those other businesses that have not as yet joined this initiative to do so, without delay.
Let us make a success of the changeover to the euro, although one must not be fooled into thinking that this will solve the country's economic problems.
The solution to these is to be found within ourselves.
In recent years, Malta's Gross Domestic Product has fallen from 78% to 71% of the European average.
The progress registered in this period came mostly from large bank profits and government projects with direct expenditure.
This kind of policy will become extremely limited in view of the convergence criteria.
Meanwhile, the sectors that ought to be drivers of our economy, such as tourism and manufacturing, have gone downhill.
This was clearly proven by the economic and social shock that hit our country yesterday, when 570 persons lost their job in one day, due to the closing down of the VF factory.
This is why a national effort is needed that genuinely favours competition in these areas.
Mr President, I also have to apologise to my Cypriot and Maltese colleagues for spoiling this historical moment of accession to the eurozone with this debate on our institutional problems with dealing with accession issues.
However, it does not take anything away from our support for their adoption of the euro and for both Mr Langen's reports.
We did not want to burden the accession of these two countries with the issue of the future procedure, but I hope that we can come to an agreement with the Commission and the Council today to ensure that, in future, there is a better procedure and a more serious opportunity for Parliament to give its opinion on this issue.
That is why we have drawn up this non-legislative motion for a resolution on the procedure.
We would like to be invited to meet with the other two institutions to produce an interinstitutional agreement on several issues, which are listed in our motion for a resolution.
This text calls for a pre-announcement system, whereby those Member States wishing to accede notify us in advance so that we can begin studying the situation, and concerns the assessment of the quality of the statistics and data provided.
My last point concerns the scheduling of the dates for the formal procedure.
We recognise that everything has to take place in a very short period of time.
However, if we are better prepared then we will have a better opportunity for serious discussion.
The Commissioner said that he was willing to sit together with us to conclude an interinstitutional agreement of this kind.
I would like to ask Mr Gloser to give us that commitment as well, on behalf of the Council, the German Presidency and future presidencies.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus and Malta's request that its degree of convergence be assessed was presented less than two years after it joined the exchange rate mechanism, on 2 May 2005, and the reports of the European Central Bank and the Commission have been presented according to the same pattern as the reports requested by Greece, Lithuania and Slovenia.
Though it is always useful to improve the processes for enlarging the euro zone and improve the European Parliament's involvement, my central message is addressed to our fellow citizens from Cyprus and Malta, so that they may hear our view that Cyprus and Malta can join the euro zone and must be able to enjoy all the advantages of the monetary union from the beginning of next year.
This enlargement of the euro zone will be a significant step in the process of European integration.
For the first time since reunification, the majority of Member States of the European Union will be part of the euro zone.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my warm thanks to you, Mr Langen, for the two parts of your contribution as rapporteur.
You recommended the entry of Malta and Cyprus into the eurozone in spite of the reservations about the time factor which you expressed in the second part of your remarks.
It is important that we should be able to achieve this within the various time limits, as Commissioner Almunia said before.
Both countries need a certain amount of time to prepare for this step so as to ensure that the people of Malta and Cyprus do not ultimately bear the brunt of an excessively long drawn-out preparation process.
I would like to re-emphasise that the European Council indicated to the President of the European Parliament that a difficult situation obtained and that time might be too short.
Let me also deal with the question of what is feasible, of what can still be done before particular official deadlines.
The timetables have been laid down.
We cannot deviate from them, because provisions of the EC Treaty are involved.
The other question is to what extent, in the consultations between Ecofin and your committee, you are receiving the information you need in order to monitor the situation continuously and thus to be prepared.
Another question concerns the extent to which you are being given advance copies of reports from the countries that have applied for membership.
May I also say this in response to various questions that have been asked in the course of the debate here: on the one hand, many things are prescribed, but in areas where changes may be possible - and this was explained by Mrs Merkel in her letter to Mr Poettering and was also referred to by the President of the Commission - if we are to recognise these possibilities we must remain engaged in the discussion through appropriate proposals from the Commission.
In all other respects, it is a matter of awaiting developments.
I therefore hope you will appreciate that I cannot make any promises today on behalf of the Council in respect of this item.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in this final speech in the debate I would like once again, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate Cyprus and Malta on the efforts they have made to bring us this far and on the efforts they are making to introduce the euro successfully, both for their economy and for their citizens.
I believe that this demonstrates once again that the euro zone is not a closed club and that joining the euro is not just an obligation for the Member States, but an excellent opportunity for those who wish to share the single currency with 318 million other Europeans and for the countries that already belong to the Economic and Monetary Union.
I therefore believe that it is a good decision to support the entry of Cyprus and Malta into the euro, as Mr Langen's report does.
I would like to make two comments on compliance with the criteria.
In his speech, Mr Langen called into question the way in which Cyprus and Malta fulfil the criteria or the way in which the Commission's convergence report has assessed the compliance with those criteria.
I must say that the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure for Malta, which took place at the last Ecofin Council on the proposal of the Commission, is a necessary condition in order for Malta to fulfil the Maastricht criterion on this point and the Commission's convergence report of 16 May said that, if the Ecofin Council approved the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure, Malta would comply.
We have done that in order not to delay the convergence report, because if not we would have had to wait until 5 June in order to publish the convergence report and you would have had even less time to debate it.
The assessment of compliance conditional upon definitive approval is therefore intended to help the work of Parliament and the Council, not to hinder it.
So to the figures: Cyprus and Malta's deficit and debt figures notified within the context of the excessive deficit notification procedures that take place twice a year, on 1 April and 1 October, are as reliable - having been analysed by Eurostat, which published its opinion on 23 April - as those of the other Member States.
Eurostat has no reservations regarding the deficit and debt figures notified.
There is no foundation for calling into question the figures for Cyprus and Malta and not calling into question the figures for France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Sweden, Denmark or any other Member State.
No foundation whatsoever.
There are difficulties with other figures: there are difficulties with the quarterly financial account figures in the national accounts, with the unemployment figures at this time of the enquiry into the German workforce and with the French figures, but that is everyday statistical work, and if Parliament wants to give Eurostat more resources, they will be welcome.
If Parliament wants to support the work of Eurostat, the honourable Members know that I, as the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, am always grateful for Parliament's support of the Commission and of Eurostat, but I do not wish there to be any doubt about the validity and the quality of the figures on the basis of which we are assessing whether Cyprus and Malta fulfil the convergence criteria.
With regard to the procedures, I wish to address you directly, Mr Langen.
The Commission is not marginalising Parliament or hindering its work in this debate in any way, and it has no desire or reason to do so.
Quite the opposite, and I have expressed, and President Barroso has also done so in his letter, the Commission's and the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs' total willingness to work with you.
I would like you to listen to me, Mr Langen, because I am telling you and I am repeating what the President of the Commission said in the letter to Mr Poettering and what I said on 7 June in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in your presence - we are entirely willing to share information with you and to forward any information available.
But what you cannot ask of the Commission is that it take the view that a country has definitively fulfilled the deficit criterion when the Council has not yet abrogated the excessive deficit procedure.
Next year, if Slovakia presents a request, we are going to have that problem again, because Slovakia is currently under an excessive deficit procedure that can only be abrogated - in the event that that abrogation is appropriate once the definitive figures for the 2007 budget have been validated by Eurostat.
We are not therefore going to be able to anticipate, and nor is the Ecofin Council, the decisions on abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure for Slovakia before the time of year that Malta's excessive deficit procedure has been abrogated.
We can anticipate the convergence report by saying that, if the Ecofin Council approves the derogation, Slovakia will fulfil the criterion.
That is a hypothesis.
We cannot say in February that Slovakia fulfils the deficit criterion, however, when the abrogation can only be approved in May or June of next year.
Likewise, we cannot carry out a rigorous assessment - and you are right to demand that we carry out a rigorous assessment - of whether countries fulfil the Maastricht criteria, the convergence criteria, before we know the spring economic forecasts in May 2008, which cannot be approved or published beforehand by the Commission and its services, because if we anticipate the spring forecasts they will be winter forecasts and they will not provide a view of the economic situation and the economic data for the spring.
I therefore wish to make it clear to this Parliament that next year's convergence report cannot be anticipated before May.
The Commission, Parliament and the Council must therefore talk and agree on a way in which we can work rigorously, coherently and cooperatively in order to come to correct decisions that enable all of us to work rigorously and take decisions at the appropriate time so that the citizens of the next countries to join the 13 current members of the euro zone do not suffer the consequences of a belated decision and of a lack of preparation for the introduction of euro notes and coins.
This is the Commission's attitude and conviction.
There should be an agreement amongst the three institutions. That is desirable.
It makes no sense that, for each enlargement of the euro zone, we should be discussing the procedures rather than the countries that are entering and the beneficial consequences for their citizens.
We must resolve this problem, but we will only resolve it by maintaining an attitude of cooperation amongst the three institutions and taking account of the objective limitations with which the institutions must take this decision.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I must come back to Commissioner Almunia's last remarks.
I am rather disappointed at the way he interpreted rather than faithfully representing what I said.
Firstly, I did not say that the data from Cyprus and Malta were worse than those from the other countries.
Indeed, in the cases of Portugal, Hungary and Greece, the Commission sold us bad data as good.
That is a fact.
Secondly, it is not a matter of us attacking specific countries but of the Commission taking responsibility.
Thirdly, on 3 May 2007, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council document COM(2007)230 - the quality report on quarterly financial accounts for general government.
That document found fault with Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus.
No more and no less than this is set out in the explanatory statement of my report.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, Mr Langen, with regard to the last aspect, I would say once again that it is clear that, with regard to these quarterly accounts, the Commission and Eurostat are asking a number of countries, including Cyprus and Malta, to supply information, to improve it and to supplement it.
I would repeat, however, that these statistics are not relevant in terms of assessing whether or not a country fulfils the convergence criteria.
There are thousands of statistics, many series of statistics that the countries have to send to Eurostat, which make up the statistical apparatus of the European system of statistics.
Those statistics, however, which are incomplete and deficient in the case of Cyprus and Malta, are not the statistics which we have used and which we must use in order to assess the convergence criteria.
They are different statistics.
With regard to your previous comment, Portugal, Italy, France, Greece, Hungary and many other countries have received revisions from Eurostat of the GDP figures, deficit figures, debt figures and many other factors.
We are clearly talking in particular about deficit and debt, however.
You, Mr Langen, and all of the honourable Members, know that these revisions have taken place and you know that the figures that we are using thanks to the work of Eurostat and of the Commission, work that has improved considerably over the last three years, are now more realistic and more in tune with reality.
Together with the Council you have approved a Regulation that provides for better instruments and more capacities for revising the figures that Eurostat receives from each Member State.
We thank you for the support that Eurostat has received and which is enabling it to produce work of a higher quality than it previously produced, and if I, as Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, need new legislative instruments for improving the quality of its work, I shall ask you for it.
I can tell you today that, if I compare the credibility and quality of the Member States' budget, deficit and debt figures with which I had to work three years ago, then things have clearly improved in that respect, and that is something we should all welcome.
Please do not blame the Commission for doing its work properly by offering you and everybody else better deficit and debt figures.
(FR) Mr President, I invite Mr Langen and all his colleagues to take part as actively as today in the discussion in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, when we apply ourselves to improving, in the scope of the discussion currently in progress, for example, the way that Eurostat functions, and when we adopt texts about which the Commissioner has just spoken, which should make it possible to improve the governance of Eurostat.
At these times I do not see you.
I should like to ask Mr Gloser if he is willing to commit himself, on behalf of the Council and in the spirit of Mr Barroso's reply to Mr Poettering, to sitting round a table with us in order to reach an agreement on a common timetable for all three institutions when the time comes to consider a new request for accession to the euro area.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) We have heard in the debate what options exist.
The Commissioner and Mr Barroso have made proposals.
The task now is to sit down together and clarify what is still possible within the existing Treaty provisions.
We should use the available time for that purpose.
in writing. - The Maltese public's support will also be influenced by the impact of eurozone membership on ordinary citizens, the business community and the economy itself.
Three major factors stand out.
The first is the success of the transition.
After perhaps a low start, preparations seem to be gathering pace and no doubt it is imperative that consumers and operators keep tight control of the process.
So far we have tended to hear only about the pros, in terms of the benefits to Maltese consumers when they travel abroad, the improved competitiveness of Destination Malta for tourists, lower transaction costs for businesses engaged in intra-EU trade, and so forth.
But we have heard very little about the potential disadvantages.
On the one hand, Malta needs to adapt to policies, adjustment mechanisms, and measures taken by the European Central Bank, such as on interest rates and monetary aggregates, that will strongly influence our destiny.
On the other, our fulfilment of the membership criteria cannot rely on the results of a crash economic diet but must be based on sustainable economic policies that ensure that we do not infringe the rules.
in writing. - I am interested to see that more countries, the latest now being Cyprus and Malta, are choosing the join the euro, which makes Britain's position look increasingly conspicuous.
Bearing in mind that the euro is rapidly establishing itself as the world's strongest currency and has now displaced the US dollar as the main denomination for world trade, accounting for 45% of the global market compared to 37% for the dollar, it is becoming increasingly clear that for the UK, staying out means missing out.
Signature of acts adopted under codecision: see Minutes
(IT) Mr President, Rule 28 of our Rules of Procedure provides that questions related to the work of the Bureau shall receive a reply within 30 days of being submitted.
About three months ago, on 28 March, I submitted a question on the statements made, in the presence of the President of our Parliament, by Cardinal Angelo Scola, who said that it was not appropriate for the current European Parliament to make continual pronouncements on issues such as marriage, family and life.
In the face of such an attack on this Parliament I decided to submit the question I have mentioned, and I think it is important for Parliament's Bureau to defend this House and its deliberations against attacks by a foreign State such as the Vatican City State.
Mr Cappato, if what you say is true - and I do not doubt that it is - you must, of course, be given an answer.
The capable ladies and gentlemen next to me will look into the matter and then you will get an answer.

Residence permits: uniform format (vote)
- Coelho report
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, in 2003, Parliament rejected two Commission initiatives on this issue.
I congratulate the Commission on accepting Parliament's idea of separating the issue of residence permits from that of visas.
Quite apart from technical issues involved in radio collisions between the different chips used, these are indeed separate issues.
It is one thing to have an identity document to be used within the Schengen area, but having a travel document to be used outside the Schengen area is quite another.
This will enable all third-country nationals living legally in the Schengen area to be identified in the same way.
I should therefore like to congratulate the Commission on proposing to us the introduction of biometric identifiers containing an image and fingerprints in interoperable formats.
The use of these biometric data is the best way of preventing the use of false identities and identity theft.
I should like to draw the Commission's attention, however, to the need for such changes of residence to meet the same high levels of security required for the issuing of national identity cards.
I also wish to draw the Commission's attention to the gaps regarding the way in which data are gathered, especially in the case of children, or people who are unable to provide fingerprints due to various forms of incapacity.
Lastly, let me draw the Commission's attention to data protection standards and to the need to draw up a detailed list of the authorities that will have access to those data, and of the authorities permitted to carry out checks on residence permits, in order to prevent the misuse of the most sensitive data.

Operation of taxation systems: Fiscalis 2013 (vote)
- Hans-Peter Martin report
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I shall only take up your attention very briefly.
The report before us on the Community programme Fiscalis, a legislative programme, has been disgracefully censored.
The chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Socialist Member Pervenche BerÃšs, inexplicably censored the explanatory statement of my report on her own authority.
This is unworthy of a parliament that calls itself democratic.
You will find the censored passages at the end of a lengthy exposÃ© on money-wasting and on scrutiny of the European Commission in an addendum - perhaps you could call the House to order, Mr President - in an addendum which is attached for those who are interested.
(Mixed reactions)
You were the cause of the disorder.
I reject your accusations against Mrs BerÃšs.
That is no way to behave here in Parliament.
(Applause)
(FR) Mr President, the explanatory statement accompanying this report happens to have been completely contradicted by the vote on the resolution in committee, a resolution which this Parliament is now about to be asked to vote on.
Consequently, applying our Rules of Procedure, I asked our rapporteur to kindly withdraw the terms of the explanatory statement since it did not correspond with the resolution as it had been adopted in committee.
These terms were added to the explanatory statement in the form of a minority opinion, in accordance with strict application of our Rules of Procedure.
I thank you, Mr President, for having allowed me to inform the House about the reality of democratic life within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs BerÃšs.
I did not doubt that.

Improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro zone (vote)
- Motion for a resolution: euro zone
Voting time
The next item is voting time.
(For results and other details of the vote, see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) As our group says, this proposal, which introduces biometric data information into the uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals, 'raises several concerns as regards its technical feasibility, financial costs and risk of its abuse'.
As we have highlighted, it is highly debatable whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security, or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection
This is a disproportionate measure that forms part of a supranational dynamic, a measure that is aimed at setting up EU-level monitoring and control instruments.
It is not in any way accompanied by 'particularly consistent and serious safeguards, especially regarding the way they are collected and used' and it is completely impossible to guarantee its use in a 'relatively safe environment'.
This proposal is both a consequence and an integral part of the trend towards excessive preoccupation with security pursued by the EU institutions, and as such we reject it.
in writing. The second modified proposal introducing biometric data information into Regulation 1030/2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals raises several concerns as regards its technical feasibility, financial costs and the risk of its abuse.
It is still not clear whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection.
The original Commission proposal has also turned out to be technically impossible and the financial resources destined for its development have been partly wasted.
Due to these reasons, we cannot support the Commission's modified proposal, which would again only raise the financial costs and technical difficulties and would be entirely inadequate to the aim of added value in security.
in writing. (DE) Thanks to the visions of some multi-cultural dreamers, a situation has arisen which is becoming increasingly difficult for the native population to endure.
In many cases, immigrants and their children have no consideration for the native population; on the contrary, they demand more and more rights for themselves and seem bent on eradicating our Western Christian heritage; conversely, they simply turn a deaf ear when it comes to civic duties or to obligations of any incomer, such as willingness to integrate.
The widespread provision of social housing for nationals of non-EU countries and for neo-citizens of the Union who are not integrated has not only created a profound sense of insecurity among the indigenous population but also led to a massive deterioration in people's housing conditions and quality of life, a situation in which outbreaks of violence are almost a daily occurrence.
In the light of these realities, a general tightening of the right of immigration is needed.
The Coelho report does not offer a basis for such action, which is precisely why I voted against it.
(SK) My formal background is that of a dentist.
Mercury is used in dentistry for amalgam fillings, and I have been watching with interest the EU strategy concerning mercury and the elimination of mercury from all areas of life where there is an appropriate alternative.
In principle, I agree with many of the measures the Commission has been submitting in the form of draft legislation in line with the mercury strategy.
However, I am anxiously waiting to see how we deal with the opinion that mercury should also be banished from dentistry, where mercury amalgams have been used for 150 years now and quite successfully at that.
There are no conclusive indications or evidence of the toxic effects of amalgams if used appropriately.
At the same time, there is no clear opinion on whether there are appropriate alternative filling materials.
I believe that if amalgam waste is properly separated in dentistry departments and if we dispose of it properly, safely and on a permanent basis, as proposed in the report, there will be no need for the time being to do away with amalgam as a filling material.
(DE) Mr President, I wish to give the report my firm backing, and I have voted in favour of it.
It is important that we should have a European strategy for mercury, because it is one of the most toxic environmental pollutants, and Europe must certainly lead the way here.
I did vote against some proposals designed to tighten the rules, because I believe it is necessary to provide incremental arrangements for businesses and to allow for a smooth transition so as not to jeopardise the general level of competitiveness.
I am also wary of creating too much red tape, and a steady hand is needed if we are avoid that risk.
On the whole, this is a very encouraging report.
in writing. We have voted against amendments suggesting that liquid mercury should be stored in above-ground facilities.
No impact assessments have been carried out by the Commission on the safety of such storage and there is no technology available to solidify liquid mercury.
Storage of mercury in an above-ground facility is therefore questionable in terms of safety and in terms of time (the amendments suggest that this storage would be temporary).
Without new technology, storage would not be temporary.
On the other hand, impact assessments have been undertaken by the Commission for the storage of liquid mercury in salt mines and deep underground hard rock formations and has been confirmed safe.
We are very much aware that technology could be developed in the near future.
We very much welcome the Council's agreement to a European Parliament request to include in the proposed regulation a review on extension of the scope of the regulation and a review of other options available for the storage of mercury in 2010.
in writing. - (PT) In 1990 the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR) recommended that all mercury cell chlor-alkali plants (MCCAPs) be converted to mercury-free technology by 2010.
Parliament's March 2006 resolution on the Community strategy concerning mercury urged the Commission to take action to implement OSPAR.
Apart from ongoing mercury emissions from MCCAPs, when these plants convert to mercury-free technologies, the vast quantities of mercury in their cells need to be managed in an environmentally appropriate manner.
To prevent this surplus mercury from flooding the world mercury commodity market, a proposal for a Regulation banning exports of metallic mercury by 1 July, 2011, was adopted in October 2006, and attempts have been made to bring that date forward.
The proposal includes parallel provisions on safe storage of the excess mercury which will mainly be coming from decommissioned MCCAPs, to prevent its re-sale.
Currently there are around 12 000 tonnes of mercury sitting in mercury cells in Europe.
To that end Euro Chlor (the EU chlor-alkali industry federation) has been asked by the European Commission and has agreed to develop a Voluntary Agreement for the storage of surplus chlor-alkali mercury.
in writing. - (FR) The management of mercury is an important issue for the conservation of the environment.
If Europe has more waste mercury to store, it is because our industries did not foresee the risks involved in the use of this metal, in particular for the production of chlorine.
First lesson: we must very quickly rethink our production methods in order to be prepared for a vital ecological revolution.
Next, it is necessary to constantly monitor the storage of waste, by setting up regular checks.
That is why I voted in favour of Amendment 25 which rules out permanent storage above-ground and underground.
Alas, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Nonetheless, the other improvements in the text justify a vote in favour of the final report.
Even though it recognises that there is currently no absolutely safe method of storing metallic mercury, the report endeavours to legalise a special type of territorial 'racism', by imposing the choice of the Spanish province of Almaden as the site for permanent landfill of the most toxic element on the planet.
The worst thing is that it endeavours to justify the imposition of this specific area with the existence there of infrastructures and 'manpower'.
In other words, it is using unemployment as a means of blatant coercion of the workers, so that they agree to turn their area into a landfill for toxic mercury waste from the entire EU, with incalculable risks to the health of the inhabitants and the environment.
The proposal in the report for the involvement and funding of all sorts of NGOs in the crucial question of the application of mercury-free technologies in developing countries and in so-called 'economies in transition' comes under the same dangerous policy by circumventing the rules which derive from binding bilateral agreements in this sector.
That is why the Greek Communist Party abstained from the vote.
The Greek Communist Party maintains that the question of where metallic mercury should be stored and managed is a subject for science and the application of its conclusions and not of choices that reflect the interests and profits of business.
(SK) Supplementary pension schemes, collectively referred to as the 'second pillar of the social insurance system', are an inseparable part of modern society.
We have witnessed in the past the reform of labour markets and social insurance systems in several Member States, and these have included pension system reforms.
Let me use Slovakia as an example of a country which introduced supplementary pension schemes within the context of reforming the social security system.
A large number of Slovak nationals have already joined the second pillar.
Savings generated in the second pillar are privately owned.
They are more secure than the promises of the state to pay out pensions from public coffers.
An advantage of the second pillar is that pension benefits no longer depend on the country's demographics but on savings accumulated in one's own account.
For these reasons and in the spirit of encouraging worker mobility in Member States, I have welcomed the draft directive designed to improve the portability of supplementary pension rights, and I believe that this will make it possible to reduce the number of problems associated with eligibility for pension rights, retaining suspended pension rights and with the portability of acquired rights.
(DE) Mr President, the single market and mobility depend on social security, which must extend beyond a person's working life.
It is important in this respect to maintain the balance between employers and employees on which the acquisition of pension rights depends.
This was the first reading, and we still have numerous discussions ahead of us.
The delegation from the Austrian People's Party has given the Oomen-Ruijten report its unreserved support, because we believe that this is the right way to continue developing mobility and the single market.
(LT) Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten and other colleagues who prepared this report concerning the improvement of portability of the right to a supplementary pension.
I voted for this document, as I believe it will positively affect most European Union Member States, especially the newest EU members.
In the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Malta, supplementary pensions have not yet been legislated, whereas in the Scandinavian countries and Slovenia, by contrast, the majority of workers participate in such pension schemes.
Our Parliament's urging to oblige EU countries to gradually seek easier portability of pension rights should provide a new impulse above all to the new Member States, and likewise to Greece, Italy and Portugal, to amend their legislation in such a way that the mobility of people in the European Union be encouraged, not penalised.
(IT) Mr President, it is with pleasure that I take the floor to say to Europe: 'if you are there, let us see some action'.
Europe must show greater courage, it must have the heart of a lion and not be a chicken.
The Directive on the transferability of pension rights is absolutely crucial for all European citizens and workers.
By approving this proposal we are doing something for workers, but we will not really succeed in obtaining a result for which European citizens can applaud Europe.
Therefore, Mr President, let us not mourn over the referendums in France and the Netherlands that rejected the Constitution.
Europe must be more courageous.
in writing. (SV) As a Liberal, I find it difficult to vote against a proposal aimed at improving Europeans' opportunities to move around more freely.
It is not made any the easier when the proposal is also aimed at encouraging people to take more active responsibility for saving for their pensions, this being one of the genuinely key issues for the future.
Nonetheless, I was unable to vote in favour of the original proposal.
The problem is twofold.
Firstly, it is debatable whether this complicated issue is suited to being raised at European level, given the various Member States' very different systems for pension savings.
Secondly, I could not help but note that Sweden, in common with Germany, has systems particularly ill-suited to this type of changeover.
The Swedish model, in which the social partners decide about the issue, is incompatible with the rapporteur's proposal.
Considerable problems could also arise if huge sums by way of invested funds could suddenly be released in a short period in order to guarantee the ability to transfer pensions.
I am, in the long run, in favour of a system in which people can change jobs and move from one country to another and still not need to worry about how doing so might affect their pensions.
I therefore in the end voted in favour of this House's amended version of the report in which national derogations are permitted.
in writing. - (PT) On the issue of the transferability of pension rights, there are at least two key aspects that must be taken into account: ensuring workers' rights and guaranteeing the sustainability of public social security systems.
The issue before us is specifically supplementary pension schemes and not public social security schemes.
With regard to these two aspects, we are opposed to the amendments tabled in the report amending the Commission's original proposal.
These amendments propose, for example, to increase from 21 to 25 the age of access to supplementary pension schemes and to make the acquisition of pension rights conditional on a minimum five-year period.
Supplementary pension schemes must not, however, replace public schemes.
Public social security schemes based on solidarity and universality are among the cornerstones of any state and something that must be guaranteed in a fairer and more egalitarian society.
Lastly, we are very disappointed at the rejection of the amendments we tabled, including the proposal to combine the Commission's original position on the minimum age of 21 with a two-year period of acquisition of rights, which would have been more favourable to the workers.
Hence our final vote against.
in writing. (SV) We have chosen to vote against this report.
The June List wholeheartedly supports an efficient internal market.
We thus support the principle whereby an employee must be able without difficulty to transfer earned pension points between the Member States.
We do not, however, believe that the EU should have views on the form to be taken by the Member States' respective pension systems, provided that all EU citizens are treated equally within the system in force.
We are thus critical of quite a few individual proposals in the report, such as the views on vesting conditions for policyholders in supplementary pension schemes, the views on minimum ages for earning pension rights or EU rules on the qualifying period for entry into a pension scheme.
How the Member States choose to design their respective pension systems needs to be an entirely national matter, provided that all EU citizens are treated equally within the system in force.
in writing.- (PL) I am voting in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights - C6 0331/2005 -
Demographic changes and an ageing population have made us aware of the need for supplementary pension and social security insurance systems, which will ensure dignified living conditions.
The new directive and Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten's report both aim to improve the mobility of workers, within and between the Member States of the European Union, by establishing minimum requirements concerning the acquisition and retention of supplementary pension rights.
The report aptly highlights the role of the Member States in providing consistent support for the transfer of acquired pension rights, especially in the event that new, supplementary pension systems are established.
Over the five years following the implementation of the directive, the European Commission will draw up a report which will take into account the conditions governing transfers of capital corresponding to employees' supplementary pension or social security entitlements.
in writing.
(DE) I voted against the report on the portability directive. The report goes well wide of the real target of increased cross-border mobility of labour between Member States.
On average, only 10% of all employees in the EU receive company pensions.
Because of the cost increase of at least 20% that can be expected to result from the high minimum standards which have just been adopted, there will scarcely be any interest in the creation or expansion of company pension schemes.
My fear is that what employers and employees have achieved to their mutual advantage in the national context over several decades is now being put at risk.
The minimum age for the acquisition of company-pension rights has been entirely scrapped.
The five-year vesting period has been abolished.
The minimum standards are to be applicable retroactively, which is in outright contradiction to the principle of safeguarding legitimate expectations.
I also voted for the deletion of index-linking, which would most probably be interpreted by the European Court of Justice as 'equitable adjustment' and as an obligation.
The German Bundesrat has calculated that treating employees who have changed companies on equal terms with those who have not will increase the cost of supplementary pension schemes by 30%.
European Commissioner VladimÃ­r Å pidla has announced the presentation of a new proposal.
Following the failure to reach agreement in the Council, the proposal will be largely based on today's parliamentary resolution and will thus jeopardise company pension schemes - and not only in Germany.
Directive 98/49/EEC guarantees the rights to supplementary pension for workers and the self-employed who move within the EU, but provides no guarantees in the area of portability of supplementary pensions and flexibility of the acquisition conditions.
This is something which the Commission proposal addresses. It lays down terms and puts forward three minimum rules regarding the portability of rights: either they remain within the business (dormant rights), they are transferred within a certain period of time, or they are paid in cash (up to a certain threshold).
According to the Commission, the new directive must apply to all supplementary pensions that are work-related.
I particularly regret the fact that the Oomen-Ruijten report excludes the proposal of portability of pension rights from the directive.
As it stands now, it only deals with dormant rights.
As I see it, the new directive should do everything in its power to support workers who invest in supplementary pension rights.
Accordingly, nobody should be excluded by imposing minimum conditions in terms of age or period of time.
I can only endorse the report if the directive retains the broad scope proposed by the Commission.
If not, I will be voting against.
The proposal for a Commission directive, as formulated with the anti-labour changes voted jointly by the Christian Democrats, the socialists and the liberals, supported by the New Democracy and PASOK MEPs, blows national supplementary insurance schemes sky high throughout the EU.
It marks a deterioration in the terms of insurance and retirement of the workers, a reduction in pensions and an increase in the retirement age.
It speeds up procedures for private insurance companies to increase their share of this sector.
The basic direction of these reactionary changes is the so-called 'three-axis' system of main state pension, with a supplementary and occupational pension from private companies.
The blow to the workers' rights in the supplementary pension sector is linked to the ambition of the monopolies to use the reserves in these insurance funds to fund their investments, while at the same time legalising the acceptance of the 'investment risk' or possible loss of the workers' money.
New Democracy and PASOK vote in favour of all the anti-grassroots measures in the European Parliament, on the one hand, and harangue and deceive the workers in our country, on the other hand, by endeavouring to show the people a supposedly friendly mask.
The Greek Communist Party calls on the workers to step up their fight against the anti-labour, anti-grassroots EU policy, to defend state social insurance schemes and to demand satisfaction of their contemporary needs, higher pensions and a lower retirement age.
in writing. - (DE) I voted against the portability directive, because it misses the real target of increased cross-border mobility of labour between Member States.
The rules on the transfer of company-pension rights only have the force of a recommendation for the Member States.
For this reason I had repeatedly advised outright rejection of the directive, since it has become superfluous.
(DE) Mr President, even though the introduction of the euro has made life easier in many respects, as in the case of cross-border trade, it would be wrong to overlook its less savoury aspects, such as the surrender of sovereignty and price increases.
As in the case of any enlargement of the EU, the introduction of the euro in new Member States will ultimately affect the fragile stability of the entire system.
This is why I believe it is imperative to ensure that the overall balance is not upset by the inclusion of weak national economies.
Now it may well be that Cyprus and Malta are ready.
In the past, however, governments have all too often played with marked cards in order to qualify for the euro club.
In my opinion, such an important decision must on no account be taken over the heads of the population, and that is why I have abstained in this instance.
in writing. - (PT) We abstained from the vote on account of the fact that it is entirely up to each Member State to make the sovereign decision on whether or not it wants to join the Eurozone.
Our opposition to the creation of Economic and Monetary Union and to the Eurozone is well known.
The example of Portugal has amply demonstrated how the euro is a tool for promoting wage moderation and flexibility in the labour market.
By sustaining nominal and not real convergence, it has been to the detriment of growth, employment and living standards, and to the benefit of the large European multinationals and financial groups.
I wish to point out that the issue of speeding up the enlargement of the Eurozone is also based on the political criteria of strengthening both political integration and the Eurozone itself.
With two new Member States - Malta and Cyprus - the Eurozone will boast over half of EU Member States.
This is a significant psychological barrier, when dissatisfaction among the workers and the people as a whole in the Eurozone is on the increase and when the future Constitutional Treaty is under discussion.
The majority therefore accept the idea of joining, even though Malta does not fulfil all the nominal convergence criteria.
As in the past, this is not an 'economic' decision, but a political one.
in writing. (DE) On the basis of economic criteria, the decision is no doubt justified.
From a political point of view, it is nevertheless a regrettable decision.
It squanders an opportunity to let both parts of the island of Cyprus enter the eurozone.
Instead of bringing North and South closer together through a single currency, it will only deepen the divide between the two parts of the island.
(MT) Thank you, Mr President.
The government has adopted as its policy the target of introducing the euro by 1 January 2008.
In order to do so a number of criteria had to be reached, for example regarding deficit and inflation.
Obviously these had a negative impact on the government's financial policies, as well as on the more vulnerable section of society.
Indeed, we believed that there was an alternative, which still entailed adopting the euro, but adopting it at a slower pace.
Obviously, our entry into the eurozone will have a number of positive effects, yet it will also have adverse effects in other areas.
However, in view of national interests, the Maltese Labour Party delegation has voted in favour.
(PL) Mr President, today we debated and voted on the expansion of the eurozone and Malta and Cyprus' membership of this zone.
I leave the sovereign decision on the abolition of the national currency in Cyprus and Malta to the citizens of these countries.
However, as a representative of the League of Polish Families in the European Parliament, I am opposed to Poland's membership of the eurozone and the negative economic and social impact this would have on Poles.
All current public opinion polls confirm that the majority of Poles do not want the euro.
I think that we should not only avoid acting hastily, but we should also not introduce the euro in Poland at all.
I also disagree with the opinions expressed today that the Member States have a duty to join the eurozone.
Poles should decide on this issue in a national referendum and I hope that the Polish zloty will remain a national currency in Europe, alongside the British pound and the Danish and Swedish currencies.
in writing. - (PT) It is well known that we opposed the creation of European Economic and Monetary Union and the euro.
Indeed, we voted against Parliament's resolution of 2 May 1998 establishing the Eurozone, which was originally made up of 12 countries, including Portugal.
We feel that monetary policy, and the prerogative of issuing currency, lies exclusively with the Member States, and therefore reject this transfer of sovereignty, which will make it impossible to address the economic and social problems in each country, including Portugal.
At this time, the enlargement of the Eurozone is based on political criteria - for example the strengthening of political integration and of the Eurozone itself - as this issue amply demonstrates, given that Malta does not fulfil all of the nominal convergence criteria.
However, with two new Member States - Malta and Cyprus - the Eurozone will boast over half of EU Member States.
This is a significant psychological barrier, when dissatisfaction among the workers and the people as a whole in the Eurozone is on the increase and when the future Constitutional Treaty is being discussed.
In our view, it is entirely up to each Member State to make the sovereign decision on whether or not it wants to join the Eurozone, and this is why we abstained from the vote.
in writing. British Conservatives have always opposed the entry of the UK into the euro zone.
Nevertheless, we have never opposed the right of other sovereign nations to form a common monetary system.
Our abstention reflects our belief that it is for the members of the euro zone to decide how best to conduct monetary policy in the interests of a stable currency.
in writing. - (FR) Our vote concerning the adoption of the euro by Malta and Cyprus will be identical to the one for Slovenia: we shall abstain.
We will not go against what we hope will be the conscious will of sovereign peoples.
We must, however, recognise that a threshold has been crossed: it is not at their express request, but because they almost fulfil the 'stupid' Maastricht criteria, as Mr Prodi would have said, that these countries have to adopt the euro.
Have their citizens been told about it?
At least one of these countries does not meet these famous criteria and neither of the two, it seems, has supplied the statistics necessary for a proper assessment of their state of preparation.
Why rush?
The practical and technical measures for actual transition to the single currency are a great unknown.
Also, the euro zone's capacity for absorption, which at another time was a matter of concern for Mr Langen, has disappeared from the picture and from the analysis.
Here we are again faced with the bicycle syndrome, from which European construction appears to suffer: if it does not go forward, it falls down.
The euro zone must be enlarged at all costs.
Full stop!
The truth is that it is the citizens of Europe who will have to pay the price!
in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to abstain in the final vote on these reports.
It is up to the people of Cyprus and Malta to decide, preferably through a referendum, whether they want the country to be part of EMU.
We do not believe that Sweden should be part of the currency union.
Nor do we recommend other countries to participate in it.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the introduction of the euro in Malta and Cyprus, because it is a matter of supporting strengthened integration of these countries in the sense given by the European Union.
Nonetheless, this decision ought to have been accompanied by measures enabling more democratic control of the single currency (establishment of real economic government of the euro zone capable of balancing the power of the European Central bank (ECB), changing the Central Bank's objectives so as to include research for growth and full employment, changing the criteria of the Stability Pact so as not to penalise public investment policy in the future).
Let us take care not to pursue endless enlargement of the euro zone without any new perspectives.
in writing. The British Conservative delegation supports the Committee on Budgets resolution calling on the Commission to resubmit its proposals for financing the Galileo project.
However, we have grave reservations about proposals to fund it through the existing European budget.
in writing. - (PT) We are very disappointed at the significant rejection by the majority in Parliament of the amendments tabled by our group, which were aimed at ensuring that 'the Galileo programme must not, under any circumstances, by used for military purposes', and that 'safeguards must be put in place to prevent the programme from being privatised' thereby guaranteeing that its implementation is funded entirely with public money.
Does this rejection mean that, following much-vaunted public investment, the unacceptable option of tendering the programme out to the private sector is already being considered?
Our position is clear.
We feel that the Galileo programme (European programme of satellite radionavigation) will be able to contribute towards cooperation, scientific and technical advancement and to foster the exchange of, and access to, information.
This is a project that should be based on a strategy of public investment and public control, so that a public service can be provided.
That way, there can be equal access and the free use of available information for all users.
It is a project in which the citizens' rights, guarantees and freedoms must be guaranteed.
It must also be ensured that it is not used for military purposes and/or as part of the trend towards an excessive preoccupation with security.
in writing. In order to conclude GALILEO, the European satellite navigation system, EU member states are asked to pay another â¬ 2 400 000 000.
For many years it has been argued that this project would bring technological innovation, satisfaction of consumers' needs, employment, and independence from the United States.
These assets could justify the spending of community funds, instead of leaving it solemnly to profit-orientated multinationals or the American war industry.
As long as GALILEO remains a peaceful process, we do not principally reject it.
Unfortunately, GALILEO will be developed 10 to 20 years too late, and in the meantime GPS, the American counterpart, has conquered the world market.
This makes GALILEO into a costly prestige project.
Spending a lot of community money on this, might sound attractive to big business, but voters and consumers will increasingly regard this as a scandalous waste of money.
European companies refuse to participate in Public Private Partnerships, because they do not expect any profit due to the arrears with GPS.
They do hope to receive a large community investment in 2012 for free.
Consequently, we do not want to spend even more money on GALILEO.
If there are no real perspectives, we should dare to stop.
in writing. (SV) EU Member States will be technologically dependent on current and future military superpowers, such as the United States, Russia and China, if we cannot develop our own satellite-based radio navigation.
Galileo is undoubtedly needed, but this expensive project should for the most part be funded by private actors with political support.
Paragraph 6 of the resolution states that, in the European Parliament's view, the Galileo programme should be funded entirely from the European Union budget.
I am not prepared to go so far and therefore choose to vote against the resolution as a whole.
in writing. - (FR) We support the Galileo project, even if we had a few reservations about supporting it.
We cannot, however, support this resolution.
It is deplorable that, after the predictable failure of the public-private partnership, this Parliament should be saying it is prepared to give up an independent GPS system if it ceases to be purely a Community project to include direct funding by Member States.
Galileo is useful!
By whatever means, it must be financed.
The Commission cannot find EUR 2.4 billion, from the hundreds of billions that it intends spending, not always usefully, by 2013?
Then what?
Why should the Member States be pushed aside?
Galileo is not a toy, nor is it the exclusive, symbolic project of Brussels' Europe that wants us to believe that it is not concerned only for itself, its competences and its sustainability.
Just for once, leave aside dogma.
Put into this industrial venture a quarter of the political willingness that a handful of Member States put, a few years ago, into building a European aeronautical and space industry, and prove what you refuse to admit: intergovernmental cooperation works.
In Brussels, on the other hand, it is at a standstill.
in writing. The clear intention of the resolution is for Galileo to be financed with a blank cheque from public funds to further EU political ambitions.
Collaborative technological projects have a dubious track record.
They do not require EU involvement and should only be undertaken for clear economic, strategic and industrial motives - not to further EU ambitions to be a global actor.
British Conservatives want opportunities for British industry and British R[amp]D, but this resolution does not guarantee that.
It supports the Commission's proposal to use public funds - through the EU budget - for the entire Galileo project.
This course of action will be another drain on taxpayers in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States, and one in which they have had absolutely no say.
Whereas, in the past, there was reluctance by the EU to admit military applications, this coyness has now been dropped.
In the Commission's Communication on European Space Policy (26 April 2007) the aim of meeting 'Europe's security and defence needs as regards space' is one of the key objectives.
As long-standing opponents of ESDP, the British Conservatives oppose proposals that extend the Commission's hand into the defence arena.
in writing. - (PT) All it took for us to decide to vote against this report was the first recital.
Community law on public procurement aims to open - liberalise would be a better word - public markets in the Member States to cross-border competition, in order to support the development of the internal market, in keeping with the liberalising agenda contained in the Lisbon Strategy.
We are of course in favour of national rules on the transparency of tendering, provided they do not block opportunities to use public markets to boost the economic fabric and national SMEs, bearing in mind their size and importance.
There is a substantial difference in this case, however, leading us to vote against, which is that responsibility for this issue should continue to rest with the Member States.
Public procurement is also an important instrument in promoting social and environmental policy, given that it may contain criteria relating to social and environmental issues involved in awarding contracts.
It cannot be restricted to supranational level, with rules on non-discrimination or on other economic interests used as a pretext.
in writing. We voted in favour of part one of paragraph 40 and against part 2 of paragraph 40.
Similarly, we voted in favour of the first part of paragraph 41 and against the second part.
We abstained on the vote for the resolution as a whole.
The reason for this is that we did not wish to indicate that we support any interpretation of the word 'rights' as indicating a support for abortion.
We do, of course, support the general thrust of the Millennium Goals and therefore did not vote against the resolution as a whole.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Kinnock report 'On the Millennium Development Goals - the midway point' because I feel that we need a broad partnership in order to be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
It is therefore desirable for the national parliaments and civil society in all the interested countries to become involved.
One of the key factors in achieving the Goals is that of a 50% reduction in poverty by 2015, with special focus on issues such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.
Gender inequality and discrimination against women are further points that must be taken into account in development programmes.
in writing. - (PT) I welcome the fact that the report acknowledges the seriousness of the world situation.
As the UN report on the Millennium Development Goals revealed, progress in the fight to reduce hunger has been too slow.
Indeed, the figures have worsened in recent years: 854 million people (17% of the world's population) per day suffer from hunger and almost 16 000 children die every day due to hunger-related causes.
Nevertheless, once again the report glosses over the causes at the root of this intolerable situation.
It is important to highlight the fact that, at the same time as 16 000 children die every day:
The US Administration has earmarked USD 600 billion for military spending in its budget;
The 691 richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to USD 2.2 billion, which is equal to the combined wealth of the 145 poorest countries;
The 500 richest people have a combined income higher than that of the 416 million poorest;
The 8 million richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to 80% of the GDP of all the countries in the world.
This is the root of the problem.
in writing. The rapporteur's approach to this highly important subject is to be commended.
There is urgent need for efforts to reach the MDGs to be redoubled.
This means wholesale debt relief and scaled-up, better coordinated and better targeted aid.
in writing. - (PT) In the space available in an explanation of vote, there are two points that deserve to be highlighted.
The first paragraph of the resolution says: 'the overarching aim of development cooperation is and must be the fight against poverty; stresses, however, that this fight is not limited to material growth and therefore, democracy-building and the promotion of basic human rights, rule of law and the principles of justice, equity, transparency and accountability must always be central themes of any such cooperation.'
I did not oppose this resolution because I understand that these concerns require us to contribute as much as we can, but I feel that the idea must be stressed that the fight against poverty cannot be effective unless the causes of poverty are combated.
Among the structural causes of poverty is always bad governance.
It is for this reason, and not out of a desire to impose some sort of model, that it is so important to fight on these two fronts at the same time.
Otherwise, we will be resolving a problem today only for it to come back tomorrow.
Lastly, the report tells us that 'Portugal, which is due to host the EU-Africa Summit during its Presidency, achieved only 0.21% ODA/GNI in 2006', which is terrible.
in writing. (PL) I was forced to vote against the report on 'MDGs at the Midway Point'.
Including proposals to fund abortion using EU budget aid will inevitably lead to divisions concerning the aid strategy for Africa.
This will undermine the effectiveness of our actions.
From both a moral and a medical point of view, abortion does not hold the key to solving the problem of maternal deaths during childbirth.
Using European Union resources to fund abortion in Africa is contrary to the principle of providing support.
It forces all European Union citizens to become indirectly implicated in this matter.
It also represents a kind of moral imperialism towards Africa.
The consistent support of this House for funding abortion in developing countries is the biggest mistake we have made in terms of shaping humanitarian aid policy.
in writing. The UKIP does not recognise the legitimacy of the ACP-EU JPA and therefore cannot support this amendment.
However, we agree with the spirit of the text and sincerely hope that the international community as a whole will ensure that the international travel bans on key figures in the Zimbabwean regime are fully respected.
in writing. The UKIP does not recognise the legitimacy of the ACP-EU JPA and therefore cannot support this amendment.
However, we agree with the spirit of the text and sincerely hope that the international community as a whole will ensure that the international travel bans on key figures in the Zimbabwean regime are fully respected.
in writing. The work of the ACP-EU JPA is vital when we consider the large number of least developed countries within that grouping and the volume of development assistance the EU targets at the ACP countries.
I support many of the demands made in the report, such as those calling for national parliaments and civil society to become more involved in the process of national aid programming in the ACP.
in writing. - (PT) The report clearly reveals how the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly - both in 2006 and before - is an excellent instrument for creating the crucial structures, relationships and dialogue necessary for the creation of sound foundations for good relations between both sides and for the development of genuinely useful projects.
That being said, although it should be noted that whilst progress so far has been laudable, our concerns should be based on what lies ahead.
We have an obligation - one that is, on the one hand, both moral and ethical and, on the other, in our own interests - to support development in associated countries, to help them develop mechanisms to open up their economies and together to turn globalisation into a virtuous movement; it is up to us to circumvent, reduce and remove the potential pitfalls involved in this movement.
Against this backdrop, in relation to some of these partners, it is vital that the forthcoming EU-Africa summit, set to take place during the Portuguese Presidency, yields results.
Realism with results is preferable to utopian ideals without history.

Towards an arms trade treaty (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements - Towards an arms trade treaty.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, illicit arms trading and the irresponsible export-control policies of some states are fuelling conflicts worldwide, undermining respect for human rights and encouraging crime and terrorism.
Moreover, they are hampering the sustainable economic development of entire regions.
It is against this backdrop that the idea of enshrining binding principles for arms dealing in an international agreement was conceived a few years ago.
The concept of an arms-trade treaty was born.
The Member States of the European Union campaigned for such an agreement from the outset, and the current Presidency of the Council also attaches great importance to this process.
At a meeting on 18 June the General Affairs and External Relations Council re-emphasised the importance of an arms-trade treaty.
I was very pleased that Mr Romeva i Rueda, the European Parliament's rapporteur on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, accepted the invitation to attend the informal seminar for the members of the Conventional Arms Exports Working Party COARM Group in Berlin at the beginning of January, where he explained in detail the views of the European Parliament on a global arms-trade treaty.
The Presidency shares Mr Romeva's view that such a treaty would serve the extremely important purpose of subjecting the global arms trade to legally binding and responsible rules.
An important step was taken with the adoption of resolution 61/89 by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 6 December 2006.
The resolution asks the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States of the United Nations and to appoint a group of experts by 2008.
It will be the task of that group to assess the feasibility, scope and draft parameters of such a treaty.
In the lead-up to the session of the General Assembly, numerous Member States of the EU were involved in the drafting of the resolution and in canvassing other states to approve it.
About 80 states, including all Member States of the EU, have so far answered the UN Secretary-General's call.
In a separate EU opinion submitted to the Secretary-General, the Presidency of the Council cited the EU Code of Conduct as a good example of international cooperation in the control of arms exports and made the case for an arms-trade treaty.
Together with other EU Member States, the Presidency also continues to press for the submission of country papers.
A large number of favourable opinions will be of paramount importance in demonstrating the strong worldwide support that exists for the project.
The success of such a treaty will be crucially dependent on whether it binds not only all the major arms exporters but also the countries that import arms.
The United Nations is therefore the right forum for these negotiations.
Let me cite two examples of issues to which the group of experts must devote particular attention in order to pave the way for an effective treaty.
First of all, the scope of the treaty must be spelled out in detail.
To this end a separate checklist will be necessary.
This must not be confined to the categories used in the UN arms register but must also apply to materiel such as small and light arms, ammunition and man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS).
Manufacturing equipment and technology should also be included in an appropriate form.
Secondly, the treaty must contain a comprehensive catalogue of criteria to be applied when decisions are taken on arms exports.
Among these criteria are compliance with arms embargos, respect for human rights in the country of destination, preservation of regional stability, prevention of internal or regional conflicts, promotion of sustainable development and prevention of any undesirable redirection of the goods.
Numerous regional organisations around the world have already been examining these issues.
The European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is the most fully developed international instrument for the control of arms exports.
Thanks to its experience with the Code of Conduct, the European Union can make a special contribution to the discussion of these issues.
At the same time, however, it must avoid creating the impression that it seeks to impose the EU Code of Conduct on other Members of the United Nations.
The fact is that support for this project in all parts of the world is remarkably strong at the present time.
Nevertheless, an important role in this process devolves on the European Union, to which several major exporting nations belong.
Let me also pay particular tribute to the role of civil society, for non-governmental organisations, scientists and scholars and the media have played a significant part in persuading hesitant governments of the need for an arms-trade treaty.
From the very start they have made valuable suggestions and contributions, and I urge non-governmental organisations to maintain their active involvement in this process.
The Presidency is pleased to note that the European Parliament has expressed itself on various occasions in favour of the conclusion of a global arms-trade treaty and that it is using its interparliamentary contacts for that purpose.
I read the latest draft resolution with great interest and warmly welcome the persuasive proposals it contains.
I very much hope that we can continue and intensify our vigorous dialogue with the European Parliament on this important issue too.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would just like to add a few words to those of the President-in-Office of the Council.
Over the last few years, the fight against the illicit spread of weapons has been the focus of much political and public attention and the issue remains of great importance to all of us.
Let me commend the honourable Members on the leadership they are showing on the legally binding arms trade treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional arms.
It is an ambitious approach proposing common international standards.
I understand your motion for a resolution has already been submitted.
The Commission also welcomes the Council conclusions of two days ago; I need not go into those in detail, because they have already been mentioned.
We all recognise the negative impact of irresponsible exports of military equipment on regional security, economic development and human safety in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world.
An arms trade treaty would be of great value, for instance in reducing the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons.
These weapons result in considerable human misery and, in making the world less safe, they affect our own security and prosperity.
The illicit trade in conventional weapons also has global consequences, which means we must enhance the coherence between EU security policy and Community development assistance.
Development and security are linked more closely than ever, and the threat these illicit weapons present goes beyond the immediate violence they cause.
In this globalised world of ours, lost GDP and reduced foreign investment, for instance, represent failed opportunities few countries can afford.
Even with an arms trade treaty, countless illicit weapons would remain in circulation around the world.
In addition to the Union's strong political engagement, we are therefore providing practical support for legislative and administrative capacity-building, giving the EU a significant role in the fight against the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons.
We are fully engaged in the implementation of the 2005 EU strategy against the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons.
This area, as you know, is not new to us.
The Commission has been fully involved in it for many years and has also gained experience working with international organisations, academia, NGOs and civil society in dealing with the consequences of inappropriate or illegal arms sales.
Much remains to be done, both through the treaty and outside it.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) In recent years, there has been little cheer for those in favour of arms control and disarmament rooted in multilateral legal instruments.
Last December's decision by the UN General Assembly officially to launch the process of drawing up a global arms trade Treaty (ATT) gives rare cause for celebration.
Although it came as no surprise, the solitary vote against the resolution that launched the process, by the United States, was sad.
The Treaty is aimed at finding a common legal denominator for the import, export and transfer of arms, at offering a global response to a completely globalised trade and at creating uniform criteria that make the arms trade subject to the imperatives of human rights, stability and sustainable development.
It is also intended to mobilise public opinion in developed countries against the opacity that characterises the millionaire legal contracts governing arms sales to allied countries.
The United Kingdom's scandalous decision to block the latest investigation into the country's arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and into the accompanying high-level corruption, is a perfect example of the true nature of the arms trade.
Only in this field would a European government dare to block a serious investigation in the national interest.
It is because of special treatment that governments the world over have taken special measures to control the arms trade.
The EU can and must take the lead in this area.
It must fight for the lessons learnt from the interpretation and implementation of its code of conduct - in particular as regards the criteria of sustainable development and human rights - to be applied to the new Treaty, because these two aspects are especially pertinent, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner pointed out.
In this regard, I welcome the conclusions of the last 'General Affairs Council', which highlighted the importance of joining forces with other countries and regional organisations to draw up a new Treaty.
All that remains is for the EU to transform this good will into a diplomatic strategy, properly rooted in a Council common position, in relation to the ATT.
While reason and scruples are not around to dignify the White House with their presence, European leadership in this area is particularly urgently needed.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is truly shameful that, despite the perils brought to humanity by the numerous irresponsible arms transfers carried out for so many years, we still do not have a legally binding UN treaty on international arms trade.
However, even if we had, I doubt if we would have had the means, or that those who matter would have had the will, to closely monitor and implement it properly, but we should concern ourselves with this once we have a UN Treaty in place.
Today, the most unscrupulous and murderous worldwide may easily possess arms.
With enough money and the right connections, anything may be purchased, from a hand gun to a jet fighter plane.
It is probably only a matter of time before even nuclear weapons may be purchased on the open market.
Why, you may ask, should there be such a despicable state of affairs in our 21st century society?
The answer is quite simple: there will always be deranged individuals in this world who want to inflict their pathologically criminal plans on others and, similarly, there will always be evil traders who supply the means for death and destruction to anybody, as long as they are able to make a handsome profit.
I must be mentioned here that the arms industry's highly lucrative enterprises continuously produce more advanced killing machines in greater numbers and at an ever-increasing pace.
I know that we cannot change the world overnight and the forces of evil will always have their share of determining the fate of our fellow human beings.
However, one must at least try to make a start to change things to some extent.
In this way, I support this motion for a resolution which calls for the establishment of common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons.
After all, it is better than nothing, and let us hope that one day human beings will have enough common sense to realise that there is no need to produce weapons at all.
In conclusion, I find it noteworthy to mention that, of the 17 leading arms exporters, more than half are EU Member States.
Let this statistic be food for thought for all of us.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, this House has spoken out in favour of an international treaty on the transfer of weapons on many previous occasions.
What makes this debate and the resolution that we have presented special, however, is that the United Nations are now getting to work.
A resolution that was approved in December 2006 with the support of 153 countries has been the departure point for our debate today.
It is right that we should remember that 153 countries signed it, because that gives the process genuine legitimacy.
Within this context, we must stress certain points of the resolution that we are presenting today.
Firstly, the 153 countries are being asked to forward their reports to the Secretary-General of the United Nations indicating what they believe the treaty should contain, its scope and, in particular, their opinion with regard to its viability.
Secondly, those reports should be based on current international legislation, particularly with regard to international humanitarian law and human rights in general.
There are important existing treaties that must be taken into account.
Thirdly, the governments of the States must commit themselves to carrying out a thorough study of the degree of compliance and, above all, of non-compliance with the current rules, international embargos and, in the case of Europe, strict application of the Code of Conduct on arms exports.
One of the cases that deserves to be highlighted in particular is that of arms exports to Sudan, an issue that we will discuss specifically during the July part-session.
Fourthly, the governments must also pay attention and give every possible support to the setting up of a group of experts that will have to be created in 2008 with a view to defining the content of the treaty.
Finally, we must be aware that, although the process of drawing up an international treaty on the transfer of weapons is already under way, it will be a slow process, and in the mean time arms sales in the world are still increasing.
According to the SIP, in 2005, sales, around a third of which come from the European Union, rose to USD 290 000 million.
In the mean time, therefore, we must be particularly rigorous and demanding with regard to the existing control mechanisms and pay particular attention to the control of intermediaries, compliance with embargos and increasing the transparency and parliamentary control of those exports.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I warmly welcome the fact that we have this joint motion for a resolution on an international arms-trade treaty, because time is running out, as arms expenditure and arms exports spiral throughout the world.
According to the study conducted by SIPRI, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the equivalent of EUR 900 billion was devoted to military spending last year, which represents EUR 137 for every man, woman and child on the planet.
That was three and a half per cent more than in 2005.
Over the past ten years, global arms expenditure has increased by 37%.
As for the international arms trade, in its new Yearbook of Armaments, Disarmament and International Security, SIPRI reports a 50% increase in the volume of trade since 2002.
Once again, the United States and Russia have been far and away the top arms exporters.
Germany, with USD 9.2 billion - EUR 6.9 billion - between 2002 and 2006, has pushed past France into third place.
Member States of the EU are up there among the global leaders when it comes to arms exports.
Last year alone, Germany's arms exports were worth USD 3.9 billion, more than double the 2005 amount of USD 1.5 billion.
France has armed Sudan, and Belgium is supplying weapons to the autocrat Joseph Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, partly so that he can massacre the opposition.
Once a conflict has been fuelled, along comes the EU with its military missions in Africa - in the Congo, Sudan and so on. The fire-fighters are dousing the flames with petrol.
It is high time the EU and its Member States put a stop to these deals.
Arms exports are violating human rights all over the world.
Arms exports are killing people all over the world.
Let us finally put an end to this traffic in death.
(LT) Mr President, the European Union, which always speaks for conflict resolution by negotiation rather than by force, is interested in muzzling the unrestricted growth of business in trading instruments of death.
Last year, as has been mentioned, EUR 900 billion was spent for military purposes.
This is EUR 137 per capita for the total population of the world.
On the basis of military spending, we are back in the Cold War.
Almost half of this enormous sum is made up by the United States' expenditure on military armaments.
The scope of spending on weaponry is growing dangerously, having reached almost EUR 40 billion last year.
The largest exporters in recent years have been the United States and Russia, each one accounting for 30% of the global arms trade, with the EU not far behind at 20%.
The greatest concern is caused by the flow of ultra-modern weapons to conflict-torn regions in unpredictable countries.
Last year 153 countries supported a United Nations resolution on a process to create a treaty on Trade in Arms.
For the moment it is difficult for all countries to agree on a legally binding document that would provide for the international regulation of imports and exports of weapons; however, steps in that direction in the United Nations are essential.
At the same time, it must be stressed that individual countries are the first-line combatants against irresponsible arms trading and the damage it wreaks on peace, security, development and human rights.
The international community, and likewise the public of any country that uses arms trade for dealings in dangerous and corrupt ventures, has a duty to bring appropriate pressure on such governments and parliaments.
(NL) Mr President, every year, approximately one million people are wounded by hand-guns, machine guns or grenade launchers.
The extent of firearm violence globally is enormous, as is the human suffering.
In recent armed conflicts, small lightweight firearms are often the only weapons that are used.
In southern Africa alone, some 30 million light firearms are in circulation; in the Middle East, estimates range from 60 to 110 million.
The majority of these weapons are produced and sold legally.
For dozens of years, international Treaties have been in place to control biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and their spread, but despite the enormous number of fatalities, this is not yet the case for the sale of and trade in conventional weapons.
This results in human rights violations, long-term wars and countries that are becoming more impoverished.
The large majority of these weapons are produced by five rich countries.
In 2005 Russia, the US, France, Germany and Great Britain jointly accounted for 81% of the worldwide arms trade.
More than two thirds of these weapons are intended for Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
Not only human lives are being destroyed, also economies, infrastructure, health care and education.
In Northern Uganda alone, 2 500 children have not attended school during the last 20 years of armed violence.
The UN resolution of 6 December 2006 sets the scene for a treaty against this free circulation and in favour of control of the trade as a whole.
This is, of course, of the utmost importance if we want to curb conventional weapons.
I would therefore urge the Council - and I gather from the acting Chairman, Mr Gloser, that something is being done - to get a massive, rapid and positive response from Europe and, for our part, to tackle the serious shortcomings in the application of the European code of conduct from 1998.
EU weapons still wheedle their way into countries such as Sudan, China and Sierra Leone.
It is high time we made this code legally binding, as this would give the UN process an enormous shot in the arm.
Mr President, last year I spent two weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo on behalf of this Parliament.
Four million people died in their civil war and, of course, an international arms embargo on that country failed to prevent arms from all over the world - including from Germany and France, for which there is clear evidence - getting into that country and contributing to the strife that took place.
There cannot be a more graphic example of why the international community needs to do more to enforce its will and its values in this area.
As we say in our resolution, we want to see a comprehensive, rigorous and fully implemented arms trade treaty.
The European Union can play a pivotal role in the international community to make sure that the text achieves just that.
I am very proud that the European Parliament text put before us today refers to the arms trade causing 'unacceptable human suffering and exacerbating conflict, instability and terrorism'.
I thank Mr Gloser, the German Presidency and the Council for taking a similarly tough line in their resolution and speaking of 'an undesirable and irresponsible proliferation of conventional arms'.
Let us carry those words through so that we really can influence what is happening in the United Nations.
The next stage must be to engage civil society.
I think we are in our present position as a result of those NGO campaigns of the mid-1990s that were finally successful in working with us to get the EU Code of Conduct.
I am very proud that experts at the Lauterpacht Centre at Cambridge University in my own constituency drew up the first draft of this treaty to be put forward to the international community.
I appeal to parliamentarians to sign the declaration in favour of the Treaty on the controlarms.org website.
Our work with civil society to engage the people of this world for a strong treaty is essential.
Finally, I am very proud that my own country, the UK, together with Finland, proposed this in the United Nations and that every single EU Member State has submitted its willing support to the UN.
We should be proud of Europe too.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for your contributions and suggestions but also for the initiatives you have taken on this very important matter as well as for the warnings that were sounded by some speakers.
Let me just respond to two points.
Firstly, unless human rights and international humanitarian law are being respected in the recipient country, arms exports can never be licensed.
I have stressed that we are engaged worldwide at various levels in promoting respect for human rights.
That is another matter which has often been on the agenda of this Parliament.
The right to life, the prohibition of slavery, political and social participatory rights, equality before the law, freedom of speech and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination continue to be flouted in too many countries of this world.
It is therefore our duty to ensure that these violations of fundamental values are not fostered by the supply of armaments.
Secondly, there is the issue of embargos.
The United Nations Security Council, the OECD and the European Union have imposed embargos on a number of countries, and the present draft resolution of the European Parliament places special emphasis on the need to uphold the embargo against Sudan.
It is absolutely essential that observance of embargos be made one of the key criteria for export licensing in an arms-trade treaty.
It is no coincidence that this criteria is listed at the very start of the catalogue of criteria in the EU Code of Conduct.
I can assure you that we shall continue to make every effort during our presidency to secure an effective arms-trade treaty.
The key role that the European Parliament is playing in this discussion has also been a great source of help and support.
I hope we shall be able to maintain this cooperative approach throughout the subsequent presidencies.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I thank Parliament for its support, for its initiative and for its motion for a resolution.
As I mentioned before, the Commission, as part of wider EU efforts, strongly supports the opening of negotiations on a legally binding arms trade treaty, within the UN framework - this is important to highlight.
An international instrument promoting high standards of responsibility is clearly desirable and, for this enterprise to be successful, we need to build the broadest possible consensus and encourage all states to support this initiative.
We would wish it to be a legally binding, separate and self-standing initiative that would cover all conventional arms transfers, set out the principles defining illegal transfers, include monitoring and be broadly based.
We know that it will not be easy to persuade all suppliers worldwide, and it will therefore be very important for all the major arms producers to avoid having a situation such as we had with the ICC or with the mine ban treaty.
We will, therefore, seek the broadest possible consensus.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 21 June 2007.
MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control (debate)
The next item is the report by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are many reasons at present which make the report we are debating today highly important and topical.
The poor results of the Euro-Mediterranean process and, at the same time, the huge challenges in this area are forcing us to take serious stock and adopt serious policies and financial commitments.
The tragic situation in the Palestinian territories is getting worse and developments are sounding the alarm for a deterioration in the situation and calling on us to take stock of our actions and become aware of our responsibilities for the future.
We also have to give convincing answers to the concerns of European citizens about the management of resources in areas which are lagging behind in democratic commitments and management and evaluation mechanisms.
I should like to remind the House that the MEDA programme is our principal financial instrument for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership supporting measures for the political chapter and the economic chapter, in the aim of creating a free trade zone, and for the cultural and social chapter which forms the third pillar.
MEDA II, which is the most recent MEDA programme we have applied, was scheduled to provide the sum of EUR 5.3 billion from 2000 to 2006.
The MEDA regulation came to an end in 2006 and today we have a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument which entered into effect in 2007 and we believe that our experience from MEDA will be very useful for the new instrument.
I should like to remind the House that annual commitments under MEDA ÎÎ, to which most of our report is devoted, varied between EUR 569 million in 2000 and EUR 697 million in 2004.
In other words, there was a steady increase, although we need to bear in mind that between MEDA Î and MEDA ÎÎ our commitments increased for Palestine, Syria, Algeria and Morocco and for the regional activities, but decreased for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia.
Similarly, increases varied according to implementation sector.
There was a marked increase in funding for actions which include education, training and economic institutional support, while less funds were committed for other sectors, such as agriculture, local development and private reforms under MEDA IÎ than under MEDA Î.
In light of our experience in the European Parliament and the information received and the report by the Court of Auditors, the Commission's management of the MEDA programme has clearly improved since the early years and we can say that, given the political circumstances that play their role in the area, the evaluation is satisfactory and a great deal of effort was made, gradually resulting in an even allocation of resources, with shorter preparation times and faster disbursement.
We might urge the European Commission to take account in future activities of the fact that there is a steady increase in the number of projects and programmes, that there is an even larger share of budget support in the total programme, that the role played by our offices and the apportionment of responsibilities at local level has been judged satisfactory and important and must be increased and that cooperation with the local authorities played a role and we must enhance this.
We must also do whatever we can to enhance cooperation between the Mediterranean countries (South-South partners) in order to achieve the much sought-after objective of regional cooperation and integration.
As far as the funding sectors are concerned, we take the view that the economic aspect of the partnership must be directed towards social cohesion and sustainable economic development, not forgetting that overall monitoring and enhanced action in all sectors are needed if we are to achieve our objectives.
The question of funding for Palestine is an important part of our report and was the subject of increased interest on the part of our honourable friends.
From 1994 to 2006 the Commission provided about EUR 2 300 million to the Palestinian people.
Payments to Palestinian areas have been quite stable at between EUR 232 and 260 million from 2002 to 2005.
In 2006 alone, EUR 700 million was provided, which is our record so far.
As we know from the decision by the Quartet on 9 May 2006, we have the temporary international mechanism and the European Commission used this mechanism to deliver the sum of EUR 107.5 million to its three windows, one for emergencies, one for infrastructure and one for payments to the poorest, vulnerable social groups.
Our committee has considered our relations with the Palestinian Authority and the best way of addressing requirements, both for political and economic aid to the Palestinian Authority per se and for channelling humanitarian aid and, in order to update the report, I have proposed two oral amendments, one to paragraph 38, which is now out of date and can be deleted or radically amended and one new paragraph referring to the Council decisions both on support for the new government and on the commitment through the international mechanism to take the action needed for humanitarian aid to Gaza.
I wish to state that our political group supports our undertaking and I believe that I also have the support of the rest of the House on this new paragraph.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur.
We have analysed the recommendations and largely agree with Parliament's assessment of the MEDA programme and, of course, with its conclusions.
The report concludes that the support provided by the MEDA programme served its intended purpose and rendered an important contribution to the achievement of the MEDA objectives.
It also recognises that the aid was consistent with the development plans and needs of the recipient countries.
I want to be quite emphatic about that, because I still recall certain discussions.
The Council acknowledges the Commission's efforts, which have led to perceptible improvements in the speed and efficiency of planning within the MEDA II framework.
The MEDA programme has now been completed, and the first of January 2007 marked the switch to the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
The ENPI is a tailor-made instrument for the implementation of the European neighbourhood policy.
The European Parliament has called for the development of cooperation among Europe's partner countries in the Mediterranean region, and this is being done through the ENPI Southern regional programme, to which EUR 343.3 million is being allocated by 2010.
We share your view that the continued pursuit of the Barcelona process is of vital importance to the whole region.
The fact that we have managed, in spite of the tensions in the region, to address substantive issues and make further progress together shows that the Barcelona process, our Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, is still the right framework for the pursuit of change in the Mediterranean region.
The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly makes an important contribution to closer North-South relations through its interparliamentary dialogue.
All of us, whether in civil society, government or parliament and in spite of our diverse structures and responsibilities, have the aim of nurturing our partnership with the Mediterranean region and the will to work together to that end.
Let me now move on to the part of the report that deals with financial assistance for the Palestinians.
Before discussing the report, however, I would like to mention that we have been following the latest developments in the Palestinian territories, and especially in the Gaza Strip, with deep concern.
The violent clashes between Fatah and the radical Islamist movement Hamas in the past week have claimed more than 100 lives and left many people with serious injuries.
The Hamas militias have effectively taken control of the territory, using brute force against the legitimate national security forces, civilians and aid workers.
In this situation, President Mahmoud Abbas has been compelled to dissolve the Unity Government, declare a state of emergency and appoint an emergency government.
The deal that was struck between the Palestinian factions with Saudi Arabian help in Mecca in February has thus collapsed, and the involvement of Hamas in the government of the country has been ended.
The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, which was difficult enough before, has further deteriorated.
The hospitals are completely overcrowded and are short of medical supplies.
The vast majority of the population of Gaza are dependent on food aid.
Aid organisations have had to suspend some of their activities because they fear for the safety of their staff - and rightly so, I am sorry to say, as was shown by the deaths of two UNRWA workers caught in crossfire during gun battles.
At Monday's meeting of the General Affairs Council, the Foreign Ministers of the European Union called for an immediate end to the violence and assured President Abbas of their full support for his decisions.
They decided to resume normal relations immediately with the new government under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and declared their intention to create conditions in which the provision of direct financial and practical assistance could also be resumed.
The Foreign Ministers also reaffirmed that they did not wish to leave the people of the Gaza Strip without humanitarian assistance in their present distress.
Other conclusions that may have to be drawn in the light of the new situation are currently being discussed.
The introduction by the European Union of the temporary international funding mechanism TIM in June 2006 has played a significant part in meeting the most urgent needs of the beleaguered Palestinian population.
The structure of TIM is transparent, and the mechanism has proved to be a flexible and effective instrument.
Last year alone, the European Commission and the Member States provided more than 300 million euros' worth of direct aid to the Palestinian population through TIM and are continuing to make their payments in the present situation, in which these funds have become even more crucial.
This needs to be underlined and emphasised time and again, because a different picture is occasionally painted, even in the media.
For this reason we also welcome the decision of the Middle East Quartet to extend the TIM mandate for another three months until the end of September.
In your report you rightly call on Israel to release the tax and customs revenue it has been withholding from the Palestinians.
The European Union has also made repeated calls to this effect, most recently in the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council at its meeting on 18 June.
The Israeli Government has announced - as you know, we had talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni - that it is now ready to release the funds.
We very much hope that this will give the Palestinian economy a desperately needed boost too.
This is another area in which the prospect of a political solution depends on a perceptible improvement.
The European Union is already active in another area to which you referred, namely the essential reform of public finances, including financial control and auditing.
The Commission is assisting the Palestinian Ministry of Finance in the ongoing development of transparent structures for the Palestinian budget.
The aim of the European Union is, and will remain, two states - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in peace with each other and with their neighbours in the region.
We want to help in the long-term creation of better living conditions for the Palestinians instead of engaging in crisis management.
The last few weeks have made it crystal-clear why this is an urgent necessity.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her excellent report.
It comes at a key moment as it concerns cooperation with the southern Mediterranean area, whilst the strengthened Neighbourhood Policy is also being implemented.
I shall speak first about the main findings before turning to the current situation in the Palestinian Territories and our response to that.
Firstly, with regard to the performance of MEDA over the last 10 years, I am pleased about Parliament's positive appreciation of how this programme has contributed to realising the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration.
Further progress can and should still be achieved, but I share Parliament's view that the Barcelona Process remains the most appropriate framework for the Mediterranean policy.
This process is now supported by the Neighbourhood Policy which will help to develop bilateral relations and put into practice many of the aspirations of the Barcelona agenda.
In terms of effectiveness and thoroughness, the findings of Parliament and those of the Court of Auditors encourage the Commission to continue further improving its performance.
It is clear that we will also take into account the different suggestions from the two institutions.
I undertake to continue the efforts of the Commission in this regard, and we have already launched a final evaluation of the MEDA Regulation.
The results should be available in early 2008.
All our efforts need to be seen in the context of the ongoing and progressive management improvements which have been introduced by the Commission since 2001.
I entirely share Parliament's view on the issues of fostering greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development.
Equally, I share your willingness to pursue the objectives of the Barcelona Process as identified in the report.
We have taken numerous initiatives in this regard through thematic support, for instance in the areas of good governance, democracy and gender.
Lastly, as regards visibility, I have made a great personal priority of visibility, on which we are making progress.
Your report, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, clearly analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the MEDA programme.
It acknowledges the improvements that have been achieved, but also points out where it is still necessary to make further progress.
The new ENPI regulation, in force since the beginning of this year, offers enormous new opportunities.
Therefore, we are looking forward to continued dialogue and your constructive support.
Turning to the current situation in the Palestinian Territories, we are more than ever at a critical juncture.
We are following the situation day to day, even hour to hour, and for the moment we are addressing the urgent needs and will probably have to continue doing so.
As our Council President said at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday, we had a long and intensive discussion on the Middle East.
There was broad agreement on the need to support President Abbas and his new government led by Prime Minister Fayyad.
This has also been the line taken by the Quartet.
It has already been said that the EU will resume normal relations with this government immediately.
At the same time, we cannot abandon the humanitarian needs of the population in Gaza, and we will never let the Palestinian population down.
With regard to assistance, there was a strong wish to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial support.
That includes: extending the emergency relief under the Temporary International Mechanism for another three months, this time with the complete cooperation of Salam Fayyad; continuing humanitarian assistance, including to Gaza; exploring options to relaunch direct financial support, including the building of institutions; supporting the Palestinian civilian police through the resumption of the EUPOL COPPS; and hopefully resuming the EU Border Assistance Mission, EU BAM Rafah.
I made it clear to the Council and to Prime Minister Fayyad that resuming direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority implies certain technical conditions - that means controlling conditions - in terms of audit control and verification.
I can tell you that we are already in touch with Prime Minister Fayyad and his staff on how this can be achieved.
Indeed, a meeting took place yesterday with my head of delegation and the Prime Minister.
As a first step, we intend to pay EUR 22 million directly from a reserve to help towards clearing the arrears of the Palestinian Authority, particularly to the private sector so that it sees there is some movement.
The TIM will also continue for the moment to channel funds vital for the Palestinians in both an accountable and transparent way.
It will operate, as I say, in support of the Fayyad Government as of now.
In this regard, let me thank you and welcome the political agreement on the extra EUR 90 million for the TIM.
I also hope that the procedures for adoption can be accelerated.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, the most important thing is that the withheld Palestinian funds, for which we have called so often on the Israelis to release, will hopefully finally be sent to the government of Mahmoud Abbas.
Finally, let me take this occasion to thank Parliament once again for its support, which has been, and will continue to be, essential.
Under the TIM, a European initiative, we have provided high levels of support reaching more than one million Palestinians - medicines, hospital supplies, fuel for essential public services, allowances both for the poor and the public sector.
That would not have been possible without your support, and now for the future we also need your support for all the items I have just mentioned.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, this excellent report by Mrs Kratsa, whom I thank for her work, contains two important statements.
Firstly, the aid given to Palestine since 2003 has been well managed and without fraud.
That is an essential element, which will silence the persistent and groundless rumours about corruption in the executive team.
Secondly, the temporary aid mechanism put in place after the sanctions in 2006 against the Hamas government has not, alas, despite the sums invested, succeeded in preventing a humanitarian tragedy with an increase in infant mortality, the appearance of new diseases and extreme poverty in the occupied territories.
Having said that, since the emergency government was set up and the National Unity Government was dissolved, aid seems miraculously to have been reestablished and even the taxes withheld by the Israelis could be paid back to the new government.
I am delighted.
While the country, however, plunged in civil war, is divided in two, this spectacular turnaround demands that we look at things differently.
The European Union has been responsible for its policy in the Middle East since January 2006.
This policy is aimed at isolating Hamas and depriving it of its electoral victory.
It has ignored the advances of its political platform, on which the National Unity Government was built; it has refused to condemn Israel for taking and imprisoning 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament.
Today, the extremists have won and a no-go area has been established in the region. Any faith in justice and democracy is dead for Palestinians and the image of the European Union tarnished for a long time.
No, of course, we do not support today the activities of Hamas.
We condemn them.
When chaos takes over, however, when civil war breaks out, it is the time of bloodshed and outrage and I would say that we have contributed to bringing about this chaos.
Months ago the European Parliament raised cries of alarm that the NGOs were calling for help.
Even the UN is no longer silent. Read the do Santos report.
We are accountable for this disaster in the eyes of international opinion, and if the United States has had the courage of a Baker-Hamilton Commission to examine their policy in Iraq, I am asking today for the setting up of a Parliamentary commission to assess our European policy in the Middle East and its consequences today.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, may I express our sincere thanks to the rapporteur.
It is rather a pity for your report that it is now entirely overshadowed by a single issue, namely whether or not it is reasonable to keep putting money into this difficult region now that the whole focus is on Palestine.
I would like to thank you for your sterling work, because we believe that we still have far more to learn from past experiences for our future programmes.
Commissioner, one of my requests would be that we do not let major disruptions occur in our programmes in future.
The EU specialises in complete makeovers after seven years.
I believe the budgetary controllers could achieve far more progress in the long term if we could rely on greater continuity in our programmes.
We can see today that our rapporteur's report was overtaken by events several times.
She took a lot of trouble with this difficult issue, particularly as regards Palestine, with visits to the region and an investigative report by OLAF as well as hours of discussion on what is surely the most troublesome area of the world.
For the third time, we are confronted by the question whether it is reasonable to put EU money into that area.
In spite of the reservations of many of my fellow members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, we decided in committee that it was reasonable, chiefly on humanitarian grounds, because we were aware of the good that had been done locally with this money, and we knew that the funds would be sorely missed if they were no longer available.
Two days ago the Council also answered this question once again.
We would like to issue a reminder that, as the budgetary legislator and the discharging authority, the European Parliament is sitting in the same boat.
We do want to support the lawful Palestinian Government, and we naturally have no wish to turn our backs on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but precisely because a civil war is taking place there, the European Commission has a special duty of accountability to us and must come to terms with its obligation to give us this account of its stewardship, particularly in view of the fact that budgetary aid is the riskiest form of support.
I was pleased to hear Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's assurances that EU funds would be increasingly linked to successful reform policies in that part of the world too, for there is one thing we find inexcusable: for humanitarian and political as well as economic reasons, we cannot tolerate our assistance being systematically undone time and again.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, Mrs De Keyser, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on the European Court of Auditors' report on MEDA, the European programme on the countries of the Southern Mediterranean. The report before us focuses in particular on Community aid granted to Palestine.
The Court of Auditors' report did not cover aid to Palestine.
The only European institution to have carried out a thorough analysis of this financial mechanism, the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), has refused to reveal its report.
The members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have not been shown the report, not even confidentially.
That being the case, we cannot make any guarantees on the proper use of Community funds in the country.
Politically, however, we are faced with a serious dilemma; on the one hand, to provide development cooperation and humanitarian aid to people who are victims of leaders who have little or no regard for their well-being, and, on the other, to ensure that Community funds are not diverted for the purpose of purchasing arms, terrorism, propaganda, indoctrinating children in particular, racism, xenophobia and hate, and suicide bombings, as has come to light in the case of funds granted to Lebanon.
This is a question of the highest importance that requires a robust political response, based on the humanitarian conviction that all human beings are entitled to life, regardless of the religion or ethnicity to which they or their forebears belong; that is to say, a policy that is able to stand up to demagogy and hypocrisy.
I therefore wish to applaud most warmly this morning's gesture by the Israeli authorities to grant free passage to the West Bank to hundreds of Palestinian refugees who spent several days blocked in the Eretz tunnels, having escaped from the wave of terror sweeping Gaza.
I should also like to make a sincere, fraternal call to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to make as much effort as possible to work together with international forces and with the new Palestinian Government appointed by President Abbas to rescue the Palestinians escaping persecution in Gaza, which has already cost the lives of many Gaza inhabitants.
I hope we can count, as on many occasions before, on the collaboration of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) to help alleviate the suffering in Gaza, provided this does not stop ECHO from carrying out no less urgent humanitarian actions to help Iraqi refugees not only in Syria and Jordan but also in Egypt, Lebanon and various Gulf countries.
Palestine is at the moment being targeted by a fanatical ideology that uses religion to conceal its greed for power and that is currently laying waste to Lebanon and Iraq.
Anyone who still refuses to grasp this reality will once again have to face facts that it was impossible to predict.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her report.
The section on MEDA in particular has been very well formulated and highlights all the steps that will have to be taken.
Congratulations on a truly solid piece of work!
In the light of events and since time is short, I intend to confine myself to TIM, the aid fund for the Palestinians.
The draft report shows clearly that the Commissioner has pulled off a real master stroke here.
I congratulate you on that, Commissioner, because the EU had been compelled to call a complete halt to its aid payments to the Palestinian Authority.
We had no option.
We cannot assist terrorists.
We never have done in the past, and we never should.
There is always a duty to act, however, when individual suffering occurs.
With TIM the European Union has found a solution that meets the high moral standards applied by Europeans to the payment of aid.
In these circumstances, I believe that, while criticism of minor accounting errors and inaccuracies should be noted, it certainly must not be made the focus of this debate.
After all, we are dealing here with a project that was put together somewhat hastily.
We all know that we were subject to certain constraints.
I do not agree with the critical undertone regarding the Israeli strategy of suspending the release of tax revenue.
We cannot blame the Israelis for not having run after the terrorists with the money, and for that reason we should let the matter rest.
Besides, subsequent events have shown that it was right to keep back the money as security, since it can now doubly benefit President Abbas and the forces of moderation.
In this context I must also commend Israel's decision to open the Erez border crossing on humanitarian grounds, thereby directly helping the Palestinians who were fleeing from Hamas.
In conclusion, let me express my gratitude to the aid workers on the ground, for aid has to be delivered to the local people.
The European Parliament is grateful for the humanitarian mission they are accomplishing.
Theirs is no easy task. Our sincere thanks go to them.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Îratsa-Tsagaropoulouon her hard work, even though I disagree on certain issues.
I do not agree with Mr Chatzimarkakis; I will oppose Mr Chatzimarkakis and I will point out your responsibilities, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, for the chaotic situation prevailing today in Palestine.
You are responsible because you did not allow a procedure for channelling any financial aid to a government called National Unity to work.
Furthermore, you alone are responsible for the present situation, because you insisted - selectively and groundlessly - on circumventing the institutional channels and the direct channelling of financial aid to a national unity government which had accepted the agreements of the PLO and, as such, met the Quartet's preconditions.
And lastly, from now on, we must be clear that under no circumstances can the resumption of direct financial relations depend on terms which split the Palestinians and serve Israel's expansionist policy.
I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to acknowledge your responsibilities and to assume them.
(MT) Thank you Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Vice President Kratsa for her extremely interesting report.
