Mr President, the Lisbon process was important because it made a significant breakthrough by deciding to take an integrated approach to the economic employment and social policy dimensions to ensure that each was given an equal standing in terms of policy development.
It is important that Barcelona does not backtrack on that commitment.
It is important that Barcelona realises that if there is going be social cohesion, if we are going to reform and develop our European social model then the equilateral triangular approach to the development of Europe has to be maintained and developed.
Specifically, I refer to paragraph 22 of the Bullmann report which deals with the question of services of general interest.
It is extremely important in my view that this House gives strong support to that paragraph.
This an area of the European economy which accounts for something like 16% of investment and close to 9% of employment.
Of course it has to be reformed, but at the same time we have to ensure that the services which general interest deliver are delivered in an equitable, fair and a universal way.
That cannot be done in an ad hoc way.
It cannot be done by each Commissioner or each Council taking its own ad hoc approach.
We need to take on board a proposal of this Parliament that we put in place a directive, not a one-fit-for-all directive, but a directive which would provide a framework for services of general interest, which would establish the principles on which they are to be provided and which would put on an institutional basis an evaluation of how those services are delivered.
Mr President, I would like to address the House to talk about the issue of sustainable development at the Barcelona European Council.
The Commission' s resolution clearly contains many interesting points; but in relation to Amendment No 10, which discusses information and the sustainability reports which have to be produced in order to receive Structural Funds and in relation to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, I wish to say that I am very concerned, because the criteria for sustainability are not well-defined at the moment.
We have no good definition of what we consider to be sustainable and this leads to subjective views, propaganda and unjust positions.
I believe it is necessary to improve the criteria that are going to define sustainability with an open mind, because the integral policy requires that we incorporate the multifaceted nature of sustainability.
But we must also take account of territorial criteria.
We must therefore employ objective and territorial parameters, since sustainable development always affects a specific territory.
In this respect, climate change, for example, cannot only be applied to gas emissions, but also to desertification, which is perfectly quantifiable, and to rain levels.
Something else also worries me, however.
While we have managed to incorporate sustainability and the environment into a transversal policy, the latter, the environment, must also open the door to social and economic criteria.
There cannot be sustainability without an assessment of the social impact, of the habitability of regions, of the negative economic impact and of the costs.
We must therefore enrich the criteria for sustainable development, otherwise we will create situations of asymmetry and injustice which make it difficult to implement energy and water policies in the future.
Mr President, it was very important progress we made in Gothenburg with the adoption of a combined strategy for sustainable development and the simultaneous incorporation of the environmental dimension into the Lisbon strategy.
The Barcelona Summit next month will therefore be the first opportunity for taking stock of their implementation.
I think that the challenges in the environmental sphere have not been dealt with fully enough either in the Spanish Presidency' s work programme or in the Commission' s discussion paper for the summit.
By means of the proposals to be debated tomorrow here in Parliament, those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have tried to correct some of these deficiencies.
Allow me just to mention a couple of examples.
I believe it is important to get the Cardiff strategy on environmental integration tightened up so that we might have clear objectives and timetables established for implementing the strategy.
It is also important that we arrange for systematic sustainability assessments to be carried out of all the EU' s political initiatives.
In the area of agriculture and fisheries, we are all aware of the problems.
It is hugely important that, in the new agriculture and fisheries reforms, we should see to it that the requirements in terms of the environment and sustainability are also considered in relation to enlargement.
Finally, I hope that the European Council will demand of the Commission that work on a new chemicals policy for the EU be hurried along as much as possible.
I hope that the Council will listen to Parliament' s eminently justified demands and recommendations.
Mr President, a great deal has been said already.
I have just two comments to make.
The first concerns the strategy for sustainable development in the run up to the Barcelona Summit, which puts flesh on the bones of the endeavour started in Gothenburg last year, when the environmental dimension was woven into economic development and social cohesion, successfully in my view.
The common objective of these endeavours is to put the European Union's long-term, global strategy on sustainable development into practice.
Biotechnology is an important sector today - and will be even more important tomorrow - and we must not overlook that aspect of it which can play an important part in sustainable development.
This point is covered in Amendment No 27 proposed by my group.
If used with care, biotechnological applications, and genetically-modified organisms in particular, can make a positive contribution both to the economy and trade and to environmental protection, for numerous reasons which there is no need to reiterate.
At the same time, if we are to establish consumer confidence, we need to pay attention to concerns on this count and the call for analytical control methods, as well as markers and tracers, to be applied to genetically modified organisms is a legitimate one.
It will guarantee compliance with the principles of safety, responsibility and proper information and, at the same time, create conditions of healthy competition in a highly promising sector.
My second comment concerns the Commission communication on the action plan on mobility.
The Commission proposal for a social security card is lacking in substance.
Why?
Because it does not create a European area of health which meets the demands of European citizens; all it does is simplify bureaucratic procedures.
Unless the card includes details and medical data, naturally with the interested party's consent, which can be used in the other Member States, it will do nothing to improve present medical coverage at European level.
Naturally, what we need is for the Member States to run compatible medical IT systems. This, of course, is where the Commission comes in and we expect it to take positive action on this issue.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to single out one aspect of the summit, namely employment, since the socio-economic policy which we pursue has, after all, a considerable bearing on employment.
Firstly, I am of the opinion that the summit should consider whether the objectives laid down in Lisbon can be met.
In my view, this is impossible at the sluggish pace which we are currently seeing in Europe.
I have studied the figures relating to the development of employment and unemployment.
Last year was disappointing, and we will therefore never be able to meet the target.
This is partly due to the fact that there is no longer any pressure from the European Union to actually implement the national action plans for employment which Member States are required to submit every year.
During the initial period of the Luxembourg process, the bad reports which the Commission gave the different Member States were still headline news. News of such reports has now been relegated to token entries on the last pages of some newspapers.
This means, therefore, that the pressure to utilise the open coordination method is slowly being reduced.
The summit should therefore consider what can be done to increase this pressure.
I would now like to mention two specific points. Firstly, the costs to employers of creating employment are far too high.
If I look at the difference between the costs and what employees are eventually left with, then non-management staff, for example, retain on average 45% of the costs of employing them, while management retain 35 or 36%.
If nothing is done to curb these costs for employers, the level of redundancies will remain high.
Secondly, the difference between unemployment benefits and wages is too small.
Many people remain unemployed and combine this situation with moonlighting, because wages are too low.
Mr President, when the Barcelona Summit takes place, it will be two years since the Lisbon process began and the objective was set of creating the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by the year 2010.
It is now high time that we provided stronger support for developing and consolidating the process of modernising the European economy and that we made clear our demands for practical measures.
If we are to be able to create a dynamic and competitive Europe, then deregulation, liberalisation, structural changes and tax reductions must be implemented.
That will in turn lead to basic conditions being created for new companies and new jobs, as well as to increased prosperity.
We shall not obtain a dynamic and competitive Europe though further detailed regulations or through the EU' s taking on responsibility for an increased number of areas.
What is fundamental to achieving the Lisbon objective is, first of all, an internal energy market characterised by liberalisation, competition and openness.
This is of the greatest importance to European industry and the people of Europe if they are to obtain better service and lower prices.
The second prerequisite is an internal market for financial services with a view to improving the opportunities for investment and economic growth by means of lower capital costs and increased profitability.
Modernisation of the European economy is partly aimed at reducing unemployment in Europe, for example by increasing employee mobility, something which is also very important if the common currency is to flourish.
Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, must also be provided with sound basic conditions in which to start up, grow and become larger - or, perhaps, even to become large companies.
I believe that these viewpoints should have been the main content of Parliament' s statements about the continued direction of the Lisbon process prior to the Barcelona Summit.
Unfortunately, that has not quite been the case, something which we Conservatives regret.
The report even contains a number of points that are in direct conflict with dynamic and competitive development.
If the report were really to have supported the Lisbon process, it should have focused upon deregulation, liberalisation and increased competition.
Thank you, Mr President.
On behalf of the Presidency, I would firstly like to thank all the parliamentary groups for their speeches and I will try to be as concise as possible, bearing in mind that there have been many references which have overlapped or coincided.
I would firstly like to address those who have noted any kind of defect in the excessive deficit procedures, that is to say, the procedures for monitoring the governments' stability plans.
I would like to insist that the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council have had absolutely no hesitation in confirming the validity of the stability pact and that, with regard to the implementation of the early warning procedure in Article 99, by the Commission, the Council believes that the declarations and specific commitments made by two countries in relation to their compliance in the short term, that is, during this year, and in the medium term, from now until 2004, with the objectives of their stability plans and the stability pact in general, with a balance or almost a balance, in 2004, were commitments which met the needs stemming from our stability commitments.
In this regard, I believe that the Commission has acknowledged that, independently of procedural factors, the efforts and commitments made by both countries are clear and thorough from the point of view of the macroeconomic stability of the European Union and the eurozone in particular.
I would also like to stress that, in Barcelona, from the point of view of competition and liberalisation, the Spanish government, and therefore the Presidency, is going to promote political agreements which represent considerable progress towards the liberalisation of markets, bearing in mind that we are talking about services which in many respects are essential to society, and that they must therefore be accompanied by levels of quality and security of supply, which must not be reduced.
I believe that economic experience does not indicate there are any cases where competition in the market economy has led to the countries involved having worse services than those which do not have competition, but quite the opposite.
Nevertheless, efficiency in the allocation of resources, and therefore prices for consumers, can be extraordinarily beneficial.
Spain is a good example of this.
Spanish family consumers, that is, domestic consumers, have made a saving since 1996 of EUR 2 400 million as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market, and the same has been true in relation to telecommunications and other markets.
To continue with the same example, I would highlight the effort that Spanish society has made in relation to the modernisation of the labour market, which has reduced the unemployment rate in Spain from 23% in 1995 to 12% in 2002, and that during the current Spanish legislature, that is, by 2004, that rate will be 9%, which is around the European average.
Therefore, liberalisation and competition do not pose a risk for the citizens, but quite the opposite.
There is a considerable saving in the cost of public services and a considerable increase in employment, and it is unquestionably the responsibility of the public authorities, the regulators, to guarantee such factors as the quality of service and sufficient supply.
I believe that experience, not only in Spain but in many countries of the Union, confirms this.
What is beyond doubt, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are now fortunately at the end of a recession which has been very intense and relatively rapid, as the President of the Federal Reserve, Mr Greenspan, has assured us this afternoon; and what Europe needs is capacity for economic growth.
Many of the objectives which you have raised, such as environmental, social, health, educational and quality of life objectives, require economies whose potential grows, and I must remind the European Parliament that, over the last ten years, the European economy as a whole has only grown by over 3% in one year and by less than 3% in the other years.
An economy in these circumstances has to be content with a structural unemployment rate of close to 9 or 10% and I am convinced that not a single parliamentary group present believes that to be a good policy, either in economic or social terms.
I believe that the introduction of the euro has demonstrated that European citizens want more Europe and want economic reforms, and - while Mr BarÃ³n is present, since he urged me to also congratulate the Commission on the introduction of the euro - I congratulate the Commission, all the central banks, the governments and all the people who have contributed to the introduction of the euro in Europe, and above all the citizens.
Various speakers have also mentioned the problems of sustainable development, and I believe that they are perfectly compatible with economic development and furthermore that is the clear definition of the type of economic policy we want in Europe.
I would like to point out that the Barcelona Council, in line with the recommendations of the Gothenburg Council, is going to take account of the third dimension of structural reform, that is, the dimension which includes sustainable development and that, following the Laeken European Council, we now have environmental indicators which are going to lead to the first report, which was made public in January 2002, just a month ago, on 17 January, and on 5 March, next week, the Ecofin Council will analyse that report in order to take it finally to the Barcelona European Council which will also allow us to reach agreements establishing the European position, with a view to the Johannesburg Summit on sustainable development.



I perfectly understand the demand from the parliamentary groups and Members that environmental issues must be at the forefront in terms of structural reform, and in this respect I would like once again to stress that the Barcelona Summit is going to bear these issues in mind, not in a generic way, but in accordance with the environmental indicators approved by the Laeken Council.
The candidate countries have been mentioned.
The candidate countries are going to be in Barcelona, and they are going to be there to talk about their structural reforms, and therefore, in an informal but effective way, they are going to be able to participate in the debate on the liberalisation of markets in Europe and the increase in growth capacity and I believe that is a good demonstration of the will - not just of the Spanish Presidency, but of all the countries of the European Union and this Parliament - for the candidate countries to participate effectively in the debates on the establishment of European policies, even before the accession process is complete.

The issues relating to small and medium-sized businesses have also been mentioned; I would like to confirm that we are not talking about generic declarations, that the informal meeting last weekend in Aranjuez, in Spain, is going to bring proposals to the Barcelona Council so that the countries make reductions in timetables, reductions in administrative costs and use new technologies intensively in order to achieve this, and that, furthermore, the Commission, before the end of the Spanish Presidency, will make a series of recommendations on certain issues which are essential to small and medium-sized businesses such as the transfer of ownership of family businesses, which over the next ten years may make up approximately 30 to 40% of property transfers within European companies.
Issues such as Basilea II, which has been mentioned by the parliamentary groups and by some Members, are going to be analysed during the Spanish Presidency in the informal Ecofin in Oviedo, where we will hold a debate on the new rules which are going to affect the financial sector as a result of the Basilea agreements, known as Basilea II, on how they may affect the funding of all companies and, in particular, small companies.
It has been rightly pointed out that the labour market is not just a question of flexibility.
This is undoubtedly the case, and the public authorities have a role to play on issues such as the defence of workers' rights, the defence of the creation of active and passive social policies which respond to the needs of workers, the creation of training systems and positive discrimination policies in favour of specific groups such as women or women with young children.

What is absolutely clear, however, is that the best kind of social and labour policy is one that can generate stable and quality employment, and which accepts the idea that on the one hand we have a policy of social protection and on the other we try to give the European citizens the incentive to work rather than receive benefits.
That is being used today as an instrument in all the countries of the European Union, and I believe that the benchmarking procedure is useful for analysing questions relating to direct public spending incentives for people to leave behind unemployment benefit and join the labour market with salaries which do not clearly benefit from the fiscal reductions which are taking place in our countries; with formulae which give people receiving unemployment benefit the incentive to accept job offers and with formulae which reconcile training with the needs of companies, as well as extending working life within our labour markets.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to refer to the need, which has also been raised by some speakers, for specific timetables to be established in Barcelona.
There is no doubt that the Barcelona Council intends to set quantifiable objectives which allow the States to make commitments which the public understands and accepts.
I believe that, by reconciling political positions, which are not necessarily similar, no issues which are clearly sensitive, such as the provision of essential services, in which public authorities undoubtedly have a role to play in terms of guaranteeing the concept of public service, and the concept of quality, I also believe that we can establish processes which create genuine European internal markets which put the European economy in a position to compete with other world economies, now that we have taken the gigantic step, in terms of the construction of Europe, of introducing the euro.
Mr President, I asked the President-in-Office of the Council a specific question on statements by the Spanish Prime Minister - who is also President-in-Office of the European Council - that made reference to my political family in the Council, but he has not yet answered my question.
It is for the President-in-Office of the Council to decide whether he answers the question or not.

Mr President, I have no problem reminding Mr BarÃ³n of what he already knows - that there is a very constructive relationship between the Spanish government and other European States, and that we have been able to reach political agreements with all governments, whatever colour their political family - to use the language Mr BarÃ³n himself likes to use - and that, bearing in mind the influence Mr BarÃ³n has over his political family, we hope that the conclusions of the Barcelona Council will allow all political families to contribute to the wellbeing of all Europeans.
Mr Rato y Figaredo, thank you for speaking to the European Parliament this afternoon.
We wish the Spanish Presidency every success in its term of office, as I am sure you are aware.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
International Criminal Court
The next item is the Council statement on the International Criminal Court.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that, due to lack of time, you will have to strictly adhere to your allocated speaking time.
Mr President, I am delighted to be able to appear before Parliament today to present the President-in-Office of the Council' s position with regard to the steps the European Union is taking to bring about the forthcoming establishment of the International Criminal Court.
The European Union has firmly supported the historic project to establish a permanent international criminal jurisdiction with universal scope.
The European Parliament is well aware of this fact since it has always been on the front line in promoting the European Union' s efforts to achieve this essential objective for human rights and justice.
I would, however, like to state once again that the establishment of the International Criminal Court is an important component of the European Union' s external policy, and consequently a feature of the programme of the Spanish Presidency.
The European Union particularly welcomes the imminent achievement of this objective, which we have been waiting for such a long time and which we are all confident will take place this year.
We cannot overstate the importance of the establishment of this Court, which so many legal experts, defenders of human rights and political leaders have been fighting for, and it is now truly within our reach.
It will be a triumph for all humanity which is due, in no small measure, to the determined and consistent action of the European Union.
Our collective experience on this continent, which has been involved in conflicts and horrors throughout the last century, makes Europeans particularly sensitive to the absolute need to develop and affirm international criminal justice as an instrument of service to human rights and humanitarian standards worldwide.
It can be a surprise to nobody, therefore, that European States and the European Union are at the forefront of this movement in support of the International Criminal Court, a court that will be truly universal, independent and efficient.
The European Union is absolutely convinced that the establishment of the International Criminal Court will represent a huge step forward for the whole world.
When serious crimes are committed that are an affront to civilised society as a whole, when common values are attacked head on, the international community must act with the full force of the law.
We need to enthusiastically and appropriately punish the most serious violations of human rights and international law, using the mechanisms agreed upon within the international community for this purpose.
The International Criminal Court will be a powerful tool in this fight for justice and against impunity for the most heinous crimes - war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.
In a wider context, the establishment of the International Criminal Court is part of a movement characterised by the evolution of our world in recent times; the emergence and consolidation of an international criminal justice system that pursues particularly heinous crimes beyond the borders of our States, because these crimes are a serious threat to the security of all citizens worldwide.
In such cases, which affect us all, we have to call upon either national criminal justice systems, through mechanisms which closely cooperate with one other, or properly constituted international criminal tribunals such as those created for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, set up by the Security Council, or in the near future by the International Criminal Court itself.
The trial of ex-President Slobodan Milosevic in the Hague which has recently started is just one more example of this tendency that is gathering more momentum throughout the world, for this is what world-wide public opinion demands, and because it has to be seen as the logical conclusion of the current process of globalisation.
The most important thing is that we are winning the battle against this culture of impunity, a culture based upon silence and amnesia, which is being replaced by a culture in which we demand that those responsible for heinous crimes be brought to justice.
In the same way, we are moving away from the attitude of turning a blind eye to crimes committed against a neighbour to one where we are involved and look for effective means to act and cooperate with each other in order to deal with these intolerable situations.
This does not mean seeking revenge or retaliation, but to ensure that justice prevails as an essential condition for long-lasting peace and reconciliation in every situation where there has been serious conflict.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the preparatory work for the establishment of the International Criminal Court is now at a very advanced stage.
Upon the basis of the Statute adopted in Rome in 1998, the preparatory committee has laid down the majority of the instruments that the Court will need to be able to function effectively.
In this process, which is undoubtedly of a technical nature but with fundamental scope and importance, EU States continue to play a very important role, I would even dare to say a leading role, in the collective work that has been carried out by countries worldwide.
And, even more importantly, the process of ratification of the Rome Statute is advancing at an even faster pace than we could have hoped for.
Whilst in the Rome Diplomatic Conference 120 States voted for its adoption, the Treaty has been signed by a total of 139 States, that is to say, an overwhelming majority of the international community.
As you already know, 60 ratifications or signatories are needed for the Statute to enter into force and consequently for the International Criminal Court to be set up.
At this stage there have been 52 ratifications, which leads us to believe that we will get the 60 ratifications needed within the next few months.
I would even dare to say that this will certainly take place before the end of the Spanish Presidency.
As you are all aware, all the Member States of the European Union have ratified the Statute or have implemented the necessary constitutional mechanisms for it to be ratified in the very near future.
We firmly believe that all the Member States will be amongst those countries which, with their participation in the assembly of signatory States, whose first meeting could take place this very year, will implement those concrete decisions which pave the way for the effective operation of the Court.
In accordance with the common position adopted in the Council of 11 June 2001, the European Union urges all States that have not ratified or signed up to the Statute to do so as soon as possible, so that the International Criminal Court can be established in the near future.
I would like to point out that recently 15 candidate or associate countries have adopted the common position and are closely cooperating with us on this commitment.
It is also appropriate to highlight the work that is being carried out in this regard by a large number of non-governmental organisations, frequently with the assistance and cooperation of the European Union.
In accordance with this appeal, the European Union has been making representations to third countries and groups of countries in order that they can speed up the internal procedures necessary to ratify the Statute as soon as possible.
These representations have been accompanied, in certain cases, by offers of technical assistance in this field.
In the next few weeks we intend to intensify these representations on various continents with the aim not only of achieving the swift entry into force of the Statute, but also to ensure that the assembly of signatory States reflects as accurately as possible the varied composition of the international community.
In fact, the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Court will crucially depend on its composition and the support it receives being interpreted as a genuine reflection of the international community as a whole.
It is extremely important that all continents and all legal systems are duly represented in the Court and that this includes lawyers of both sexes as specified in the Rome Statute.
The search for this wide-ranging support for the Court should inspire our efforts.
We feel encouraged in our commitment by the fact that the ratifications that have already been registered and those that will take place in the very near future are from States on all continents, predominantly European, African and Latin American States so far, with different legal systems and levels of economic and social development.
No one can say that the International Criminal Court is going to be a Court simply for the Western world or developed countries.
It will be a legal institution for the whole international community, fully independent and linked to the United Nations system.
It is important to point out that all countries, whether they have signed the Statute or not, can play an active role in the process of establishing the International Criminal Court through their participation in the work of the preparatory committee and then, if they so desire, as observers in the assembly of signatory States.
And the doors will always be open to any country that wants to ratify or sign up to the Statute at a later date.
In this regard, the European Union has maintained a constant and sustained dialogue with several countries harbouring doubts, some of which are our closest allies - I am referring, in particular, to the United States - and we will remain ready to continue these exchanges, with the aim of clarifying respective positions and promoting a favourable atmosphere for cooperation in the future.
It is obvious that this task will not come to a conclusion with the entry into force of the Statute and the decisions that will be adopted in the next meeting of the assembly of signatory States.
We will need to take all of the necessary measures so that the establishment of this new institution in its permanent headquarters in the Hague will be as quick and efficient as possible.
The preparatory committee and the host country, the Netherlands, are already preparing for the implementation of these measures and the European Union is cooperating with them.
Next, we will have to develop and strengthen all the mechanisms that will help the new institution in order to guarantee its effectiveness both in its headquarters and on the ground.
The experience of the courts for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have taught us that international criminal justice, in order to be effective, needs to be equipped with considerable human, material and operational resources.
The Court, with its potentially universal scope, will require no less. It will certainly require more.
Within this context, the European Union and its Member States will have to be prepared to give any assistance that may prove necessary.
Furthermore, the Court, whose proceedings will be governed by the principles of complementarity and cooperation with national legal systems, will only be able to operate effectively if it can rely upon the cooperation of the judicial and administrative authorities of the States.
This means that a very substantial proportion of the implementation of the Statute will consist of the adoption of measures on a national level to make this cooperation possible.
This corresponds to each State in accordance with their constitutional practices, but the European Union can help in this process through the exchange of information and, when appropriate, the offer of technical assistance to countries that need it.
All of this is taking place on the basis of the common position adopted in June 2001, which I mentioned earlier, which, if necessary, could be supplemented by a more detailed action plan or, when appropriate, through an updating or refining of its terms depending on the progress of the process.
I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will pay very close attention to the ideas that arise from this debate when it comes to taking decisions.
Mr President, we share a firm commitment to supporting the swift and efficient establishment of the International Criminal Court as an independent and impartial institution devoted to carrying out justice in the worst cases of violations of human rights and humanitarian law throughout the world.
In this regard, all of us, the European Parliament, the Council, Member States and the Commission, are closely united and committed to continuing to act with determination and tenacity.
This conviction, this determination, is what has allowed the European Union to play an unquestionably leading role in this process, together with other countries characterised by their attachment to democracy and human rights.
We are very close to achieving our objective through the entry into force of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the Court.
This will provide us with a 'before' and an 'after' in the history of humanity' s effort to introduce justice throughout the world.
We will therefore be able to feel proud of Europe' s contribution to this progress in the international community, but we will by no means be able to rest on our laurels, for this will be the moment at which we have to move on to the next stage in this struggle for justice, in which Europe will again have an indispensable role to play.
I am sure, Mr President, that we will lack neither the will nor the consistency to be able to persevere in our commitment, and, for this reason, I believe I will always be able to count on the support of this Parliament.
Thank you, Mr de Miguel.
You can rest assured that you will always be able to count on the support of this Parliament, which has expressed its political will in this regard on many occasions.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, EU policy in the sphere of human rights and democratisation includes as an integral component the fight to ensure that serious crimes do not go unpunished and the struggle for justice at an international level.
The statute of the International Criminal Court, concluded in Rome, represents probably the most significant achievement of international law since the establishment of the United Nations.
The European Union has always advocated the International Criminal Court and continues to support this project vigorously, as demonstrated by the common position adopted by the EU in June 2001, in which we put the case for the agreed statute to enter into force as soon as possible and for the Court to be established.
The Commission unreservedly approves the start made in this common position, and I, too, wholeheartedly concur with what RamÃ³n de Miguel has just set out in his capacity as President of the Council.
The Commission welcomes the official statement in January 2002 by the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, as well as by Cyprus and Malta, countries also associated with it, and the EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area, to the effect that they associate themselves with the objectives of the common position.
The EU's budget is being used to support projects by non-governmental organisations, by means of which projects the whole world is to be made aware of the need for the Court to be established.
Since 1995, then, within the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, some EUR 6.9 million have to date been spent on projects of this sort.
EUR 2.1 million were made available in 2001 for three projects by non-governmental organisations in support of the International Criminal Court, which complement each other.
The 'NGO Coalition for the Criminal Court' project aims to facilitate civil society's involvement, in cooperation with governments, within the framework of the United Nations' Preparatory Committee for the Criminal Court, and promote and facilitate technical cooperation, so that binding national legislation can be enacted to implement the statute concluded in Rome once it is ratified.
The project 'Parliamentarians for Global Action' is engaged in a parliamentary campaign to ratify and effectively implement the statute of the Criminal Court and promote the rule of law, and the project 'No peace without justice' concentrates on campaigns to build public awareness and organise conferences in support of the Criminal Court.
In the May 2001 Commission communication on the role of human rights and democratisation in third countries, the combating of unpunished crime was ranked as a measure to be promoted as a high priority.
The Commission will therefore continue to support the establishment of the International Criminal Court.
EUR 5 million has been allocated to the special budget line for the International Criminal Court, which also includes the ad hoc courts for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and also the newly-established court for Sierra Leone, for 2002.

In 2002, the Commission will be concentrating its efforts on two aspects, firstly on increasing awareness of the Criminal Court, as part of which it wants to call on more than the necessary sixty countries to proceed with ratification, so that the statute can enter into force, whilst, at the same time, wanting to ensure that all areas of the globe are represented.
We want, secondly, to concentrate on the enactment of binding national legislation to implement the plan; this would cover the training of the specialised staff involved - judges, lawyers, law enforcement agency staff and parliamentarians - to enable them to contribute to the work of the Court.
We can also make a limited contribution to covering the Court's main costs.
Proposals as to how to realise these objectives will be invited in March this year.
I too was fortunate to be able to listen to Commissioner Verheugen first, so that I can now concur with both speakers, both the speaker on behalf of the presidency and the speaker on behalf of the Commission.
Their statements dovetail perfectly with what the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats would like to see.
We also fully share their views on the significance of the Court.
If we talk about the need for reconciliation, then it is true that justice is to be done first, and the Criminal Court that has been set up for this purpose is therefore an extremely important instrument for ensuring the international rule of law, particularly in its preventive effect on people with dubious criminal backgrounds who have acquired high political positions, as we have witnessed in Yugoslavia and near the Great Lakes in Africa.
It is of the utmost importance for impunity to be no longer acceptable and for this now also to be universally known.
The resolutions submitted by Parliament contain a few important points. First of all, we as groups mutually agreed during the negotiations to urge the President and the Congress of the United States to review their position on taking part in the International Criminal Court.
We have such high regard for the US that we need to make this appeal in a proper manner.
This is why I also deem the amendment in this connection, which concerns an old document from the negotiations, to be wholly inappropriate.
It makes no sense to try to convince the Americans by using tough words.
Instead, we should prevent the irritation, which is already in evidence among the Americans in respect of Europe, from escalating any further and try to discuss these matters in a friendly manner.
Another point is the need for the provisions of the Geneva Convention with regard to prisoners of war to be updated, so that we can take account of the status of the people currently held in Guatanamo.
We, as a group, set great store by providing a definition in this connection.
In addition, we hope that the Spanish Presidency will succeed in setting up this International Criminal Court under its own presidency.
Mr President, too much time has passed since, on 17 July 1988 in Rome, the establishment of an International Criminal Court was approved, to bring to justice those individuals responsible for the most serious crimes which, as has already been mentioned here today, are the scourge of the whole world, including terrorism.
There have been 52 ratifications of the Statute to date but, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all well aware, 60 are needed for it to enter into force.
Given that we anticipate that the International Criminal Court will enter into force in the first six months of this year, under the Spanish Presidency, that the first assembly of signatory States will take place in New York, in September this year, that the attitude of the United States has not been positive so far and there are also well-founded suspicions that the American administration will be supporting a campaign against the Court, even going as far as to revoke Clinton' s signature at the UN on 31 December 2000, I would like to take advantage of your presence here, Mr de Miguel, to ask you a few specific questions.
What does the Presidency of the Union intend to do with regard to the Bush administration to avoid this risk of taking a backwards step?
Does the Presidency not think it necessary to draw up a plan with specific measures and resources to attract the United States to the International Criminal Court?
What does the Presidency of the Union intend doing to guarantee that the 18 aforementioned judges, an integral component of this Court, designated at national level, meet with the requirements with regard to qualifications, balanced regional distribution, experience and parity between men and women?
When the Rome Statute was approved, Kofi Annan considered it a gigantic step forward.
However, a long time ago, Benjamin Ferencz, former prosecutor at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trial, said that there can be no peace without justice, no justice without law, and no meaningful law without a court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstances.
Today, following 11 September and the conflicts in the Middle East, the citizens see the establishment of this Court as something urgent and necessary.
Let us not, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let time slip away and forget about this until the next crime or war reminds us of this ever-present threat.
Mr President, right is wrong.
If all individuals are not treated in the same way, if war crimes and crimes against humanity go unpunished, how can we credibly pass judgment on less serious violations of the law?
It is of the utmost importance for a permanent International Criminal Court now to be set up specifically in The Hague, the judicial capital of the world.
This court is one element in the development of our civilisation.
It should naturally be universal.
Asian and Arab countries, in particular, are still under-represented, and I urge all signatories to proceed to ratification.
It is very poignant that the United States too should refuse to ratify the Treaty.
It was mainly the Americans who proclaimed in Nuremberg that individuals have duties towards the international community which prevail over those towards their own State, and that this should become international law.
Meanwhile, for the Americans, the same international criminal law apparently applies to everyone apart from themselves.
A rare insight into the arrogance of power is provided by a bill that has already been adopted by the Senate and that boycotts the court and every country which participates in it.
Another outrageous bill would even authorise the President of the United States to use violence to liberate people kept in prison by the court.
If sufficient guarantees are built in to ensure a fair judicial process and competent judges, there is no reason at all why America should be fearful of this court.
The Council and our Parliament should get this message across to our counterparts in America in a friendly, yet unambiguous manner.
Also, as many countries as possible, spread across the different continents, should proceed to ratification in the short term.
The court should not become too European. It can prove in practice that States that do not participate are in the wrong.
Anyone who refuses to recognise the International Criminal Court commits an injustice and lags behind our civilisation.
Mr President, only another eight ratifications are needed for the International Criminal Court Treaty to enter into force, but there are a number of problems to be resolved before the Court can become that instrument of international justice and the fight against impunity that we want it to be.
The first obstacle is the persistently hostile attitude of the United States.
We call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to make it clear, once again, at all formal and informal meetings with the United States, how much importance Europe attaches to this issue.
It would be genuinely feasible to find some creative instruments to put pressure on the United States, and I believe this has not been seriously attempted.
The second problem concerns the difficult issue of internal rules to bring national legislation into line with the Court' s Statute.
This will certainly be a difficult process but we must not allow it to become too drawn-out.
From this point of view, I would genuinely like to express my pleasure at Commissioner Verheugen' s words to the effect that he and the Commission are in favour of supporting the training of specialists to help the Court operate more effectively, not least by providing financial aid.
Mr President, I come from a country that has already completed the process of ratifying the Rome Statute, thereby confirming the humanist tradition of attachment to justice which characterises the Portuguese people; the tradition of a country which abolished the death penalty 450 years ago and life imprisonment 118 years ago.
The most important thing, however, is that we can see the values of justice and of the fight against impunity spreading to the five continents.
Slowly, it is true, but spreading nonetheless.
We are also pleased to note that the forthcoming establishment of the ICC will contribute on a different scale to the rejection of the death penalty.
It should be added that justice is only justice if it applies to everyone in the same way.
We know that the ICC is not and never will be perfect.
It will often appear to be dispensing 'winners' justice' , but, in addition to its normal jurisdictional function of investigating and prosecuting particularly serious crimes, it will also perform two other highly relevant tasks: one is to act as a deterrent to prevent further crimes being committed and the other is to provide compensation and reparations for the victims.
It should also be pointed out that the International Court will only take action if national criminal authorities are not proceeding with the investigation and the prosecution of crimes, either because their laws do not cover such crimes or because the authorities are not able to proceed.
We consider this to be a satisfactory solution as long as it is properly applied to the difficult problem of the conflict between the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the sovereignty of the national criminal systems.
Mr President, the impartiality and the independence of the ICC are fundamental values and are part of the defence of what is the greatest asset of the European Union: the respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms, as well as the Rule of Law.
We should, therefore, take every opportunity to praise the objectives that have led to the creation of the Court, and these objectives should not be disparaged under any circumstances.
Mr President, I feel that, in recent years, the way this issue has been addressed has been a prime example of cooperation between the European institutions.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, the Commission officials and the Council for their constant focus on the matter and for their openness to society, Parliamentary group and NGO initiatives, for I feel that a model of cooperation has emerged from this exercise - which we have already applied, for example to the treaty on antipersonnel mines - which is proving effective and therefore warrants due analysis.
Mention has been made here of some of the countries which have not ratified the Statute.
There are others, from Russia to China, which should, perhaps, also be mentioned or be the subject of focus.
Fifty-five countries have ratified the Statute, and I feel that our efforts must now be directed towards achieving a political and geographical balance.
The endeavours made at the Seville Conference, for example, to include the Arab countries, the very positive, unexpected stance adopted by the Arab League and the recent statements by the Mexican President, Vicente Fox, give rise to the hope that, with further endeavours, we might not merely achieve that quota but, I believe, even attempt to take a flying leap beyond it and make participation as universal as possible.
From this point of view, I feel that, as in other cases, Europe can be proud of these 10 years of dogged, resolute, difficult hard work, in which it was alone at the outset but which is now widely recognised.
The attention accorded to the special courts of accountability too, such as the Sierra Leone court which is about to be set up, is evidence that, when it so wishes, Europe can also be a community of values.
Mr President, I feel we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that 55 States have signed the Statute. However, some European States have still not done so.
It is therefore crucial that we encourage them to sign up.
Since 1995, this Parliament has been working towards the creation of this criminal court, and subsequently, in 1998, the Rome Conference very clearly stated the work that needed to be done to set it up.
We are at the end of this process, but, perhaps, at this point, an effort must be made to get 60 signatories to the Statute.
However, Mr President, I would also like to say to the Spanish Presidency that all this effort is only worth it if the end result is significant.
In order for this to be an instrument of fundamental importance, we need a whole series of working and operating mechanisms.
I would ask the Spanish Presidency, during whose term of office the Statute for the International Criminal Court will in all likelihood be approved, to put all its efforts into ensuring that the court will have the sufficient means to be able to function as it should.
This has been Parliament' s concern since 1995: that this struggle for a future that is more just will be successful and that this International Criminal Court will take on the crucially important role that it should have in the future.
I have received 7 motions for resolutions pursuant to Article 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Democratic rights in Turkey, in particular the situation of HADEP
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on democratic rights in Turkey, in particular the situation of HADEP.
Mr de Miguel has the floor on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, Turkey has for several years made clear its interest in establishing closer relations with the European Union.
From the signing of the Association Agreement, in 1963, and its formal request for accession in 1987 and the Customs Union signed in 1996, relations have had a long journey, which has not always been easy, characterised by mutual interest, rapprochement and, at the same time, by the clear European requirement for certain indispensable conditions that apply to every candidate for accession to the Union to be met.
The Copenhagen European Council laid down the political criteria that the candidate countries must fulfil, which are; achieving institutional stability that guarantees democracy, the Rule of Law, the defence of human rights and respect for minorities and their protection.
Furthermore, the Helsinki European Council formally acknowledged Turkey' s application to join the Union, by concluding with the words that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the Union on the basis of fulfilling the new criteria that also apply to the other candidate countries.
From now on, Turkey should benefit from the same association strategy for accession as the other candidate countries, which should act as a stimulus and a support for its reforms.
The conclusions of the Laeken European Council indicate that Turkey has made progress on fulfilling the political criteria set for accession, in particular by means of the recent amendment of its constitution.
The prospect of opening up accession negotiations with Turkey has thereby come a step closer.
The European Council urged Turkey to continue making progress on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, both the economic and the political criteria, especially with regard to respecting human rights, and acknowledged that Turkey is participating on an equal footing with the other candidates in a matter as vitally important as the Convention on the future of Europe, which will be inaugurated tomorrow in this Parliament.
The Progress 2000 report stated that Turkey had initiated a very positive debate on the political reforms necessary for its accession, one of the most important of which is the fact that it has signed up to various international instruments in the field of human rights.
Two-thousand-and-one saw one of the most important changes in Turkey' s process of democratisation: the adoption of a package of 34 amendments to the constitution, which is the most profound change that this fundamental legislation has undergone since its entry into force in 1982.
Amongst the more innovative aspects are the recognition of the freedom of thought and expression, measures to prevent torture and the strengthening of civil authority as opposed to military authority and major prison reforms.
These reforms have undoubtedly benefited from the fact that Turkey' s candidature has been acknowledged and from the prospect of its joining the Union in the future.
Similarly, at the end of January 2002, another major step forwards was taken when the Turkish government decided to remove its opposition to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, concerning the right to freedom and security in relation to the maximum periods of detention an individual can be subjected to before being put on trial.
The Secretary General of the Council of Europe expressed his satisfaction at this decision, and stated that this marks a step forwards in the field of the protection of prisoners' rights.
I would also mention the decision to create a commission, comprising of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and Human Rights, to supervise the situation at field level of the protection of human rights and adopt the necessary measures.
The same applies to the entry into force in Turkey of the new Civil Code, which signifies considerable progress in the recognition of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender, in family law and also in the law of succession.
We should also mention the amendment of the law on the National Security Council, which is about to be approved in the Turkish Parliament, in order to adapt it to the new wording of Article 118 of the Constitution and which increases the number of civilian members of the National Security Council, thereby more clearly demonstrating its consultative nature.
It is also to be welcomed that the Council of Ministers has approved the decree that will allow Amnesty International to legally open an office in Turkey.
Although these constitutional amendments represent enormous hope for the process of democratisation - despite some important omissions, such as not having fully abolished the death penalty, which will still apply in the event of war or to punish particularly serious offences, such as terrorism - the legislative development of these constitutional rules has, however, been clearly inadequate.
Although the legislative minipackage for developing the constitutional reforms adopts a more restrictive definition of the offence of promoting terrorism and provides greater guarantees for prisoners awaiting trial, at the same time extremely vague concepts have been introduced and even, in some cases, the range of punishable actions has been increased, as well as the fact that limits are continuing to be set on the right of association and the right to demonstrate, which is totally incompatible with current practices in the European Union.
The same could be said of the reform of the Civil Code.
The amendment of the status of legal persons does not solve the problem of the legal obstacles to the right of association or to the law on foundations, recently ratified by the Supreme Court, prohibiting the acquisition of property by foundations run by non-Muslim religious minorities in Turkey.
It is worth pointing out, on this matter, that one of the priorities of the Association Agreement for accession is non-discrimination on the grounds of religion.
Another important factor that should be taken into account is the practical implementation of the reforms.
It is not sufficient for the laws simply to be approved; their provisions must also be put into practice.
Turkey could be said to have the basic characteristics of a democratic system, but the implementation of the reforms necessary to guarantee democracy and the Rule of Law is taking place extremely slowly.
Essential reforms in the State Security Courts have still not been carried out, the situation of torture and abuse has scarcely improved, especially in the southeast, due largely to difficulties in prosecuting the members of the security forces who are responsible for these acts.
There are limitations on the practical independence of the judiciary, due amongst other reasons, to the fact that the Supreme Council of judges and prosecutors is headed by the Minister of Justice, which prevents any practical separation of the competences of the executive and the judicial powers.
The Law of Criminal Prosecution still prevents judgments that have been challenged from being reviewed or any measure to compensate for violations of the European Convention of Human Rights from being adopted.
The action plan for the southeast has still not been made public and Turkey has yet to sign up to the Council of Europe' s framework convention on the protection of national minorities.
All of this remains problematic, not to mention the major limitations inherent in the judicial system itself.
Despite the legislative reforms, any real improvement in this field will depend on the correct implementation and interpretation of development legislation.
In practice, it has already become clear that actions that no longer constitute an offence, in light of the recent reform of the Penal Code, could still be considered to be an offence under some other Article of criminal legislation and punished, in some cases, even more harshly.
An essential element of the Turkish process of democratisation is what is known as the National Programme for the Incorporation of the Acquis, presented by the Turkish government shortly after the Council of the European Union approved the Association Agreement for accession in March 2001.
This represents a major step forwards in the right direction but it is inadequate because it contains various shortcomings that could endanger the objective of fully meeting the priorities and objectives required by the Union.
In some aspects, this National Programme for the Incorporation of the Acquis is imprecisely worded, which will lead to problems of interpretation before it can move ahead.
Specifically, it should mention the abolition of the death penalty, the subordination of the armed forces to civilian authority, the eradication of corruption, the socio-economic situation of the southeast of the country, which has a majority Kurdish population and the lifting of the state of emergency in the southeast.
Furthermore, this plan gives no commitment to eliminate legal barriers to the transmission of radio and television programmes in mother tongues other than Turkish or to safeguard the cultural rights of Turkish minorities.
In this process of reform and progress, in the recognition of the cultural rights of minorities, Turkey is still falling short.
The recent reform of the Constitution has led to the amendment of Articles 26 and 28 and to the corresponding removal of the ban on the use of other languages.
Nevertheless, the recent demonstrations by university students and parents of schoolchildren demanding the inclusion of Kurdish language courses in the academic curriculum have been harshly dealt with by the security forces, who state that the Kurdish language as such does not exist, that the only national language of the Republic is Turkish and that individuals who were arrested and who remain in prison are being detained because of their suspected support for the terrorist organisation, the Kurdistan Workers Party, otherwise known as the PKK.
This message was repeated by the National Security Council when it stated that the campaigns requesting Kurdish language education have been orchestrated by the PKK with clearly separatist intentions, adding that this party, the PKK, is attempting to take another step in its strategy of politicisation and of creating a Kurdish nation.
Another problem that cannot be sidestepped in the legislative process of Turkey' s democratisation is the problem of the recognition of the right of association, to be specific, the criminalisation and shutting down of political parties.
In 1994 and as a replacement for the banned Democratic Party (DEP), accused of maintaining links with the terrorist organisation of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the People' s Democratic Party (HADEP) was created; the former members of the DEP who wished to become members of HADEP had to request the express permission of the government, which only allowed those who had no criminal record or against whom there had been no complaint to join.
Since its creation, HADEP has been the dominant political force in the southeast of the country and controls the majority of the councils in the cities in this region; but also, since its inception, HADEP has had the threat of being closed down hanging over its head.
The Constitutional Court' s decision of June 2001 to close down the Islamicist Fazilet Party highlighted the problems existing in the field of freedom of expression and association.
The Constitutional Court is now trying the HADEP case.
The public prosecutor has requested its ban on the grounds of its suspected links with the terrorist and leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, Abdullah Ocalan.
It is being accused of using party meetings to spread propaganda for Ocalan and to incite hatred against the constitutional order and the indissoluble unity of the Turkish Republic.
There have been thousands of cases of people from the HADEP party being arrested, and although the majority have been released following a short period of detention, these individuals were arrested for being suspected members of the PKK terrorist organisation and were accused of being involved in terrorist activities.
No one was arrested and tried simply for being a party member.
It can nevertheless be stated that in Turkey any mention of Kurdistan, its flag, or the call for education in the Kurdish language, is considered to be collaboration with or support for terrorist activity.
It is also true, however, that, until it is banned, HADEP is a legally recognised party in Turkey and no one can be arrested simply for being a member of this party.
Making it illegal would signify a step backwards in Turkey' s progress towards accession and would require the European Union to adopt a common position expressing its concern at the negative impact of such a move on freedom of expression and of association and on political pluralism, on the understanding that respect for the cultural rights of the Turkish people of Kurdish origin is one of the objectives set out in the Association Agreement for accession.
Mr President, it cannot be denied that Turkey has made progress in fulfilling the political criteria for accession; consequently, the prospect of opening negotiations has come even closer.
Nevertheless, this progress is still not sufficient to begin talks on accession.
One of the main obstacles is the protection of the cultural rights of all Turks, regardless of their ethnic origin.
Recently, the Secretary General for European Union Affairs, Volkan Vural, announced that a second package of legislative reforms is being prepared.
This gives us hope today that we will see a new step in Turkey' s process of democratisation, which will open the way to a more fluid relationship and to negotiations, perhaps in the future, on its future incorporation into the Union.
.
(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes today's debate, which gives us the opportunity to draw up an interim balance sheet of democratic rights in Turkey and on the progress made in the area of political reforms.
The background to our debate is the decision taken in Helsinki in 1999 to accord Turkey candidate status, and the pre-accession strategy agreed on this basis.
All this strategy's elements have in the meantime been implemented.
Turkey has, in particular, in order to meet the priorities of the Accession Partnership, accepted a national programme for the adoption of the acquis communautaire, thus at last setting in motion a reform process that is also playing an ever greater role in public discussion in Turkey.
Initial results are already visible.
Last year's constitutional reform is evidence that Turkey is seriously getting to grips with the political reforms that are needed.
The Laeken European Council paid tribute to Turkey's efforts and noted that Turkey had moved closer to its objective of joining the European Union.
Allied with this is, though, the expectation on the part of the European Union that the reform process will be carried on consistently.
Turkey does not at present meet the political Copenhagen criteria.
During my conversations in Ankara a few days ago, I strongly encouraged the Turkish government to be determined in proceeding with their package of political and economic reforms.
My conversation partners, who were from all the parties in the present coalition government, confirmed to me both their desire for reform and their objective of rapprochement with the European Union.
In order to implement last year's constitutional changes, Turkey has, this month, enacted a first mini-package, the provisions of which the Commission welcomes in so far as they deal with pre-trial detention.
Although these provisions comply with EU standards, we take the view that they do not go far enough as regards freedom of opinion.
Having expected more extensive and comprehensive reforms in accordance with the constitution, we are unable to find much improvement in the new wording of the relevant articles as compared with the current legal provisions on freedom of opinion.
During my brief visit to Turkey, I therefore underlined our expectation that further steps would be taken in such areas as freedom of association, the use of languages in radio, television and education, the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of fundamental legal rights in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.
Alongside changes in the law, there need to be real changes on the ground through the way the law is interpreted in Turkey.
At the end of the day, we must not measure the human rights situation in Turkey according to what is written down, but have to judge it by what actually happens in practice from day to day.
State prosecutors and judges have an important part to play in this.
To this end, the Commission offers Turkey a range of training programmes, which are eagerly taken up.
The Commission, like Parliament, is observing developments in connection with the court case against the HADEP party in the Turkish Constitutional Court.
A new hearing is to begin on 1 March, that is, the day after tomorrow, and representatives from the Commission are endeavouring to be present at it.
It goes without saying that the Commission assesses this case on the basis of the Copenhagen political criteria, and so I can tell you that, in our view, a ban on the HADEP party in Turkey would offend against our political principles.
Last year, the Turkish parliament amended the constitution towards strengthening human rights in Turkey, but left untouched the legal basis for the banning of political parties.
It has therefore to be said that current provisions in Turkey cannot accord with EU standards.
The Commission therefore calls on the Turkish government to make further efforts to comply with these standards.
It can indeed be said that Turkey is in the midst of an intensive debate on the future course of its reform policy.
Positive steps, for example the constitutional reform, can be set against other areas, in which we continue to observe deficits.
As a result, though, I am confident that Turkey possesses the strength and the will to carry on with its reform policy.
I see Turkey's consent to the opening of an Amnesty International office as a favourable indication.
I also see it as positive that the mini-package to implement the constitutional reforms, enacted a few weeks ago, is soon to be followed by another package of legislative implementing measures, which is, apparently, to cover laws on the press and on public assembly, criminal law and the law on the powers of the police.
It is my hope and expectation that this legislation will clearly manifest a strong desire for reform, and so I take this opportunity again to encourage Turkey to strengthen democratic rights within its borders, set the relevant legislative initiatives in motion and bring them to a conclusion.
What is and will continue to be crucial, is that human rights are safeguarded in practice and that Turkey, as regards day-by-day social coexistence guarantees the benchmarks of a democratic and pluralist society.
It makes a nation - and the Turkish nation is no exception - stronger rather than weaker, when it sets itself the highest objectives as regards the realisation of democracy and human rights.
Mr President, the Christian Democrats in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats are able fully to support what has been said by the Council and the Commission.
Turkey' s constitutional court wishes to declare a further political party illegal.
Over the last 40 years, as many as 23 political parties have been declared illegal in Turkey.
These have been parties with religious, regional, cultural and ethnic bases which have been considered to go against the Kemalist structure of the unitary state.
Allow me to draw a clear comparison.
If we had had such a constitution among the various Member States of the European Union, a large number of parties would have been declared illegal including, for example, my own party, the Swedish Christian Democratic Party, and its sister parties throughout the EU.
I promise that we in the European Parliament will show no lack of vigour, energy and persistence in monitoring this judicial process in Turkey.
Within the framework of an ad hoc delegation, we intend to act in such a way as to protect democratic rights, the multiparty system and, of course, the rights of the Kurdish minority too in Turkey.
Kemal AtatÃŒrk, who died more than 60 years ago, founded a unitary Turkish state.
It is time for a debate among the Turkish people about whether this constitution and this unitary state fulfil the requirements of modern society and pluralistic democracy.
My view is that the Kemalist unitary state is based more upon power, threats, compulsion and authoritarian demands for loyalty than upon winning over people' s hearts and inspiring an inner loyalty, healthy affection and patriotism in relation to their own country.
The time should be past when a constitutional court declares one political party after another illegal.
Moreover, these are large political parties more often than not.
Turkey has not signed the Council of Europe' s convention governing the rights of minorities and proceeds ultimately on the basis of Kemal AtatÃŒrk' s constitution harking back to the 1920s and 1930s.
I wonder if Turkey is not in actual fact scoring an own goal by not opening itself to the outside world and not acting differently towards its minorities.
Only if it changes in these ways can people' s hearts be won over in Turkey and the rest of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Council and the Commissioner have rightly observed that we have managed to set in motion a process of reform in Turkey, but one that still has many, many deficiencies.
What is decisive, as the Commissioner has said, is actual practice and implementation.
I sometimes rather feel that we are being led a dance when the constitution is amended, but not the implementing legislation, thus making it possible for the police and the other security authorities to act, for example, against those who want to be taught in Kurdish and sign up for courses accordingly.
I believe that we cannot accept that.
Anyone who believed that the Kurdish question was resolved by Ãcalan's arrest has, alas, been disappointed, as Turkey has not yet taken advantage of the chance to pursue another policy on the Kurds, for example, by giving the mayors of whom the President of the Council has spoken, the means - financial and otherwise - enabling them to improve matters in South-East Anatolia, which is what they want to do.
On the other hand, admittedly, intransigent officials are arrested or abducted without it being known whether this is the work of the security forces or of private organisations and without any real attempt being made to find the people who have been abducted or those responsible for the abductions.
What Parliament stands by is this: We campaign for the cultural rights of the Kurds - rights that are inalienable, that do not amount to separatism or terrorism, that do not create difficulties for Turkey, but which could be the salvation of Turkey as a European country.
Mr President, the prosecution of the people's democratic party stems from disturbances at their party congress as long ago as 1996.
Since then, the PKK has declared a ceasefire and Turkey has started its long programme of political reform. In particular the revision of Article 69 seems to be designed to expand the scope of party political activity within the political system.
The reform should be taken further quickly so that no regionalist party, nor those of mainly Kurdish origin, should be under threat.
It would be a very good signal of the resolve of Turkey to carry on with European integration should the Supreme Court decide this case at the very moment when Turkey takes its seats inside the Convention.
The banning of the Fazilet party last year was a poor signal.
If there are serious allegations against persons for connections with terrorism they should be charged, but the party itself should be saved for parliamentary democracy.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I can be brief about what has led us to this discussion: the charge of separatism against HADEP is undesirable and, mainly, unjustified.
HADEP is a democratic party which is trying to defend the cause of the Kurds peacefully, and has done so in the past.
It is therefore only right that the Council, the Commission and Parliament, too, should denounce this charge unequivocally.
I can only hope, therefore, that the decision to re-examine this case next Friday in terms of the present constitution and the proposed constitutional changes, and not to proceed full steam ahead towards a ban, forms part of a more general change of direction regarding what, in my view, is the central issue under debate here, namely the question of how political, cultural and religious minorities in Turkey should be accorded a place in the political system.
This is about fundamental human rights: the right to speak one' s own language, the right to use that language in the media and the right to be taught in that language.
But more than anything, it is about the need for crucial political reforms.
In this sense, the case against HADEP epitomises the choice which Turkey is facing: either the country opts for pluralism, democracy and freedom of expression, or these basic European principles remain subordinate to a dogmatic view of state security.
However, let there be no misunderstanding about the fact that this criticism of Turkey and this support for HADEP are based on one crucial premise, namely that it is to be welcomed that Turkey is one of the EU' s candidate countries and that the European Union must do everything in its power to enable Turkey to acquire membership.
Consequently, it is not my intention, by supporting HADEP and criticising the Turkish government and authorities, to keep Turkey outside the EU indefinitely, but rather to prepare Turkey for fully-fledged democratic membership of the European Union.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when Turkey embarked upon a constitutional review process last autumn, my group immediately visited the country in order to initiate an in-depth dialogue with the government or the Grand National Assembly and with representatives of civil society.
Unfortunately, we quickly became aware of the limits of this process.
We were refused permission to visit Mrs Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, and other former MPs of Kurdish origin, who are still in prison.
Whilst the human rights organisations welcome every advance that is made, the sheer number of specific cases they deal with demonstrate how much work still needs to be done before we see the democratic Turkey that we all hope and pray for.
We did not expect, however, to find out some weeks later from the President of the HADEP party himself, Mr Murat Bozlak, that he was summoned before the Constitutional Court to face a likely ban on the political party that he leads.
In order to encourage the European Parliament to react strongly to this extremely serious and arbitrary development, we immediately invited President Bozlak to come and meet all the groups and proposed sending a parliamentary delegation to Turkey.
I welcome the unanimous support for both these initiatives.
The only crime that HADEP has committed is that of continuing to gain influence throughout Turkey, to the point where it is now guaranteed, if elections were to be held, that it would enter parliament, in spite of a specially made law, which sets a 10% minimum score for parties to be represented in parliament.
I also welcome the fact that we decided, by means of a resolution which all the groups support, to send a clear message to the Turkish authorities, and the following statement, in particular: 'The European Parliament calls for the case against HADEP to be dropped' .
I therefore propose that together we undertake to ensure that this is done.
It is the very least that we can demand of a country that will tomorrow be taking part in the Convention on the future of Europe.
Mr President, certainly the Turkish Government has improvised some cosmetic measures to hide its awful human rights record, but new repressive actions give us more serious grounds for concern, as the President-in-Office has said.
The atlas showing the world's languages in danger of extinction presented last week on International Modern Language Day highlights the critical situation for most of the languages of this planet.
We ought to have the courage to denounce all governments - like the Turkish one - that threaten so many linguistic communities with extinction.
President-in-Office, can we accept under democratic criteria that political parties opposed to the disappearance of whole communities could suffer the prohibition of their activities.
Should we set a bad example with our own situation in the Basque country where our language has been considered at risk of disappearing?
Mr President, in no way has the human rights situation in Turkey improved over the past year.
I am in favour of Turkey's admittance to the EU, but the Copenhagen criteria must be met.
Whilst I welcome the amendments to the constitution, they fall far short of my expectations.
Turkey must take still further action, or else it will not be able to join the EU.
The death penalty has not been abolished, but only restricted.
Turkish politicians show little zeal when it comes to putting the changes to the constitution into practice.
Whilst Arabic, English, German and Chinese may be taught at Turkish institutions of higher education, Kurdish, the mother tongue of 12 million people, remains barred from the education system.
Over 10 000 students who availed themselves of their constitutionally guaranteed right and petitioned for Kurdish to be allowed, now face criminal proceedings.
They are charged with separatism.
Any peaceful and political solution to the Kurdish issue will involve the lifting of the ban on the language and the incorporation of Kurdish as a subject in the curriculum.
The Copenhagen criteria include the right to native-language teaching and media, and must be a non-negotiable condition for accession.
Members of HADEP have also been arrested and accused of initiating the Kurdish campaign.
The opening of proceedings to ban HADEP have seen increased repression of its members.
In the past year, 2001, 3 245 HADEP members were arrested, over fifty-five offices were searched and shut down.
Over 3 000 HADEP members were arrested on World Peace Day, and one person was even killed.
Commissioner Verheugen, I challenge you to travel to South-East Turkey and talk to the thirty-seven mayors who belong to HADEP, and who receive no financial aid.
The villages that were destroyed have still not yet been rebuilt.
How are the thousand refugees meant to survive?
Why is it that the South-East gets no money from MEDA Programme funds, even though the rules require it?
Banning HADEP will be a backward step for democracy, and will set Turkey off on a march in the wrong direction on the road that leads to Europe.
Along with my group, I vehemently demand that the proceedings against HADEP be abandoned at once.
The Conference of Presidents has resolved to send a delegation to Turkey.
Until such time as Turkey publicly speaks out against banning HADEP, any delegation must show its solidarity with HADEP and support it.
We must show here and now that this House does not accept undemocratic actions!
Thank you very much, Mrs Uca.
I have received five proposals for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was adjourned at 8.39 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
.eu" Top Level Domain
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (Ã5-0027/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the common position established by the Council on the implementation of the .eu Top Level Domain.
Mr President, the draft regulation we are now discussing provides for the implementation of the .eu top-level domain, which should raise the profile of the European Union in cyberspace and allow the ring of confidence created by the single market to shine through to the Internet.
In the vote at first reading in July 2001, Parliament adopted amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The amendments primarily reaffirmed the principles of non-interference and self-management in the realm of the Internet and recommended efficient administration of the .eu domain, with less red tape.
Although the Council accepted a large number of our amendments in the common position adopted on 6 November 2001, some of them did not meet with its approval.
The Committee on Industry therefore went back on the offensive to call for the 'first come, first served' principle to be taken into account in registration policy, so that the policy of extrajudicial conflict settlement could be based on recovery of costs and in particular so that the consultative procedure could be provided within the committee structure.
In fact, the Committee on Industrial Affairs, like the Commission, felt that the .eu top-level domain must become operational as soon as possible and must be able to work quickly and efficiently in order to be successful.
To the very end, the issue of the consultative or regulatory nature of the committee structure was the main sticking point in the discussions between Parliament and the Commission on the one hand and the Council on the other.
Informal contacts between Parliament, the Council and the Commission were continued after the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry were adopted, and the three institutions finally reached an agreement.
This agreement is reflected in Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which have been tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Group of the Party of European Socialists and Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
As far as the committee structure is concerned, we split the difference or rather, we adopted two thirds of the one position and one third of the other.
The regulatory mode will apply to most measures concerning the implementation of the regulation, in other words, the general interest policy rules and principles and the definition of the criteria and procedure for the designation of the Registry.
The consultative mode will apply to the designation of the Registry and to the conclusion of the contract between the Commission and the Registry.
The reason why the Commission and Parliament ultimately accepted a compromise about which they are less than enthusiastic is that they want the .eu domain to be made available to users as soon as possible, in accordance with the desire expressed by the Lisbon European Council.
Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, may I insist that the Commission and the Council undertake to pursue this aim with due diligence.
I know that Commissioner Liikanen intends to make a statement to this effect during this part-session and that the declaration to the same effect that is due to be adopted by the Council will be communicated to us tomorrow before the vote on the amendments.
On this basis I recommend to the House that we vote in favour of Amendments Nos 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
Mr President, following the numerous informal contacts with the Council and the Commission which enabled us to reach a compromise, I should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen and the staff of his departments, the Spanish presidency for its unstinting efforts, my colleagues, Mrs McCarthy, draftsman for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the coordinators of the political groups.
Together we have achieved a result which should pave the way so that the .eu top-level domain can be launched at the end of the year.
It is a pleasure to be speaking under your gavel for the first time and to offer you my congratulations, and I hope I can have 10 seconds extra at the end for saying that.
It is a pleasure once again at second reading, to be supporting this very important measure on behalf of my group and also to pay tribute to Colette Flesch for the energy and time that she has put in, particularly in handling very astutely the negotiations with the Council and the Commission over the last few weeks, so that we quite rightly have a compromise deal which I have signed up to on behalf of my group, and which we urge your colleagues to support tomorrow.
One of the crucial reasons for that, as Mrs Flesch mentioned in her speech just now, is that we need to get this new .eu domain name operational as quickly as possible.
We are working in a crowded market, colleagues.
The .eu has to survive in a whole world of new domain names, and it will only be of real value to commercial organisations and NGOs and other institutions who want to use it, if the procedures that are put in place for registration are the best possible that can be achieved.
People want to be able to have their registrations handled quickly and clearly and to have the sort of guarantees about their copyrights and trademarks that we expect, because after all, with the institutional backing it has from the European Community over all the European Union, people will expect it to be nothing less than the best.
It is going to be under scrutiny, so best practice is all-important.
But we must get this done and get it through as soon as we possibly can.
We look forward to the declarations of the Council and the Commission.
I will be withdrawing my amendment, which put down a specific timescale of 6 months for getting the registry authorised, or rather to get the tender documents out in 15 months overall.
I have been criticised in the industry for being too generous, so I hope that will be the absolute maximum.
We look forward to hearing your declaration, and I should like to say in conclusion that this is an important measure, which must be done well and be done quickly.
Mr President, I too, on behalf of my group, endorse what Mrs Flesch and Mr Harbour have said.
The solution put forward with the amendments, which we urge Parliament to adopt en bloc, is a compromise solution, but I feel that it is a useful, appropriate compromise in that it will allow us to move forward quickly with the creation of the .eu domain.
I feel that this is to be welcomed as positive for it represents another tangible step forwards - made possible by the cooperation not just of the rapporteur, Mrs Flesch, but also of the Commission and of Commissioner Liikanen, in particular - towards the implementation of the undertakings given at the Lisbon Summit.
Therefore, since it is clear in many other contexts that decisions too can sometimes encounter practical difficulties and delays in implementation, I feel that our review of the situation tonight is cause for great satisfaction.
I will stop there for fear of repeating what my fellow Members have said on the matter, but, without wishing to pre-empt what Commissioner Liikanen has to say, I add my voice to the call for the time frames for putting the .eu domain in place and making it operational to be made as short as possible.
This point remains to be discussed and so I will leave the floor to the Commissioner now, who, we hope, is going to make a statement on the matter.
The adoption of the regulation to make the .eu top level domain a reality is now reaching its final stage.
I would like to express my thanks, particularly to the rapporteur, Mrs Flesch, for her sustained efforts to reach a compromise.
I wish also to thank, in particular, Mrs McCarthy and Mr Harbour and also Mr Carraro.
Their understanding of some of the complexities raised by this initiative has contributed significantly to the outcome we are discussing today.
It is my pleasure to indicate that the Commission can accept the compromise amendments from 7 to 12.
Several of the amendments proposed introduce useful additional clarifications to the provisions of the common position.
The Commission can support the amendment relating to the examination of the first-come, first-served method amongst the existing options when defining the registration policy and within the boundaries of the regulation's framework.
It can also support the amendment introducing the cost-recovery principle in the policy relating to the extra-judicial settlement of conflicts.
The most complex issue to address was without doubt the type of committee and procedure to select for this Regulation.
The Commission can accept Amendments 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
With respect to Amendment 6 of the recommendation for second reading, as adopted by the Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy Committee, the Commission cannot support the amendment to Article 8.
However, in the light of Parliament's concern over the implementation of the .eu top level domain, the Commission wishes to state the following:
The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that, to be successful, the .eu top level domain should be in place very quickly and should not be burdened by an excessive regulatory framework.
An advisory procedure was therefore considered by the Commission to be the most appropriate for this regulation.
In line with the decision adopted at the Stockholm European Council in March 2001 to adopt all the necessary measures to ensure that the .eu top level domain is available users, as soon as possible, the Commission has resolved, however, to accept the regulatory procedure for Article 3(1) and Article 5, in order to facilitate the early adoption of this regulation, and with the confidence that this step can further promote the spirit of collaboration needed to achieve the objective set at the Stockholm Council.
The Commission stresses that the selection of the Registry, to organise administer and manage the .eu top level domain, should take place as early as possible and that all reasonable efforts will be made to ensure a prompt publication of the call for expressions of interest after the entry into force of the regulation.
This presupposes that the criteria and procedures for the designation of the Registry are completed in due time.
The Commission is committed to submitting the measures required for the implementation of the .eu top level domain in a timely fashion and shall do its utmost to ensure that the relevant procedures are completed and promptly to allow the .eu registry to become operational as early as possible after the entry into force of the regulation, unless exceptional circumstances intervene.
The Commission calls on the Member States to fully subscribe to this objective and to provide the support required for achieving it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
1999 discharge (measures taken by Commission)
The next item is the debate on the report (Ã5-0024/2002) by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the action taken by the Commission on the observations contained in the resolution accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 1999 financial year.
Mr President, in the discharge for 1999, we looked at the budget from all sides.
Light was shed on all the sectors.
All the EU institutions were examined in turn because, even if it is ultimately the Commission that is responsible for implementing the budget, it does not, of course, act in isolation.
It is bound by decisions taken in Parliament and in the Council, and it is dependent upon the effectiveness of supervision in the Member States.
The agricultural area is a shining example.
The Commission is proposing a reform of agricultural policy, but the Council and Parliament are resisting this and proposing that the subsidies be made still more bureaucratic, over-generous and vulnerable to fraud and trickery.
The flax, milk and sugar subsidies are good examples.
There is, however, a continual need for fundamental reform and a new administrative culture in the Commission.
We do not always agree with the Commission, but we basically have the same objectives, namely that the Commission should become an efficient and modern administration.
What is most important is that the Commission' s reform plan should proceed in the right way.
My original plan was to compare the individual directorates-general of the Commission and offer a characterisation of each one of them.
That would have been in keeping with the spirit of the reform, but it has not been possible to carry out that comparison.
I should like to call upon the Court of Auditors to investigate what is practised in the Member States.
The discharge for 1999 highlighted a number of very sore points in the Commission' s administration.
One of the most important was the inadequate review of auditors' reports and the insufficient degree of follow-up.
In the report on the discharge for 1999, the Commission is asked to send Parliament reports twice a year, summarising all the auditors' reports and their recommendations together with the ways in which these have been followed up.
Apparently, the Commission will only agree to the internal auditing service' s briefing Parliament once a year, and that is absolutely not enough.
The financial controller used to brief Parliament four times a year, and that is what we also expect from the new department.
The supply of information is always the biggest bone of contention between Parliament and the Commission.
I have had an incredible amount of information supplied in connection with the discharge for 1999, and I should like to thank the Commission for this. However, clear rules that can be applied are needed, irrespective of the identities of the Commissioner and of the rapporteur for the discharge.
The framework agreement is a mess. It can be used to withhold documents and to keep them confidential, for it is the Commission which, in the last analysis, decides whether a document is confidential.
What is more, it is bureaucratic and leads to long delays.
I have respected the framework agreement because that is what applies at present, but I think we should make efforts to have it renegotiated, and I should like to ask our President, Mr Cox, to honour his pledges concerning openness and reforms, especially in this area.
The Committee on Budgetary Control might well consider spending more time on evaluation.
We must ensure value for money.
It is unfortunately my impression that most evaluations are simply binned.
The Commission has promised to submit results of evaluations that have been carried out.
It does not go into how often and in what way.
What does the Commission say to providing a briefing every quarter or every six months?
There are quite a few practical issues arising from the discharge for 1999 that it has not been possible to follow up, either because OLAF investigations are not complete or because a disciplinary case is under way in the Commission.
Many of the big issues raised by the discharge for 1999, such as the IRELA case, are still being dealt with by OLAF, which does not put much of a move on.
There has been a lot of focus on IRELA, the Institute for European-Latin American Relations that has now been closed down.
I am not sorry that the Institute has been closed down.
The Commission now has delegations in the majority of Latin American countries which attend to the links between Europe and that part of the world, but matters have to be properly cleared up.
OLAF is at present in the process of concluding an internal investigation to clarify whether disciplinary procedures need to be instituted.
IRELA still has EUR 3.4 million to repay.
I should like to ask the Commission what the situation is regarding those repayments.
I should also like to applaud the Commission, and especially Mrs Schreyer, for following up the Flechard case.
This showed that it is possible to admit to a mistake and then change the rules.
I really do think it is a splendid result we have achieved.
There is then the issue concerning the Stockholm Representation which, on the other hand, cannot be brought to a conclusion.
I accept that the matter rests with the Swedish prosecution authorities, but we shall need to do something about this.
I should like finally to say thank you for one and a half year' s worth of sound cooperation and, in particular, to thank Commissioner Schreyer.
It has been a pleasure to work with someone so well qualified. As it turned out, it was not just cooperation but more along the lines of a good friendship, through which we have achieved fantastic results.
That is something for which I should very much like to convey my thanks here in this House and, if this is to be the pattern for the future, then it is really something we can build further upon.
It has been really splendid.
Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for this report, which concludes the budget discharge for 1999.
Parliament is required to exercise its powers of scrutiny over the Commission's expenditure.
However, this is only possible with access to all the documents and information.
Otherwise, the discharge decision does not constitute genuine scrutiny but is merely a formality.
I therefore draw your attention specifically to the demand set forth in paragraph 4 of the report, which states that Parliament must have the same access to Commission documents as the Court of Auditors has.
The Commission must stop devising a wealth of new strategies and delaying tactics to withhold documents from us.
The latest example is the van Buitenen report of 31 August 2001.
I was the rapporteur on the first phase of the Leonardo programme in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, yet the Commission gave me absolutely no indication that fresh accusations of mismanagement had been raised and were being investigated by the Commission and OLAF.
Indeed, if a third party had not drawn my attention to the situation at the very last minute, the Commission, despite its superior knowledge, would have allowed Parliament to grant discharge for Leonardo I. Since then, the Commission has played down the situation and deployed a variety of stalling tactics.
I ask you, Mrs Schreyer, is this the trust and cooperation which you and your colleague Mr Kinnock never tire of demanding from this House?
What have you got to hide?
The entire report is apparently already in the hands of at least one German newspaper, together with the relevant OLAF report.
Is not it time, Mrs Schreyer, for it to be made available to us as well?
The Framework Agreement, which was cobbled together and presented to Parliament immediately after the 1998 general discharge without any opportunity for discussion, has shown itself to be ambiguous and misleading, and clearly conflicts with our Rules of Procedure.
It is therefore unacceptable in its current form.
The Agreement must be brought into line with the Rules of Procedure, not the other way round, which is what Mr Bourlanges' proposed amendment appears to be demanding.
I therefore ask you to reject Mr Bourlanges' amendment and to leave Parliament's rights of scrutiny - set forth in the EU Treaty - intact.
No committed European can genuinely be in favour of curtailing the rights of Parliament to benefit an already excessively powerful Commission, putting Europe at risk of becoming an uncontrolled and uncontrollable bureaucracy.
This is the last thing our citizens want to see.
As regards the disgraceful affair of the adulterated butter, known as the Flechard case, I would have preferred more plain speaking.
However, I have no doubt that the spineless investigation into the Flechard case - which concerns not only wasted money but also the risk these products posed to health - is an issue which will give us plenty to talk about during the 2000 discharge procedure.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I, too, should like to add my voice to the congratulations addressed to the rapporteur.
He also worked very hard on the main report on the 1999 discharge and produced excellent results.
We wholeheartedly support this report too.
I also believe that the Commission has been at pains to provide the relevant information within a short time.
However, I naturally endorse the criticism voiced by Mrs Stauner: we have the impression - and this is reflected in the relevant paragraph of the Blak report - that the Commission is still playing its childish game of hide and seek with the European Parliament.
The events of the last few days and the publications on a further van Buitenen report show that European reality does not take place between Parliament and the Commission, between a few officials and MEPs; it takes place in the real world, among 370 million Europeans, who cannot and should not continue to be led by the nose.
I would be delighted if the Commission could finally move towards a more generous system - which, in my view, is an integral part of any democracy - regarding the disclosure of documents and the transparency of its administrative procedures.
Mr President, with the discharge procedure for 1999, the Commission and Parliament opened up a new approach, characterised by greater institutional cooperation.
It is the Commission that deserves praise for this result, but also the rapporteur, Freddy Blak, for having managed this procedure with determination, common sense and intelligence.
We are undeniably seeing progress in the field of agriculture, not least as a result of the implementation of the integrated management and control system, but it is equally true that no progress has been made in the monitoring of fraud in the food industry.
This situation is paradoxical: a deviation by half a meter in the route of a tractor working the land or the replacement of a milk cow on a date that is not considered to be in accordance with the regulations can lead to a declaration of financial irregularities and corrections by means of statistical projection.
Nevertheless, fraud in the food industry committed in order to obtain export subsidies is rarely monitored and when it is, cases of fraud often disappear within the labyrinthine processes of national justice systems, and do not result in Community sanctions or a public explanation of the facts.
This is a state of affairs that we cannot accept.
Mr President, Mr Blak, ladies and gentlemen, the discharge procedure for 1999 really does bear the rapporteur's handprint.
It was an extremely intense process of collaboration which, while not always setting out from the same starting point, I believe nonetheless consistently yielded substantial results after intensive debate.
I do not intend to review the entire procedure here; instead, I would like to highlight one aspect of our collaboration on the discharge, namely the issue of 'access to Commission documents' .
After all, a major change has taken place here compared with previous years, and this is due in no small part to the rapporteur's persistence.
Of course, the Commission is happy to read in your follow-up report that you are pleased to have received all the documents requested in the discharge resolution.
However, we have different views on how this was achieved.
In my view, it clearly shows that the agreement between the Commission and Parliament facilitated this treatment of confidential information.
Let me stress that I believe the treatment of the agreement is working very well in this respect.
It is not only the discharge procedure per se and the various reports that clearly bear the rapporteur's handprint.
The same can be said of the follow-up measures or the measures taken during the budget discharge procedure.
Again, let me cite just one example, namely the guidelines for the application of the proportionality principle for the writing-off of debts.
There was considerable debate about this point during the discharge procedure, especially in the light of a 1994 case when Parliament felt that the decisions made by the Commission departments were lacking in transparency.
As a result of our lengthy discussions, the application of the proportionality principle is endorsed on principle but Parliament has insisted that clearer and more transparent procedures must be adopted.
The rule which has now been adopted in line with the proposed resolution is this: certain criteria must always be upheld, and above all, once a specific sum of debt write-off is involved, the Commission must make the decision as a collegiate body so that it is quite clear that a political responsibility is being assumed.
Let me mention just one dissenting point on the follow-up report.
The Commission cannot comply with the request contained in the follow-up report that the appointment of the accounting officers - that is, of the most senior officials responsible for keeping accounts - or of the financial controller, ought to be conditional upon prior consultation of the European Parliament.
These are not interinstitutional posts but Commission posts for which the Commission itself is the appointing and decision-making body.
Mr Blak, in your statement a moment ago, you enquired about the further procedure with regard to IRELA.
Here, the Commission has decided to take the next step.
As you know, the Commission issued a recovery order, but no recoveries can be made as the Institute itself no longer exists.
Nonetheless, it still exists as a legal body.
The Commission has therefore agreed to take the next step and instruct the Legal Service to determine the extent to which there is scope to proceed on the basis of personal liability.
As regards the issue of the dossier compiled by Mr van Buitenen, I must point out that Mr van Buitenen has himself strongly insisted that only a few copies are in existence.
I have not received a dossier from Mr van Buitenen either.
As we have heard from my colleague Mr Kinnock, OLAF and the relevant departments in the Administration Directorate-General have examined the dossier.
OLAF has designated eight experts from its area to examine the document.
I must emphasise that there have been no delays here: the dossier's author himself conceded that it is likely to be March before the documents have been scrutinised.
OLAF has now submitted a report. I have not seen it, but the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control has a copy.
I believe that my colleague, Mr Kinnock, has also informed the Committee.
As soon as recommendations are made to the Commission, the Commission will examine them and if new procedures are to be introduced, it will, of course, do so.
Let me turn now to the issue of DAS as this is also included in the follow-up report.
The aim is to ensure a positive DAS for the budget year 2003.
I must reiterate on the Commission's behalf that we, for our part, cannot promise when a positive statement of assurance will be issued by the Court of Auditors for the means of payment as well, as this decision is a matter for the Court of Auditors, which has not set itself any benchmark stating when a statement of assurance will be granted.
However, I believe that during the eighteen months of discussions on the 1999 discharge procedure, we have concluded that it would be a welcome step if we could find common indicators by which to identify and measure progress on financial management.
I assume that this issue will also feature in the budget discharge for 2000.
In particular, the Commission has reformed the system of financial management.
If allegations of poor management are made, we investigate them, and if allegations of fraud are made, OLAF investigates them.
I refute any claim that an investigation by OLAF would be a delaying tactic.
This is not the case: OLAF was set up in order to investigate allegations of this kind!
Let me make it clear that there has never been a complaint that the Commission has tried to influence the findings of an OLAF investigation in any way.
It would be foolish of us to do anything of the kind, for OLAF is an important body, not only in intensifying cooperation between Member States on combating fraud; it is, of course, also a sound and objective instrument by which to investigate internal matters.
I am gratified by yesterday's judgment by the European Court of Justice.
OLAF and its significance have been enhanced as a result of the ECJ judgment.
The European Union's budget will undoubtedly continue to grow.
There are new tasks ahead, and, of course, enlargement, in particular, represents a new and major challenge in the field of financial management.
Against this background, I am sure that future discharge procedures and follow-up reports will raise a great many important issues which I hope we can resolve together with the same effectiveness as has been evident in the 1999 budget discharge.
I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again for his collaboration.
Mr President, I am sorry to take the floor again, but I am a little surprised that there is a report from Mr Van Buitenen of which I have been unaware.
I should like to say here in the House - and this is something of which I am totally convinced - that that man should be removed from the Commission.
He smashes and destroys European cooperation because his life' s work is to set himself up in opposition and to carry out assignments we cannot live with.
I am very sorry to see something like this appear at the last minute, but I want to recommend to the Commission that it get rid of this man once and for all. He is a thorn in the side of all of us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Supplementary estimates for 2002 - DAB 1/2002
Mr President, I shall be discussing both documents together, not only that on Parliament' s budget but also that on the Convention, a report which I drafted together with Mr Costa Neves, for both reports are closely connected.
The Convention on the European Union' s future commences tomorrow.
We are therefore in good time to commit the funding for this.
The Convention offers a good opportunity to obtain a more decisive institution, to bring about more efficiency in this House and also to increase the legitimacy of the institutions.
The concept of such a meeting of representatives of Parliament and governments was born here in this House.
The European Parliament sets great store by the success of this Convention.
This is one of the reasons why we agreed to an accelerated procedure.
I therefore hope that Parliament makes it possible for the supplementary and amending budget No 1/2002 to be approved tomorrow, to coincide with the start of the Convention.
I should like to single out a few details of the Convention' s budget.
The Council' s Secretariat-General has made an estimate and arrived at an amount of approximately EUR 10.5 million for a 10-month period, until December 2002.
Part of this amount, EUR 6.5 million, will be payable by the participants: the three institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - and the governments and parliaments of the Member States or the candidate countries.
This, for example, covers all kinds of travel expenses which are usually borne by the institutions or the national governments.
This leaves us with a balance of some EUR 4 million. This is the amount which actually matters for this is the Convention' s own budget.
How will this EUR 4 million be managed?
It is only a small amount, of course, but, politically speaking, it is very important for the three institutions to have a sufficient say in the budget.
On a limited, practical level, it goes without saying that the Convention and its Praesidium will decide on how this budget will be spent.
But if expense funds are moved elsewhere, for example if more funding is needed for daily expenses, to the detriment of the forum for NGOs and citizens, then that is a political matter.
Then it is important, particularly for a Parliament which wants to play an important role in the Convention, to have a say in the budget.
The problem, however, is that the Convention itself has no legal basis and that the normal budgetary principles did not, therefore, apply.
The Member States insisted that Parliament and the Council should not form the two arms of the budgetary authority, but that the EU Member States as a whole should have the final word.
Although this was inopportune for us, we showed an understanding of this problem in the negotiations and arranged matters in such a way that the Member States were eventually able to give their seal of approval, though not before the three institutions had given their avis conforme.
Accordingly, the Member States can only approve something if the three institutions agree.
As a result, the European Parliament has acquired the right of veto, we have a say in the budget, we also have the right to information and to peruse documentation, we can give discharge and such like, and we have therefore, in practice, held on to the important achievements of Parliament.
I am very aware that this solution is not very attractive on the surface. We would, of course, have preferred it if the amount had been included in the budget in the normal way, but this is how it was, for there was no legal basis.
Seen against this backdrop, I therefore think that the Committee on Budgets has achieved a very respectable result.
Despite this, there has been some criticism.
I was at the Bureau today and, there too, concern was expressed about the role of Parliament and about the implications of Parliament not answering to the Council but to the Member States as a whole.
There was also concern in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
This is the reason why we have included a long amendment in the resolution which expressly states the achievements of the agreement and which also states that this agreement in sui has no legal character. It forms an exception, an agreement that only applies to this particular situation.
I hope that this addition, in which we expressly state that the agreement is an exception, as well as the fact that we managed to retain Parliament' s say in the budget after all, will lead to wide support for this agreement.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the consensus achieved between the institutions in the trialogue held on 18 February, Parliament is now, I believe, able to give its assent to the Draft supplementary and amending budget No 1/2002, which deals with the financial resources intended for the special 'Fund' that will cover the spending of the Convention on the future of the European Union from the first day it begins its work.
The work has been carried out swiftly and, in my opinion, well.
Given the need to ensure that all the factors that might contribute to the effectiveness of the Convention' s works are put in place in good time, its budgetary framework has already been defined, in accordance with the rules of transparency and institutional balance.
The particular nature of the Convention explains the specific characteristics of its legal and budgetary frameworks, revealed immediately by the very existence of the 'Fund' , and by the fact that this is subject to exceptional financial rules.
Particular account has therefore been taken of the temporary nature of the new body and the requirement for greater flexibility has been met.
The factors I have mentioned form the basis of a specific interinstitutional agreement, which defines, in particular, the sum of the contributions from the institutions providing the finance, which are Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as Mrs Buitenweg already mentioned.
Under the terms of the agreement reached in the trialogue of 18 February, the full involvement of Parliament is, therefore, guaranteed at all stages of the life of the 'Fund' , (created by intergovernmental decision) - it must be stressed - particularly with regard to the processes of transferring appropriations and of discharge. The exceptional nature of the initiative and, as a correlation, that of the applicable rules is perfectly clear.
I should like to conclude by thanking all my fellow Members for their cooperation, and I would specifically like to highlight the work of those who took part in the trialogue, Reimer BÃ¶ge and Kathalijne Buitenweg, as well as the contribution of the Committees on Constitutional Affairs and on Budgetary Control, which helped to focus attention on certain aspects.
I also hope that, by means of this budgetary procedure, we will remain associated with a Convention that could well make history.
Mr President, let me begin by saying that it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to address the House under your Presidency for the first time.
I should like to make it clear that I am speaking primarily on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The rapporteurs - whom I also wish to congratulate on their work - have both pointed out that the Committee on Budgetary Control gave this matter very careful consideration and this is reflected in the reports.
We did so because we want the proceedings of the Convention to be a success.
This is our unanimous view, and I would like to make that clear.
On this basis, we will be voting for the supplementary and amending budget which is contained in the report submitted to this House by the Committee on Budgets.
However, it must be clear that this extraordinary budgetary procedure is a one-off; under no circumstances can it constitute a precedent for the future.
This has been emphasised by the rapporteurs.
Furthermore, the budgetary transactions must be conducted with maximum transparency and clarity, not least in order to justify the trust and hopes invested in the Convention.
Although the Committee on Budgets is satisfied with the agreed procedures, a number of key issues remain unresolved as regards budgetary control.
We have set these out in our statement, which was drafted in great haste, and we note that some of these points have been included in the resolution, for which we are grateful.
The main concern, from our point of view, is the granting of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget which, under the Treaty, is the prime and sole decision of Parliament and is normally non-negotiable.
Yet Article 20 of the Council Decision on the financing of the Convention states that the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States shall give a discharge to the Secretary-General of the Convention, after Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall have consented thereto.
What exactly does this mean, given that the terms assent or avis conforme are not defined in the various language versions? What procedures are envisaged for this process?
A satisfactory solution has yet to be found in this respect.
The second issue which inevitably arises is Parliament's access to documents.
The Treaty clearly states that the Parliament must receive all documents and information which it deems necessary to the discharge resolution procedure.
Yet Article 4 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets merely refers to the Court of Auditors in this context.
This does not reflect the spirit of the Treaty.
As has already been noted, this is a sui generis procedure which diverges in part from the Treaty.
Nonetheless, Parliament must have full and free access to all documents.
I welcome Article 5 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets, which stresses that budgetary procedures, in particular on discharge, will have to comply with ordinary law, should the Convention's remit be extended beyond the period originally projected.
I would like to reiterate my hope that we will be able to adopt this report tomorrow and thus get the Convention off to a good start .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we have to vote on a supplementary and amending budget which, without doubt, is, and will remain, unique in the history of this Parliament, for we are negotiating a figure which amounts to 0.005% of the European Union budget and have even arranged a debate specifically for this purpose.
We asked Commissioner Schreyer to appear before this House to discuss the reports and the action we are taking.
There is good reason to discuss these matters, for they concern the financing of the Convention.
This House pushed harder than any other European institution for the setting up of the Convention; we promoted and demanded it.
We demanded it because we believe it is necessary to develop and introduce new procedures in Europe in order to improve interinstitutional relations and the interdependence between the three institutions.
This means that there must be mutual respect, an awareness of roles, and transparency.
The Spanish Presidency's initial proposal on the management of the funds necessary for the financing of the Convention alarmed us all, for it stipulated that the Council alone would provide the money, administer it and - above all -monitor how it is spent.
It made no reference at all to Parliament!
Of course, under no circumstances can this be a precedent for future relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The Committee on Budgets and this House firmly rejected this model.
In doing so, we had to adopt an accelerated procedure as there was no time to follow our usual procedure.
Indeed, we had to involve coordinators to discuss the matter.
We could not even make proper preparations within the Committee on Budgets.
Nonetheless, we did so because we were keen to ensure that the Convention could be launched tomorrow.
What this House has achieved is to ensure that in conformity with our powers, we are now part of the budgetary authority as regards the allocation of funds.
We are one of the two elements of the budgetary authority whose task is to decide on the allocation of funds.
Transfers of funds can only be carried out with our consent, which is also necessary for the granting of discharge.
This gives rise to other issues and we have discussed these as well.
In the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the solution identified is a good one.
We have, however, gone one better, for our colleagues from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control have added an extra dimension, which is all to the good.
We will certainly ensure that the procedure adopted for the Convention, and the implementation of this procedure, do not become a blueprint for any other institutions which may be set up at European level at any time in the future.
One existing institution - namely Coreper - will assume a function which has not been assigned to it at all at European level.
It will be the body to which Parliament, the Council and the Commission grant the right to consent to discharge.
It is astonishing: the Council will grant consent for the discharge of Coreper - one of its own institutions!
This is very bizarre.
This will not be a blueprint for any future arrangements in the European Union, and the discharge procedure will not be carried out on this basis in any other context.
We will vigorously resist any moves in this direction.
Parliament will defend its rights, and we will monitor developments very closely.
However, we will vote in favour of the report tomorrow because we recognise that the Convention must be able to start its work.
It is important to send out a positive signal to Europe by demonstrating that we are no longer applying the old procedures but are adopting a new approach, a new direction, and are shaping the future of Europe!
Thank you Mr Walter for your excellent speech, but I have to say that I am not the good fairy today; it is Mr Costa Neves, who had five minutes and only spoke for three.
Mr President, the proposal to free up EUR 4 million for the Convention, which commences tomorrow, was rushed through the institutions at breakneck speed.
We have therefore witnessed a complete change from the sluggishness of the decision-making process for which, with good reason, we are often blamed.
Having said this, the funds are community funds raised by the citizens.
Without giving a value judgment here about the Convention phenomenon, it is evident that it entails costs.
Given the Convention' s working method, the lion' s share of these costs, however, will be accounted for in terms of the normal activities of national parliaments and European institutions.
This does not detract from the fact that these costs should also be made transparent, like those required for making infrastructure available.
Neither the Convention' s character, nor the urgency, can absolve the Council or Parliament from their joint responsibility for the EU budget.
This fund of EUR 4 million should also be spent in a transparent and effective manner and will, inter alia, cover the costs of the chairman and the secretariat.
Precisely at a time when the remuneration of expenses is high on the agenda in this House, it is important that the Convention too pursue a responsible policy.
Reports about exorbitant remuneration can best be refuted if transparency is in place.
There should certainly not be a whiff of profiteering surrounding a project concerning Europe' s future.
There are no objections, as long as this fund still has a healthy balance at the end of 2002.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the setting up of the Convention is indeed a step of extraordinary significance.
I believe that the Convention on the future of the European Union will shape the face of Europe.
I am pleased that it has been possible to reach an agreement, an understanding, on its financing despite the misleading speculation at the outset, especially concerning the amount of funding necessary.
As has already been mentioned, the costs for this year are estimated to total EUR 10.5 million.
Part of these costs will be covered by the Member States or candidate countries, namely the travel expenses for their members.
Most of the costs will, however, be borne by the European institutions.
I should particularly like to mention Parliament's contribution here, which will be provided as infrastructure resources, namely translation and interpretation.
One estimate reveals that a further EUR 4 million will be required for other sundry expenses.
What are these other sundry expenses?
They include, for example, the funding of any studies which may be required, or, perhaps, additional translation services.
The estimate thus stands at EUR 4 million, and a consensus has been achieved very quickly on how these EUR 4 million are to be provided: EUR 400 000 from the Council, EUR 1 million from Parliament, and EUR 2.6 million from the Commission.
These resources will be paid directly, via the supplementary budget, into a fund which will then be available to the Convention.
I believe that with the Interinstitutional Agreement, to be signed tomorrow, our discussions have resulted in an arrangement which will ensure extraordinary transparency.
In this way, all three institutions will be involved in setting the budget for the Convention, making any amendments to this budget, and granting discharge. In this context, the prior assent of all three institutions will be required, especially in respect of the discharge.
The institutions will not be dealt with en bloc; voting will not be based on majorities. Instead, the assent of each individual institution will be required.
Clearly, this is a quite exceptional model, and I am pleased that this point is emphasised again by this House in its resolution.
It is entirely in the Commission's interests - and let me stress this point - for this exceptional nature to be underlined.
The Convention is exceptional, and the solution which we have found makes it clear, above all, that it is in the interests of all three institutions to ensure that the proceedings of the Convention are a success.
Let me conclude by reiterating one key point: despite all the speculation, we have achieved a good solution very quickly, and it would be a very positive step if the signing of the Interinstitutional Agreement, together with the adoption of the resolution on the supplementary and amending budget, could take place tomorrow.
In conjunction with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets, we will thus have made a significant contribution to establishing conditions for its success.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
EU relations with South Caucasus
The next item is the debate on the report (Ã5-0028/2002) by Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the European Union's relations with the South Caucasus, under the partnership and cooperation agreements.
Mr President, the South Caucasus, that is to say Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, is a region with which one quickly falls in love, with fantastic people and amazing countryside.
At the same time, it is a region that easily causes even its best friends to despair.
Only in the last few weeks, preliminary census figures have shown that Georgia and Armenia have each lost approximately a million people since independence.
It could scarcely be any clearer that post-Soviet social and economic policy has been a total failure.
The Soviet planned economy has only partly been replaced by a normal market economy.
Instead, widespread corruption flourishes, based on clan loyalties and mafia domination.
However, the catastrophic situation is not entirely self-inflicted.
A study by the Centre for European Policy Studies describes developments during the 1990s as being 'partly a result of liberalisation ... caused by transition to a free market system' .
The wretched economic and social situation has exacerbated the political, cultural and national conflicts that characterise the area.
Unfortunately, there are no clear signs of solutions to the conflicts concerning, for example, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia or Abkhazia.
Sometimes, there is positive news, such as President Shevardnadze' s appointment of a mediator from Abkhazia considered acceptable to all the parties, the regular discussions between Presidents Alijev and Kocharian concerning Nagorno-Karabakh or Turkey' s recent decision to make it easier for Armenians to obtain visas.
Just as often, however, there are worrying reports concerning, for example, an escalation in Georgian protests on the border with Abkhazia, increased tension on the border between Georgia and Chechnya and the cessation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani discussions at presidential level following the Key West Summit in April of last year.
Against that background, it is no exaggeration to state that the South Caucasus is a powder keg that could explode at any moment.
The risks are not reduced by the fact that the area is a transport route for the Caspian Sea' s and Central Asia' s gas and oil field and is situated in the vicinity of Afghanistan, a factor which has led to reports to the effect that Al-Qaida members may be found in the border country between Georgia and Russia.
That has now in turn caused the United States to send troops to a country which still accommodates Russian military bases.
The South Caucasus can be designated a test case for the EU' s peace policy.
At the Gothenburg Summit, a programme was adopted for the prevention of violent conflicts.
A civil peace corps could constitute a tool for such an action plan, designed to prevent conflicts.
I also propose that the EU draw up a clear strategy for the South Caucasus, benefiting from lessons learned from the Stability Pact for South-East Europe.
If it is to be possible to implement this, the EU' s presence in the region must be strengthened by full representation in Jerevan and Baku too, and not only, as at present, in Tbilisi.
The environmental situation in the South Caucasus is alarming.
The nuclear power station in Medzamor must, as agreed, be shut down by no later than 2004.
For this to be possible, alternative energy sources are obviously required, a need which the EU could help meet on the basis of its experience.
The EU must also continue its attempts to get regional cooperation projects under way, especially when it comes to the railway line between Baku and Nakhichevan.
The vast majority of politicians, intellectuals and representatives of independent grassroots movements in the region have expressed a strong desire to be bound more closely to Europe.
This has partly happened because the three states are members of the Council of Europe.
At the same time, many also have a strong desire to see their countries become members of the European Union.
I think that the European Parliament should give the clear answer that the countries of the South Caucasus are, of course, entitled to become Member States of the European Union if they so wish.
With regard to the amendments, I recommend approving all of these apart from Amendments Nos 2, 14 and 16.
I would particularly advise against approving Amendment No 2 because such approval would mean a sudden U-turn, unsubstantiated by new arguments, in relation to the position held by the European Parliament since 1987.
I am conscious of the fact that there are Armenian circles that try to exploit the events of 1915 to excuse today' s Armenian politics.
It is, however, clear from the report that I have not been influenced by this factor.
This report is very critical of the Armenian occupation of Azerbaijani territory.
That does not, however, mean that history has to be re-written.
After the First World War, Turkish courts sentenced those mainly responsible - Enver Pacha and many others - to the most severe penalty under the law, partly for their responsibility for the mass murders of Armenians.
It is a mystery to me why, 80 years later in Turkey, the attempt should be made to brush all this under the carpet.
All nations have skeletons in their historical cupboards.
Those who recognise this and openly come to terms with their pasts command respect, while those which deny and conceal their pasts mostly evoke surprise and disappointment.
Mr President, may I start by congratulating you and wishing you all the best for your term in office. May I also congratulate Mr Gahrton on a job very well done and on the skill he demonstrated in reconciling the basic positions of the various political groups on the individual issues and setting them out in his report.
It was a painstaking task but it has brought about a well-turned, balanced text which, with the members' additional amendments, is a realistic and objective summary of the current situation in the South Caucasus, the problems and the prospects outlined and the various dimensions and parameters which colour relations between third countries in the region and the European Union.
Given the generally-accepted view that the region of the South Caucasus is especially important to Europe and the fact that the European Union has taken various political and economic steps to express its desire to support the process of safeguarding reform and political stability and establishing the rule of law in these countries, I think it is worth pointing out the advisability of reinforcing the role of the European Union in formulating a strategy to resolve the problems in the region, while taking account of the specific national and historical sensibilities of these nations and encouraging neighbouring countries, especially Russia, Iran and Turkey, to make a constructive contribution towards the peace process in the South Caucasus.
The report rightly calls in this context for Turkey, which has a partnership agreement with the European Union, to prove itself worthy of its European ambitions by terminating the blockade of Armenia and creating a basis for reconciliation with it in line with the compromise set out in paragraph 15 of the report, which I urge the House to adopt.
Russia is called upon to play an equally important and pivotal role in averting conflict in the South Caucasus and resolving the highly sensitive energy question, with the countries in the region involved either as power producers or consumers.
I should like to close by stressing that the European Union's interests in the South Caucasus have to be maintained and stated consistently, with active support for the desire expressed by these countries to belong to Europe and with close collaboration between them and the European Union and its institutions in all sectors.
Congratulations!
Mr Gahrton' s report is an excellent, balanced report calling for a greater European Union presence in a bridge area between Asia and Europe.
The southern Caucasus could become a calvary but it could also remain a powder keg.
Behind the essentially peaceful facade, tensions are rising which could explode given the right political situation.
It would therefore be as well to play down the age-old disputes between the Turks and the Armenians.
We hope that paragraph 15, upon which we are going to vote tomorrow, which is in line with the policies of many international bodies, will be a useful step in this direction.
If the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy' s proposal is endorsed by the majority, we will henceforth be able to start to look towards the future and leave the past behind.
In addition to the ethical and political issues, major economic interests are at play in the region: there is controversy regarding the exploitation of the Caspian Sea and the routes for the oil pipelines are still provisional; there is the potential for great pressure to be put on Russian policy, which applies different criteria for each of the three countries and in respect of the ethnic minority too.
It would appear that the OSCE Minsk Group is exploring a fresh approach to the compromise for Nagorno-Karabakh and the various occupied territories behind closed doors.
Let us hope so!
Mr Gahrton is right to call for a European Union special envoy to be appointed for the southern Caucasus.
A conference between the countries of the southern Caucasus and the European Union could also yield results and make it clear whether it would be better to adopt the 'step-by-step' method or an overall solution.
Mr President, our fellow MEP, Mr Gahrton, and I usually disagree about most things where the EU is concerned.
It is therefore especially pleasing to have the opportunity this evening to praise Mr Gahrton for what is in every respect a well balanced and sound report on the South Caucasus.
The EU must have a clear and well thought-out policy for a region as important as this on the border between Europe and Asia.
We are aware of Russia' s significant role, of the opportunities - but also problems - presented by oil and of the region' s increasingly strategic role following the war in Afghanistan.
Today, five American military advisers went to Georgia to train the army there in counter-terrorism.
The EU can operate as an active mediator.
It has an important task in terms of strengthening the democratic forces and civil society and combating the environmental problems.
Mr Gahrton mentioned the fact that a first important step in strengthening the EU' s presence in the region would be to set up delegations in both Azerbaijan and Armenia, but more money from the EU is also needed for the region.
Mr Gahrton and I are in agreement.
There needs to be more EU involvement in the South Caucasus too.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should give a very warm welcome to Mr Gahrton' s report, which offers the three republics of the South Caucasus region the prospect of a way out of a situation marked by regional conflicts and a state of uneasy truce, so that they can finally find the path towards the durable peace that each of the republics and their populations desire.
We have the political responsibility to help them in their quest.
The reflections and proposals contained in the report also give an indication of the potential of the European Union to wage an active diplomatic campaign and to affirm its status and its role, and these are not fine words or empty rhetoric.
Be they friends or rivals, these three republics in the South Caucasus are sister nations. The doors of the Council of Europe have been opened to them, and in that forum of discussion and exchange many of the tensions between them have already been eased.
This antechamber of Europe must offer them new prospects of even closer fellowship with the European family, so that the Union can ultimately snuff out their age-old tensions.
This highlights our responsibility, for the world and our continent are becoming increasingly interdependent.
Besides the familiar question of oil, water is now becoming an equally strategic issue for the entire region, and before, on top of all this, an accident occurs in the Metsamor nuclear power station, it is also our responsibility to help these three countries to pre-empt such a threat.
Mr President, the report contains a long list of good intentions for the South Caucasus, which is undoubtedly an unstable problem area.
Europe naturally has an interest in the conflicts in the area being solved, but I must express doubts as to whether the EU is in a position to play such a large role in the area as this report proposes.
I therefore wish to emphasise that, even if the possibility of EU membership is only mentioned as a long-term prospect, these countries do not constitute natural candidates for EU membership.
All these many fine words are scarcely enough to solve the major problems in the area, and I would venture to doubt whether the Commission has the capacity to implement the desired changes.
I should like to add a few remarks on Amendment No 2 to paragraph 15.
I think it wise of Mr Duff to propose a formula that simply talks about reconciling historical differences.
I would therefore call for a vote in favour of the amendment.
Events during the First World War, which neither the British nor the American governments were then able, following investigations, to characterise as genocide, cannot profitably be discussed in the terms they are discussed in paragraph 15 of the report.
That is not the way to achieve the normalisation of economic and diplomatic relations.
It is true that the land border between Turkey and Armenia is closed, but there is no question of a blockade in the ordinary sense of the word.
There are air links between the countries, and Armenian citizens are able to travel into Turkey.
The closure of the road and railway links is a consequence of other unsolved aspects of the political and diplomatic situation.
What the EU can do is work towards a combined negotiated solution to the issues that divide the two countries.
Reflection and diplomacy are required.
The European Parliament will not promote a solution by setting itself up as a judge of events in the distant past.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote in favour of the report on condition that Amendment No 2 to paragraph 15 is adopted.
Mr President, I cherish very intense, personal memories of South Caucasus.
More than ten years ago, I was there as a journalist and followed the process of post-Soviet decolonisation.
The hospitality and geniality of the local population have always stayed with me.
At the same time, however, inter-ethnic conflicts have darkened the political horizon of the three Transcaucasian republics.
The rapid, armed escalation of these conflicts is still a burden upon the entire region.
Just think of the explosive centres of crisis formed by Abkhazia and Nagorny-Karabakh.
Mr Gahrton has attempted to unravel the Caucasian knot of conflict, which is a nigh impossible task.
The aim is to provide specific recommendations for a constructive European contribution towards the pacification and reconstruction of the region.
I would particularly like to underline his appeal for prioritising European support for establishing the rule of law in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
A western Caucasus specialist told me yesterday that this matter of concern requires more coordination between the Member States and the European institutions.
The Commission may be able to tell me whether it shares this concern.
More so than with the draft resolution, reading the explanatory statement to the Gahrton report evoked a sense of protest in me.
I should like to single out two controversial points.
Firstly, Mr Gahrton' s analysis and interpretation of the post-Communist socio-economic collapse of the Transcaucasian republics has no regard for the legacy of the Soviet economy, or the mockery which native leaders made of the privatisation process.
Secondly, the rapporteur is very critical of the role of the United States in the region.
I doubt whether the republics are in danger, or should live in fear, of 'neo-colonialism' from specifically that quarter.
Meanwhile, the idea of an 'Organisation for Economic Cooperation in South Caucasus' appeals to me greatly.
It is a practical step towards establishing mutual trust, turning back the process of regional economic disintegration and re-creating a transnational system of infrastructure.
Current European aid projects, including Traceca and Inogate, are ideally suited to these goals and, what is more, prove that European efforts of this kind would be worthwhile in the southern Caucasus.
Mr President - I am delighted to see you perched so high up there, if I may say so - Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Per Gahrton, for the many efforts he has made to try and bring this report up to an acceptable level.
He reminded us very clearly in his introductory remarks that we are not there yet, that we still have a very long way to go.
Today, as he said, the South Caucasus is a powder keg; as for the North Caucasus, the less said, the better.
Today in the South Caucasus there are the unresolved questions of Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, Adzharia and so on.
All of these issues have been smouldering for years.
In thirteen years of transition from Communism to democracy, during which time the European Union has invested a billion euros in the region, I do not believe we can claim that European policy in that part of the world has been a resounding success.
As Mr Gahrton said, the underlying question concerns these nations' future prospects, and the Commission in particular - with the complicity of the Council, as usual - is refusing to offer any enticing political prospects to these countries and seems to reject the view that the only criterion for membership of the European Union is the fact that the people of a particular country feel European at heart.
One need only travel to Georgia, Azerbaijan or Armenia to ascertain that the people of these countries feel European, and so we have no reason whatsoever to deny them the prospect of a European future, which we have been doing in countless ways.
The other extremely serious problem, and one for which President Prodi bears the brunt of responsibility, is the failure of the European Union to safeguard its fundamental interests, the fact that it signs agreements, month after month, year upon year, with the Russian Federation.
As for the pipelines, all of them have to pass through Poland to reach Russia.
No energy-supply lines can pass through the Caucasus.
If it were not for the Americans, we would not even have the little pipeline that passes through Azerbaijan and Georgia.
This is the sort of policy that breeds dependence rather than interdependence.
Commissioner Nielsen evidently believes that the Caucasus is a region with a population density akin to that of Greenland or the Antarctic.
That is not the case.
The Commission is forgetting that the Caucasus region is the doorway to Central Asia, which will be the chief supplier of the energy of tomorrow.
This is the prospect that the Commission and the Council are presenting to us, but we in this Parliament could and should be calling on the Commission to take a decisive step, to make a bold political gesture by inviting these three countries to become candidates for accession to the European Union, to accede in ten years' time, once they are ready.
They certainly could be ready by then if this prospect were set before them now.
As things stand, the only prospect is that the powder keg of which Per Gahrton spoke is likely to set off a few more explosions.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees is most grateful to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for enabling us, with Mr Gahrton's report, to focus in more detail on the South Caucasus region in this debate today.
This region on Europe's periphery draws on a wealth of cultural and Christian traditions.
It is Europe's gateway to Asia.
With the troika initiative and the visit to South Caucasus, the European Union has sent out encouraging signals, but things are moving far too slowly.
What is especially alarming, as far as south-east Europe is concerned, is that Russia suspects that al-Qaeda fighters may have taken refuge in Georgia and has announced that it will expand its action throughout Georgia.
Georgia, on the other hand, is hoping for support from the US, which is already responding.
But where does this leave Europe?
We have already discussed the aftermath of 11 September in the European Parliament in Strasbourg and expressed concerns about the difficulties which might arise if the situation in the region escalates.
Unfortunately, it seems that our concerns are justified, for events have now taken a truly dramatic turn.
In recent centuries, South Caucasus has constantly been riven by conflict. Surely, in 2002, it must be possible to stabilise these regions at last and give the people there a future and the chance to live their lives in peace and with some measure of lasting prosperity in their home territories.
All three countries are striving to establish democratic structures and assert their independence from their over-mighty neighbours.
Yet if we consider that Russian troops are still present in two of these countries, and that while Azerbaijan has been liberated, one third of its territory is effectively out-of-bounds across Armenia, these are issues which are not only of concern to the local population, but could also unleash a new wave of aggression.
I therefore address my comments to the Commissioner in particular: oil could undoubtedly become a key issue here, and I wish that as well as America and Russia asserting their interests, the Europeans - in the countries which still count as Europe - would not only take action but would also ensure that stable development takes place in these countries. After all, they are trying to establish democracies, but it is a difficult process.
If corruption and crime gain the upper hand here, life for ordinary people will become intolerable.
I think that as Europeans, we face an enormous task: to respond as quickly as we can and do our utmost to play a positive role in this conflict in order to give these countries a future.
Mr President, the rapporteur has presented an impressive report which makes it clear that the South Caucasus states are of key importance for Europe's security.
In particular, the fossil fuels and energy reserves known or suspected to exist in abundance in these countries, and their strategic position as the new 'silk route' for oil and gas, give them a global political dimension.
This is both a blessing and a curse for them.
At present, promoting social and economic development in these states is undoubtedly the imperative.
Against this background, the resources allocated by the EU naturally seem distinctly insubstantial.
It goes without saying that closer ties with the European Union are a desirable objective.
The EU must not renege on existing agreements such as the closure of the nuclear power station in Armenia.
As regards the fraught historical relations between Turkey and Armenia, we must avoid awakening hopes on either side that the European Union will assume the role of referee in this conflict.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to stress that item 15 of the resolution, which will be put to the House' s vote and which calls on Turkey to create the conditions for reconciliation with Armenia, is highly apt and important.
As we know, reconciliation between these countries is one of the key prerequisites for the establishment of peace in the Transcaucasian region, and the international community has every right to expect Turkey, as a major power, to conduct itself in a responsible manner on this important issue.
Nobody can understand why the Turkish government continues to reject dialogue and to maintain a policy of systematic hostility towards its small northern neighbour, opposing the establishment of diplomatic relations and maintaining a stringent and damaging blockade that it imposed in 1993.
This blockade must be lifted unconditionally, and its lifting must not be linked in any way to a requirement that Armenia drop her legitimate demand for international recognition of the genocide committed against the Armenian people.
On the contrary, the abandonment of all revisionism by Turkey, in the same way as Germany has done, which would form the basis of a profound reconciliation with Armenia is, as we are well aware, the only means of guaranteeing the establishment of lasting peace in the South Caucasus.
That is why, Mr President, we shall support item 15 of the draft resolution.
Thank you very much Mr President.
I am very happy with Mr Gahrton' s report because it makes a timely and useful contribution to our discussions on Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, three countries, currently members of the Council of Europe, which have not reached the level of political and economic development to which they aspire and which we would want them to have.
The conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia still represent the greatest threat to the stability and development of the region and of its neighbours.
These conflicts, at a standstill today, could tomorrow become new danger zones, and, for this reason, I fully agree with Mr Gahrton' s point that the European Union must make a huge effort to help solve these problems, with a view to promoting the causes of peace and development.
We are not starting with a blank slate, which is why before looking at some of the key points of this report, I shall give a brief summary of our current relations with this region.
The partnership and cooperation agreements that we have signed with each of the three countries provide a unique platform for cooperation in a broad range of fields, from political dialogue, trade and investment, to relations with civil society.
The implementation of these agreements, which entered into force in 1999, is gaining impetus.
Furthermore, we are continuing to provide considerable levels of aid to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
The European Union has provided some EUR one billion since 1991, the year in which these countries gained independence.
Last year, the European Union sent the region a clear sign of its wish to make a greater contribution to conflict prevention, to conflict resolution and to rehabilitation following conflicts.
In February 2001, the first EU ministerial troika for the region conveyed this message, which was later confirmed in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 26 February.
In a joint statement adopted at the meetings of the Cooperation Council last October, the three partner countries explicitly expressed their satisfaction with the intentions of the Union.
Mr Gahrton draws our attention to some of the instruments we have used in other places and suggests that we apply them to the southern Caucasus: a common strategy, a stability pact, a special envoy and other measures.
Since we are aware that there are limits to what we can do, let us look at how far we can go and what the new financing needs are.
Instead of creating new instruments, we should focus on maximising the benefits of already existing instruments.
In this regard I should like to highlight three aspects of our discussion: firstly, the political will of the participants, above all else, is the key, the aspect most likely to result in progress.
In the current situation it is crucial that we maximise our efforts to support our commitments, particularly by means of political dialogue.
Difficult choices will have to be made and a culture of commitment to the southern Caucasus will have to be developed.
Secondly, in order for the European Union to be able to participate to the highest possible degree in conflict resolution, we must continue intensifying our common foreign and security policy as well as our role in the measures to promote conflict resolution.
I am referring, in particular, to the OSCE Minsk Group, to Nagorno Karabakh, to the friends of the Secretary General of Abkhazia and to the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia.
We have made progress recently; since last year, the Union European has been participating in the tasks of the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia, but a great deal remains to be done to ensure that the Union' s voice is heard in certain mediation circles.
Thirdly, we have to ensure that the southern Caucasus has a definitive place on the agenda of our relations with the main players in the region, such as Russia, Turkey, Iran and the United States, and as some of you have said, also in our own interest, amongst other things, for reasons of energy supply.
In conclusion, there is not a single and easy answer to the question of how to improve relations between the Union and the southern Caucasus.
The Gahrton report rightly reminds us that we have to work patiently, on various parallel levels, probably for a long period of time, within the limits of available resources and on the basis of the achievements of the last year.
The Commission wishes to explore new ways of promoting peace and development in the southern Caucasus.
I wish to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that at a certain point, there will have to be a limit to European integration, and I should like to point out that in terms of geographical proximity and of historical ties, we are closely connected to countries such as Morocco, Algeria or others on the shores of the Mediterranean.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Impact of transport on public health
The next item is the debate on the report (Ã5-0014/2002) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the impact of transport on health.
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to introduce my report at this evening's plenary session.
Colleagues will recall that this is an own-initiative report and in our early discussions in committee some concerns were expressed about the potentially enormous scope of a report on such a broad subject as transport and health.
We agreed that in order to be useful, we would need to prioritise the issues that we focussed on very rigorously.
For that reason I focussed this report on just two key issues: gaps in existing legislation and where further work can have genuine added value.
First, the introduction of health impact assessments for all major EU transport projects and policies is probably the single most important initiative which could help integrate transport and health policies and help to minimise the negative impact of transport on health.
The second issue I focussed on was the promotion within the bounds of subsidiarity of cycling and walking within EU transport policy.
This would have an enormous impact on maximising the positive effects of transport policy on health.
To demonstrate why action is urgent and necessary, my report summarises some of the key negative health impacts arising from transport growth. These include air pollution, noise, lack of physical movement and others.
To take just one of these, transport is now the dominant source of air pollution in urban areas and despite the past decade's improvements in air quality in Europe, close to 90% of the urban population is still exposed to excess ambient levels of particulate matter, NO2, benzene and ozone.
These can affect respiratory functions and lead to other health problems and diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
Although it is true that vehicles have become relatively less polluting, the effect in absolute terms is offset by the increase in the number of vehicles on the road together with the increases in the length and frequencies of journeys.
The significance of this was demonstrated by a recent study that found that air pollution now causes a higher mortality rate than road accidents.
This is also a very timely debate.
New evidence from scientists in California in just the past few weeks demonstrates that car fumes can actually cause asthma rather than only exacerbating asthma in existing sufferers.
New research in the UK, part-funded by the UK Government, reveals that children find it increasingly hard to breathe the closer they live to main roads.
So having focussed on two priority areas, I should explain the process used to identify those areas.
First, on health impact assessments: in all the relevant literature it is clear there is still a lack of integration of health issues into transport policy at EU level.
This was most recently and clearly evident in a synthesis report produced by the WHO and the UN Economic Commission for Europe in January of last year.
That report was called for by European ministers to provide an overview of relevant existing agreements and to provide further recommendations.
Their overwhelming conclusion was: "The main gap seems to lie in the lack of an overarching integration strategy which would bring together and use the synergies of policies and legislations relevant to transport, environment and health."
We also have an EU Treaty obligation to better integrate these fields.
Having spoken to a number of experts, it seems to me that health impact assessments should be introduced for all major EU transport policies and projects so that we can understand better the potential health risks and benefits of different proposals.
These analyses could be very helpfully integrated with strategic environmental assessments.
This proposal actually complements and builds on proposals that are currently being considered in the Commission's proposal for a new programme of Community action in the field of public health.
What I am proposing is that this commitment should now be implemented urgently as regards transport and health.
Some people will say that this methodology is not yet ready to be implemented.
I would counter that very strongly.
While this methodology, like all methodology, is still evolving there is more than enough knowledge to start implementing now.
