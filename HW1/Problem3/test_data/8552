The Commission has expressed a preference: for the time being, it does not want to draft new legislation on the matter, and this is for two reasons.
Firstly, in most of the Member States, the creation of public-private entities for the purposes of providing services of general economic interest is an altogether new and very innovative opportunity.
Non-binding clarifications in this area would enable us to provide the necessary guidelines, without stifling innovation.
Secondly, in 2004, after several years of intense debates, Parliament, the 15 Member States at that time and the Commission reached a compromise and adopted the current directives on public contracts.
Many Member States only implemented these directives this year, and some are working towards implementing them.
In order to legislate on mixed public-private partnerships, we need to review the 2004 compromise, renegotiate a new text with 27 - and no longer 15 - Member States and, in the event that a new compromise is reached, once again force the Member States to amend their national laws and their practices in relation to public contracts, even though the current rules are not yet well established.
That is why we think that it is better, at this stage, to choose a non-legislative path, just as most of the interested parties are requesting.
That is the point that I wanted to make on behalf of my colleague, Mr McCreevy, but you would be right in thinking that the Commissioner for Transport is also very much affected by these provisions.
I am now going to listen carefully to the various speeches made by the MEPs.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, much as I would like one quarter of the Commissioner's speaking time to explain the position of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the unfortunate fact is that I am not going to get it, but I am very grateful for the clear explanations that have been given today, particularly to the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, who has done something that is not customary in this House by accepting essential points from the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the course of the enhanced cooperation procedure.
We all agree on the line we take, although we do have our differences about such things as paragraph 5, which Mrs Weiler has reinserted by way of Amendment 20.
In the event of a legislative declaration, we will handle it by way of the codecision procedure, as provided for by Article 251.
This was a typical case for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in which we found the exact wording only after a vote during which we had sought out a compromise.
We should do things the other way round, and then there will be no differences after the vote either.
In accordance with the position that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted, I would opt for Mrs Weiler's Amendment 21, and my personal view is that we should incorporate this amendment, which envisages the possibility of these criteria being incorporated into Community law, and is therefore preferable to Amendment 20.
I believe that we would be doing the right thing by sticking to our line according to which there would be no new areas excluded from the tendering procedure, with the alternative route of supra-regional communal undertakings being cut off, and no extension being permitted to in-house businesses.
We would, however, like the Commission to clarify the issues thrown up by the ruling in the case of the City of Halle, among other rulings from the ECJ.
What we want, then, Commissioner, is not only a proposal for concessions, but also clarification of the outstanding legal issues relating to institutionalised public-private partnerships.
You, Commissioner, have told us where you stand.
That was clear - laudably so by the standards of a Commission that has again and again avoided taking a decision in recent years - and so we will find an agreed solution that will enable us to move on.
As I finish, I would like once more to thank Mrs Weiler for having done everything she could to achieve an across-the-board position, one that will enable us not only to withstand the rulings of the ECJ, but also to stand firm in the vigorous debates with the associations representing various interests.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the majority of the experiences of public-private partnerships in Europe concerns the construction and management of infrastructure and transport and logistics services.
In addition, public-private partnerships are perhaps the only way that private investment can be involved in creating this infrastructure.
For this reason I would like to raise just two points.
Firstly, as stated in the report, we need a legislative initiative on concessions, including concessions for construction and management.
There is a real need for legal certainty and for defining relations between public concessionary authorities and private concessionaires.
On the one hand, private concessionaires need to have the guarantee that contracts will be respected for as long as they are in force, and, on the other hand, the concessionary authorities must be able to rely on having fixed- or limited-term contracts, which can then be adapted to production conditions over time and put to the test of competition.
These are the two pivotal points on which I hope that the proposed legislation in question will be based.
Secondly, there is a need to encourage new forms of innovative financial engineering, such as the guarantee funds already provided for by the regulation on the funding of trans-European transport networks, so that they can be used as leverage and ensure that many more public-private partnerships also prove to be efficient and effective funding instruments for infrastructure which we all need and with which I am sure you are very familiar, Commissioner.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PL) Mr President, we are always complaining about the Member States' refusal to countenance even the slightest increase in their contribution to the Community's budget, and we are always saying that there is not enough money available to even out the regional differences in development and that Europe is developing too slowly.
We ought, therefore, to support the use of private money and know-how to promote development, instead of creating obstacles and difficulties.
The European Union should give absolute priority to the widespread dissemination of good practice in the area of public-private partnerships.
That is the bare minimum.
At the very least, the Union should invest in an Internet site, in the 20 official Community languages, which would be accessible to the general public.
Such a site would contain a description of the PPP system and its effects.
It would also provide examples of model PPP projects, enabling every municipality in Europe to have easy access to accounts of successful experiences. This would allow municipalities to learn from the past and to make use of that knowledge as they plan their own way forward.
I call on the European Commission to request such publicly accessible information from the European Investment Bank.
The EIB is currently preparing a purely internal, intergovernmental information system on PPPs that would not be accessible to the public in the Member States.
This is unacceptable.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, we are concerned here with a response to the Commission Green Paper on public-private partnerships, designed to investigate points that remain unclear, especially in what is known as the in-house area.
We are, however, all agreed that, as the Commissioner so wisely said, there is no need to tear up existing legislation on public procurement.
Public-private cooperation must favour competition and, above all, contribute to new thinking and increased efficiency within the public sector.
The Commission must now solve the problem - that being the aim - without legislating more than is necessary.
We do not, however, have closed minds on this point and, just as Mr Langen said, we thus support Amendment 21 by Mrs Weiler.
We have made a request for legislation on concessions, and the Commission has responded positively and quickly to this.
We are agreed about respecting the threshold values and about the need for normal legal principles to apply beneath those values where public procurement is not a requirement.
We do not wish to reduce the scope for public procurement.
Moreover, we unambiguously call on the Commission to propose solutions to the problems that exist in Germany, France and other countries when it comes to cooperation between local authorities, but not to forget less wealthy local authorities that wish to cooperate in sparsely populated areas in Member States such as Finland and Sweden.
If the Commission were not to carry out this task, it could no doubt expect heavy pressure to be placed on it by Parliament.
I am convinced that the Commission will do an excellent job of fulfilling this task, and we wish to give it time to consider our views on the Green Paper and to come up with proposals.
All the parties concerned should be involved in the continued process.
The committee can certainly be of help in increasing the level of knowledge in this difficult area.
Paragraphs 45 to 47 already guarantee more legal certainty and show that local authorities can cooperate.
In the future, we shall also have a clearer and more detailed view of how things are to work.
In conclusion, I wish sincerely to say a big thank you to Mrs Weiler for the splendid work she has done, as well as to the great many other people who have been involved.
Thank you very much.
We are obtaining a more competitive Europe with greater legal certainty.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, allow me first of all to thank all of my fellow Members, and in particular Mrs Weiler and Mr Langen, with whom we have done an outstanding piece of work.
Let us hope that the text will be adopted tomorrow.
It is quite simply a question of protecting the exercise of subsidiarity for PPPs, instruments that are very familiar to our local authorities, and have been for a great many years.
I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to legislate on concessions, which have been mixed up for too long with public contracts.
However, I shall state in this Chamber that I believe that legislation is also required for institutional public-private partnerships.
It is wrong to say that these are recent entities: semi-public companies have been around since 1955 in France and the Stadtwerke have been around for a very long time in Germany.
The fact is that subjecting them to two forms of competition today means putting an end to them.
What private partner would agree to work with a local authority that makes it compete twice over?
Furthermore, I would draw the Commissioner's attention to the risk run by inter-communal structures, which are in danger of being mixed up with private structures even though they are an entirely public means of organisation for local authorities that aspire to be large enough to be able to fulfil increasingly demanding obligations and public-service missions.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public procurement is of crucial importance in terms of budget and competition policy - on that we all agree.
Competitive tendering is a fit and proper way of determining the most economic way of providing public services, and, over and above that, mandatory Europe-wide tendering does something essential in terms of opening up the internal market to competition.
As rapporteur, Mrs Weiler has done a fine job of steering us, together, through the public procurement dossier - which is a difficult one - in an exemplary way.
It is thanks to her that we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have already managed to come up with plenty of workable compromises, so it is only right that we should take this opportunity to express our gratitude and particular appreciation to her, and both I and the other Members involved are certainly willing to do that.
I have advised my group to hold fast to what has emerged from this vote, and wish only to say something about the few contentious points.
In so doing, let me start with institutionalised public/private partnerships, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, the development of which should not be unduly restricted by legal regulation, and it became clear from the public consultation that people do not want it to be.
I therefore recommend that we go no further than an interpretative communication and guidelines that are comprehensible not only by lawyers but also by those who take decisions at the municipal level, which will not only afford greater flexibility than does legislation, but also - and above all - hold out the prospect of a rapid resolution to the legal uncertainties that are very definitely still there.
This is where the Commission needs to act as promptly as possible.
Moving on to inter-municipal cooperation, the second contentious point, I believe it to be self-evident that the municipalities should not in any way be hampered in their management of their own affairs, but equally self-evident, too, that this cannot mean that public/private partnerships should be generally exempted from the obligation to put work out to tender.
Although public authorities are not obliged to hand over to third parties the performance of functions for which a market exists, should they decide to entrust third parties with the performance of a service, they must be bound by a public tendering process, as is indeed clear from Article 295 of the European Communities Treaty, which requires neutrality in the application of internal market rules to public and private undertakings.
That, by the same token, makes cooperation between municipalities possible in principle, albeit subject to the restrictions that are so well stated in what is now paragraph 45 of the Weiler report, namely when cooperation between municipalities is for the purpose of administrative restructuring or where real in-house monitoring is provided for.
Perhaps I might be permitted to add something as I close, namely that people in Europe have had very varying experiences of public/private partnerships, and so I am certainly very glad to see that a start is to be made on an exchange of good practice, which will bring in its train more good examples of working PPPs.
I might also add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, wish to thank the rapporteur for her efforts, even though our group is rather less than satisfied with the final result that emerged from the committee, as a result of which I would like, this evening, to appeal to you all to rethink your position, even if only in part.
It is intercommunal cooperation, in the shape of intercommunal undertakings, that we see as the most important point, and I would like once more to make it clear - not least in response to those who have already spoken - that they have nothing whatever to do with the devolution of functions to third parties, but have to do rather with the municipalities deciding to perform services for the community.
It is lack of funds in public coffers and an ageing and numerically declining population - particularly in rural boroughs - not to mention greater critical awareness of the issues and the costs involved on the part of the public, that makes this form of cooperation the best for many local authorities in Europe, and often the only way available to them of modernising the services they provide.
So it is, then, that administrative services, water supply and drainage, playschools, schools and many cultural amenities are operated jointly, sometimes, indeed, across borders, examples of which can be found in the pre-school projects run together by French and German communities.
Europe should not be putting this sort of thing at risk, but rather enhancing it, so let me therefore commend to the House's support our Amendment 45, which is a compromise put together by Members from various groups, and which I hope will gain majority support tomorrow.
My second point has to do with concessions.
I dare say that I am more sceptical about public-private partnerships than are most of you, but I do, all the same, think it wrong to send out the message that public-private partnerships are being promoted and then demand that concessions be put out to tender in the same way as contracts, the performance of which was, of course, the basic rationale for the PPPs being set up in the first place.
I do not believe it is merely fortuitous that Parliament and the Council did not explicitly include concessions for services in the directive on the award of contracts, and I hope we will come to agree that what we do not want here is a requirement that they be put out to tender in the same way as contracts.
Services concessions are something different and need to be regulated in a different way.
As for 'in-house', what the European legislator really should have done about this was to clarify the conditions.
I do not regard a figure of 100% as sustainable.
What is needed, I think, is threshold values, and high ones at that, which must then actually be complied with.
It is, though, the legislators that should define them and not the ECJ.
(SK) Even though there is no uniform definition of public-private partnership (PPP) that would apply throughout the Community, a large number of projects have been successfully implemented in the European Union's freight and passenger railway transport sectors, as well as in the area of public health and education.
These successful projects provide sufficient justification for Parliament to take up the topic as well, and I welcome the Commission's communication on PPPs, which includes specific proposals drawn up on the basis of public consultation.
At the same time I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her well balanced report highlighting the need for legal certainty in this area.
Under PPP arrangements, private enterprises transfer their know-how to the public sector.
In my amendments, which have been incorporated into the report, I have therefore emphasised the need for establishing transparent mechanisms for private investors.
Investors should be given guarantees that their legal and financial interests will be safeguarded for the life of a contract and also that the terms and conditions of public tenders will remain unchanged during their period of applicability.
Due to lack of experience, the new Member States in particular are apprehensive of using PPPs.
Information gathered from the implementation of successful projects will help them to avoid repeating errors and procedures that have in practice ended in failure.
I am convinced that PPP projects will be able to attract the desired capital only if the interested parties within EU Member States are well informed and conform to the quality regulations and transparent rules of the Community.
These regulations and rules will help them build up infrastructure, the development of which has lagged behind due to underfunding.
This form of cooperation may also prove instrumental in helping bridge regional disparities and ensuring the sustainable development of Europe's poorer regions.
(DE) Mr President, I regard institutionalised public/private partnerships as a very important tool.
The legal uncertainty resulting from the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the case of the city of Halle shows just how necessary it is that legislators should do something about them, and it is surely not acceptable that the Commission should act without reference to anyone else in giving guidance as to the manner in which this problem should be addressed.
On the contrary, it is for the co-legislators, namely the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission together, to reach a joint decision as to how we in Europe are to deal with these issues.
The second point I would like to address briefly is inter-municipal cooperation, and this is where I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff, for it has been going on for a very long time; there is a very long tradition of it, not least in the Federal Republic of Germany, and it is something we should maintain.
Cross-border inter-municipal cooperation is at present a delicate shoot, and one that we must not destroy by declaring that these things should be left to the free market.
If they are, we can pack it all in on the spot, for we will have no further need of municipalities, and that is surely not the sort of Europe that we want to see.
(NL) Mr President, I was particularly involved in this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where Mr Langen was rapporteur, and I would congratulate both rapporteurs on the final result, although it is true that a certain amount is left to be desired.
There is, as I see it, a clear correlation with the discussion we had about the services of general economic interest, on which we took a decision in the previous plenary part-session.
In both cases, it was about the way in which decentralised authorities, service providers and citizens can be given more legal certainty, which can sometimes create conflict between the internal market rules, on the one hand, and the general interest which authorities need to serve on behalf of their citizens, on the other.
It is often the case that the Court of Justice has to be called upon or that the Commission gives interpretations of its own.
The important message in both those files has been that we, via the codecision procedure, really want to take political decisions in this area, and that it is also important that we ask the Commission, and really insist on this, to present legislative initiatives on which we can decide in codecision with this House and with the Member States and their parliaments.
That is the principal message I should once again like to take to the Commission in connection with this report.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of public-private partnerships has for some time been part of the new boundaries of welfare state systems within the European Union.
Its significance should be seen from a new perspective, through the interconnections with all the initiatives on which our services rely.
The common objective, which has been reaffirmed many times, including today, is to create a complete and clear legal framework within which local public authorities can make their own choices, aware of opportunities and constraints, principles to be respected and possible areas of freedom and innovation.
In the text on which we are voting, overlapping is apparent with the current regulations in the field of contracts, concessions and joint enterprises, and with the European Court of Justice guidelines.
However, the added value lies in the cross-cutting focus on the various ways in which alliances between the public and private sectors are built in the extremely sensitive field of services involving citizenship rights.
Two firm principles are needed.
Cut-backs on spending cannot come before or relax the requirements of service quality and safeguards for the rights of service providers.
The search for efficiency and innovation must be tied to guarantees of accessibility, transparency and non-discrimination.
This year has seen many initiatives in the field of services.
The hope is that, working on elements of various scales, we will be able to build a coherent scheme.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Weiler's report provides the clarity and transparency that we needed in relation to public-private partnerships, and thus allows us to change the wayward paths taken by the European courts and to improve the legal clarification for all of the actors concerned.
Concessions are all too often mixed up with public contracts: the latter concern the purchase of goods consumed by local authorities, while concessions offer public authorities the opportunity to delegate the completion of part of their tasks to a third party.
Therefore, we should have a law on these concessions and not a mere interpretative communication.
The same is true of institutionalised PPPs.
Their creation is currently being threatened by the rigours of case-law, which tends towards having two calls for competition when allocating work, something that is likely to seal the fate of semi-public companies.
I am therefore grateful to our rapporteur for having requested a legislative initiative on this subject.
Finally, in the Commission versus Spain judgment, the inter-communal structure has become a private partner for the Court of Justice.
Authorities should therefore make inter-communal structures to which they delegate the provision of services compete with each other.
Mrs Weiler is re-establishing the law and offering us the best parliamentary contribution on this subject, and for that I thank her.
Mr President, I should like once again to thank Mrs Weiler, as well as the draftsmen of the opinion of various committees: Mr Langen, Mr Costa and Mrs Staniszewska.
I am going to try to respond to some of the questions asked, without claiming to respond to them all.
I shall first respond to Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, to Mr Lambsdorff and to Mrs RÃŒhle.
When a local authority grants certain services to another public body in return for payment, these are in principle services that have been the subject of a public contract.
The public body benefiting from the contract is competing with private companies and possibly with other public bodies offering the same service.
A general exclusion of all forms of public-public cooperation from the scope of the Community rules on public contracts and of the rules on concessions would therefore be unacceptable.
The Court of Justice case-law is very clear in this regard.
Conversely, not all forms of public-public cooperation are covered by Community law.
The Commission recognises that clarification is required in order to determine the extent to which Community law applies to the delegation of tasks to public bodies and which forms of cooperation remain outside the scope of the provisions on the internal market.
We are working closely with all the parties concerned in order to provide this clarification.
Next, I shall respond to Mrs RÃŒhle and to Mrs Gebhardt on the issue of public-private partnerships and on the 'in-house' concept.
The 'in-house' concept excludes the application of the rules governing public contracts when a public body grants a contract or a concession to a third party over which it exercises some control.
The Court has outlined the circumstances in which this derogation may be applied.
You will understand that the Commission wants this exception to the rules on granting contracts to continue being monitored.
In particular, it seems extremely doubtful that a public contract or a concession would be granted in a discriminatory way to a company that represents certain private interests, while other private companies concerned are pushed aside.
That is why we think it necessary at this stage to keep to the current definition of the conditions for application of the 'in-house' system: where authorities exercise the same control over the service provider as they do over their own services, and where service providers carry out the bulk of their activities with the authority concerned.
For these reasons and also so as not to have to start from scratch with the new public contract rules, which are scarcely at the transposition stage in the Member States, we think it appropriate to legislate on mixed public-private companies and on the 'in-house' concept.
An interpretative communication is the most suitable means of explaining the way in which the rules regulating public contracts apply to the selection of private partners for these partnerships.
In response to Mr Savary, who raised the question about the two calls for competition, I would say that we are aware of this problem and, as you pointed out, I referred to this in my speech.
I should like to make myself very clear: we do not require two calls for competition simply because we believe that that is unnecessary.
We explained this in the 2004 Green Paper on PPPs and we plan to clarify our position in the texts that we are due to present in 2007.
Mr President, I am well aware that I have not responded to all of the questions asked, but I should like now to conclude.
On the subject of concessions and of a possible legislative initiative, it is important not to rush things.
To begin with, the Commission must look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions, and at other measures suitable for dealing with the problems at stake.
On the basis of the results of this impact study, the Commission will then - most probably next year - decide whether the cost-benefit ratio warrants such a legislative initiative and will, if necessary, prepare a legislative proposal.
Furthermore, the message from all those who work in the area of PPP start-ups is clear: they are calling for practical guidelines on the way in which to apply the rules on public contracts to the creation of these partnerships.
The Commission intends to provide these guidelines in non-legislative form for the reasons that I indicated in my introduction.
There can be no doubt as to the importance of PPPs for the European economy.
I hope that Parliament's report will help clarify the Community rules on public contracts and concessions so as to offer partners transparent and fair conditions of competition.
It has become quite clear to us, in this debate, that Parliament's emphasis was on legal certainty, but you, for your part, will have also understood the Commission's preoccupation, in an area as vital as this for European investment, with retaining some room for manoeuvre, such as to enable it, while guaranteeing legal certainty, to invest more money where it is really needed.
Moreover, several of you rightly stressed that these are absolutely vital tools.
Mr President, those are the answers that I wanted to give, and I thank Parliament once again for the quality of this debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Posting of workers (debate)
The next item is the report by Elisabeth Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the application of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Services Directive is one of the most important directives in terms of the freedom to provide services, making possible, on the one hand, fair competition among service-providing enterprises right across Europe, while also, on the other, containing unambiguous rules for the protection of the posted workers, and also setting down minimum standards applicable to all, while nevertheless providing sufficient flexibility to enable these standards to be enforced by the various national systems.
At its heart is the principle of the same minimum wage or the same minimum conditions for the same work in the same place, which enables it to establish fair competition conditions for businesses on the ground.
If, though, the Posting of Workers Directive is to be successfully transposed, it demands committed effort by all - on every side and at every level.
I would like, at this juncture, to thank those Members who worked with me on this report for their dedication, and, above all, for their inexhaustible patience with the negotiating process, as well as the staff of the committee's secretariat, in the Tabling Office, of the groups and Members' private offices, for their dedication and the innumerable extra hours they were required to work.
This report is a joint effort.
It enjoys support right across the groups, and the reason why that is so is that all concerned have met others halfway and arrived at compromises for the sake of the matter in hand.
It is out of its commitment to the Posting of Workers Directive that this House repudiates the Commission's attempts at guidelines limiting the Member States' opportunities to exercise control, for the Member States have the particular function of ensuring, by means of their control measures, that the minimum working conditions for the posted workers are actually complied with, and they must be able to continue to do so in future, and without exceptions being made.
Our criticisms of the guidelines will come as no surprise to the Commission, for it is using them for no other purpose than to reintroduce through the back door the substance of Articles 24 and 25 of its original draft of the services directive, which this House had, by a large majority, deleted, and to that deletion the Council consented, for neither employers' nor employees' associations, neither governments nor members of parliament, want the freedom to provide services at the price of workers' fundamental rights.
The reverse is true: there is a broad alliance of people who are convinced that this European Union of ours can succeed in combining the two, and that doing so will bring into being what we call the social Europe.
Our expectation of the Commission is that it should take seriously February's unambiguous vote on this report as a guide to how it should proceed.
That also means that we expect it to take into account this House's views when evaluating the questionnaires that it sent yesterday to the Member States.
It is unacceptable that the Commission should make demands of the Member States with the ultimate object of jeopardising compliance with minimum labour standards.
I might also add that the ECJ has made it clear that requirements needed in order to secure minimum labour conditions do not run counter to the freedom to provide services, and that, precisely, is what is made clear in this report.
So it is, for example, that it has been demonstrated in practice that, contrary to the Commission's interpretation, wages documents can also be needed in addition to certificates of time worked in order to secure workers' right to their minimum wage, and the consequence of that is that, in future, legal counsel will be indispensable as parties in the wages negotiations described in Article 3(8) of the Posting of Workers Directive, or as representatives to make such negotiations possible by being available for the effective delivery of official documents.
If the directive is to be implemented, then action will need to be taken to clarify matters in advance and to provide information on compliance with minimum employment standards.
It is with that in mind that I hope that the commitment of so many to this report will pay off and that the Commission will now, without any reservations, allow 'the same pay for the same work in the same place' to be established securely throughout the European Union.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her report.
I am sorry to have to say, however, that unfortunately the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs did not take account of what I believe were the main findings which were voted through in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
In addition to this, in Group B, we had no opportunity to exchange information on important issues or to discuss them.
In her report, the rapporteur included many worrying and often contradictory elements.
Today, I shall focus on the most significant problems.
They are not new problems, and had already been widely discussed during work on the Services Directive.
Regrettably, it was decided that the solutions to these problems would not be contained in the Directive, only in the Commission's Guidance on the Posting of Workers.
I believe these guidelines are useful, because they deal with the problems thousands of entrepreneurs encounter daily as they post their workers.
One of these problems is the requirement imposed by the host country to set up legal representation, instead of simply posting a worker who could act as the employer's representative.
This requirement has far-reaching implications, because setting up legal representation falls under the principle of freedom to establish an enterprise, and not that of freedom to provide services.
In addition, it represents a considerable financial outlay for employers.
The fact that the host country requires the provision of various quantities of documents is also a problem.
In practice, entrepreneurs complain that the host country's authorities abuse this requirement, insisting on documents that are not relevant to the work undertaken.
The requirement pertaining to the supply of information declarations on the posting of workers represents yet another problem.
Some countries insist on receiving this information many months before the start of the posting period, and it is often the case that these declarations are treated as authorisations.
Such practices are very burdensome for the service providers.
The final important issue I should like to draw attention to, and which is often highlighted by entrepreneurs, is the very strict control of Polish enterprises ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, allow me first of all to thank Mrs Schroedter for the extensive and excellent work she has done in drafting this report, and especially for her efforts to secure the broadest possible consensus on a text that is important for a variety of reasons.
She has also pointed out the useful work done by a large majority of Members of this Parliament during the debate and the vote on the Draft Services Directive.
It was useful because, in voting in favour of crucial amendments guaranteeing absolute respect for the competences and subjects covered by the Posted Workers Directive, Parliament safeguarded the vital role that this directive must play at a time when we, in the Union of 25, are witnessing and are going to witness a large increase in the provision of services, as well as a rise in worker mobility.
The text also safeguarded - and I believe that this was the unanimous opinion of the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - our powers over the subjects that are rightfully ours.
A directive that has been understood properly, applied properly and that has properly controlled effects should ensure that the right balance is struck between fair competition and guaranteed respect for workers' rights.
The ground rules must be strict and fair regarding this issue.
They must also guarantee transparency and security for workers, in terms of both service provision and freedom of movement.
For a directive to be understood properly there needs to be a major effort in terms of providing explanations and information and of simplifying administrative matters.
A directive that has been applied properly must clearly ensure that the right to free movement and the principles of equal treatment are respected and must pursue objectives relating to the harmonisation of working conditions and of social systems.
A directive with properly controlled effects is a major tool in the fight against the anti-European feelings that may be stirred up by the presence in the population of workers who are treated as mere commodities moved about at will and exploited under the most abject conditions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank our rapporteur for all the work she has done and for her willingness to listen.
I can tell you at this stage that my group considers this to be a balanced report.
Commissioner, with this report, my group would, above all, like to encourage you to take action to get the Posting of Workers Directive complied with on the ground.
We do not ask you to review the directive, because the legislation itself is fairly sound, but we all know that in practice, employees who temporarily work in other countries are often brutally exploited, and we think that this exploitation should stop.
That is why the different Member States' inspectorates should collaborate more.
We would, accordingly, ask the Commission to form them into a well-organised network.
The passing on of information about rights and duties to employees and to companies, Commissioner, should also improve, and our group is delighted with your pledge to develop a well-documented website, launch uniform forms and exchange good working practices.
I should also like to raise the subject of the guidelines that the Commission has launched in response to this House successfully preventing the Services Directive from eroding the Posting of Workers Directive.
I should like to urge the Commissioner not to create any confusion between, on the one hand, attempts to simplify administration, which receives our wholehearted support, and, on the other hand, question demands that are necessary for monitoring and control; that is why we maintain, Commissioner, that Member States must retain the right to demand that representatives be appointed by the firms in question, but also to place demands in connection with documents and registration systems.
We must join forces in order to call a halt to bureaucracy and exploitation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) A spirit of protectionism and economic nationalism is becoming entrenched in certain countries of the Community.
This hinders international trade and the free movement of capital and labour.
Protectionists have a negative attitude not only towards competition from Asia but also towards any source of foreign competition.
This is a short-sighted attitude.
We all know that competition is an engine of economic progress, whereas exclusion leads to economic and social decline.
Putting artificial bureaucratic obstacles in the way of implementation and application of the Posting of Workers Directive is one of the manifestations of protectionism.
This situation harms not only our own interests, but also those of the entire Community and infringes its citizens' fundamental rights; first and foremost, the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment.
These rights are embodied in the EC Treaty and in the Posting of Workers Directive, but are being ignored by the Member States. Such behaviour undermines our Community.
I will be voting for the elimination of bureaucratic obstacles so that national borders do not hinder business development in the Community and people are free to choose where they wish to work.
They must also be sure of not being exploited or discriminated against when working abroad.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) It is well known that many workers from EU Member States, such as Portugal, continue to suffer discrimination when they go to work in other countries that are also EU Member States, but where people earn higher salaries.
According to the directive on the posting of workers, the host country is solely responsible for ensuring the protection and the rights of posted workers.
To this end, the country concerned is required to adopt measures to prevent minimum standards from being circumvented.
This gives rise to genuine discrimination affecting all workers, both the posted workers and those from the host country.
Reality has shown us that this directive is ignored on many sides, despite countless complaints, either by Parliament, or in reports of specific cases, such as we have issued on a number of occasions.
There are still examples of non-compliance that need to be resolved, and we accordingly do not accept the Commission's proposal to restrict in certain important areas the minimum requirements imposed by the Member States on businesses, which followed on from the proposed directive on the creation of an internal market for services.
Consequently, whilst we support the report, we must express our disappointment at the pressure exerted, and the proposals put forward, by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, following their attempts to block clarification of important aspects of the implementation of the directive.
They tabled various amendments, for example, aimed at removing points in the report before us, with the attempts at removing Amendment 13 and parts of Amendments 26 and 29 from the report being of particular concern.
As far as we are concerned, we want the rapporteur's work to stand and would urge the Chamber to adopt a number of other proposals aimed at enforcing the directive.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, when the feeble compromise on the Services Directive was reached, it was obvious that it had been achieved at the expense of the new Member States of the European Union, whose main competitive advantage on the Union market is precisely in the services sector.
This compromise sounded the death-knell for all hope of equal opportunities on the common market as outlined in the initial draft of the Directive.
The European Commission's Guidance on the Posting of Workers was one element of the deal that might have inspired some hope in the new countries.
In presenting today's report to us, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is aiming to completely do away with even that small and non-binding opportunity.
With this report, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is aiming to preserve the complete status quo concerning the services market, even though protectionism and plain chauvinism are rampant throughout that market.
According to the European Trade Union Confederation, for example, the benefit of this chauvinism, is that it is worker-related and has been established under the aegis of the unions.
Personally, I doubt it has anything at all to do with the genuine good of working people.
Essentially, strict administrative and social requirements only serve to deprive people of jobs.
That was what happened in the Vaxholm case and also in the case of the Polish company Zojax.
Both companies were forced to withdraw from the implementation of projects, and this resulted in losses and redundancies.
Swedish trade unionists were very complacent, however, because those made redundant were foreign workers, namely Latvians and Poles.
I would remind Swedish trade unionists, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that the said foreigners are citizens and companies entitled to their full rights, who had been promised equal rights within the common market when accession took place.
It is true that the requirements laid down in Article 3 of the Directive are minimal, but does the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not feel that it is high time to set upper limits for such requirements, both for cases of requirements based on law and for those based on collective agreements?
Does the committee not feel that these requirements are usually mere smokescreens for plain and simple protectionism?
The requirement to register, to set up legal representation in the host country and to make social documentation available in situ are all used by the authorities as a pretext for making things difficult.
They all serve one single purpose, namely to protect the national market against bricklayers, bakers, wood polishers, and many other kinds of workers who are now, quite rightly, feeling let down.
Their expectations concerning equal rights within the Union's market are being shattered by harsh reality.
Adopting the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as it stands will send out a clear signal to the Member States, namely that they take whatever action they like on the common services market.
It will also amount to going back on the delicate compromise reached on the Services Directive.
That is why I am appealing for support for the amendments tabled by a group of Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, because the report does not deserve our support without these amendments.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, when people work on short-term contracts in countries other than their own, there are obvious advantages for all sides.
So I am all in favour of posted workers - but not this way.
The report says in paragraph 19 that this will not be achieved by huge bureaucracy, but some 35 out of 49 paragraphs include references to laws, rules, infringement procedures, ECJ cases, enforcement by penalties.
If this proposal is anything to go by, I am not surprised that the Enterprise Commissioner is behind schedule in his drive to simplify EU laws!
For yet again we have a proposal carrying a raft of rules and regulations, backed up with so many references to penalties and infringement procedures that the rapporteur must be at her wits' end trying to make a proposal which is easy to operate, fair to all, but effective.
When this was debated a while ago in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members were horrified to hear cases of blatant exploitation of posted workers.
This must be stopped, but what were the Member States doing?
What were the trade unions doing?
After all, it is highly likely that local workers were also being abused.
Were posted workers employed because local workers refused to accept the conditions on offer?
The key lies in recital L on page 5 of the report, which talks about preventing the circumvention of national standards.
Since national standards are emphasised this way, why do we need an EU directive at all?
Why is it not left to Member States, if it is their rules that control the situation?
An EU directive will be a burden on all sides and produce delays, when all we want is people in work.
After all, this is not a new situation.
Posted workers did not come about because of the EU. They existed before there was an EU.
My own brother, English like myself, was an engineering draughtsman.
He became self-employed, took up a contract with Volkswagen and worked in Germany for several years.
He had no problems at all, but that was before the UK joined the then EC.
So I repeat, we do not need this directive.
Member States are perfectly capable of managing their affairs within the existing regulations of the European Union - in short, subsidiarity.
Do you remember that?
(CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who contributed to this report.
The posting of workers is one of the important issues that the EU must resolve if it is to meet its target of completing the internal market with the free movement of persons and the freedom to provide services on a cross-border basis.
I feel honoured to take the floor in front of hundreds of my fellow MEPs at this significant time.
The Commission communication is aimed at liberalising the provision of services and the posting of workers, and removing the unnecessary restrictions and protectionism prevalent in some Member States.
Mrs Schroedter's report, however, takes the opposite approach.
The rapporteur places undue emphasis on protecting workers and in turn establishes protectionist measures that work against the freedom to post workers.
The current practice places workers from the new Member States at a distinct disadvantage.
Businesses from the old Member States are permitted to provide services anywhere in the EU market, as well as in their country of origin.
Businesses from the new Member States, on the other hand, are not allowed such access or are subject to time restrictions and a series of administrative barriers and protectionist measures that in reality prevent their posted workers from being competitive and from providing services freely on the market under the same conditions as workers from the host country.
In this Chamber we still hear fears expressed about the Polish plumber and all he symbolises.
Mrs Schroedter's report rides roughshod over the fundamental values on which the EU was founded, and in no way leads to the achievement of our shared aim, which is to complete the single internal market.
I should therefore like to call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against this report.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her very constructive work.
As many others have said, this is an important directive not only for freedom of movement but also for the protection of workers.
There are quite a number of deficiencies - we know this from the surveys - when it comes to information, cooperation between Member States and the ability to carry out checks.
Allow me to state that we are in favour not of protectionism but of open borders.
We are in favour of competition on equal terms between companies, but we are also in favour of the equal treatment of workers.
That is what we are concerned with here - equal treatment.
Some of the Members who referred to the Vaxholm case have left now.
That precise case was about the need for Latvian workers not to be treated worse than Swedish workers.
They were to enjoy precisely the same treatment - not worse, but precisely the same, treatment.
One issue on which there has been disagreement between ourselves and the Commission is that of the importance of having a representative.
You propose that it would be enough to have a link with someone in the other country with whom to negotiate.
That would be incredibly bureaucratic and enormously difficult.
A representative must be able to act as a channel of communication in those countries that take care of the negotiations, so it would be necessary to have someone with a negotiating mandate.
He or she would also have to be able to communicate with, for example, authorities responsible for occupational health and safety.
Anything else would be quite impossible.
There is no case law that contradicts what I am saying.
The Arblade case was about something else.
It was about documents that had to be kept for five years under Belgian law and is therefore irrelevant to what the Commission is saying.
I nonetheless hope that we shall get this Posting of Workers Directive operating successfully in society.
In that case, it will, however, have to include the parts to which I have referred.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
Because of time constraints, I shall concentrate on the Irish experience only, but it is certainly relevant to this debate.
The Commissioner stated that Ireland has not adopted specific transposition measures and was not conforming to the criteria established by the case law of the Court of Justice.
So, apart from all the other difficulties highlighted by the rapporteur - and I do not have time to list them - it seems that we in Ireland do not have the legal certainty to comprehensively enforce this directive.
Recent events in Ireland have shown how much we need full implementation of this directive: with GAMA, a Turkish construction company, ripping off some of its foreign workers; the Irish ferry scandal, where existing workers were simply replaced by mainly foreign workers on half the wages and with inferior working conditions - I might add that this is one of the reasons I support a directive on ferries; and today in Ireland the mushroom industry admitting that some of its members are paying half the minimum wage to their foreign workers.
My final point is that it is not just posted workers who suffer: it is all workers, including Irish workers, who will pay a price down the line, as minimum wages will be undercut and suspicion and distrust will replace solidarity between workers.
The Commissioner said earlier that it is difficult to protect workers while ensuring free movement of services; but, regardless of how difficult it is, we must do so.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, will begin by expressing my appreciation for the work the rapporteur has done.
The Posting of Workers Directive was a cause of constant controversy in the past, and has remained one to this day.
The country from which I come was not the only one to be unwilling to extend the directive's scope to cover the economy as a whole, and, in Germany, it still applies only in the building industry and to occupations associated with it.
I would like to steer the debate on this report towards three aspects of it.
One is the emphasis that the rapporteur puts on the need for the social partners to be strengthened if the standards laid down in wage agreements are not to be undermined.
That should not, however, be taken to mean that these agreements, reached between the Member States and the two sides of industry, actually do guarantee living wages.
There needs to be examination of the degree to which minimum standards actually do meet the need for 'decent work' in the individual Member States.

Mrs Schroedter, with some justification, also points out that it is difficult to distinguish between the employed and the self-employed, but, necessary though it is to define them and clarify the status of those who are termed the 'putative self-employed', we should not forget that we are talking here about the people who are most on the margins and earn less than anyone else, that they must be accorded a status that secures them rights, including the right to a fair and living wage.
The use of the relevant directives to enforce the freedom to provide services is always justified by reference to - among others - the argument that, at the end of the day, there has to be something in it for the consumer.
At first sight, the Posting of Workers Directive would appear to have little to do with the protection of consumers, but I am sure that just how much the two are connected will become clear when we gain a sense of perspective, for the consumer's interest is no longer only in the quality of the goods themselves, and that is why, today, consumers are protected against imported goods produced using child labour.

The exchange of goods and services is meant to have a social dimension to it, and those who participate in it must be entitled to minimum standards that guarantee them a living, appropriate working conditions and the protection of their livelihood.
(DE) Mr President, in February, this House, together with the Council and the Commission, arrived at a compromise on the Services Directive, Articles 24 and 25 of which were thereby deleted on the grounds that they provided for only superficial scrutiny of the delegating firms and their workers.
We were thereby able to ensure the more effective combating not only of illicit labour but also of wage dumping.
Over the past few months, the Commission has sustained losses, and now it is trying to use the Posting of Workers Directive as a back door through which to resubmit the rejected positions, in certain cases - by way of guidelines on which we are allowed to do no more than state an opinion - going beyond what the ECJ has stipulated, and it is doing so by means of guidelines on which we can do no more than give an opinion.
That is deceitful and amounts to robbing the people's representatives of their powers.
Guidelines will no doubt be drawn on by the ECJ when arriving at judgments, and they will thereby be made binding in law.
The German Federal Government, our political parties, social partners, employers' and workers' associations, will not tolerate the planned restrictions on our posting of workers legislation, and other European countries have similar misgivings.
In Poland, for example, there are hardly any Poles to be found on building sites, but instead loads of manpower from non-EU states.
Necessary though it is that mobility within the European internal market should be permitted, it is above all necessary that justice and fairness should prevail, and that is what effective controls make possible.
Every host country must be entitled to demand documents and check employment conditions - such things as income, working time, rest periods, safety and health protection.
Those who claim that fewer forms and documents are needed, and that bureaucracy is to be avoided, do not in fact want there to be any controls and are making illegality possible; it must also be possible to serve notices on those who have broken the law, and so the posting enterprises must be represented by persons who are fully authorised under the law of the host country.
I welcome Mrs Schroedter's report; she has included my proposed amendments in compromises.
On one point, though, I do not agree with her, and that is with regard to the definition of 'workers' which is adapted in such a way that the economically dependent self-employed are categorised as fictitiously self-employed.
I hope this position will gain majority support tomorrow.
(NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I have discussed this dossier with Mrs Handzlik in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - she, unfortunately, is no longer taking an active part in the debate.
What I should like to underline is that we very much considered the problems mentioned by her and by many group colleagues which the new Member States are facing and that we obviously recognise that unnecessary bureaucratic barriers to the free movement of services and the free movement of employees should be removed.
I also have sufficient experience, however, of what is happening within the labour market legally, illegally or partly-legally to know that people are indeed exploited and that it is the scope for posting workers across the border that is used to circumvent the rules.
That is why I should like to spell out once again that we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater, but that we must strike a good balance instead; I should once again like to impress on Mr Clark, who is apparently oblivious to how these rules work, that there is such a thing as the principle of subsidiarity, that it is the rules of the working country that apply in labour law, that Member States have complete autonomy in this and that this Posting of Workers Directive is only intended as an exception to this rule in order to cover the situations where employees are posted across the border and are allowed to work under their own conditions temporarily, provided there are a number of minimum protective provisions in place.
It is precisely because of the control procedures in this respect, and because they are so complex, that rules are needed in order to create scope for monitoring, better scope for labour inspectorates to collaborate, which means that this balance is needed.
Also in the framework of the Services Directive, I should like to underline once again that there is no hierarchy of rules for this labour legislation, that Member States are autonomous in this respect and that this is not overruled by the rules for the free movement of services.
(PL) Mr President, the possibility of posting workers is intrinsically linked to the fundamental freedoms of the European Union.
The most important of these are the free movement of people, services and capital.
The Posting of Workers Directive is therefore a logical consequence of the functioning of the European Union's internal market.
There is no doubt that the state of the Union's economy is measured in terms of the state of its enterprises, particularly its small and medium-sized enterprises.
The 1996 Directive was mainly intended for SMEs, and aimed to simplify the principles allowing them to compete and carry out their economic activity outside their country of origin.
Internal competition is essential if the Union is to cope successfully with competition at global level, where it faces competition from the economies of the United States, China and Japan.
I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for venturing to tackle an issue of such importance for the future of Europe.
I have studied her report carefully. Unfortunately, I am bound to say that I fear the document is not quite in line with my vision of freedom to provide services on the internal market, which is so dear to my heart.
Having read Mrs Schroedter's draft report, I have come to suspect that its de facto aim is to make it difficult for companies to post workers in order to undertake a specific task and, accordingly, it sets out to sanction the protectionist practices Member State governments put in place to protect themselves from the effects of competition.
I should like to state clearly that I am referring to the positive effects of competition.
At the same time, I support the efforts by the European Commission, and the Commissioner's own personal efforts, aimed at ensuring better implementation of the Directive in practice.
I hope that there is no reason to change it, or replace it with a new legal act.
I trust Commissioner Å pidla is of the same opinion.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for a very good report.
We need an effective directive to protect workers posted temporarily to an EU state.
This is essential to prevent a race to the bottom.
However, we have a directive that is full of legal black holes and is not applied at all in some states.
Despite the best efforts of Commissioner Å pidla, I do not believe that guidelines will solve these failings.
Many of our states are resisting the necessary legislative changes.
The consequences are scandals of the kind already mentioned, such as the Irish ferries debacle.
While ships' crews are excluded from the posting of workers directive, the Irish Government also resists the implementation of a ferries directive, which would protect those workers.
We urgently need a legal framework to effectively prevent a race to the bottom, unfair competition and, indeed, the ugly emergence of xenophobia.
We need clarity and certainty on definitions of workers and an end to false self-employment.
We need the right to apply clearly established higher minimum standards, sufficient inspectors to ensure compliance and enforceable penalties for failure to comply with EU legislation.
I believe, also, that we need protection for whistle-blowers, for those who reveal the abuses that take place under the existing regime.
I should like to remind those who would criticise the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and myself over this issue that I represent a state that opened its borders to all ten new Member States, fully and freely.
We have now been forced to close our borders to Bulgaria and Romania because of the abuse of migrant workers and the consequent effect upon Irish-based workers.
This is not an easy question to resolve and it is certainly not an attempt to create protectionism in the 15 'old' Member States.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the dynamic nature of the internal market has offered increased mobility for workers and has helped European businesses to develop their activities beyond national borders.
The ability of businesses to post some of their workers to other EU Member States for the purpose of temporary work has made a further contribution to this increased mobility.
The experience until now, however, has left much to be desired.
In the case of Portugal, the posting of workers has not gone well, especially in the building industry.
A number of cases have come to light of Portuguese workers being exploited in Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
This has happened because there is a yawning chasm between the 1999 directive, which strikes a balance between the freedom to provide services and the guarantee of the labour rights of posted workers, and the implementation of that directive on the ground.
In addition to the fact that Member States have differed in their interpretations of the directive, there have also been differences in its practical implementation, and this has led to more barriers and more bureaucracy, and has slowed down the process.
It is abundantly clear that there is no monitoring of the implementation of this directive.
Subcontracting is a terrible example of situations that are very common but are not covered by the directive.
This has led to an unacceptable watering down of responsibilities, which always - I repeat, always - works to the detriment of the posted workers.
I support Mrs Schroedter's report because I believe it is up to the host Member State, in close cooperation with the authorities of the country of origin, to ensure that the employment conditions laid down in the directive are rigorously complied with, for the purposes of increasing the effectiveness of monitoring and of combating illegal practices.
What is needed, therefore is greater transparency and more information on the rights and obligations to be complied with when businesses become involved in the posting of workers.
I also endorse Mrs Schroedter's report because it has become necessary to adopt corrections in order to ensure that this directive is supported, monitored and carried out better and more systematically.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must acknowledge the fact that a European labour market does genuinely exist, especially in the field of services which, more than any other field, involves the posting of workers.
We are in favour of this, but not under just any circumstances and not at the risk of social dumping.
Human labour is not a commodity and cannot be subjected to the rules of free competition.
We voiced this concern during the debate on the 'Services' Directive, and - as you pointed out - Parliament rejected Articles 24 and 25 of this directive, which deal precisely with the easing of the conditions on the posting of workers.
The fact is that it is unacceptable for the Commission to undermine this position and to ignore the criticisms voiced by Parliament.
The Directive on the posting of workers has been poorly applied in the Member States and is not meeting its objectives.
That may be the case, but should the legislation be relaxed as a consequence or, on the contrary, should more be done to encourage the Member States to apply it?
I do not believe that the obligations for declarations and effective controls and the retention of documents lead to pointless red tape when what is at stake is the protection of the social rights of posted or local workers.
A lax attitude on the matter only benefits fraudsters.
Furthermore, enhanced restrictions and the very threat of financial penalties should act as a deterrent.
That is why I endorse this report and urgently call on the Commission and the Member States to overcome the difficulties in applying the directive, which we do not want to have amended at this stage.
(HU) Several people have pointed out that the Posting of Workers Directive and the Services Directive are closely interconnected.
Therefore, I regret that we will not deal with both together in November, although that would have been logical and sensible.
As for our standpoint, there is an important philosophical difference between the approach expressed by socialist and Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fellow Members.
We put the focus on strengthening and speeding up the economy, because without accelerating development we cannot create new jobs and we cannot secure long-term financing for the major social welfare systems or safeguard European social values.
It will be impossible to make progress towards trying to balance work and family life or towards improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Consequently, we will not have adequate resources to deal on a European level with the massive downsizing caused by company relocations.
The question, then, is whether we want to hamper or strengthen the performance of the economy.
In the course of the debate on the Posting of Workers Directive, it seemed to me that we want to hamper it, which is not a good sign for the future.
To mention only the most striking problem, the requirement concerning company representatives runs completely counter to the free provision of services.
In practice, this represents a serious competitive disadvantage.
It would require setting up a local framework, which is an expensive, pointless and impractical exercise.
This is why I would like to bring to your attention the fact that we consider Amendment 7 to be crucial.
Should it not be accepted, we will not support adoption of the directive.
Please, take that into consideration when voting.
(DE) Mr President, I wish the Posting of Workers Directive were no longer needed, and I am sure that the Commissioner is thinking along similar lines.
Nor am I sure that this law actually can adequately protect workers from exploitation, but there is no other means available to us - or none that is adequate - to prevent problems on the European labour market.
What is clear is that the most important features of the Posting of Workers Directive function only to a limited extent - I am talking here not only about the imposition of administrative penalties across borders, but also about the cooperation between authorities.
Moreover, the failure to take account of bonuses as an often essential component of wages leads to more wage dumping.
No doubt the minimum requirement for the Posting of Workers Directive to function will be the availability of a person who can act as the representative of the delegating enterprise and ensure that the directive is applied.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief indeed, because it is already five past midnight and I feel we must adhere very strictly to regulations such as the working time directive, and others in force in the EU.
Very briefly, then.
One key question, raised twice in this debate, is that in its communication the Commission tried to reintroduce Articles 24 and 25, which had been removed from the services directive.
I wish to point out that this is a mistaken view, because Articles 24 and 25 are based on the country of origin principle, which is the principle that the country of origin is responsible for inspections.
This is not in the communication because the communication is duly based on the current legal situation, according to which the responsibility for inspection lies with the countries to which workers are posted, that is to say, the countries hosting the workers.
I should also like to say that I have noticed in the debate that we agree on the idea that the directive is capable of working at any given time, but it is vital that we step up efforts to ensure its consistent application.
The main problem at present is that it is being applied inconsistently, especially in cross-border cooperation between individual Member States.
The Commission has taken steps in its communication to address this issue - and I feel that it is our duty to do this as thoroughly and as quickly as possible.
I do not wish to issue an opinion on individual cases that have been cited by way of criticism of the directive or the Commission, not because this is impossible but rather because I respect the working time of the interpreters.
I should like to make a final general remark.
In its communication, the Commission firstly interpreted the court ruling in Luxembourg, and it did so correctly.
Then on the basis of its obligations as Guardian of the Treaties it formulated a position on a series of issues.
Thirdly it proposed, and continues to propose, steps that must be taken to improve the implementation of this directive.
I should now like to make one last remark.
It is a basic principle of due process under the rule of law that any law - in this case the directive - can be used only for the purpose for which it was drawn up.
The purpose of this directive is to protect posted workers, not to restrict the freedom to provide services.
Consequently, in terms of this general structure and from the standpoint of proportionality, the communication does not restrict the Member States' ability to carry out their own inspections; nor does it restrict their ability to perform their duties.
The fundamental rule of proportionality naturally applies, whereby the obligations laid down must be appropriate to the objective, and cases must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, as in fact the communication indicates.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the attention given to this issue by Parliament.
I am convinced that this is one of the most important directives concerning the EU labour market.
It is our duty to interpret it correctly and accurately and to put it into practice as quickly and effectively as possible.
I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her report, because it undoubtedly marks a step forward in the process I mentioned earlier, namely the full implementation of the directive in such a way that it can meet its objective.
Honourable Members, thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
Tonight we are debating the report on the application of a directive relating to posting of workers, as we are aware the posting of workers directive refers firstly to the guarantee of the free movement of persons and services, secondly, that posted employees enjoy terms and conditions related to minimum rates of pay, working conditions, health and safety of the host Member states.
The main problem of the directive is its enforcement.
One of the main obstacles is the need to adjust the definition of 'employees' so that a clear distinction is made with the status of 'self employed persons' for the purpose of national employment law.
Another difficulty is that this directive has not been transposed by all the Member States, nor is it enforced in practice in a number of Member States.
Also it is apparent that such workers do not even know their rights and therefore the aim of the directive is not being achieved.
I have come across numerous Maltese who were working in other Member States and who have no idea of their rights under this directive.
So as to make the directive meaningful, we must not be ambiguous.

European Central Bank Annual Report (2005) (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs BerÃšs on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the 2005 Annual Report of the European Bank.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, the annual report of the European Central Bank always offers an opportunity for the European Parliament to review monetary policy and to supplement the work carried out by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs through the monetary dialogue conducted four times a year with the President of the European Central Bank.
You will all remember that last year we rejected the report, as it did not correspond to the guidelines advocated by this Parliament.
The year 2005 was an unusual year, in which the Central Bank initiated a movement raising interest rates five times, the first of which was on 1 December.
These successive rises took place in an unusual economic context, determined by both the rise in oil prices and a disadvantageous exchange rate for euro zone exports, and in the context of an upturn in economic growth considered by more acute observers as fragile.
In these circumstances, this report specifically invites the Central Bank to analyse carefully the conditions in which it conducts its monetary policy.
I am pleased that this report also emphasises that euro-dollar parity is important to growth in the European Union and that it draws from this a number of conclusions, which have been drafted in a spirit of compromise, bearing in mind the need for each monetary authority to exercise in full its responsibilities in terms of exchange rates.
I hope that this compromise will still be present at the time of the vote.
I should like to express my regret, nonetheless, that it was not possible in this report to include both the subject of household debt and the improvement needed in the coordination of economic policies.
Allow me, Mr President, to mention a number of points on which I believe this report provides original and valuable insights.
Consider, for example, the invitation made to the Central Bank to examine closely the use of EUR 500 notes and the possibility of freezing the issue of these notes.
Let us come now to the key issue for this Parliament, namely the conditions in which democratic control is exercised and the way in which the Central Bank operates as an institution.
From this point of view, we wanted to make our contribution, before the next renewal of a member of the Executive Board, to the necessary debate that must take place among the institutions in order that the members of the Executive Board may represent the interests of the euro zone in the best way possible.
We believe that, to this end, the best approach would be to apply to the ECB the arrangement seen on the executive boards of all other central banks, namely a variety of backgrounds and a balance of portfolios.
We are in agreement within this Parliament on requesting that the balance between nations should not be enshrined as an eternal status quo, and we believe, moreover, that a variety of backgrounds should enable the contributions and plurality within the Executive Board to be enhanced.
I also hope that this Parliament will advocate that the Council, when giving its opinion on approving a nomination to the Board, should exercise its decision-making power in full by making its choice on the basis of a number of different candidates.
I am familiar with the argument used frequently by yourself, Mr President of the European Central Bank, and also used by Jean-Claude Trichet from time to time: having several candidates would damage the careers of those not accepted for the position.
Allow me to say that, as observers of international nomination procedures, our assessment is entirely different.
At international level, the only post that is filled without competition or without a variety of candidates - and I come from a party that, as you know, is currently experiencing this process and all its virtues - is the Presidency of the World Bank.
This process does not apply in the case of the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the World Trade Organisation.
That is why we believe that, from this point of view, the euro zone as an integrated area should allow a number of different candidates.
Obviously, we also request that the European Parliament should finally be given the power to approve the appointment of the members of the Executive Board, which, in my opinion, would only strengthen the Board's authority and legitimacy and ability to embody a strong voice for the euro zone, on the international stage also.
This is the primary objective of this Parliament, namely that, on the international stage, the Central Bank, alongside the Council and the Eurogroup, should be the key legitimate spokesman that we need for Europe's voice to carry loud and clear on such important subjects as you have wanted to raise, Mr President, and on which this Parliament would like to make a contribution.
I am of course thinking of the question of the alternative funds, on which, I hope, the compromise drawn up by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be supported by all the groups at the time of the vote.
European Central Bank. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and a great pleasure to speak to you today.
I am here to present to the European Parliament the 2005 annual report of the European Central Bank.
However, as you know, relations between Parliament and the European Central Bank go beyond the specific obligations imposed by the Treaty.
In fact, as Mrs BerÃšs has just said, we have over the years established a very close dialogue, which, I should like to emphasise, has been enhanced once again this year.
Honourable Members, it is therefore the third time that I have spoken before you this month.
Furthermore, my colleagues on the board of the ECB have been in close contact with the European Parliament regarding various issues such as reform of the International Monetary Fund, payment systems and clearing and settlement systems.
For our part, we attach great importance to the contacts on these issues.
(DE) I would like to start by giving you a brief overview of the economic and monetary policy developments of 2005 and by outlining the European Central Bank's monetary policy measures.
I would then like to make some comments with regard to points and proposals that you have raised in your draft resolution on the ECB's annual report for 2005.
Mr President, Let me first of all welcome the assessment of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee as regards the ECB's monetary policy in 2005 and beyond.
As recognised in the draft report, the ECB's monetary policy - which is designed to fulfil our primary objective of maintaining price stability - has continued to be successful in anchoring inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, despite a number of challenges mentioned by Mrs BerÃšs, relating in particular to the continued strong surge in oil prices until the most recent period.
As already emphasised on several occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area, fully in line with Article 105 of the EC Treaty.
In this respect, let me emphasise that the ECB's open and transparent communication is a key element in guiding market expectations.
In particular, my introductory statement at the press conference after the first Governing Council meeting each month provides a clear view, on the part of the Governing Council, on the current monetary policy stance in real time.
Hence, we make the outcome of our deliberations public.
As such, the introductory statement is comparable with what other central banks call 'summary minutes'.
In 2005, the ECB's monetary policy operated in an environment of increasingly improving economic conditions.
While real GDP growth remained moderate in the first half of the year, in an environment of heightened uncertainties surrounding domestic demand, the pace of economic activity gradually strengthened during the second half of the year, from around 1.2% year-on-year on average in the first half of 2005 to around 1.7% year-on-year on average in the second half.
Overall, real GDP in the euro area grew by 1.4%.
As regards price developments, annual HICP inflation averaged 2.2% in 2005, compared to 2.1% in each of the two preceding years.
While annual HICP inflation eased to 2.0% in the first half of 2005, mainly reflecting base effects, HICP inflation rates accelerated to levels significantly above 2% in the second half, reaching a peak of 2.6% in September, mainly on the back of substantial increases in energy prices.
Thus, reviewing the ECB's monetary policy decisions in 2005 and early 2006, it is useful to split this period into two parts.
In the first half of 2005, against the background of subdued inflation developments and with inflation expectations for the euro area solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability, the Governing Council concluded that it remained appropriate to keep interest rates at their historically low levels.
At the same time, the Governing Council was constantly alert with regard to the materialisation of upside risks to price stability, as signalled by both the ECB's economic and monetary analyses.
In the second half of 2005 and early 2006, the likelihood that average annual HICP inflation could remain above 2% over the medium term increased and a spill-over to inflation expectations had to be avoided.
This scenario of elevated inflation rates remained subject to previously identified upside risks, notably further increases in oil prices and indirect taxes and, more particularly, potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting.
It was also confirmed by the monetary analysis, given strong monetary growth, robust credit expansion and ample liquidity.
As a consequence, by the end of 2005, the regular cross-checking of the ECB's economic and monetary analyses indicated that an adjustment of the very accommodative stance of the ECB's monetary policy was clearly warranted in order to contain upside risks to price stability and preserve the firm anchoring of long-term inflation expectations in the euro area.
The Governing Council of the ECB therefore decided in December to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after two and a half years of maintaining these rates at historically low levels.
Since then the Governing Council has continued to withdraw monetary accommodation, thereby establishing the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.25% by now.
Turning to recent developments, all the main indicators of economic activity in the euro area that have become available in the course of 2006 confirm the Governing Council's assessment that economic growth has gained momentum and, in addition, become more broadly-based and sustained, mainly supported by domestic demand.
With regard to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation rates, notwithstanding their decline in most recent months, will remain elevated, at levels above 2% on average in 2006.
As regards 2007, inflation risks remain on the upside.
These risks include, in particular, a stronger than expected rise in wages on the back of improving labour markets and a stronger than expected pass-through of past oil price rises.
The assessment of upside risks prevailing is confirmed when cross-checked with the monetary analysis, given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth, ample liquidity and, from a medium-term perspective, a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion.
This has been noted in the Commission report.
Monetary developments therefore require enhanced monitoring, in particular against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area.
As I said publicly on behalf of the Governing Council after our last decision, if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted.
The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor all developments very closely, so as to ensure price stability over the medium to longer term.
As regards fiscal policy, budgetary developments in 2005 and 2006 and plans for 2007 point to further, albeit slow, improvements in budget balances.
However, this should not give rise to complacency.
It remains of the essence that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided, which would boost the confidence of both the markets and the public.
As regards structural reforms, I welcome the view of the European Parliament that comprehensive structural reforms are needed to raise the potential growth rate of the euro area and underpin the momentum of the ongoing economic recovery.
In this respect, the reform measures initiated in the context of the renewed Lisbon Strategy were a welcome additional step in the right direction.
The successful implementation of national reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would improve the smooth functioning of EMU and facilitate the conduct of the ECB's single monetary policy.
In your motion for a resolution you raise a large number of issues of relevance to the ECB and I would like to assure you that we will consider them with great care.
I should like to share our assessment on two issues straight away, in view of their topical nature and the exchanges of views I and my fellow members of the Executive Board had with you on those points.
In the motion for a resolution, the ECB is called upon to carry out further analysis in the area of hedge funds - a point you have underlined.
Amid the increasing attention being paid to the activities of hedge funds, I think that it would be unfair not to mention their role as regards enhancing market liquidity, providing significant diversification opportunities for investors and fostering financial innovation.
That being said, it is clear that there are potential risks for financial stability from their very rapidly growing presence in the financial system and it has yet to be tested whether they would amplify market volatility or pose greater counterparty risks in a less benign financial market environment.
Against that background, the ECB will definitely follow up on your request for further analysis.
It is possible that we will conclude that there is a real case for enhancing the current framework, which relies essentially on the vigilance of the financial institutions that are themselves under supervision as regards their counterparty risks on the hedge funds.
But I also note that any such enhancement should be agreed upon at the level of the international community and, in particular, on the basis of an appropriate transatlantic discussion.
As regards payment and settlement issues, let me first thank the European Parliament for the support expressed for the implementation by November 2007 of the TARGET2 system.
Being an integrated large-value payment system, TARGET2 will provide for efficiency gains and improved liquidity management by banks.
In this regard, I should like to refer to the increased pressure also to have an integrated platform for the settlement of securities transactions in euro.
The Eurosystem is therefore currently examining, in coordination with the European Commission and in close cooperation with the market, the feasibility of setting up a Eurosystem infrastructure for the provision of securities settlement services in central bank money.
A decision on whether to offer such a service, referred to as 'TARGET2-Securities', is expected early in 2007.
In the field of retail payments, we strongly support the efforts to establish a Single Euro Payment Area - SEPA.
We welcome the European Commission's initiative for a directive on payment services and I warmly welcome the European Parliament's contribution to a swift adoption of this directive to assist the banking industry in its implementation of SEPA payment instruments as from 1 January 2008.
I thank you very much for your attention.
I am now available to answer your questions.
(Applause)
Mr President, allow me to begin by saying that - as can be seen from the report - we generally endorse what the European Central Bank has done over the past year.
It is particularly important that the independence of the ECB has been, and remains, secure.
It has proven to be the case that the Bank's moderate interest rates policy has contributed to the invigoration of the economy, even though that same policy has very often been criticised in recent years.
That being the case, we believe that it would be absolutely right to raise the current level of interest rates, which is very low in historical terms, a little, if the situation so requires it, in order to control inflationary trends.
We also welcome the ECB's comments with regard to the necessary structural reforms in the Member States that it is constantly calling for.
It is quite right to do this, as inflation would hit those on middle and lower incomes particularly hard.
Higher inflation would make these people poorer.
We are opposed to that.
We also welcome the clear statement by the President of the ECB in relation to the development of European stock exchanges.
It is imperative that we ensure that European stock exchanges are consolidated within Europe and are not simply taken over from abroad - from the US, for example.
That is the only way that we can prevent the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act being implemented in Europe via the back door.
We have sound and transparent market regulations in Europe that are suited to our European situation, and they should not be undermined.
As regards the report, we have resolutely advocated that the ECB does not become politicised.
We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are thus very clear in our rejection of the publication of ECB voting results.
Doing so would lead to politicisation, because voting results would then be discussed.
We are also opposed to a publicly debated nomination process, as qualified candidates would be discussed to death.
We thus do not feel that we can support these two elements, as they would mean politicisation of the ECB.
We would, on the other hand, like to point out that, if the ECB becomes a market operator in the areas of settlement and the clearing of payments and instalments within the framework of TARGET 2, it must also subject itself to appropriate corporate governance.
Corporate governance of this nature still has to be developed.
The independence of the ECB will then be ensured and that will result in a stable economic policy that will call for structural reforms in Europe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I shall refrain from dwelling, on behalf of my group, on the first part of Mr Trichet's account or on what Mr Lauk stated a moment ago.
Suffice for me to say that I welcome such a political dialogue - as Mr Lauk's viewpoint is also a political viewpoint obviously - with you on a regular basis.
We have ourselves conducted such a dialogue only recently, and I think we should persevere with it.
The report that is now before us reflects, in my view, just how mature this dialogue has become, touching, as it does, upon very serious subjects, including the link between monetary policy and macro-economic policy, which is of huge importance to our group.
Allow me to single out two or three items which have been subject of discussion.
First of all, I am delighted with what Mr Trichet had to say about hedge funds, his commitment to better analysis of them and to the adoption of a much more serious stance with respect to them.
Whilst we stated this in very specific terms a few weeks ago during the dialogue, he was a little more hesitant back then.
I am therefore pleased that this has now been spelled out much more clearly - I have referred to this in a different connection as the black hole of the financial markets - because that black hole is widening all the time and must be plugged very deliberately by monitoring financial markets, not least with stability in mind.
The second point is the appointment of the members of the ECB's Executive Board.
In the spring, we debated this very subject further to Mr Stark's appointment.
We then said quite clearly, because we did not have anything against Mr Stark himself, who was well-qualified, but wanted to talk about the procedure, that we would not dwell on the appointment procedure and would come back to it in this report, which is what we are doing now.
I regret that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to help improve - by making it more fully-developed - this appointment procedure, and also the role we in this House can play in this.
I am pleased, though, that at least the Liberals and other groups are prepared to lend their support.
I hope that we can make the necessary progress in time for the next appointment, which, as it happens, will not be until 2009/2010.
This is very important, because it should not be the case that large countries have a qualified seat and that it is, in this case, only in the Federal Chancellery in Berlin that it is decided who is a good candidate.
Finally, I should like to turn to the subject of Target II.
We have clearly decided not to speak out on this, or on the code of conduct that is being prepared by the Commission for that matter, but to closely monitor your next move instead.
What we would say at this stage is that if, and only if, the ECB and the euro system are to have an active decision-making role in this, this should involve sound monitoring and democratic decision-making; that much we agree on.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this report does, in any event - and indeed, as has already been indicated - represent an opportunity to take another good look at not only the ECB's annual report but also at where we as Parliament stand in the debate on monetary policy.
I have to say that this time round, as indeed in recent years, my group has taken a traditional line.
First of all, our viewpoint on monetary policy is clear.
The ECB's independence may not be affected, there should be no political pressure and we must prevent monetary policy in the euro zone from being politicised.
We believe that there is a need for confidence in the European Central Bank to be restored.
In September 2005, when the rate of inflation rose by 2.6%, the European Central Bank responded well by increasing the historically very low interest rate.
Price stability is the ECB's Number One priority and that is how it should stay, as described in the Treaty.
Having said this, we also take the view, and will do in future, that more transparency is possible.
This is, in fact, what Mr Huhne said as long as six years ago, when he produced a report on this.
I also value the ECB's efforts on this score, and the President's being present in this plenary is a very different matter - although the same people are involved - from his visits to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs; this is also very much appreciated; and I also think that this has not been done before.
Despite this, much of the ECB's decision-making is done in what appears to us to be dark backrooms.
It is, of course, not the case that we want the whole of the European Parliament and the BBC to attend the meetings of the ECB's Executive Board, but we would like to know the arguments in favour or against any decisions taken and whether these were taken unanimously or not, so that the market can gain a better insight into monetary policy.
Finally, we would ask that the procedure for appointing members of the ECB's Executive Board be reviewed.
We think the current de facto division of ECB seats according to the size of Member States should be abandoned.
This should not involve a major public debate, but choosing from various candidates really strikes us as being a better system.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since we are discussing the European Central Bank's report, allow me to address these few words to its president.
Mr Trichet, you really are the reviver of a very poor system for all the peoples of Europe.
As such, you have probably been - inadvertently, otherwise it would have been common knowledge - the best campaigner for the 'no' vote of the French and Dutch people on the European Constitutional Treaty, and we thank you for it.
The principles on which the European Central Bank is founded are already in themselves an obstacle to growth in the euro zone, but when there is growth, in spite of your actions, it creates few or no jobs and only benefits the richest in society.
The European Central Bank claims to have stopped inflation.
In reality, the working and middle classes have seen their purchasing power plummet, while the rich have never been so rich.
You champion the worst kind of capitalism, that of shareholders and the pauperisation of the middle and working classes.
Day after day, your inertia faced with the weak dollar policy pursued by the United States destroys thousands of qualified industrial jobs creating added value in the euro zone.
You represent the bank of discontent and mass unemployment.
For all these reasons, we must break with a European Central Bank controlled by the financial markets and with no link to the will of the peoples of the Union.
We urgently need a new treaty entrusting the European Central Bank with responsibilities in the field of employment, training and research, all under the strict control of our Parliament and the national parliaments.
This new treaty must, imperatively, replace the financial stability pact with a social progress pact for employment and growth, reviving public spending throughout the Union on health, training, education, social housing, culture, transport and infrastructure.
Through these decisions we will be able to restore the confidence of the European people.
If this were not the case, the gap would continue to widen between our institutions and the various peoples.
The differences in wealth between the peoples of the Union and between citizens of a single country would continue to increase.
This would therefore encourage the rise of extremism and anti-European nationalism.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, here we are again telling the European Central Bank how to do its job!
Not only is this against the spirit of the Treaty, which states that the ECB is independent, it is also largely a waste of time, because, as always, the ECB will listen politely but, quite rightly, take little notice.
Indeed, the ECB has enough trouble of its own, without listening to this Parliament, in finding an interest rate that suits 12 different economies, soon to be more.
The one-size-fits-all problem does not go away.
At the moment, the larger euro zone economies are enjoying slightly higher growth but, as Mr Trichet accepts, this is fragile.
When it falters, his problem of choosing the right interest rate will become more critical.
Effectively, the ECB will be forced into a choice between inflation in Germany or recession in southern Europe, with all the dire implications for government debts that this will entail.
I wonder what advice this Parliament will be giving then.
(FR) Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, in this Chamber yesterday we were debating breast cancer, and no one appeared worried about the fight against inflation.
That is to say that in situations of life and death our priorities change: we discover what is truly important.
However, is the fight against inflation really the most important thing in economic life?
Beginning our resolution with a reference to the Father-like status of the independence of the Central Bank, followed by the Son-like status of price stability, in the hope that the Holy Spirit of prosperity will descend from the United States may be good for the independence of the Central Bank, but it is bad for the people.
Personally, Mr Trichet, I fully appreciate that you are bound by monetary aggregates one, two and three and by the need for fine-tuning and for steering interest rates.
Yet even in the country of Milton Friedman, Chile is left to practise a budgetary surplus of 1%, while the United States itself takes a budgetary overdose.
I must therefore conclude by asking the real question: just because our German grandmother had inflationist diabetes in the 1920s, should that mean that, 80 years on, the whole of Europe should go on a sugar-free budgetary and monetary diet?
(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the European Central Bank's position on currency stability.
We should not succumb to the temptation to add to the ECB's responsibilities areas in which the nation states refuse to act, in other words the areas of economic and social reforms.
The ECB cannot pay for such reforms alone, nor can it afford to.
In this case it is essential that the nation states finally fulfil their obligations.
We also support the independence of the European Central Bank, its political independence and the independence of its monetary policy, and all of this right from the selection procedure for its members.
I do not know what the results of today's votes will be.
I can only tell you that the European People's Party supports the idea of non-politicisation, starting with the selection procedure, and believes that the form of transparency proposed is not helpful.
The European Central Bank has numerous other tools in its dialogue and does make use of them, just as other central banks around the world do.
There is broad support for this in this House.
On the subject of independence, I would like to add that we are fighting for the independence of monetary policy.
I also hope, however, that the European Central Bank realises that it should not overplay the subject of independence.
We have had an on-going discussing with the European Central Bank for years now on the subject of 'clearing and settlement', in particular with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, and I would just like to remind the House that the European Central Bank has begun a dialogue with the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on this subject and is now entering into a dialogue with those involved in the market.
I would like to state clearly that we are not opposed to dialogue.
Perhaps the route that the European Central Bank is proposing, and that it is taking, will be the right one in the end.
For us, this is not about a material assessment, but the route by which the European Central Bank becomes a part of the market cannot be chosen unsupervised and in a vacuum cut off from politics.
That is why we have been calling so urgently for this - and we hope that the vote today will proceed as we had all envisaged - we need governance, we need a regulatory framework for this area.
We cannot have a situation where Parliament and the Commission are deliberating about whether to create a directive, whether to produce with a suitable framework, and the European Central Bank then comes out and claims that none of that affects it and that it will take the route it thinks is right.
Do not overdo it here; where monetary policy is concerned, we are on your side.
(FR) Mr President, since its creation, the European Central Bank has fulfilled its primary mission, namely the fight against inflation.
Rates of inflation in the euro zone have thus remained below those in the United States and Great Britain.
The public is mistaken in believing that the euro has made prices soar.
Admittedly, there was an inflationist surge during the transition to the euro, mainly in the catering and retail sectors, where prices were rounded up a little too high.
That said, since this surge of initial excitement, underlying inflation has in general remained under control.
The price boom on the oil and gas markets represents an external shock over which the Union has very little control.
However, because the euro has risen against the dollar, which remains the currency in which raw materials are listed, the shock has been less severe for the euro zone than for the Americans.
The euro is in fact a shield that has protected the whole of Europe during events such as the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan or even 11 September 2001.
Without the euro, many European currencies would have been under pressure and would have threatened the internal market with collapse.
As Mr Zapatero pointed out, Spain would never have been able to withdraw its troops from Iraq if its currency had been the peseta instead of the euro.
Although the euro has served Europe well, and although I congratulate the ECB on the work accomplished, I remain convinced that the ECB could do better.
President Trichet and his colleagues attach too much importance to the fight against inflation, while inflationist risks remain very limited.
On the other hand, the ECB refuses to lend its support to the Union's general economic policies and justifies its position by arguing that the Constitutional Treaty stipulates that maintaining price stability represents the only possible support for Europe's general economic policy.
The ECB is independent and will remain so, even without Mr Radwan's support. This is another reason to be open to dialogue.
Those who are independent, Mr President, can allow themselves to maintain a more active cooperation with the Eurogroup, for example with a view to achieving more sustained economic development for Europe.
Growth and stability are the two feet moving Europe forward.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Trichet and his colleagues for their solid cooperation thus far.
The ECB annual report is a very important document for this House.
It forms the basis of the debate on fundamental monetary policy issues.
Not for nothing has the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs taken personal responsibility as rapporteur for this issue.
There is, however, always controversy when we debate appointments to the ECB and the primary task of the Bank.
We have just experienced this once again.
It is therefore no surprise that it was only through innumerable compromise proposals that it was possible to achieve something like a common view in the committee.
Personally speaking, I find it regrettable that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament abstained from the final vote in committee, despite all these compromises.
Their decision shows the difficulties the Socialist Group still has with a handful of points in the report.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supported the independence of the ECB without ifs and buts.
The primary function of the Bank is, and remains, to ensure the stability of the euro.
Thus far, it has performed this job admirably.
We cannot go soft on independence or on price stability under any circumstances.
There must thus continue to be an absence of political pressure in future, and the members of the Executive Board must be chosen purely on the basis of their expertise and not according to nationality.
Mr President, yet again it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the ECB continues to print large numbers of 500-euro notes, which are only useful to those who are hoarding ill-gotten gains or laundering money.
Indeed, the volume of printing has recently even gone up.
Yet the Sunday Times in London recently published an extensive article detailing much evidence about the use of these notes in Spain, Italy and Greece, directly for money-laundering purposes.
The only possible conclusion we can reach is that the ECB is actively involved in aiding and abetting money laundering.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to express a favourable opinion of the activities of the European Central Bank in 2005.
I would also like to categorically state that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully supports and respects the independence of the Central Bank.
We believe that this independence is a sine qua non for conducting an appropriate monetary policy within the economic and monetary union.
It also guarantees the value of our common currency.
I would now like to highlight three issues that have long been debated in this House.
Firstly, the relative importance of the two pillars of monetary policy adopted by the ECB remains unclear.
I refer here to monetary supply as opposed to other information on future inflation.
As a result, we do not know whether, or to what extent, developments in monetary supply constitute a decisive factor for the ECB when setting interest rates.
Laying down clear rules in this matter would improve the transparency and effectiveness of monetary policy.
Secondly, a clear interpretation of the ECB's mandate, as laid down in Article 105(1) of the Treaty, is urgently required.
In particular, the ECB needs to state how it intends to fulfil its Treaty obligations to support the European Union's economic policy while simultaneously maintaining price stability, and what resources it intends to draw upon to do so.
I would point out that the Treaty draws a clear distinction between these two aims, and that they cannot therefore be deemed to be interchangeable.
If the ECB adopted a clear stance on this question, it would be possible to avoid misunderstandings as to whether or not the ECB is responsible for attaining aims other than price stability.
Thirdly, the ECB is mistaken in its interpretation of the inflation criterion applied in assessing how prepared new Member States are for entry into the euro zone.
The Treaty clearly states that the point of reference should be the average inflation rate of, and I quote: 'the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability'.
The Treaty makes no mention of the lowest prices.
The ECB defined price stability as a rate of inflation under 2% but close to 2%.
However, when assessing the degree of preparedness of the candidate countries, the ECB applies another definition, namely the average of the three countries with the lowest inflation.
There cannot be two different definitions of the same Treaty provision, and I therefore call on the ECB to clarify the situation.
(ES) Mr President, President Trichet, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation and debate in Parliament of the European Central Bank Annual Report 2005 is the annual account that makes the independence of the Central Bank compatible with its democratic control.
I would like to make three brief comments on the impact of the monetary policy, the need for financial integration and the future composition of the Management Board.
The objectives of the monetary policy are to control inflation and to contribute to economic objectives of a general nature.
At the end of 2005, and following two and a half years without taking any action, the European Central Bank increased interest rates, inflation stood at 2 tenths above the 2%, and there was a modest growth in the euro zone of 1.4%.
Those are the macroeconomic data, but the results of the monetary policy require that a more precise approach be taken, which I believe requires, on the one hand, an examination of internal divergences, which are considerable in terms of inflation and growth, amongst the Member States of the euro zone.
This is important in order to ascertain the impact of the monetary policy, and, in particular, to ensure that there are no persistent imbalances.
Secondly, we also need to know how these monetary policy conditions translate to the market and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses.
During 2005, the European Central Bank published its first report on financial integration in the euro zone, and I congratulate it on that.
It makes a very significant contribution.
Accelerated globalisation is creating changes in financial products and markets that bring new challenges.
When the single currency was drawn up, the risks of the system could be dealt with by means of monetary policy instruments.
Now we need new initiatives.
This is why it is important to carry on making progress on the Economic and Monetary Union, in order to achieve new goals, but also in order to maintain the efficiency of the monetary policy in the face of new challenges.
Finally, on the composition of the Management Board, I am in favour of greater parliamentary control, in order to achieve more professionalism and competence, and also a gender perspective, Mr President.
The group photo of its governing body contains just one woman.
European Central Bank (FR) Mr President, might I perhaps say a word or two, since a number of issues have been broached?
I should like first of all to thank the honourable Members.
I have indeed been very alert to the precise nature of the remarks, observations and recommendations made to us.
On the subject of independence, I should like to say, on behalf of all the members of the Executive Board and the Governing Council, how important it is to hear so very many MEPs state how crucial it is for the European Central Bank to be independent.
I must confess that we should certainly not have been able to give the European economy its particular monetary and financial environment without the credibility conferred on us by this principle of independence recognised by your Parliament, by the whole world and by all market participants, wherever in the world they might be.
The Bank's independence is stated in the Treaty, it is a recognised fact and it is one of Europe's basic assets.
I should like once again to thank all the MEPs who expressed themselves so clearly on this point.
Let me now deal with some of the other points raised, which are certainly important in the eyes of a number of Members of Parliament.
I have to say that the question of the appointment of the members of the Executive Board is one that should be addressed to the executive branches, particularly the Council, because they are responsible for such matters.
We are appointed according to the Treaty provisions and, as you know, not only does Parliament give its assessment of the quality of the various persons concerned, but so do we in the Governing Council.
I know that Parliament would like to have not only an advisory role but also responsibility for the decision itself.
I respect that sentiment.
I realise that the ECB has to let Parliament and the Council discuss the matter, provided full independence and absence of politicisation are totally assured, for, clearly, if the institution were to suffer from politicisation, it would not be able to deliver what it has to deliver, namely, price stability, something which also depends on it enjoying sound credibility, so that inflation expectations can be firmly anchored.
As regards the various remarks on the dialogue between Parliament and the ECB, in my opinion this dialogue has improved in terms of both frequency and interaction and I will take good note of all the remarks made here, including those concerning the governance of our possible Target2 Securities system.
On that issue, which is dear to your heart, Mr Radwan, and to that of other Members of Parliament, I would say that our aspiration - and it is really a work in progress - was to maximise the benefits of European integration following the successful introduction of the euro, since it is clear that the availability of a single settlement engine for securities denominated in euros would undoubtedly represent progress.
The second objective would be to maximise settlement efficiency and that would probably require cash and securities to be settled on the same IT platform, according to what is known technically as an 'integrated model'.
The third issue, which is important from our own perspective, is how to maximise the Central Bank's control over the bank accounts opened in our own book.
We take a very strong line on this, believing that solutions which avoid forcing central banks to outsource the management of their accounts would not be good ones.
These are the three main reasons why we are working on this matter, through a dialogue with the market, which is very important, and, of course, with Parliament.
A number of other points have been mentioned.
I will not return to the matter of hedge funds raised by Mrs van den Burg, in particular.
As to the question of whether or not we are sufficiently transparent and open as regards communication, I reiterate that we do not take decisions alone behind closed doors.
The Commissioner and the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, are invited to all meetings of the Governing Council.
They are also invited every fortnight to our discussions and deliberations, so that they can be as close as possible to the decisions taken.
I myself have the privilege of appearing before the Eurogroup every month.
So there are three opportunities each month to exchange views and gain as full as possible an understanding of how the decision-making process really works.
It seems to me that, from that standpoint, we have the most highly-organised system of contacts anywhere in the world.
It is not new; it was the tradition of the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and a number of central banks.
Let us not underestimate its significance.
Some of the remarks made fail to take this into account.
As regards the transparency of our concept of monetary policy, we are in a position where we say that our primary goal is price stability, because that is what the Treaty stipulates.
We give an arithmetical definition of price stability as inflation rates of below and close to 2%.
Everyone is aware of this.
We have a two-pillar strategy that is very clear.
In that respect, we are much more transparent and precise.
We provide a greater yardstick with which to measure our performance than other sister central banks do.
I do not want to address myself to any of them in particular, but across the Atlantic there is a sister central bank which, for very good reasons of its own, has a different approach to the definition of price stability, with regard to the clarity of that goal.
From that standpoint we are very transparent.
The entire world knows that we are transparent and it is one of the reasons why inflation expectations are anchored in line with our definition of price stability, which is a fundamental result.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to reply briefly to a number of MEPs.
The fact that we are credible and that our predictions concerning inflation correspond to our definition of price stability offer the European economy a particularly favourable financial environment.
I would ask those Members who have criticised our monetary policy, accusing it of being too orthodox, simply to remember what the rates of interest for the medium- and long-term markets in their countries were before the introduction of the euro.
In reality, inflation predictions assumed a rate of inflation much higher than that which we ourselves are now able to guarantee to Europeans.
It should be noted that low inflation represents, above all, a crucial factor for the poorest sections of our societies, preserving as it does their purchasing power.
I noted, moreover, that many Members were asking us to remain very vigilant in this respect.
I am, therefore, deeply convinced that there exists a very simple relationship between our primary objective, as assigned by the Treaty, and Article 105.
Meeting our primary objective is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of our being able to move in the direction desired by everyone in this Chamber, that being, of course, the direction of growth and employment.
Price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and for the creation of lasting employment.
If I have time I shall make two or three other remarks.
Regarding the 500-euro note, I do not agree at all with the remark that was made suggesting that we would actively assist money-laundering.
As you know, large denomination notes were a strong tradition in many of the countries forming part of the euro area and we decided not to change the various traditions drastically.
So the note is used in some countries, but not in others.
It remains an option and we decided not to eliminate that option for those countries and economies that were used to it.
I believe I have covered all the other questions that were raised.
However, Mr Whittaker mentioned the 'one-size-fits-all' angle.
Europe is a vast continental economy and, from 1 January next year when Slovenia joins, the euro zone will have 315 million citizens.
This compares with 300 million in the United States and thus represents an economy of the same order of magnitude.
When you measure the dispersion, the standard deviation of growth and of inflation at the level of various states of various different sizes, you will see that it is roughly the same for both economies.
This is not widely known, but is worth pointing out, since it appears to be a characteristic of a vast continental economy.
This does not mean that we have to cater for persistent differences, and it is one of the things that we have discussed, particularly in the Eurogroup.
We need to reflect on this question, but again, it would probably be wrong to forget that an element of dispersion is always associated with the size of the economy concerned.
(FR) Mr President, I think I have covered most of the questions put, but it goes without saying that I remain at Parliament's disposal.
Thank you, Mr Trichet.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(FR) Mrs BerÃšs's report on the Annual Report (for 2005) of the European Central Bank is disappointing as it does not sufficiently underline the need for political reflection on the use of the euro to support growth and employment.
In an ever more complex world, characterised by an extremely violent economic and social war, not to have an extensive and high-quality political debate on this subject is, at present, an error but may, in future, prove to have been an act of negligence.
The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Trichet, must not lose sight of the fact that Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community clearly indicates that, without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the European System of Central Banks shall support the EU's economic policies.
At a time when increases in the prices of raw materials and of energy are giving rise to natural inflationary tensions in the world, we need to reflect on the impact of this situation on our internal market and our common currency, while seriously asking ourselves whether the time might not have come to develop the euro so that, as well as being a truly remarkable technical success, it is also a political currency.
Support for rural development by the EAFRD - Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) C6-0237/2006;
the report by Mr Goepel, on behalf of the Committee of Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and amending Regulation (EC) 1290/2005 C6-0235/2006.
Mr President, according to the agenda, we were supposed to be able to have, and conclude, a debate about both Mr Mulder's report and my own this morning, before having the opportunity to vote on them.
We now have exactly 18 minutes until voting time.
It is completely unfair to our farmers and agriculturalists to begin a debate of this nature and then perhaps conclude such an important subject as the 20% voluntary modulation - in other words, a policy whereby one-fifth of the existing direct payments to farmers are to be transferred or reduced - with some form of contingency vote this afternoon.
I request that this debate be postponed until November.
(Applause)
Are you asking for the debate or the vote to be postponed?
Mr President, when are we to have this debate?
Surely not now, in the 15 minutes that remain?
On behalf of my group and of my fellow MEPs, I would like to bring forward a motion for the postponement of the debate.
I do realise that under the rules of procedure such a motion must be brought forward at least 24 hours before the debate, but 24 hours before the debate I was unaware that Parliament would not be keeping to its agenda.
(Applause)
(EL) Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we absolutely support the proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, for the debate and vote to be postponed until plenary in November.
(DA) Mr President, I am deputising today for Mr Mulder, who is unable to be with us for personal reasons, and I would very much like, on behalf of my group too, to support Mr Goepel's proposal.
At the same time, I would like to direct some criticism at the Presidency.
It is absolutely outrageous that this extremely important issue - which we needed to be able to deal with this week, partly from the point of view of timing considerations - should now be mishandled in this way and dealt with like this.
I therefore support Mr Goepel's proposal to postpone both the debate and the vote.
Mr President, I support Mrs Batzeli, Mr Goepel and Mr Busk.
This is a very important debate: it is about the whole future of the common agricultural policy.
It concerns all the countries in the European Union, but none more than the United Kingdom.
As we have to catch planes this afternoon, it is simply impossible to debate it now.
We really need to postpone the debate and the vote until November.
I hope you will accept that situation.
(DE) Mr President, on behalf of my group, too, I would like to support the rapporteur's motion.
Looking at the report, even the uninitiated would be able to tell that what we are dealing with here is rather a formal matter.
Behind this facade, however, as Mr Parish has already pointed out, lies the fundamental consideration of the funding of agricultural policy in the coming years and the position of Parliament on this issue.
For this reason, we must debate this issue at a proper time when there is sufficient time available so to do.
We cannot dismember this issue in this way.
I therefore support this motion and ask that you agree to it and that you inform the Bureau of the significance of this dispute.
Perhaps the Bureau was not already aware of it.
(PT) Mr President, I should just like to say that I agree with the proposal to postpone this debate and the vote until November, for the reasons mentioned, that is to say, because it is too important an issue to be dealt with in a hurry in 15 minutes or a little more.
(DE) Mr President, firstly, I would ask that we simply vote on this motion so that you then also have the recommendation of this House.
Furthermore, we could vote solely about postponement.
The decision as to when this subject is put on the agenda again is of course a matter for the Conference of Presidents and ultimately for the entire House.
Personally speaking, however, I would be in favour of postponing both.
Perhaps we could vote, and then you would see the clear will of the House.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse the rapporteur's motion as well as what Mr Swoboda has said.
As rapporteur on financial planning, I would also point out that this ill-starred proposal is based on the conclusions of the European Council and that the Commission was obliged to come up with a proposal for this so-called voluntary modulation.
In the course of the financial planning negotiations we explicitly reserved our position for the legislative process.
That is exactly what the rapporteur is now observing.
Given the significance of this matter, I find it reasonable to ask the Council to be represented at the next debate after any postponement and to confirm to us that this will be the case.
(PL) On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I simply wanted to say that I also fully endorse Mr Goepel's suggestion.
These are important reports and they deserve to be debated in a serious setting, not under the present circumstances.
I fully support Mr Goepel.
I am convinced by the arguments.
I propose, as President of this sitting, that we change the agenda by withdrawing the joint debate on the reports by Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel.
(Parliament agreed to withdraw the two reports from that day's agenda)
Mr President, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all the political parties and groups.
(Applause and laughter)
We have reached a reasonable solution.
The debate will take place at a more convenient time, under more favourable conditions.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 11.40 a.m.)
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen, before proceeding to the vote on the budget, I would like to inform you that the President of the Chilean House of Deputies, Mr Antonio Leal LabrÃ­n, is here with us in the official gallery.
(Applause)
Mr Leal LabrÃ­n is accompanied by Chilean MPs Mr Gonzalo Duarte Leiva and Mr GermÃ¡n Becker Alvear.
We welcome them and thank them for visiting us.
(FR) Mr President, this is indeed a point of order and also a reminder of Rule 188 of the Rules of Procedure.
We have just learned, following the meeting of the Bureau, that the Israeli Government would like to exclude Mrs Le Pen from the political discussions of the Israeli delegation. She is a member of that delegation in a spirit of debate, dialogue and openness.
I should like to express our thanks to Mr Brok for his perfectly correct attitude and to say very clearly that, when Mr Krivine was similarly excluded by a decision of the United States Government, we agreed entirely, whatever the difference of opinion between us, that it was not for the host government to determine how the European Parliament's delegation should be composed.
I therefore dare to hope that, in your capacity as guarantor of the rights of all Members of the European Parliament, you will be anxious to make this point to the Israeli authorities.
(DE) Mr President, you should give the floor to Mr Brok first, as he has something he wants to say on the subject; I am quite happy to state my position afterwards, and so I ask to be given the floor after Mr Brok has spoken.
The Conference of Presidents has decided to postpone the visit of the ad hoc delegation to Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, and I hope that this is a satisfactory response to the concern expressed.
Thank you for drawing Parliament's attention to this issue.
(ES) Mr President, as you know, I try to be serious when I speak and, since the Rules of Procedure state that all documents handled officially in this House must be available in all of the official languages, I would draw your attention to the fact that I am going to vote for amendments that only appear in three: English, French and German; these are three highly respectable languages, as are all the others.
Since this may create problems in the future, therefore, I would draw attention to the fact that this text is not available in all of the official languages; it is not available in mine.
The Secretariat's services inform me that they are sure that they appear in all languages, including yours and mine.
If I have understood correctly, you are not referring to the texts on which we are going to vote, but to the voting list.
This list is available in three languages, as usual, but the texts on which we are going to vote are in all languages.
Our Rules of Procedure have not therefore been violated.
Nevertheless, we shall look into the issue for later plenary sittings.
(DE) Mr President, since I wish to repudiate the utterances made by the group back there, perhaps I might be permitted to make a comment.
The rights of all Members of this House are being safeguarded, all in the same way.
If we are to undertake a journey to a region like this one, balance is essential, and every aspect of the trip must be organised professionally.
That it was not possible, on this occasion, to go at the time planned, was attributable to technical considerations.
We should, however, be making the journey at a later date.
We should not allow the Le Pen group to read something secret and mysterious into this that is not there, and I would like to repudiate what they say in the strongest possible terms.
The procedure has been as follows: the Conference of Presidents, having listened to you, has decided to postpone the visit of this ad hoc delegation.
That is the fundamental procedure we have followed; anything else is a matter of opinion or interpretation and everyone is entitled to their own.

Draft general budget for the European Union - Financial year 2007 (vote)
Ladies and gentlemen, I would point out that, according to the Treaties, in order to be approved, draft amendments relating to what we call non-obligatory spending must be voted for by a majority of the members of the European Parliament, that is to say, 367 votes.
In the case of proposed amendments relating to obligatory spending, a majority of the votes cast is sufficient.
Before the vote, Mr Elles wishes to propose certain technical amendments.
rapporteur. - Mr President, it is good to get the vote on the 2007 budget under way.
Before we start on the vote on Parliament's first reading, I should like to announce that a small number of technical adjustments need to be made.
Rather than read out a very long list of numbers, the list of technical adjustments has been annexed to our voting lists.
Following the vote those adjustments will be made by the relevant departments and included in the Minutes of the sitting.
(Parliament accepted the technical amendments proposed by Mr Elles)
(Before the vote on Section I)
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to inform you that the resolution will be adapted according to the result of the vote on the budgetary amendments.
Therefore, any technical corrections needed will be made by the session services.
(Parliament agreed)
2.
Draft general budget for 2007 (Section III) (vote)
3.
Draft general budget for 2007 (sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII) (vote)
- Before the vote on paragraph 31:
(FR) Mr President, because it has never been proved that, employee for employee and hour of work for hour of work, the Manpower solution to providing session auxiliaries was any cheaper, and because Parliament is constantly trying to make savings, we propose to help it by adding, at the end of paragraph 31, the following sentence: 'reject as too expensive the solution of using a temping agency to replace session auxiliaries'.
(Applause)
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to propose that the text of paragraph 58 of the report be replaced by the following text: 'Notes the improvement in monitoring of the implementation of the EU budget in its budgetary vote; asks the relevant committees to examine the setting-up of a structure and a procedure to carry out the implementation assessment exercise for 2007 with the specialised committees; in this way it will also help to prepare for the budget review in 2008-2009; asks the Secretary-General to facilitate the logistics to organise regular monitoring meetings according to the priorities that will be defined by the committees concerned'.
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)

Fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions (vote)
5.
Commemoration of 1956 Hungarian Uprising (vote)
- Before the vote on Recital J:
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this resolution makes a connection between the Hungarian revolution and the other efforts at resistance in Eastern Europe, it makes no reference to the uprising on 17 June 1953 in the GDR, when, in over seven hundred cities and municipalities, people went on strike and mounted demonstrations, events that were put down by Soviet tanks.
I would therefore like to insert the following in Recital J:
'recognising the historical and political link between the Hungarian Revolution in October 1956 and various other forms of resistance and resistance movements, such as the mass demonstrations in East Germany in June 1953, the PoznaÅ demonstrations in Poland in June 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968, the birth of the Solidarity Movement in Poland in 1980 and democracy movements in the former USSR, notably those of the Baltic peoples;'
(Applause)
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)

Georgia (South Ossetia) (vote)

EC-Syria Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement (vote)
11.
Nairobi Conference on Climate Change (vote)
12.
Inland waterway transport (vote)
13.
Public-private partnerships (vote)
- On paragraph 45:
(FR) Excuse me, but you have unfortunately forgotten the original wording of paragraph 45.
Thank you very much for your constructive observation, but we have voted on the corresponding amendment, and we did not therefore have to vote on the text to which you refer.
14.
Posting of workers (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
(NL) Mr President, it has been agreed between the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs that the text should read as follows: 'considers that for ensuring', etcetera.
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
15.
European Central Bank Annual Report (2005) (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 7:
(DE) Mr President, may I make just a very brief interjection, since this report is not exactly an unimportant one, and ask just how legitimate a vote is when fewer than half the Members are present for it?
I have no desire to waste the House's time, since the previous President wasted quite enough of it already.
Yes, Mr Alvaro, I note your concern, but we have checked that there is a quorum in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and the votes are valid.
- Before the vote on Amendment 11:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, with regard to Amendment 12 on the subject of the post market and tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we wish to table an oral amendment.
I will say it in English.
Rather than 'its own settlement infrastructure', we should say, 'a settlement infrastructure'.
(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
That concludes the vote.
Mr President, I should just like to thank you very much for the fast and efficient way in which you have organised business since you took the Chair.
Those are the kinds of speeches we like to hear when we are in the Chair!
(Laughter)
Mr President, this is just to say that I was mistaken on my last vote.
I thought we were voting on the amendment instead of the final vote on the BerÃšs report.
I voted against when I should have voted in favour.
This is just for the record.
Thank you for your efficiency.
Voting time
The next item is the vote.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
in writing. UKIP voted for every reduction or cancellation of payments, especially the ones concerning subsidies and propaganda, on the principle that these funds should not have been used for these purposes.
Concerning Euronews, this is blatant propaganda and the media should stay independent.
in writing. Smoking kills half a million EU citizens every year.
Smoking is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the EU.
It is disappointing that Amendments 376, 489 and 529 were rejected (232 votes for, 333 votes against).
Subsidies for tobacco-growing in the EU need to end.
I abstained on Amendment 3 because I was not quite sure of the intent of the study that was proposed in paragraph 23, but I fully support paragraph 23 itself.
in writing. (SV) We want the budget to contribute to sustainable social, economic and environmental development for the EU in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy.
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of those amendments that give priority to research, development and education and training.
We do not, however, wish to support those amendments that give more money to direct agricultural aid and export subsidies for agricultural products, as such aid is already excessive and also results in inefficient agriculture that damages the environment and that, through the dumping of surpluses, helps increase the gap between rich and poor in the world.
Nor do we want to give money to subsidise tobacco cultivation, as this contributes directly to public health problems.
We believe that such aid should quickly be cut back on and completely abolished before long.
The money thereby saved could be used, for example, to fund measures designed to reduce the use of tobacco and dependency on it.
in writing. - (FR) On Thursday 26 October, the European Parliament adopted the first reading of the European Union's budget for 2007.
Amounting to EUR 120 billion, it reflects the first time that use has been made of the new financial perspective for 2007-2013, which was adopted in May 2006 and which the French Socialists did not approve, believing that it did not make it possible to respond to the great challenges of the future.
In this context, the 2007 budget has turned out to be very modest, corresponding to 1.04% of the European Union's GNI.
The many constraints, both internal and international, on the European Union have led Parliament to single out priorities that should enable Europeans better to perceive the added value supplied by the EU.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has therefore decided to vote in favour of this 2007 budget, having received assurances concerning their priorities in relation to the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies.
These priorities include, in particular, education, training, research and sustainable development.
The revival of the communication policy and the emergence of new pilot projects are also encouraging in terms of the future of the European Union.
I voted against Amendment 811, which refers to the Committee on Budgets' rural development programmes, and against Amendment 3 to paragraph 23, because they restrict funding for rural development and block 'voluntary modulation' under the terms in which it is proposed by the Commission.
in writing. This budget again fails to find the money to meet our commitments, particularly in relation to our emerging common foreign and security policy and our development policy.
The EU's ability to play a global role is being hampered by 'bean-counters' back in our national capital.
For this they bear a heavy responsibility.
On two details I will be voting against the amendment from our ultra-nationalistic and Catholic fundamentalists from Poland urging opposition to forced or 'coercive' abortions.
Of course I am opposed to such an idea, but the EU is not supporting such a programme.
Rather it is an attempt to introduce US evangelical Christian bigotry into EU development policy and must be opposed for that very reason.
Second, I want proper control of spending and value for money.
Yet some pursue these demands as a way of tying Commission staff into overly-bureaucratic regulations that hamper and hinder work, rather than assist.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the EU's budget should be limited to 1% of the Member States' average GNI.
I have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament, at the same time as the June List has welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by either the Committee on Budgets or individual Members.
There are quite a few unfortunate budget headings, but the June List particularly regrets the large amount of aid for the EU's agricultural policy, Cohesion Fund and fishing industry, as well as the budget headings under which various forms of information campaign are to be subsidised.
The June List also believes that something must be done about the European Parliament's constant commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be closed down.
This week (beginning 23 October 2006), the EU's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth time in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EU's budget was being used correctly or for the purposes intended.
How can this madness continue whereby, year after year, financial resources are appropriated, only a small portion of which can be guaranteed to be used for the purposes for which they were intended?
Whilst we wish to restate our opposition to key aspects of the negotiating strategy and of the priorities established by Parliament on the Community's 2007 Budget, we also feel we must advocate the adoption of some of our proposals, which are aimed at:
increasing the appropriation earmarked for the European Social Fund convergence.
promoting cooperation and the establishment of associations between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises;
protecting and preserving the forests, with measures and actions to monitor and prevent forest fires;
promoting, preserving and protecting cultural heritage, such as the Cistercian Route and UNESCO world heritage sites.
