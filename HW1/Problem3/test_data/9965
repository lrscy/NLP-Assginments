The fact that he can indicate these differences and draw conclusions about what is obviously best practice is due to the fact that we have not implemented the standardisation and extreme control from the top for which he appeals.
The report indicates a very dangerous route for economic policy in Europe.
We have therefore voted against it.
in writing. (PL) This report has been carefully prepared.
It provides an overview of the state of the European economy based on a good deal of statistical data.
It makes it possible to identify trends in the development of the Europe of 27 Member States and trends in the new countries.
There is also a commentary explaining the relevant reasons.
I would emphasise the significance of internal demand and export for economic growth.
The report contains many important elements for assessing the impact of external factors, such as the economic situation in the United States, the price of oil and the euro-dollar exchange rate.
Another strong argument in favour of the report is the large measure of agreement on its content within the committee.
Credit for this is due to the rapporteur.
in writing. (SV) With its focus on traditional growth policy, the report is old-fashioned and behind the times.
It makes a casually optimistic assessment of the euro and is unbalanced in the way that it sings the praises of the internal market.
At the same time, parts of the report are critical of the EU and recognise increasing wage differences, greater poverty and the advantages of the Scandinavian model.
The report contains continued demands for forced liberalisation of the energy market, yet at the same time sets out demands for investment and a tax policy that favour renewable energy.
There are, then, both positive and negative aspects to the report. I am therefore abstaining in the final vote.
I voted in favour of this outstanding report on a most important, relevant and topical issue.
Measures to reverse the current trend of Europe's increasing dependency on imported energy supply must be taken, for example by encouraging investment in renewable energy sources, enabling us to meet the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol.
As a matter of urgency, a global strategy must be drawn up leading to reduced energy consumption, in particular in the transport sector, which is responsible for 56% of oil consumption in Europe.
Higher oil prices, which have hit almost USD 80 per barrel, appear to be a structural phenomenon that is here to stay.
Unlike the oil crises of the 1970s, which were caused by a breakdown in supplies, the current 'crisis' has arisen, on the one hand, from increased demand on the part of developing countries such as China and India, and of the biggest consumer in the world, the United States, and, on the other, from predictions that this 'finite' resource will be in short supply in the medium term.
Living with higher oil prices worsens recession and balance of payments difficulties, results in higher production costs, inflation and interest rates, penalises families on low incomes and causes wars over control of the oil supply, as in Iraq.
If technological solutions can contribute towards increasing energy efficiency, and towards finding new forms of fuel and energy, it is vital that we change the capitalist mode of production, which causes waste and inefficiency.
The answer lies in reducing GDP energy intensity, in promoting high-quality public rail transport and in promoting production for local markets.
Whilst the rapporteur has put forward some welcome proposals, we cannot accept the creation of an internal market for energy and the liberalisation that goes with that.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that rising energy prices are best adjusted to at national level.
We are therefore sceptical about this opinion-soliciting resolution from the European Parliament.
For example, paragraph 20 of the draft report regrets the lack of an energy regulator in the EU.
Bureaucratisation and control from the top are, as always, the only way proposed by Parliament.
We believe that the Member States should exercise the regulatory function themselves as long as there is no question of cross-border risks of the type associated with nuclear power. If such risks do exist, the regulatory body should, however, be the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency.
The EU countries should agree on certain energy targets. How these are achieved should be left up to the individual Member States.
Otherwise, the report contains both helpful and unhelpful wordings.
We have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote, since it does not form part of any legislative process and carries little weight and because, in our view, it makes no difference to the debate in the Member States on these issues.
Although the report stresses the impact of oil price increase on the transport sector, which is responsible for 56% of total oil consumption, it is a great pity that it makes no reference to other sectors, such as fisheries.
Fuel prices have hit the fisheries sector particularly badly.
Its operating margins and economic viability have been significantly affected, thus exacerbating the socio-economic crisis in the sector.
Between 2004 and 2006 alone, the price of fuel went up by around 100%, and in some parts of the sector fuel accounts for some 50% of total operating costs.
Fishermen have seen their incomes go down, which is particularly serious as the sector is mainly concentrated in regions with fragile economies.
Various studies warn of the risk of thousands of fishing businesses and thousands of jobs disappearing on account of fuel price rises.
Urgent, extraordinary measures must therefore be taken to support the sector, for example the creation of a guarantee fund, with Community participation, in order to stabilise fuel prices.
Until such time as that fund is put in place, the fishing businesses affected must be granted some form of temporary compensation.
in writing. (PT) I voted in favour of the report by Mr dos Santos because I agree with the principles, the analysis and the proposals it contains.
I also voted in favour because the broader debate engendered by this report, both inside and outside Parliament, has helped to clarify the issues for the general public and to ensure that experts and politicians are better informed.
I was able to use this report in a paper on geopolitics and energy that I gave in Ankara at the EU/Turkey Parliamentary Committee.
Furthermore, I had the honour of taking part in a seminar in Lisbon organised by Mr dos Santos, where I chaired two panels.
At the conference, the report was discussed in great detail with high-level personalities, experts and interested members of the public.
The debate on energy issues must go on and must go further.
Mr dos Santos's report is a positive contribution to that debate.
in writing.
The high cost of oil has significant adverse effects on businesses and families in Scotland, where there is still substantial dependence upon road transportation of goods and passengers, due to a lack of realistic alternatives in large areas of rural Scotland, and due to the distances involved in transporting goods to mainland European markets.
The situation in Scotland is worsened by the fact that the UK Government imposes very high taxation levels on road fuels, further disadvantaging Scots traders and travellers.
I supported the Dos Santos report, which rightly identifies the need to prioritise development of renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency.
Scotland has considerable potential to contribute to such developments.
We also have in Scotland a significant offshore oil and gas resources, and it is essential that we maintain a set of economic circumstances which will encourage exploration and full extraction of that resource.
My belief is that an independent Scottish government would ensure that all of Scotland's energy resource potential can be maximised.
in writing. (MT) The economic impact of the increase in oil prices is considerably greater in situations such as that of Malta, which is a country wholly dependent on oil as its energy source.
This is a problem that has never been addressed with the urgency it deserves, despite the fact that a country of Malta's size lends itself more easily to the development of creative alternatives.
If our limited space does not allow us to build large alternative energy plants, then fiscal incentives must be made available to those businesses and families that want to invest in cleaner energy technology.
Due to a lack of planning in the area of oil purchasing, Maltese and Gozitan families and businesses now have to pay a surcharge on their electricity bills, which currently stands at 45%.
This surcharge on services that are so essential is proving to be a financial burden on families, especially those in the lower income bracket, and is giving rise to extra costs for companies - a development that in turn is putting pressure on the cost of living.
Worse, this continuous fluctuation in prices makes it difficult for individuals to plan ahead, and this leads to uncertainty.
What is even worse is that, while people are asked to pay extra for indispensable services, there is an unjustified waste of public resources.
The European Parliament's recommendations indicate long-term solutions to the problem.
However, governments too should plan ahead in order to be able to cope with problems such as these and not expect their mistakes to be paid for by workers, families and small businesses.
The impact of the current increase in oil prices is highly significant for a European economy showing only weak signs of recovery.
Its effect in lowering GDP growth, employment levels and investment, as well as the different energy dependency levels in the EU Member States make our task all the more difficult.
The social consequences are thus easy to predict, given that accommodation and transport are the top two items of expenditure for European families: inequality in purchasing power will inevitably increase.
It is clear, therefore, how important it is to complete the internal market in energy, to increase competitiveness and to boost investment in alternative energy sources.
It is necessary to guarantee that freedom of movement remains a pillar of European growth, and it is therefore vital to ensure that European mobility is not affected, and that social exclusion and the impoverishment of the most vulnerable members of society do not result.
The European energy supply crisis can only be mitigated effectively by means of a global EU strategy aimed at the gradual reduction in oil dependency, the development and production of alternative fuels, including looking into the nuclear option, and innovative solutions to managing transport systems as a whole.
in writing. On behalf of the EPLP we support the broad principles and thrust of this report given that it deals with a very urgent problem facing the European Union.
The problem is oil price shocks caused by major disruptions to oil supply, whilst at the same time demand grows across the world for this increasingly scarce resource.
However, we would disagree that there is a need for tax harmonisation on this issue.
Whilst many of the recommendations from the rapporteur are completely acceptable and while the UK may practise the essential elements of the tax regime proposed already, we do not believe it is the role of the EU to set a rate of taxes in Member States.
That concludes voting time.

Dialogue between the Chinese government and Envoys of the Dalai Lama (debate)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Envoys of the Dalai Lama.
author. - (NL) Mr President, it is no good thing that the world at large should have accepted for so long China's conception of Tibet as an integral part of itself.
The Tibetans embody their own culture in inhospitable living conditions, isolated and high up in the mountains.
For a long time, China has been unable to resist the temptation to consider that region as a fall-back that can absorb sections of its own very large population.
This is a problem not only for the people of Tibet, but also for those of the neighbouring and more readily accessible region of Xinjiang, home to the Uighurs, who are related to the Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the Kazaks, Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks.
They fear becoming minorities in their own countries and losing everything that is dear to them.
Moreover, we should certainly not idealise the traditional living conditions of Tibetans and Uighurs.
Although sweeping changes are called for, these changes should not be imposed from outside or, what is more, serve outside interests.
Since China is the world's most populated country and an up-and-coming economic power, it is extremely unlikely that Tibet will be given the opportunity to develop into an independent state.
This makes it all the more important that, 50 years after the major conflict, there should be a reconciliation in which, within China, the Tibetans are allowed to retain the most valuable traits of their individuality and they no longer run the risk of becoming the victim of state violence.
These days, the progress ideology that has dominated China for nearly 60 years is mainly focused on economic growth.
Although this has drawbacks, it does offer more scope for tolerance and recognition of diversity than was the case for a long time.
A dialogue or cultural individuality and self-governance within China should pay off.
My group is in favour of anything that can contribute to this dialogue and to peaceful solutions.
author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe simply to join in the request, directed primarily towards the Chinese regime, to resume dialogue - and let us not forget that this request is also addressed to our European institutions.
As the European Parliament, in the past we have made the proposal that a special representative be appointed to deal with the issue of Tibet, but we know that the proposal has so far not been implemented.
In my view, this would be a useful and tangible contribution.
There are also other instruments, such as a declaration by the Presidency of the European Union.
I hope that the discussion and the debate will not be restricted to a mere invitation to the Chinese regime, since this request is also of direct concern, at the highest levels, to the institutions of the European Union.
We should not be afraid of this.
This Parliament has shown that it is not naively utopian in urging the importance of political and commercial relations with the Chinese regime.
In this Chamber, nobody wishes to deny the real significance of such relations; nor is there any need, however, to commit the opposite error, and that is to 'poison' a line of action that is clearly highly popular, not within the institutions but with the people.
The Tibet issue and support for dialogue are matters which enjoy the support of the people of Europe.
For that reason, excessive timidity deriving from other motivations should not be allowed to influence the current debate, attention to human rights or the resumption of dialogue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all of you for attending this debate on Tibet - particularly now that we have reached an important point, with solutions to a problem that has been smouldering away for decades within reach.
This is only the case, however, if the Chinese Government, too, stops deliberately raising certain issues as stumbling blocks.
For example, it is unacceptable to put the spotlight on the history issue; that is, to ask whether or not Tibet was ever part of China.
This is completely the wrong question to ask.
Instead we must look to the future.
We have to keep repeating that the Dalai Lama and the Tibetans themselves are striving for autonomy - and not just on paper - allowing them cultural and religious freedom and access to education.
They are not questioning the 'one China' policy.
This must be emphasised time and again, even if the solicitations from the Chinese Embassy that many of my fellow Members have no doubt received in recent days tell a quite different story.
I can tell you that we know how things stand.
We need dialogue, and we want this dialogue.
Europe must support it - I fully agree with the previous speaker on this.
Europe must bring this dialogue into much sharper focus and also conduct it at official level.
author. - Mr President, the dialogue between the Government of China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama is to be warmly welcomed and should continue to receive our approval and support.
Only through forward-looking dialogue will pragmatic solutions be found that will meet the aspirations of the Tibetan people and fully respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Let us always keep in mind that the 'one China' policy is a long-standing EU position.
Our support is undeniable, but we should also ensure that this support becomes practical.
Such practical support should be offered in the context of the new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and China.
Personally, I do not support the idea of a special representative for Tibet because we already have enough means in our hands to facilitate such a dialogue.
China has an enormously positive role to play in world affairs.
Just one example: China made a vital contribution to the success of the six-party talks on North Korea just yesterday.
We can use this as an example and as a lesson.
If China can make a positive contribution through structured dialogue to regional peace and stability, then we can also engage China in a dialogue which will help to create a climate of confidence that will allow for a pragmatic solution to the Tibet issue.
author. - (PL) Mr President, on 26 October 2006 the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the shooting of unarmed women and children in the Nangpa-la pass.
We also called for those responsible for this crime to be punished.
The incident caused an outcry the world over, but to no avail, as the situation in the region remains unchanged.
It is true that no reports of further brutal murders have reached us recently, but this does not mean that the situation has improved.
It seems to me that little has changed in this age-old conflict during the three months that have elapsed since our last debate.
We must be consistent, however, and bear the rights of the 6 million people affected by the problems in the region uppermost in our minds.
This is a region where human rights are still constantly violated, even in the 21st century.
In my view, this problem should be a priority for the new President of the European Parliament and therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for us all.
author. - (DE) Mr President, what good are bilateral talks if they do not produce any tangible results?
Do they mask an inability to act, or do they at least contribute to confidence-building?
Parliament is rightly calling for the resumption of the dialogue, last conducted one year ago, between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.
Items on the agenda should include the elimination of reprisals, an end to human rights violations, and tangible measures to guarantee the Tibetan population cultural and religious autonomy.
The dialogue was launched in September 2002.
China has been blocking it for 12 months. The grounds are always the same: preconditions are to be met; the Dalai Lama is not interested in improving relations, and is striving for Tibetan independence.
This is simply not true.
For years, His Holiness has been interested not in an independent state, but in Tibetan autonomy.
There are good examples of this kind of legal status even in the EU.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stands by four positions, as do almost all other groupings in this House.
Firstly, an EU Special Representative for Tibet must be appointed.
It is insufficient that this issue be relegated to the fringe of EU-China dialogue.
Secondly, we want the Commission to make Tibet an integral part of the EU-China Partnership and Cooperation Framework Agreement.
We ask that the Commission inform Parliament of progress and retrogression.
Thirdly, the Council should include in its annual report information on current developments with regard to the China-Tibet dialogue.
Fourthly, the EU should draw up joint strategies with its partners in the world, particularly the USA.
It is my fervent hope that the representatives of the People's Republic of China understand the desire of the international community - as just expressed by my fellow Members - for China to resume this dialogue with the Tibetans at long last.
After all, China's representatives are most preoccupied with good press in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
I believe that today's debates on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama's representatives are particularly important for a number of reasons, but above all, because on 17 January this year negotiations officially started in Beijing toward a new agreement on the basics of partnership and cooperation between the European Union and China.
More than once we have expressed support for the commitment of the Government of the PRC and His Holiness the Dalai Lama to resolve the issue of Tibet by means of dialogue.
I think the European Parliament, which in the past has adopted more than one resolution on Tibet, on the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China and likewise on dialogue between the PRC and the Dalai Lama's representatives, must urge the European Council, the Commission and European Union member countries to actively support the intensifying of this dialogue and to seek a result.
While no tangible results have yet been obtained in the resolution of these basic questions, Parliament should - in consultation with both parties - evaluate what further role the EU can play in seeking to facilitate a solution of the Tibet issue by means of negotiation, and it should appoint a special European Union envoy to Tibet.
I support the position of the resolution we are considering that the Senior Commissioner and the Council's Secretary-General be encouraged to include information about progress on the dialogue between the PRC and representatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2007 and also in later years in the Annual Report to Parliament on General International and Security Policy.
I think the country currently presiding over the Council - Germany - could initiate and accept a declaration that would show how the European Union might assist in achieving a peaceful resolution of the Tibet question through negotiation.
In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Thomas Mann and other colleagues who initiated the resolution being considered today.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the question of Tibet's status is raised in the European Parliament several times a year.
So far, however, the resolutions we have adopted have not led to any tangible results.
The same is unfortunately also true of the consultations that have been taking place between the Tibetans and the Chinese Government since 2002.
The problem of Tibet remains unresolved.
In the meantime, over 1 200 000 of the six million Tibetans have lost their lives under the Chinese occupation that began in 1951.
Every year, some 3 000 inhabitants of Tibet flee their country.
These are mainly children and young people, who can only obtain a Tibetan education abroad.
The Tibetan people are discriminated against in every area of social life, from education through to social care, work, living conditions and religion.
We must act in solidarity and exert pressure on the Chinese Government, so that the dialogue is resumed as soon as possible and the status of Tibet regulated.
The European Commission should raise the matter of discussions with the Dalai Lama during negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between China and the Union.
For its part, the Council should define the Union's role in resolving the Tibet issue, as the outcome of the negotiations between China and Tibet should be reflected in the Council's annual report to Parliament on the implementation of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the problem of Tibet has been with us for many years and, as has already been mentioned, this House has dealt with different aspects relating to this problem many times in the past.
In essence, the core issue of dispute between the people of Tibet and China has been the wish of the Tibetans for self-determination, as opposed to the Chinese Government's fear of a possible domino effect leading to the break-up of China.
In fact, such a problem has been the commonest cause of disputes worldwide.
However, history has shown that by far the best and most effective way to solve such problems is through peaceful and open negotiations with a prerequisite determination on the part of all concerned to find a lasting solution.
The alternative way - that of endless confrontation and bloodshed - usually leads nowhere and is, in most cases, to the detriment of both sides.
With this in mind, we would warmly welcome a commitment by both the Government of China, in particular, and the Dalai Lama to resolve the Tibet question through a process of dialogue, and wholeheartedly hope that such a process, if brought about, will lead to a successful resolution of the Tibetan problem.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Despite the fact that since 2002 there have been five rounds of dialogue between the Government of the People's Republic of China and representatives of the Dalai Lama, it is abundantly clear that there are fundamental differences standing in the way of reaching a definitive agreement that clarifies the situation of Tibet in a way that is satisfactory to all of the parties, while at the same time being fair and proper, particularly for the people of Tibet.
Nevertheless, I am one of those who believe that the responsibility of each of the two parties for the fact that an agreement has not been reached cannot be compared.
The Dalai Lama, as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, has demonstrated his desire for dialogue and agreement on more than one occasion, and he has even given up his demand for complete independence in favour of a genuine autonomy that guarantees respect for the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identity of Tibet.
In this regard, I believe that it is the Chinese Government that should show greater signs of willingness and at least accept a resumption of dialogue with a view to reaching a good final agreement.
I would therefore urge the European Commission, the Council and the Member States to take every possible opportunity to support a new round of dialogue between China and Tibet.
In particular, as others have said, it is essential that we take advantage of the negotiations of a framework agreement on European Union-China cooperation, which began on 17 January, to express the Community's commitment to dialogue and a fair and lasting solution to the issue of Tibet.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, it is often the case that different standards are applied to China, where human rights are concerned, than to countries where lucrative contracts are unlikely to materialise.
It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral.
When reading the relevant resolutions, which reflect not only the positions of the different groups in connection with this dialogue, but also the stance of official Europe, I, as a Fleming, do have some reservations.
Politicians who, yesterday and the day before that, while discussing the Fava report, brandished international law and insisted on human rights - which they were right to do - are now suddenly talking about the need to respect China's sovereignty, whilst not breathing a word about the illegal occupation and subsequent annexation of Tibet, about the mass human rights violations, the ever increasing exclusion of the Tibetans from their local government, or the Namdrang Rangdrik programme, launched in 2005, whereby Tibetans are forced to demolish their houses and subsequently rebuild them according to strict official guidelines.
The sanctimonious line is that a mutually acceptable solution must be found for Tibet's future.
To say that is to make victim and executioner equal partners in dialogue.
It became once again evident on whose side the EU is when in November 2005, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, was received with much pomp and circumstance across Europe, yet it had, in fact, been he who perpetrated serious human rights violations when he was Secretary of Tibet's Communist Party between December 1988 and March 1992.
The Tibet issue once again demonstrates that European rhetoric all too often amounts to nothing but moral wrapping paper and that in reality, only economic interests matter.
We must continue to have the courage to denounce the cowardice and sanctimoniousness of this Europe, of this mercantile Europe that chooses to side with the oppressors to the detriment of innocent peoples.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, thank you for your very strong commitment to human rights.
I trust the honourable Members have noticed the same strong focus on fundamental human rights and universal values in the recent Commission communication and in the Council conclusions on China.
This reflects the fact that it is and will remain an important priority for the European Union with regard to our overall relations with that country.
We share the concern expressed in the joint resolution regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and, in particular, the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.
This issue has been regularly addressed by the European Union in the framework of bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, such as our bilateral summits and senior officials' meetings.
Former European Parliament President, Mr Borrell, also raised the matter when he officially visited China last year.
With regard to the recent shooting mentioned by Mr Czarnecki, I would like to inform you that this matter was formally taken up by the European Union during the last session of the EU-China Dialogue on human rights held in Beijing in October 2006 and via the subsequent follow-up dÃ©marche in December 2006. On both occasions, the EU urged the Chinese authorities to undertake a thorough investigation of this incident and refuted the Chinese claim that the shooting had been done in self-defence.
We will follow this serious matter closely.
I agree with Mr Matsakis that bloodshed leads nowhere.
The Commission has regularly kept this Chamber informed regarding its overall policy vis-Ã -vis Tibet and will continue to do so.
As Commissioner Fischer Boel underlined in this Chamber in October 2006, the EU has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet, which will hopefully lead to the recognition of a genuine autonomy of the Tibetan region.
We have therefore followed very closely and welcomed the five rounds of talks which have taken place up to now between the Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.
In this respect, EU officials have regular contacts with the two Special Envoys, the last being in November 2006.
Even in this Chamber there are differing opinions on the question of the appointment of a special EU envoy.
We have our doubts about the value of such an appointment, because such an envoy would probably be prevented from having a real impact on the ground or from playing a significant role in this dialogue.
We need the two sides to continue and deepen the dialogue.
We agree with the honourable Members that this dialogue should be regular and substantive, and that the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence.
We take note that the Tibetan side is ready for a rapid resumption of the dialogue and hope that the Chinese side is willing to do the same.
The European Union will spare no efforts in stressing the importance of this dialogue to both parties on all possible occasions.
I also want to express my gratitude for your attention and focus on this matter and your support, especially now via this resolution, because such support is helpful in the process.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to express my thanks for this motion for a joint resolution.
I believe that it is sound, impartial and relevant.
Constructive solutions need to be found for this age-old issue of Tibet.
The motion for a resolution is geared towards finding a solution to the Tibet question which is compatible with China's right to self-determination and which respects the rights of the people of Tibet, and this, I think, is the right approach.
We need a constructive, peaceful process that recognises that Tibetan nationals have a right to their own culture and religion.
As citizens of Europe and of the world, we have to ensure that people's fundamental rights can be implemented around the world.
In this respect it is to be hoped that people's cultural and religious rights will not be restricted in Tibet either.
We would hope that proper dialogue can be established between Tibet and China, leading to a solution that is satisfactory to both sides.
I hope that we will find practical solutions which also show respect for China's regional inviolability but which at the same time fulfil the wishes of the Tibetan people.
I do not know if this is too much to hope for, but we in the European Union must work hard to establish such a peaceful coexistence.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order.
As we have often complained about the Council's absence from our Thursday afternoon debates on human rights, I would like to point out that, today, the German Presidency is represented, and in the person of its spokesman on human rights Mr Nooke, who was at one time a civil rights activist in the former German Democratic Republic.
This is something of a sensation.
It is one that gives us pleasure, and I would be very happy if, during the trilogue, we could bring pressure to bear to ensure that this becomes something of a dependable tradition, that is to say, that the presence of the Council - Mr Nooke is here as an observer today - becomes a fixture in these Thursday afternoon human rights debates in future.
In any event, Mr Nooke, many thanks for joining us here today.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr Posselt's contribution was not a point of order, but we agree entirely with him.
2.
Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq (debate)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq.
author. - (DE) Mr President, although this resolution on the situation of refugees from and in Iraq is a very sound one, it is silent on the central issue, namely the reasons why there are refugees in and from Iraq.
The primary reason is the occupation of Iraq by troops from the US, the UK and other EU Member States, and, above all, the nature of that occupation.
If you pursue a policy of occupation of this nature, you should not be surprised when it generates refugees.
Despite Germany's restrictive asylum policy, people from Iraq now form the largest group of asylum-seekers in that country.
According to figures from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 1.7 million refugees within Iraq and a further 2 million in neighbouring countries.
These people are fleeing because Iraq is in a state of war.
The Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have presented a study, published in the New York Times and the Washington Post, which estimated the number of Iraqis over and above the normal mortality rate who died as a result of the invasion and its consequences between March 2003 and July 2006 to be 650 000.
Of these, the estimates count 600 000 people who have died as a direct result of violence and 50 000 who have died as a result of disease and other causes.
The study goes on to say that, after the end of the invasion, 31% of the victims were believed to have been killed by coalition troops or air raids.
According to the Johns Hopkins University, the risk of dying a violent death is 58 times higher than before the invasion.
What I want to say to this House is that these figures show that the occupation of Iraq is wrong and must finally be brought to an end.
The collective support of this war by a number of EU Member States, including Germany, must cease.
If that happened, there would not, in fact, be as many people who have to flee as there are at present, as has been quite properly stated in the resolution.
author. - Mr President, my thanks to colleagues for initiating this important debate.
I cannot agree with the point made by the previous speaker, which was not discussed when we framed this report.
May I say that what we can do in the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament is something different.
There are huge numbers of Iraqi refugees in Jordan, in Syria and in other neighbouring states, yet in almost every one of those countries these refugees are not allowed to work.
Their children are prevented from going to school.
Their parents and children are not allowed access to healthcare.
They are in a desperate plight and there is no state support for them, as there would be were they in European Union Member States as refugees.
Inside the country there are huge numbers of IDPs - internally displaced people - equally without work, without food, far from their homes.
They have been displaced mainly through religious and ethnic cleansing, one of the most miserable of wars to fight internally, as we know so well from our past history in Europe.
The Shia are fleeing the Sunni, the Sunni are fleeing the Shia and many others are fleeing because of the various different insurgencies that are going on.
I would suggest, therefore, that the European Commission, which has worked mightily on this problem, should declare Iraq an emergency.
I would ask the Council of Ministers, which has also worked incredibly hard with the Government of Iraq, to discuss this with the Commission and with other G8 donors, for example.
Iraq has in a sense been put on one side.
People have been unclear as to what to do, but today, now, the Iraqi people are back in the sort of crisis they were in under the prolonged dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, under whom many more fled and under whom many more were killed.
But here we are.
They need our help.
I strongly request that the Commission and the Council of Ministers declare Iraq to be in an emergency state, to mobilise donor funding and spend it accordingly: housing inside, aid outside.
There is a lot that we can do, but we have to look at the situation differently.
author. - Mr President, this unhappy debate takes note of the oh-so-predictable humanitarian disaster which has afflicted the people of Iraq since the coalition invaded illegally.
It also demonstrates the double standards of our own Member State governments, particularly, I am afraid, my own in London, rather than Edinburgh, where I would rather it were.
Chancellor Gordon Brown was asked how much funding was to be allocated to the military action and his answer was 'as much as it takes'.
I am afraid the financial allocation to the humanitarian support measures is shameful.
As we have heard, the United Nations estimates that 1.8 million people have been forcibly displaced within Iraq and 2 million have fled that unhappy country.
That is more than the population of a number of our Member States.
Prime Minister Blair worries about international terrorism - he talks about it often enough.
Well he might!
The direct result of his policies has created the best possible recruiting ground al-Qa'ida could ever have asked for.
So, what to do?
As we, of course, go through airport security this evening flying home from this place, let us think that that is Prime Minister Blair's legacy to Europe and to global politics.
We, as we have heard, can do better: by sticking to our principles and by digging deep into our budgets.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross efforts are severely underfunded.
The countries neighbouring Iraq are in desperate straits and in dire need of support.
This motion has a number of points in it which I commend to the House.
We did not create this disaster, but we are in a position to ameliorate its effects.
By doing so, I hope we can lead by example where so many of our Member State governments have so comprehensively failed.
author. - (PT) Mr President, the text that we are submitting today for Parliament's approval very much reflects the fact that this situation can only be described as a human tragedy of massive proportions.
I should like to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr AntÃ³nio Guterres, for drawing attention to this disaster, which took place on 7 February.
I should also like to give a special word of commendation to the Swedish authorities for their exceptional European-level response to the human disaster.
I should particularly like to commend the Egyptian authorities, which is the non-bordering country that has done by far the most to welcome these refugees, and I should like to make a heartfelt plea to the Egyptian authorities not to prevent these refugees from arriving or to suspend the conditions for hosting them when they arrive.
Most of all, however, I wish to call on the Commission and the Council - as Mr Posselt, who is here today, so aptly reminded us - to open their eyes, to go to Iraq and to see what is happening there.
A disaster of this nature would never be possible unless it were organised from somewhere, as was the case previously in Rwanda and in the Balkans.
We can no longer turn a blind eye; we must go to Iraq and understand what is happening.
In this connection, I should like to say that I am proud that I was there recently.
I have drawn up a report and invite all my fellow Members to have a look at it on the Internet.
author. - (PL) Mr President, I do not wish to speak about politics.
Mr Casaca has just recalled the political context of the invasion of Iraq and its consequences.
He may well be right.
I would prefer to focus on issues that may not be as important for journalists or for politicians like ourselves, but which are probably far more important for those who are currently going through hard times in Iraq, namely the refugees.
In my view, the underlying reasons for events in the world of politics are of secondary importance.
What is really important is what we can actually do.
I am firmly convinced that we are currently being perceived as helpless by the rest of the world.
I am also firmly convinced that the European Union is not in a position to provide real help to these people.
This is even truer of the United States, and is really tragic.
There seem to be two aspects to the situation in Iraq.
There are the victims of attacks, in the form of the hundreds and thousands of people we see on our television screens.
They make up the news we are bombarded with.
We hear very little, however, about the other aspect of the situation in Iraq, namely the tens of thousands of refugees.
The European Union must certainly not appear helpless in this regard, and I agree with the previous speakers who referred to initiatives by the Scandinavian countries and to Egypt's role.
All that is true.
We must make a clear and determined statement to the effect that we are interested not only in that first aspect, namely the victims of the attacks we see on television.
We must let it be known that, as Europeans, as European politicians, we are equally concerned about refugees.
The refugee problem is probably one of the greatest embarrassments for those who started this war and for those who are pursuing it, even if they are acting with the best of intentions.
A reaction is therefore necessary, and that is what the European Parliament is currently engaged in.
I am grateful for the wise words contributed by other speakers today.
author. - (FI) Mr President, behind the Iraqi refugee problem is a set of circumstances the like of which it is predicted will only become more common in various future conflicts.
The situation has reached a state of civil war.
The Christian minority in particular have become a scapegoat, and many Christians have been killed.
Iraqi security forces have been unable to protect Christians, no matter what the Government's attitude is.
For example, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon have taken it upon themselves to place refugees temporarily.
In these countries, the United Nations refugee agency has not been able to confer refugee status on incoming Iraqis during the current conflict because the situation does not meet the criteria of the Geneva Convention.
The present Government in Iraq is not persecuting Christians, but the problem is that sects inside the country are, and the Government cannot do anything about it.
International agreements therefore do not grant refugee status to Iraqi Christians, although there is no doubt that they are in need of temporary protection.
To protect the asylum seekers, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not made a negative decision with regard to them either, since otherwise the host country could return them to Iraq, a situation which the UNHCR wants to avoid.
Accordingly, it is vitally important that the international community responds to the agency's appeal for more international support.
To aid the refugees, international assistance is required so that Iraq's neighbouring countries, which are struggling with huge numbers of refugees, will not close their borders to Iraqis.
The latest news that the United States of America is accepting more refugees is a step in the right direction, and is vital, because earlier the United States had been shirking its responsibilities in this area.
We need more news like this.
Of the EU countries, Sweden deserves special mention.
The Iraqi refugee situation is absolutely desperate.
There is a shortage of everything: food, medicines, health care and fuel.
I heard of actual examples of this when the human rights organisation I head met a group of Iraqi Christian refugees in Turkey last autumn.
Crucial, however, to the assistance of Iraqis is to establish comprehensive reforms to promote justice and the law throughout Iraq.
Similarly, the Iraqi Government must do all it can to bring those guilty of crimes and breaches of human rights to justice.
This is essential if the unrest and violence against minorities is to cease.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I endorse this resolution, not least because, at least in some of its subsidiary clauses, it vigorously champions the rights of the persecuted and imperilled Christians of Iraq.
We must bear in mind that the Christian communities in today's Iraq are probably some of the most ancient in the world.
They have survived for 1 300 years as a minority in a Muslim-dominated part of the world, something for which those Muslims also deserve credit, yet today, in a time of massive Western presence in Iraq, they are under threat.
This has to do with the fact that Iraq was put together as an artificial state after the First World War, that that state is now on the point of breaking up and that its constituent parts are attempting to make themselves homogenous units through a process of nationalistic self-discovery which, of course, poses a particular threat to the minorities.
There is one laudable exception, and that is the Kurdish sector.
This is something worth highlighting.
I do, however, call on Shias and Sunnis to follow in the great tolerant tradition of their forefathers and once again afford the Christian communities in Iraq the protection that they have enjoyed in that part of the world for over a thousand years.
I call, above all, on the Commission to go into bat strongly for the rights of Christians, because who else will do this if we do not?
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, on 8 January, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued an urgent call for funding to the donor states for a new USD 60 million aid programme.
The object is to help hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the conflict in Iraq, irrespective of their faith.
Such massive movements of fleeing people are the results of a war that was begun against the will of the international community, yet it is the international community that now has to bear, and pay for, the terrible consequences.
We are currently witnessing the largest long-term exodus since the displacement of the Palestinians in 1948.
One in eight Iraqis is a refugee.
In 2006 alone, half a million Iraqis fled their country.
Every month, another 50 000 join them.
There may now be 1.7 million deracinated Iraqis in Iraq.
By the end of 2007, the UNHCR estimates this number could be 2.3 million.
The longer the conflict goes on, the worse will be the plight of these displaced persons and the communities that help them and that want to help them.
We call on the Member States and the Commission to support the UNHCR, politically and financially, in its work protecting the refugees, irrespective of their faith.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figures given are more or less in agreement: we are now approaching 4 million refugees, around half of whom are 'external' and the other half 'internal' within Iraq.
To all intents and purposes this is a humanitarian catastrophe almost without precedent, and for this reason the opportunity offered by the Geneva Conference on 17 April 2007 should not be wasted: the European Union must prepare itself and arrive in force, with a political presence at the highest levels, having already decided on an appropriate amount of funds to put on the table.
If this is not done, we risk total failure.
This is a point on which we all need to be united, regardless of the political reasons for the conflict: thus the greatest possible unity is needed to resolve an issue which is liable to explode in our faces, with disastrous consequences.
With regard to its causes, I believe that perhaps - obviously this is not the subject of our resolution; I am just mentioning it to the representatives of the Council and the Commission - it would be useful to take into consideration the possibility, faced with the daily carnage in Iraq, of referring the matter to the International Criminal Court, since these are crimes against humanity, committed systematically and on a daily basis.
Perhaps this could also be helpful with regard to the causes of this humanitarian catastrophe.
Mr President, I too want to focus on the Assyrian Christians who are now seeking refuge mainly in Syria and Jordan.
Iraq's Christian communities are amongst the world's most ancient, speaking Aramaic, the language of Christ.
They suffered terribly during the 1915 Armenian genocide, and then again under the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy for cooperating with the British during the First World War.
Then they suffered again during Saddam Hussein's days when he had the war with the Kurds.
Today there are only about 6 000 to 8 000 who remain, mainly living in the Nineveh Plain.
As many as 60 000 Assyrian Christians, or perhaps even more, have fled since the beginning of the insurgency that followed the US-led invasion in 2003.
Their exodus was accelerated in August 2004 after the start of the terrorist bombing campaign against Christian churches by Islamists, who accused them of collaborating with the allies solely by virtue of their practising the Christian faith.
Last April the European Parliament voted for the Assyrians to be allowed to establish, on the basis of Section 5 of the Iraqi Constitution, a federal region where they can practise their own unique way of life, free and safe from outside interference.
I call again on this House, on the Commission and on the Human Rights Special Observer from the German Presidency, for this solution to be considered as a possibility.
(LT) Every day we hear about bloody explosions in Iraq, and the victim count is growing steadily.
We do not get enough information though about another tragedy - the painful fate of becoming a refugee has affected 4 million Iraqis.
Almost one in six of the inhabitants of that country has been forced to leave his or her home, the number of refugees is increasing, and their situation is terrible.
The United Nations Organisation is trying to help, but unsuccessfully, because the international community has still not grasped the seriousness of the situation.
The initiative of Sweden, which has agreed to grant refugee status to 9 000 Iraqis, is to be commended.
Not many EU countries so far, especially the new ones, have had the resolve to follow this example.
However, particular responsibility falls on the United States, which, willy-nilly, created the current situation, in which Iraq is wading ever deeper into the quagmire of a nation beset by divisive internal and external conflicts.
(Applause)
Mr President, the emergence of Saddam Hussein in the post-colonial troubled era in Iraq brought a rule of intimidation, persecution and murder of citizens.
The illegal military invasion and occupation of Iraq undertaken in 2003 by Mr Bush and his British bulldog, Mr Blair, have brought an unprecedented calamity to the people of Iraq.
The Bush-Blair duo has succeeded in accomplishing in the space of three years what the likes of Saddam Hussein did not succeed in doing for thirty years, i.e. to bring the country completely to its knees, with hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians killed, with utter lawlessness, with comprehensive destruction of the country's infrastructure and with millions of internal and external refugees.
The USA and Britain could together spend over one thousand billion dollars a year supporting their war machines in Iraq, which largely caused the problem in the first place, but now expect the international community to deal with the enormous humanitarian problem of the Iraq refugees.
Instead of the USA and Britain taking care of the Iraqi refugees and all the necessary costs involved, they expect neighbouring and European countries to do so.
Fair enough: we must not deviate from the rule that those who cause a catastrophe very seldom pay for it.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the German Presidency, and warmly welcoming the presence of its representative at today's debate.
I am delighted the German Ombudsman is with us today.
According to UN data, almost two million people have left Iraq in recent years because of the danger to their lives, the chaos and the difficult economic conditions.
We are witnessing a major tragedy of refugees fleeing from Iraq to neighbouring countries.
There are a million of them in Syria, some 750 000 in Jordan, over 100 000 in Egypt, 40 000 in Lebanon and many more scattered throughout other countries.
Those Palestinians inside Iraq are in a particularly difficult position.
In its statement on 2 February 2007, Human Rights Watch called on Syria to immediately open its borders to the Palestinians who are currently in danger in Iraq.
The UN is calling for a contribution of USD 60 million to a fund to help refugees from Iraq.
The world cannot remain indifferent to their fate.
Today's decision by the United States to grant asylum in the United States to 7 000 Iraqis next year is a step in the right direction, as is the decision by the United States to contribute USD 18 million to the programme to assist refugees from Iraq.
These are still only drops in the ocean of need, however.
The European Union must play a leading role in the forthcoming conference to be held in Geneva on 17 April 2007.
It must provide financial support to alleviate the plight of the refugees and help resolve this crisis.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I wish to express my gratitude to the authors of this resolution and to the groups and individuals who have presented their opinions.
There was a strong focus on the eminent need for solidarity with the people in great need.
The Commission is also extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the scale of human suffering caused by the ongoing violence in that country, the high level of displacement inside and outside Iraq and the impact this is having on the whole region.
Over the past few months the Commission has kept monitoring the situation, keeping in close contact with other key international players, notably with the Red Cross and the United Nations.
As you have mentioned, we have the same figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: 1.8 million people are now internally displaced and 2 million Iraqis have already fled to neighbouring countries.
As Mr Smith said, that is nearly 4 million people.
However, an exact assessment of the needs inside Iraq has so far been made impossible by the difficulties of gaining access to the affected populations as a result of the security situation.
The conference the United Nations is holding in Geneva in April, which has also been mentioned here, is expected to provide more clarity regarding the situation of internal and external displacements, the impact and the needs.
The Commission will take an active part in that Conference.
I am certain that Mr Cappato expressed an important invitation be united there with the Council and the Member States.
In the meantime, based on the information received from partner international humanitarian agencies, the Commission, through its Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), has decided to allocate EUR 10.2 million for humanitarian aid to the victims of the Iraqi crisis.
As announced this morning by my colleague Mr Michel, an initial funding package of EUR 6.2 million, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, will be proposed for meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees who have fled to countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
The aid will consist of basic healthcare and education, as well as targeted distributions of food and essential household items.
Protection activities are also envisaged, in particular support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' refugee registration system, which is important in identifying the most vulnerable groups and assessing their specific needs.
Another initial funding package of EUR 4 million is in the process of being drawn up for people suffering inside Iraq, based on a careful assessment of priority needs and aid delivery arrangements in what is a highly volatile security environment, as you can imagine.
Humanitarian aid will be provided impartially and without discrimination, with a focus on those most at risk.
The Commission will consider further funding decisions when new needs emerge or when access to groups requiring help, and who are currently out of reach, becomes possible.
The Commission will also continue monitoring the situation closely and to raise specific matters through its regular discussions with third countries and the Government of Iraq, including the Ministry of Displacement and Migration.
If the situation deteriorates further in the coming months, the Commission will examine the situation in the light of the criteria of the Temporary Protection Directive, in order to decide whether to submit to the Council a request to activate the temporary protection mechanism for the Iraqi asylum seekers.
This may offer them immediate protection while, at the same time, providing financial support for their actual reception as well as making arrangements for an eventual redistribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States.
The Commission will also explore, in close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the possibility for a coordinated effort by EU Member States to resettle refugees from the region.
Such a resettlement effort could target particularly vulnerable categories of people, such as women-at-risk and unaccompanied minors.
I want to thank the honourable Members for their resolution and support.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.

Guinea (debate)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Guinea.
author. - (NL) Mr President, when in 1958, France agreed to self-determination for its West African colonies, Guinea was the only one to decide in favour of immediate and complete independence.
In the 11 other colonially governed areas, the elite chose, often disregarding the will of their own people, to perpetuate close administrative, military and economic ties with France.
Guinea, on the other hand, followed the example of the former British colony Ghana, which had gained independence one year earlier, and which wanted to develop an African model of socialism with strong participation of the own population.
The leaders Sekou TourÃ© and Kwame Nkrumah inspired many Africans in their battle for a better future, in which colonialism and poverty were set to be replaced by equality and development.
Unfortunately, a military coup in both countries stopped this development in its tracks.
In Guinea, ContÃ© has wielded dictatorial power since 1984.
Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was represented in parliament was forced to leave it.
The trade union confederations CNTG and USTG are now the main force in the fight for democracy.
The presidential security force, led by the dictator's son, responded to their protest rally on 22 January by killing 59 people and wounding 150 others.
The dictator increasingly treats the country as his own private property.
Like many other countries that are run by dictators, Guinea is also becoming the victim of the fight over natural resources among factions that want to get their hands on the revenues from them. In this case, the resources in question are gold, iron and bauxite.
This resolution stands up for the demands of the democratic opposition, and it enjoys my group's support.
author. - (FR) Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and the representative of the Council for being here today. The time has come for the Union to take action, as the situation in Guinea is sliding downhill.
Guinea has for too long been deliberately kept in a state of underdevelopment by the dictatorial regime and is becoming mired in a tragic deadlock for lack of transparency and democracy.
The people of Guinea have had enough of poverty, destitution and social injustice; they have not enjoyed the benefits of Guinea's riches - the country has an abundance of natural resources - which are monopolised and mismanaged by the President and his cronies, who are as guilty as he is.
President ContÃ©, who has been in power since 1984, is ill, and is clinging to life as he is clinging to power.
If he survives, no one will begrudge him his health.
If, on the other hand, he remains in power and re-establishes a state of emergency. We will neither understand nor accept this.
After decades of undiluted power, one has no choice but to condemn such an attitude when wisdom, or a modicum of compassion for his people, would surely have led the President to prepare for the smooth transfer of power to his successor and for the transition to a genuinely democratic regime.
Instead of that, a state of siege has been declared, the right to assembly and freedom of movement have been curtailed, and the military have violently broken up peaceful demonstrations and killed people. This is unacceptable.
We have no choice but to condemn this brutality, this lack of respect for the most basic human rights of the people of Guinea and the shameful behaviour of a leader who is at the end of his reign but whose capacity for causing suffering is sadly not at an end.
We must demand that a committee of inquiry be set up to look into the events in Guinea in order to ascertain the full extent of the repression and the level of the hierarchy at which decisions have been taken and by whom.
Furthermore, will the EU demand political dialogue, as laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement?
We must keep a very close eye on the situation, because, if it were to continue to worsen, not only would the people of Guinea suffer but so too could the whole of that region of Africa, as the deepening internal conflict would spread to neighbouring countries.
The past is sadly all too full of such examples.
author. - Mr President, you might be surprised to know that Guinea has a long history of association with Europe.
It first became known to Europeans during the Portuguese discoveries that started the slave trade in the 15th century.
In 1890, present-day Guinea was created as a French colony and remained so until 1958.
From 1958 until 1984 the country was governed by a dictator, Ahmed SÃ©kou TourÃ©, who was supported by the Soviet Union.
Following TourÃ©'s death in 1984, a new totalitarian regime took over, headed by another dictator, Lansana ContÃ©, who some claim was supported largely by the West.
ContÃ©'s rule has certainly been better than TourÃ©'s, but is still very far from being democratic.
The heavy-handed approach to political opponents and the events in February which led to the killing of 23 demonstrators is proof of that.
Guinea represents a country used and sometimes abused by Europe in the past and is now struggling to survive in extreme poverty and political instability.
Guinea's mineral wealth makes it, potentially at least, one of Africa's richest countries.
We, as Europeans, have a duty to assist its people - honestly and effectively this time - in finding and following the road to true democracy, freedom, justice and prosperity.
author. - (FR) Mr President, in Guinea, since 17 January, an old senile dictator has been massacring his people with complete impunity in order to protect his regime, his corrupt friends and his waning power.
Guinea is in complete decline.
Despite its status as the leading exporter of bauxite and despite its deposits of gold, diamonds and iron, its people are among the poorest in the world.
Its wealth is consumed by corruption, and bad governance does the rest.
Repression beats down on a people who no longer accept it.
President ContÃ©'s only response to the January strikes was to have the crowd fired on, to imprison the trade unionists, then, having pretended to negotiate on 27 January, to go back on his commitment to appoint a consensus prime minister and to declare a state of emergency.
There have now been more than one hundred deaths, and the massacre goes on.
Europe cannot remain silent and do nothing.
We cannot wait for Guinea to descend into chaos with unforeseeable consequences for the region.
Europe has a responsibility to fulfil.
We call on the Commission to implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, applicable in the event of violation of human rights and democratic principles.
We must now support the people of Guinea and demand that the authorities end the massacres immediately, release those arrested during the demonstrations, restore civil liberties, lift the state of siege, open negotiations with the trade unions and civil society, and, in cooperation with the opposition parties, appoint a consensus prime minister and government.
Furthermore, I believe that the European Union must call for elections to be convened under international supervision, with missions sent by the European Union and the United Nations.
That is what is currently being done in Mauritania, involving our fellow Member, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, to whom I pay tribute in this House, and it was what was done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with results that have been extremely effective and significant.
Finally, we must indeed support the proposal for an independent committee of inquiry, led by the United Nations, into the violence of recent months.
After twenty-three years of dictatorship, enough is enough; the European people must stand alongside the people of Guinea in their fight for freedom and dignity.
author. - (DE) Mr President, as has been said already, Guinea's fishing, farming and raw material resources make it, potentially, a very prosperous country. The fact that, despite this, the country is languishing in miserable poverty is a result of the terrible mismanagement, the dictatorship and the abysmal administration by the state that have obtained there for decades and I am most grateful to Mr Matsakis for having pointed out that SÃ©kou TourÃ©, to whom Mr Meijer referred, was one of worst dictators ever to rule over it.
Today too, unfortunately, the prevailing state of affairs is anything but acceptable, for which reason we must call on the current transitional president - for he cannot be any more than this - to use the short period that remains to him to bring about an ordered transition to democracy and the rule of law.
He can only do this, however, if he does not name a puppet as prime minister, as he now has, but only if he truly commits to the demands of the trade unions and the democracy movement and constitutes a broad-based transitional government, including the forces of opposition, which then does nothing other than set about creating public order and preparing free elections so that the past terror and dictatorship can finally give place to democracy and prosperity.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, like many other African countries, Guinea is rich in mineral resources but at the same time is extremely poor.
A large proportion of its people live in abject poverty.
This was the reason for the strikes and demonstrations that took place in 2005 and also at the start of this year, protesting against the corrupt rule of Lasana ContÃ© who has been in power for 23 years.
The strikes are an expression of discontent regarding inflation, unemployment, energy and water shortages and the high price of basic goods.
In recent times, the strikes have also led to the interruption of the export of aluminium ore, which is Guinea's most precious asset.
Tremendous losses were incurred, reaching a level of USD one million a day.
The leaders of the January strike and the trade unions did suspend the protest, however, following the signing of an agreement demanding a change of Prime Minister.
The promises contained in the agreement between the trade unions, the Parliament of Guinea and its Supreme Court were not kept, and once again a member of the ruling party was appointed Prime Minister.
This does not bode well in terms of improving the situation, as demanded by the protestors.
Events in Guinea are similar to those that took place in my home country some time ago.
In Guinea, the current regime is also firing on fellow citizens fighting for change, better living conditions and respect for fundamental human rights.
We demand respect for the principles of democracy and reforms in a country whose inhabitants wish to live in dignity, supported by their own natural wealth which is currently being exploited by rich companies and siphoned off by corruption.
Thousands of Guineans are dying of hunger and poverty.
Over a hundred were killed during the demonstration.
These are the victims of a fledgling democracy and of the struggle for human rights.
They are also a stain on the consciences of those who value aluminium ore, bauxite, gold and diamonds more than human lives.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, not only has the country had a very difficult history and legacy, but it faces a very difficult current situation.
However, together we can help to bring more hope to Guinea.
The Commission is fully aware of the situation in that country.
In a press release of 22 January, the European Commission condemned the violent interventions by the security forces and called for restraint and civic responsibility during these demonstrations.
Commissioner Michel regretted the loss of human lives and encouraged the different stakeholders to pursue a constructive dialogue in order to implement the necessary political reforms important for that country.
The German Presidency, on behalf of the Union, issued a declaration on 9 February regretting the loss of life during the demonstrations and asking the Government of Guinea for an explanation of the circumstances of those deaths and of the judicial steps being taken against those responsible.
The inquiry commission appointed in Guinea is led by public prosecutors, but victims and relatives are invited to submit their cases either to the courts, which have limited means, or to the police, an institution heavily involved in the repression.
Given this situation, the Guinean Bar has refused to participate in the inquiry commission and has called for an international commission instead.
The Bar also wishes to present a case to the International Criminal Court.
The Commission's delegation in Conakry and Member States' embassies have repeatedly stressed to the Government of Guinea the need to carry out a full inquiry into the events.
This was also stressed by Commissioner Michel to Foreign Minister CondÃ©.
The delegation and other diplomats have also stressed to the new Prime Minister that the behaviour of security forces observed during the previous strike should simply stop.
The ninth European Development Fund cooperation strategy with Guinea, signed on 21 December 2006, includes governance as a focal factor, as a priority.
Actions foreseen are aimed at promoting effectiveness and transparency in public management, reinforcing the rule of law and promoting a democratic society.
A reinforced political dialogue with the country is ongoing as a follow-up to the Article 96 (Cotonou Agreement) consultations, which ended in April 2005.
The Commission has stressed to the Guinean authorities that the new situation would be taken into account in this context.
I should like to thank you for the resolution, and express the firm belief that the European Union should support the country in seeking a better future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)
1.
Dialogue between the Chinese government and Envoys of the Dalai Lama (vote)
2.
Humanitarian situation of refugees from Iraq (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment No 5:
Mr President, we propose in paragraph 5, line 4, to delete the words 'the European Parliament' on the grounds that it is a little linguistically untidy and perhaps a little illogical for Parliament to call on 'the Parliament' to take part in this international conference.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
-Before the vote on Amendment No 7:
Mr President, on this amendment to paragraph 7, we would in no way limit our praise of the Swedish Government, but the figure listed in paragraph 7 - 8951 - is just factually incorrect.
We would propose that the words 'which granted asylum to 8951 Iraqis in 2006,' be deleted.
That will help the flow of the paragraph, while still praising the Swedish Government's efforts.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
3.
Guinea (vote)
- Before the vote on section D of the Preamble:
(FR) Mr President, we have indeed agreed to withdraw our Amendment 1 in order to maintain a consensus and a unanimity among the groups that, I am delighted to say, will, I believe, strengthen the resolution.
With the agreement of the various groups, we have instead submitted an oral amendment to be added at the end of recital D and which I will read to you in English, since that is the language to be used as reference and in which the oral amendment was negotiated.
It will specify that intervention is taking place by mercenaries from Liberia and Sierra Leone, currently used by the authorities, but that officially there is not yet absolute proof of such intervention, even if all observers on the ground have begun to note it.
In order to refer to the situation while remaining rigorous, we will state the following:
'whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters'.
(FR) However, I believe that our fellow Member, Mr Matsakis, wished to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment in order to make it still more precise, and I should like to say straight away that I support the wording that he will now propose to us, so that we may all vote unanimously in favour of the same text.
Mr President, in order to clarify it even further and make it more factually correct and comprehensive, I wish to make an oral amendment to the oral amendment by Mr DÃ©sir.
After the words 'whereas there are allegations of the presence of mercenaries and former guerrilla fighters', I wish to add 'working as paramilitary government forces'.
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
That concludes the vote.
Voting time
We shall now proceed to the vote.

(DE) Mr President, I have a couple of questions to put to you and to the Secretary-General of this House.
I learned as early as last Thursday that a ceremony commemorating the victims of terrorism was to be held here this afternoon before this plenary sitting began.
I take it as read that it was of an appropriately dignified character, and do not indeed doubt that it was, for I see the occasion, and the need for such a ceremony, as important.
What I am not willing to accept, however, is the way in which this was prepared and staged, and I would also like to tell the Secretary-General, Mr RÃžmer, that I intend to energetically follow up what he said in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday, so I will tell the plenary that I, the chairman of my group, had no advance notice of this event whatever.
I do not know whether the members or chairmen of other groups were informed of it, but I, in any case, was not.
When I, last Thursday, asked the Secretary-General and you how this had been prepared, I was told - for you left the answer to the Secretary-General - that it had been done in close cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and, that appearing to be to be an acceptable explanation, I declared myself content with it.
Since then, I have learned that neither the deputy chairman of that committee, Mr Lambrinidis - who is a member of my group - nor my group's coordinator, Mrs Roure, had had any word whatever of this event.
I think this House has earned the right to be allowed to take part in an event of this kind, and I would have been happy to be present in my capacity as a group chairman.
I do not think it helpful that Parliamentary business or initiatives of this kind should be staged in this building without Members of this House being present, and so I ask that, the next time events of this kind - which are, as I have said, useful - are prepared and held, a better job should be made of it.
I personally, as President of this House, took it as read that the procedure would be the same as it was last year; we will check to see if something different was done then.
I myself presided from 3 p.m. onwards and wanted to do so until half past three, but the sitting then dragged on longer as the young people - whom it was very nice to see there, may I say - and the group chairmen were not so punctilious in keeping to their speaking time, and the President was not in a position to tell the young people to stop speaking after four minutes, so that I myself was unable to keep a very important appointment at half past three.
The whole thing lasted until just before 4 p.m.
The sitting had been chaired before 3 p.m. by Mr Cavada, the chairman of this House's home affairs committee; the rapporteur was Mr Sifunakis, who is a member of your group, and Commissioner Å pidla was also present.
What I would recommend is that we should check to compare what was done last time and what was done this year.
As for next year, I would ask - and I am grateful to you for saying how very useful you, too, find this - that we should try for a bit more transparency next time around, but there is one thing that will not be possible, for the Chamber was packed out with 580 young people in it, and if we invite all the Members of this House, there will not be enough space.
We should, though, give some thought to how this House can be properly represented through the political groups.
Can we agree on that?
Statement by the President
Perhaps I might make a comment to the topic we have just discussed.
Yesterday - Sunday, March the eleventh - was the third anniversary of the terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004, when 192 people were killed.
The day of this appalling event has become a European day of commemoration for the victims of terrorism.
It is a day for keeping memory alive - the memory of the victims of terrorism - and for solidarity with them and their families, with those who lost their lives and also with those who still suffer the effects of it, whether physical or psychological.
It is a day for fostering awareness, for, following the attack on Madrid, the bombings in London on 7 July 2005 resulted in more victims within the European Union, and, elsewhere around the world, too, it is still too often the case that too many people are being killed by violence motivated by fanaticism.
Terrorism is an attack on freedom and democracy.
Terrorism is an attempt at making things happened through blind violence and, in the process, destroying values, the values that are the foundation of the European Union and its Member States.
Terrorism is a crime that cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.
It represents one of the greatest dangers to the security, stability and democratic values of the international community and is also a direct assault on our citizens.
The European Union and the international community of states must be determined in fighting terrorism in whatever shape or form.
There can be no justification for terrorism, and, in fighting it, we can allow ourselves no weakness; that is why we need a strong and united Europe.
If we are to fight it effectively, we need to go beyond mere close cooperation and develop a coherent common policy that meets the needs of the public while also reflecting our understanding of human rights and human dignity.
Let me, then, say once more that this House does not see Guantanamo as compatible with our European legal order, and that we must ensure, in joining together to fight terrorism in Europe, that we do so in a manner consistent with the values that we are defending.
On the occasion of this day commemorating the victims of terrorism, we must again declare ourselves willing to fight terrorism in whatever form and also to take the action needed in order to do so.
We must not forget the victims of terrorism; the punishment of their murderers is a debt we owe to them, but a determined policy must also have the object of preventing, in so far as possible, terrorism and terrorist acts on European Union soil and anywhere else in the world, in line with the principles of the international community and our system of law.
On 5 March this year, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, an Italian journalist and Afghanistan correspondent for the newspaper 'La Repubblica', was abducted by the Taliban.
He was simply doing his job, which was to report on the situation in that country.
I would like to take this opportunity of expressing this House's solidarity and my own with Mr Mastrogiacomo's family and with the newspaper 'La Repubblica'.
I would also like, speaking on behalf of this House, to express the same solidarity with the German citizen and her son, both of whom were abducted in Iraq in February.
We urge and demand of the persons who are holding Mr Mastrogiacomo and the organisation Kataib Siham al-Haq, which abducted the two German citizens and long-term residents of Iraq, that they should let these people go free - free and unharmed - without delay.
We must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed by violence.
I now ask that we remember the victims of terrorism.

Order of business
The final draft of the agenda for this sitting, as agreed by the Conference of Presidents meeting on Thursday, 8 March 2007, in accordance with Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been circulated.
It has been requested that the draft be amended as follows:
Monday:
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has moved that there be no motions to close the debate on the oral question to the Commission on Community measures to provide cross-border health services.
Who wishes to justify this motion?
(FR) Mr President, my group believes that this proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to submit an oral question with debate and resolution on the provision of cross-border health care is inappropriate for the simple reason that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, backed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, is currently debating a draft report that relates to the same subject, namely health services in the European Union.
The vote on this resolution is in danger of being redundant and, above all, is in danger of cutting short the debates taking place in the two other committees.
My group could therefore just about endorse the presentation of this oral question with debate, but it requests that the resolution be left in abeyance and dealt with at the same time as the report by the committee concerned.
According to the information I have, this report is scheduled for the May plenary session.
Let us therefore avoid any duplication of effort and let us try to do some serious parliamentary work.
In other words, let us wait for the background report by the committee concerned to become available.
(DE) Mr President, I can, in fact, do no more than repeat what my colleague Mr Goebbels has already said.
We, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, are currently drafting a comprehensive report, which will also include opinions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the Committee on Legal Affairs.
It would, of course, be good if our committee's ongoing work were not to be prejudiced by the adoption of a resolution that had to be cobbled together within the space of three days, whereas we have been spending many weeks preparing a good document that, it is to be hoped, will enjoy broad support.
I think the sensible thing to do would be to have a debate on this - that is something we can certainly accept - while not adopting a resolution on it.
Mr President, I understand the courteous and moderate way in which the request has been put by the colleagues opposite, but I have to say that I think it is based on a misunderstanding.
I am grateful for their support.
However, we are not talking about two debates on the same issue, but about a report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which is not yet completed, concerning the exclusion of health services from the Services Directive.
An opinion from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is winging its way to that committee and, in due course, we shall have a full debate on that.
This resolution is not about services but about patients.
(Applause)
It is about the consequences for patients of the judgments of the European Court of Justice.
When colleagues say that this debate might be untimely, they are right because it is very late.
This resolution was not cobbled together in three days but was put together by the Committee on the Environment last December, when it was carried unanimously by that committee.
The Health Commissioner, Mr Kyprianou, told us on numerous occasions that he was waiting for the resolution and asked why he could not have it because he knew that it had been carried.
Therefore, it is long overdue.
It is quite separate from the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we will give that due respect when it comes.
However, for now, I ask Parliament to agree that the oral question should be accompanied by the resolution, which did not come before us in January or February, but surely can now do so in March.
(Applause)
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
Tuesday:
Motion by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Virrankoski's report on biotechnology: Prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe to be sent back to the committee.
. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on the report held in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 24 January was split down the middle: of the 43 members present, 22 voted in favour, 15 voted against and 6 abstained.
Due mainly to the fact that it focuses on GMOs, when biotechnology is far broader in scope, this report, which is entitled 'Biotechnology: prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe', has provoked numerous reactions, and not only within our group.
For that reason, and due to the ensuing risk of this report - which is fairly crucial for a subject as important as biotechnology - failing, it would be helpful if the report were referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development so that it can re-examine it and perhaps arrive at a more balanced proposal that receives more votes.
I would add that I met Mr Virrankoski to discuss this issue - I am grateful to him for the constructive meeting that we had last week - and that it seems, moreover, that my fellow coordinator, Mr Busk, shares this opinion, if the e-mail that he sent me is anything to go by.
(FI) Mr President, biotechnology offers massive opportunities for European agriculture, although it presents challenges for it as well.
For this reason, a report such as this cannot be treated as a yes or no issue: instead, it needs to be examined thoroughly and without bias.
Accordingly, I am in favour of it being referred back to the committee so that we might get the greatest possible support for it in plenary.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(MT) I ask that this debate on hunting in Malta be concluded without a resolution because I feel that such a resolution is unnecessary and unjustified, and for three reasons.
Firstly, spring hunting is, in itself, illegal, its being through the use of a derogation that European law allows the practice of hunting at this time of year.
Secondly, the use of a derogation to allow spring hunting was the specific subject of negotiations between Malta and the European Union in the period prior to accession, and there is therefore no reason why this chapter should be re-opened.
Thirdly, if spring hunting is to be abolished, then this should be done on a scientific basis and not in response to political pressure.
(MT) I agree with my colleague, Mr Busuttil.
I believe that we are talking in this case about an agreement between the European Union and Malta, approved by both Parliament and the majority of the Maltese and Gozitan population of my country.
I believe that it is at this stage unnecessary to come up with a resolution that goes against what was decided on between the Maltese people and the European Union, because I feel that we would in that way be sending out the wrong message to every European citizen, namely that the very European Union that originally endorses an agreement tries to put a stop to it after a while.
I therefore believe that this is not the time for a resolution on the matter.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we asked for and accepted this debate and why a resolution is needed is precisely because Malta has failed to abide by the agreements.
It is obvious that that is what the problem is.
Otherwise a resolution would not have been put forward; we would not have received the results and the very explicit recommendations of a fact-finding mission sent to Malta; and the Commission would not have recommended, as my fellow Members are very well aware, that the Maltese Government should not authorise the spring hunt in the country this year, in view of what has happened in previous years.
The reason, therefore, why we are calling for a debate and resolution is exactly the opposite of what my fellow Members maintain: since there is a violation of Community law and since we must apparently legislate less, we had better concern ourselves with applying this law.
I hope this House will act in accordance with the decision made earlier and draw up a resolution on this topic.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
Wednesday:
Motion by the Presidency of the Council for the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Berlin Declaration to be taken following the debate on the report on the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the meeting of the European Council (8/9 March 2007).
(DE) Mr President, starting the agenda in this way with a brief debate on the Berlin statement is a good choice.
If the declaration is worth anything, let it be debated briefly and early in the morning, rather than at the end of a long and perhaps rather problematic debate on the Council, with different groups pulling in different directions.
I think it is certainly appropriate that we should first have an hour's worth of debate on the Berlin statement, followed by an exhaustive one on the Council.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
Thursday
Debates on violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure): Motion by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to delete the word 'Nigeria' and replace it by the wording 'arrests of activists contending for the rights of women in Iran'.
(DE) Mr President, we have seen that World Women's Day was marked in Iran by demonstrations by women, which were then violently suppressed.
Over recent weeks, pressure on women's organisations in Iran generally has increased, and it is for that reason that we think it more relevant and more a matter of urgency that this be debated rather than the subject in relation to Nigeria.
(DE) Mr President, although I am sure that Mr Gahler is right to say that this is an important problem and one that we should not disregard, I do nevertheless believe that we should not drop the subject of Nigeria in favour of something else.
What I would propose is that we leave Nigeria on the agenda and take the subject of women in Iran during the next part-session in Brussels, for example in the format of a brief oral question to the Commission or the Council as to what they envisage doing in order to support women in that country.
We would be happy to agree to that, but this time we should leave the agenda as it is.
In that sense, I am against the motion, but would offer the opportunity for an in-depth discussion of the issue at another time - that time being in the course of the next part-session.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
(The agenda was therefore adopted.)
Corporate social responsibility (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Howitt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on corporate social responsibility: a new partnership.
Mr President, honourable Members, it is indeed true to say that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is marching ahead in Europe, and last year's communication from the Commission triggered a great wave of activities and new ideas.
It is because CSR can make a great contribution to sustainable development and enhance Europe's potential for innovation and its competitiveness that it is closely tied in with our strategy for growth and employment, the object of which is not only to create more jobs but also, and primarily, to create better ones.
We are talking here not about short-term successes or apparently favourable quarterly results, but rather about the need for our companies to adjust in the long term to the changed conditions under which we have to compete in the world as a whole.
Favourable social conditions may well be an important factor in competition, but producing them is not a responsibility for policy-makers alone; businesses have a responsibility of their own, and it goes beyond mere obedience to the law.
They are responsible for the social climate, for the environment, for equality of opportunity, for training, for innovation and for structural change; to sum up, they are responsible for the people who work for them, and for the location where they are based.
The Commission welcomes Mr Howitt's report, which is evidence of deep knowledge and competence and not only essentially endorses the Commission's aim of strengthening CSR in Europe, but also makes an important contribution towards achieving it.
I certainly agree that the debate should aim to achieve concrete results; that the multi-stakeholder approach should embrace all the interested parties and groups affected; and that the whole process should be even better integrated into the Lisbon Strategy.
You will be aware that the Commission believes that the openings for regulation in this area are limited.
We do not believe that an enterprise's culture can be imposed from above or standardised by legislation, and that is why the Commission has been unwilling to take a decision in favour of proposing a regulation on CSR or the standardisation of it at European level.
If something, somewhere, has to be regulated; if we, by reason of our political responsibility have to insist on businesses doing something, then we have to summon up the courage to enact the relevant legislation, which must be specific and practically relevant to the area in question, but corporate social responsibility is, by definition, something that goes beyond companies' obligations under the law and is more than that which we lay down in regulations.
We want to support businesses and to encourage them to make use of the internationally recognised instruments, which are available in great numbers.
The Commission is also supporting CSR in the global context, for example, through the EU-Africa Business Forum, brought into existence by my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel, in which representatives of businesses from both continents met in November 2006 to discuss social responsibility.
The Commission is continuing to discuss with developing countries the progress being made in implementing the basic standards of the International Labour Organisation, and, in Europe, we are promoting the further development of relevant instruments within the various sectors, alongside multi-sectoral initiatives.
My fellow-Commissioner Mr Å pidla and I are meeting more and more business people who are getting committed to and involved in making Europe a front-runner where CSR is concerned, and who see it as putting their businesses at a definite advantage on the market.
In the short time in which it has been in existence, the European CSR Alliance has set in motion some impressive and exemplary initiatives, and far-sighted managers and investors have long known that a company with a good record of CSR is usually a successful one, as, indeed, is evident from the prices at which such businesses' shares are quoted on stock exchanges.
The Commission calls on Europe's businesses to make CSR a European brand and to compete for the best ideas.
We are convinced that a European company must be one that acknowledges its own social responsibility and acts accordingly.
That is something on which the Commission and your House are in complete agreement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Verheugen has characterised the general framework of corporate social responsibility.
I feel I must emphasise that this is about voluntary commitments on the part of businesses, commitments that clearly go beyond what the law requires.
This must not of course restrict the right of any lawmaker or relevant authority to draw up any law it deems essential.
Given that the general framework has been described sufficiently clearly, I should like to present a number of specific areas in which we support corporate initiatives and which form part of the March 2006 strategy.
First of all, businesses play a major role in professional cohesion and also support social cohesion insofar as they hire workers and are involved in human resources management.
Secondly, 2007 has been declared the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
We have neither the right nor the means to deprive ourselves of our diverse talents, and therefore we support corporate initiatives aimed at equal opportunities.
Thirdly, an important part of the intergenerational pact, which ageing Europe desperately needs, is cohesion and the retention of older people in employment.
The other priorities in the March communication, such as health, investment in lifelong learning, innovation in training, science and operating on a global scale are equally important.
The text you will be debating addresses these very issues.
If we want to ensure that corporate social responsibility continues into the 21st century there needs to be dialogue with the whole community, and for this reason in December we held a multi-stakeholder forum on corporate social responsibility.
At the same time, it was decided to convene a European level discussion body from one of the plenary sittings, which will bring together representatives from civil society, the world of business and academic institutions.
These forums have made it possible for us to assess the results of initiatives launched since 2004.
As regards Commission initiatives I believe that corporate social responsibility is becoming increasingly influential across all of our policies, and in particular in external EU policy.
Issues of common interest for the future have also been staked out, such as education, research and working conditions across chains of subcontractors.
This will clearly have a major impact in fostering more secure social conditions in regions outside Europe for subcontractors who work for European firms.
There is much work to be done but we are on the right track.
It can be seen from our debates and discussions with interested parties that corporate social responsibility is an increasingly important issue.
It is important to maintain existing conditions and to be unstinting in our efforts.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (EL) Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, in its opinion on corporate social responsibility, calls on the rapporteur for a holistic understanding of this issue, because it believes that the role of companies is fundamental as regards respect for the values underpinning the European Union, irrespective of where they trade, within or outside the European Union, and irrespective of their size, of whether they are small or medium-sized enterprises, multinationals and so on.
At global level, core standards of the International Labour Organisation are promoted through corporate social responsibility.
Within a framework of voluntary action, they can introduce measures to support female human resources, within the framework of national and Community legislation on gender equality and non-discrimination, both during the recruitment procedure and during the procedure to promote and elect women to the administration bodies, to the board of directors, when promoting the planning of actions for corporate social responsibility.
We congratulate the European Commission on reinforcing the new alliance and we do not believe that it will be a repetition of the multi-stakeholder forum.
A charter of good practice to which companies subscribe voluntarily will help to promote actions for the living and working environment and facilitate a better combination of professional and home life alongside cultural and educational services.
Finally, we are calling for good corporate social responsibility practices to be promoted and rewarded, especially in the gender equality sector, but not with a mandatory report by companies.
Commissioners, allow me to express the view that the possibilities of voluntary application of corporate social responsibility, not as a means of advertising or competition, should be planned in the multi-stakeholder forum, which is a forum for discussion between all the social partners, and we hope that there will be significant female participation in it.
Mr President, far and away most of the EU's businesses have committed themselves to social responsibility, to socially and environmentally responsible action, to the protection of people and their environment, and to security of production.
They support cultural and religious facilities, sports and clubs.
As both Commissioners have just said, though, it is and remains a prerequisite that these things should be done on a voluntary basis, something laid down in the European Parliament report back in 2003, and, a year later, on the occasion of the founding of the Multi-Stakeholder Forum.
If you want to maintain the voluntary character of this commitment, you have to reject binding regulations and suffocating bureaucracy.
A comprehensive reporting system ought, if at all, to be expected only of large companies; SMEs, which make up over 90% of all companies, cannot cope with it, for they quite simply lack the human and financial resources required to give an all-round picture of their CSR.
My group's shadow rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, has succeeded in reaching some compromises that have the effect of defusing the Howitt report, which my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was right to reject.
I count it a victory that the demand for the award of public contracts to be made dependent on compliance with social and environmental clauses has been largely struck out.
Firms must be able to win a public contract even if they do not have an ecologically-correct pot of flowers in front of the factory gate and even if the menu of their works canteen does not include alternative meals.
Paragraph 11, which calls for the setting-up of a central point of coordination for CSR, is problematic, as are paragraphs 39 and 55, which advocate the appointment of an ombudsman for CSR.
I am opposed to any extension of enterprises' liability and obligations to account for their corporate social responsibility, and regard such dirigiste manipulations as unacceptable.
Finally, we are talking today about an own-initiative report, one that many do not take seriously on the grounds that it is thought to be no more than a declamation.
What I say is: principiis obsta - resist that which is only just beginning!
If this House calls for some of all this to be made mandatory, then legislative measures from the Commission are no longer far away.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) A transnational company has, within its network in one of the new Member States, employed people living with handicaps as cleaners in a city struggling with social problems.
The company received subsidies from the local authorities for these employees with handicaps, thereby depleting almost the entire funding source available for this purpose.
In my view this mode of behaviour does not meet our expectations regarding corporate social responsibility.
The efforts to recover costs can and must in all cases be harmonised with social goals.
This is pointed out in Richard Howitt's excellent report.
I would add that a favourable economic environment has since the early 1990s attracted numerous transnational companies to Central and Eastern Europe.
Certain regions of the new EU Member States continue, however, to experience multiple disadvantages.
To use a distinctive phrase: they are in a sense the European Union's internal peripheries.
Therefore we must make it clear to transnational companies as well that their actions must follow the principle of 'think globally - act locally'.
This will help avoid that certain regions of the Union become peripheries that only 'think globally'.
This is why I consider Richard Howitt's report to be important, and this is why I hope that it does not sink under arguments over formalities, but will develop its role within the European social model of CSR.
Corporate social responsibility does not simply mean avoiding doing harm, but is an ordered system for positive actions.
The question here is not whether or not certain actions can be prescribed, but rather whether they can fulfil expectations in view of a better world.
It is my belief that they can.
We can expect that they treat employees as human beings, in their entirety, with their rights, state of health and cultural and social traditions.
Richard Howitt's report is a very important step along this path.
(ET) I am certain that corporate social responsibility promotes sustainable development and also the improved implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in such matters as the more sensible use of natural resources, improving the results of innovation activity, the reduction of poverty, and also, of course, improved compliance with human rights requirements.
Corporate social responsibility should also act as an additional measure for the management of industry and restructuring, and act so that new areas are added to it; for instance, lifelong learning, equal opportunities, social involvement, sustainable development, and also ethics.
Companies' participation in such social activities must be voluntary.
If we wish to move forward towards the creation and development of traditions in the area of corporate social responsibility, it is inevitable that we follow agreed and internationally recognised principles.
We have no other framework or agreed system with which we could adequately measure companies' activities in connection with corporate social responsibility.
Thus the creation of the institution of ombudsman would be premature and pointless at the present moment.
The imposition of a package of regulations would not have a positive effect, and would instead lead to negative counter-reactions.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his eight years of persistent activity in aiming to achieve this objective.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt on his report.
However, I am not sure that I am so happy about the deal he made with the PPE-DE Group to weaken what we will vote on tomorrow.
Yesterday I participated in a citizens' consultation, and it is quite obvious what citizens want - they want Europe to be more active on environmental issues.
I think that last Friday's Council was well received by citizens.
The second thing that citizens want is greater social responsibility, and I am afraid the Barroso-Verheugen Commission went in entirely the opposite direction when it took office.
So, Commissioner, you have already turned somewhat on environmental and energy issues under pressure from science and from citizens.
I hope that this report by Parliament, especially if it is not watered down too much tomorrow, will help you to reconsider your social agenda.
It was the Commission not being active enough in the multi-stakeholder dialogue that played a large part in frustrating NGOs to the extent that they left the table completely.
There are some good bits in the report which will be voted on tomorrow.
I just wanted to highlight one issue: the deletion of paragraph 63, in which we call for global leadership from the European Union on this issue.
Why is this important?
With more Chinese oil and mining companies investing in Africa and other areas, if Europe does not elevate corporate social responsibility from a purely European issue to a global, UN issue, our companies will lose out, so I do not understand how the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups can delete a paragraph from the original report as voted on that calls for us to be much more proactive on a global level.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate and thank Mr Howitt for his initiative and his report, and to endorse the series of amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
As has been demonstrated, the main problem or the main question in our debate is over whether regulation is in fact needed in this area or whether a voluntary approach will suffice.
I for one am not in favour of excessive bureaucracy and superfluous regulation.
In questions such as corporate social responsibility, however, it is clear that relying on the goodwill of businesses is simply not enough.
Otherwise, a part of the population of Europe will find itself facing an unequal situation.
I feel, though, that what is needed is a workable legal instrument that would force companies to fulfil their responsibilities not only in the social field but also in the area of protecting working conditions, health at work and the environment.
Although I warmly endorse this report, I have tabled two amendments in conjunction with members of our group, the purpose of which is firstly to sound a warning about the current situation and the problems faced by workers regarding, for example, company relocations, low salaries, precarious work and insufficient health protection at work, and secondly to express our objection to the policies proposed by the Commission in the area of social responsibility, which often do not match the goals and the principles on which corporate social responsibility should be based.
I hope we will succeed in producing not only a statement of intent, but also the practical instruments needed to take practical action.
If not, we will end up with mere window-dressing, and I believe that the citizens expect more from us than that.
(PT) Mr President, the main function of business is wealth creation, but companies are, in certain circumstances, capable of being more than merely wealth-generating machines.
Companies can also be seen as communities in which people live and interact; people can view their company as their place of professional fulfilment, and even, in many cases, personal happiness.
Successful companies, those capable of creating wealth, are those that normally enjoy good relations with their partners, customers, suppliers and with the community in which they operate.
Successful companies are those that adopt transparency criteria in their relations with the authorities and operate on the basis of codes of conduct and ethics, which are sometimes extremely stringent.
If one were to describe companies that exist for a long time in human terms, there are companies that function with a strong personality, with a particular culture that they have managed to create and develop and that identifies them and distinguishes them from the others.
These are companies, one might say, with emotions and feelings.
Companies such as these opt to give more to the community over and above their traditional functions and thereby take on a greater responsibility; this is what might be termed 'social responsibility'.
I feel, however, that corporate social responsibility is not something that can be decreed or imposed, but something that must be entered into willingly.
Corporate social responsibility can never be imposed from above.
If it were, there would be a risk of reducing its role to a public relations exercise aimed at creating a smokescreen and at enabling companies to sidestep their responsibilities of addressing social and environmental issues.
In which case corporate social responsibility would be a fraud because it would be insincere.
I endorse the report before us because, in its final version, my view on the issue was ultimately taken into account.
(ES) Mr President, I am obliged to begin by thanking Mr Howitt for his wonderful work and for his extraordinary willingness to receive the contributions that other members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have presented to him.
He is also showing great capacity and flexibility on such a complex issue, opening himself up to dialogue and agreement with other groups in Parliament.
As others have said, I believe that corporate social responsibility is good per se.
This must not lead us to think, however, that it is not possible to improve our current framework and the relatively short experience we have acquired in the European Union.
I believe that the world's problems are increasing at a considerable speed, both environmental problems and the problems faced by people who are deprived of all kinds of rights.
I therefore believe that we must make an additional effort.
That is all Mr Howitt is asking us for in his report.
I hope that the Commission, whose Communication has had a mixed reception, not very positive in some cases, will see this as an opportunity to take more account of social responsibility.
Much can still be done, avoiding false debates on what should be voluntary and what should not.
We must continue moving forward with a view to creating criteria to make responsibility objective.
Companies will be free to adopt codes of conduct, but they cannot be free when it comes to respecting the codes of conduct that they have adopted.
There must be transparency, there must be more than philanthropy in this notion of corporate social responsibility.
We Europeans offer the world a model based on the sustainability of our economic model for us and for others.
We can go further on the control and verification of these obligations that have been taken on freely.
We have directives in the European Union.
Directives that have not been transposed in the Member States on union law, on environmental responsibilities.
The Commission can make commitments and not take the laissez faire, laissez passer approach to everything.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes now, each of us, in turn, has been repeating the fact that we do not want the forthcoming provisions to result in so many additional constraints and regulations.
We want a commitment on the part of business leaders, we want them to be proactive, we want this proactive approach to be applied internationally, we want SMEs to commit themselves and, as the rapporteur said, above and beyond declarations, we want something concrete.
As a company director myself for over thirty years, well, I want things to be able to materialise.
With this in mind, I have a proposal for you, Commissioners.
A system is already applied internationally by hundreds of thousands of businesses.
This system coordinates the social responsibility of businesses via the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 standards, which ensure that business relationships with customers are better, that practices are totally environmentally-friendly and that hygiene, health and safety rules are complied with in full.
Therefore, allow to me to suggest, Commissioners, the use of these three management standards with the aim of having businesses throughout our Europe genuinely assume their social responsibilities.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this excellent report.
One of the key points to come out of the report is that we are not just looking at corporate social responsibility within the European Union, but beyond the Union as well, and at the behaviour of European companies elsewhere in the world - a move away from the double standards of how you operate here with one legislative framework and what you think you can get away with somewhere else.
What we have heard from the Commission on the Africa Forum is a good initiative, but we need to look much more closely at how companies behave in conflict zones.
We have the leadership on the diamond process at the moment and we need to move forward on that.
I also note from the report that voluntary reporting is now stabilising and that not all voluntary reports cover supply chain compliance, which is one of the most important mechanisms we have to drive up standards, to ensure brand protection for companies behaving well and to ensure that they avoid the actions of companies which behave irresponsibly.
I look forward to Parliament's report on socially irresponsible corporate behaviour so that we can look at the contrast in how we work.
(PL) Mr President, I am aware that the concept of corporate social responsibility is becoming an increasingly important part of the debate on globalisation, competitiveness and sustainable development.
According to the definition of this concept, companies voluntarily take account of the social and economic impact of the activities they undertake.
In the framework of implementation of social responsibility on a voluntary basis, companies decide to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and commitments resulting from collective agreements, in order to respond to social and environmental needs.
I should like to make it very clear, from the floor of this House, that it is precisely the voluntary basis of the action taken and of companies' response to the notion of social responsibility that is vital.
As corporate social responsibility is based mainly on decisions taken by companies on a voluntary basis, I believe that the imposition of any kind of additional duties and administrative requirements would most probably prove counterproductive.
It would also be at variance with the principles of better legal regulation and with efforts to simplify and improve the functioning of the European Union.
It was with this in mind that I tabled 10 amendments to the text presented by Mr Howitt, and I am pleased that the spirit of these amendments has been incorporated into the compromise text proposed by the rapporteur.
I should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to underline the importance of introducing methods for the exchange of good practice concerning implementation of the notion of corporate social responsibility.
In practice this can be achieved in the framework of the European Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility.
From the floor of the House I would like to commend the European Commission on its commitment.
The Commission recognises that the companies themselves are the main players on this stage, and has announced its support for this body, which represents a sound and open way of exchanging good practice between all types of companies be they large, small or medium-sized.
(EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, on his systematic work and his constructive proposals.
The concept of corporate social responsibility seems to be more topical than ever.
On the one hand, the dramatic change in the climate, due in large part to the uncontrolled use and consumption of natural resources and, on the other hand, the worrying spread of poverty, in conjunction with the reversal of the demographic pyramid, appear to be the result of attempts to downgrade employment and overturn the social acquis.
Nonetheless, if we want to flesh out the bones of this concept, at least three preconditions need to be met: firstly, the Commission needs to take serious account of the proposals tabled by Parliament.
Secondly, it should be acknowledged that companies need to accept their responsibilities towards the environment, society and the workers which derive from their economic activity, without of course this being seen as a sacrifice on their part.
Thirdly, priority should be given to supporting investments designed to promote workers' knowledge and the development of new technologies, especially those which are more environmentally friendly.
Both these sectors should be seen as basic pillars of corporate social responsibility.
Finally, this is an excellent opportunity to prove that the competitiveness must not be at the workers' expense, but must go hand in glove with respect for environmental equilibria, the promotion of dignified working conditions and social progress in general.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, what seems clear first of all is that more and more companies see social and environmental responsibility as an opportunity, as an instrument for sustainable development, for growth and for creating jobs, and also as a good instrument for helping companies and workers to adapt better to the changes demanded by the globalised economy of the 21st century.
I would like to comment on two issues in particular.
Firstly, that it is clear that companies are the main players and that we must also take account of other parties such as consumers and non-governmental organisations.
Above all, however, I believe that we must take account of the central role of unions, and codes of conduct cannot replace the crucial role of unions and collective negotiation under any circumstances.
Secondly, it is clear that corporate social responsibility must be a factor that increases competitiveness, but behind the labels relating to corporate social responsibility there must be realities and not just mere propaganda.
Otherwise, we will undermine them and consumers will not trust those labels and we will stop moving towards corporate social responsibility and its capacity to create more competitive companies.
Many companies are currently making decisive efforts towards corporate social responsibility and they naturally know that it offers added value, and I am sure that those who do it in a clear and fair way will not object to it being verified by means of objective data.
(HU) Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to welcome the report by my fellow Member Mr Howitt.
The debate concerning corporate social responsibility is a very sensitive subject on which people are divided, since we would like to ensure a strong European social environment, while at the same time wishing to enhance the competitiveness of European companies.
The current practice of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is an excellent example of the fact that strengthening the social and environmental dimension does not necessarily mean a decline in companies' competitiveness.
We need to strengthen the European social model, but we must avoid introducing a mandatory model based on a single pattern.
A better regulated voluntary model offers greater opportunities both to producers and to consumers, rather than new administrative burdens that are difficult to bear.
If we reinforce voluntary CSR by defining minimum standards with which we can avoid excessive increase in expenditure on the part of smaller companies, then this will be able to increase their competitiveness, provided consumers are sufficiently informed about CSR-type production and business practices.
We need to increase consumer awareness and information, as this creates a market for responsible production.
Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is grateful for the constructive and frank spirit of this debate.
I would like to stress once more that Mr Howitt's report contains numerous valuable suggestions that the Commission will be happy to take into account in the further development of its policies on CSR.
This will bring us, together, a good way further ahead.
Businesses need a clear legal framework; they have to know what they have to do and what they must not do.
If they do not, they cannot function on the market.
Businesses have a social responsibility; that is why there are thousands of rules, at the European level and in the Member States, compelling companies to discharge their responsibility to society.
All the legislation we have enacted - be it on the protection of consumers, health and safety at work, protection of the environment or social security benefits - is intended to compel social responsibility on the part of business and set standards that we believe absolutely have to be met.
The intellectual problem we have with the debate we are having is that I, for one, find it difficult to imagine how we are supposed to fashion a legal framework for something that is not prescribed by law.
The idea of creating a regulatory framework for CSR means that one would be enacting a law regulating how companies have to handle things that the law does not require them to handle.
That is inherently contradictory, and the Commission really did want to put this debate behind it, and, for once, to see real progress being made; that is why, last year, we encouraged European businesses to get this Alliance for CSR up and running.
As I told you, and as you can also read in the Commission's report that you have before you, this has already come up with some pretty remarkable ideas and initiatives.
There are two very important things - to which Mr Turmes referred - that I would like to discuss.
The first is the Multi-Stakeholder Forum, in the holding of which the Commission was heavily involved, and which made some important proposals that the Commission is taking on board.
There was very broad support for the Commission's stance.
Some non-governmental organisations did not come on the grounds that their line differed from that taken by the Commission, and I find that a peculiar way of behaving in a democratic society - taking part in a discussion only if you are sure that everyone else is going to agree with you.
I therefore expressed regret at the non-attendance of these non-governmental organisations, which were few in number, but we want to continue to engage in dialogue with them, and I have specifically asked them to rejoin us in this work in future.
As for the global dimension, which Mr Turmes also had something to say about, the Commission is wholeheartedly supportive.
Before the end of this year, we will be staging a major conference on the subject of the international dimension of CSR, a topic that we have already broached in our dialogue with the other regions of the world, most notably with the developing economies such as China, India, Latin America and Africa, but which we are also discussing with the USA, the Japanese and other European partners, and it is a subject that we want to move forward at the global level.
Reference has been made in this debate to the existence of an ISO standard for corporate social responsibility.
Such a thing does, indeed, exist, but it is a voluntary standard; for companies can decide for themselves whether or not they want to use it, and the good thing is that more and more European companies do, and also make use of it for marketing purposes, telling their customers - society at large - that 'we, X Ltd, act in accordance with this standard' and they also want to be judged on that basis, for they see it as useful in terms of their market success.
I would like - and I am also speaking on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Å pidla when I say this - to offer your House our continued close and constructive cooperation on this matter, and will reiterate that we have, in Mr Howitt's report and in the debate, found many important suggestions, which the Commission will take into consideration as it continues to work on this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) Business, or entrepreneurship, is the deciding factor for the development of people and society.
Business has to consider products, organisation, marketing, design and production processes.
The key factor in business, however, is its human capital, which must always be promoted and protected, and human capital is the result of education: education about safety, trust, creativity, the ability to learn, and a taste for what is useful and beautiful.
To become competitive in the marketplace, companies need to be able to make the most of these aspects and also to exercise strong social responsibility in caring not only about their product but above all about their work and their workers.
If entrepreneurs exercise this responsibility of their own free will, it creates a virtuous circle among company, capital and work, helping them to compete effectively in the global marketplace.
Cross-border collective copyright management (debate)
The next item is the report by Katalin LÃ©vai, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services (2005/737/EC).
Mr President, honourable Members, I should like, if I may, to thank Mrs LÃ©vai for her report on the Commission recommendation of 18 October 2005 on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services.
I should like to point out that the catalyst for the Commission recommendation was originally authors' fears: authors, composers and music publishers warned the Commission that they are not earning royalties from the use of their works on line.
From our analysis it is clear, however, that it is too complicated for individual countries to manage the use of copyright works on line, particularly in a digital environment.
As a result of the complex relationships between the collective management organisations (CRMs) policing these rights in each individual country, it seems that royalties do not reach authors and other right-holders.
The purpose of the Commission recommendation is therefore to ensure that authors, composers and music publishers do receive their fair share of online royalties.
Similarly, I believe that it is possible to improve the system of issuing licences in such a way that it facilitates the development of new online services while also protecting and providing genuine support for the interests of copyright-holders.
To put it clearly, the recommendation does not propose a concrete model for issuing licences, but puts forward the principle that when it comes to managing their online rights, right-holders should be free to choose the most advantageous and efficient form of management or licensing.
The aim therefore is to ensure that right-holders earn royalties from the online use of their music works.
This will in turn enable us to ensure complete protection for the value of the right-holders' works.
This is in no way a race to the bottom.
This objective serves the interests of rights-holders and is reflected in the recommendation's regulations relating to administering transparency, resolving disputes, the responsibilities of copyright managers and the balanced representation of all categories of copyright-holders on the boards of CRMs.
The Commission welcomes Parliament's overwhelming support for this report.
Even though we are still monitoring the impact of the recommendation and gathering the opinions of the interested parties, a number of initiatives have already been put in place with a view to strengthening management.
In 2006, for example, the world trade association of music publishers and the umbrella organisation of European associations for the collective rights of authors adopted a joint statement establishing a set of rules for online copyright management.
Various right-holders including smaller CRMs and publishers have expressed enthusiasm for the business opportunities opened up by the recommendation of online music services.
In the issuing of online service licences, the Commission sees an opportunity for the entire EU to acknowledge the value of music and to support different cultures and their musical works throughout the EU.
The creation of new markets with specific music genres and the discovery of a genuine Internet public will unquestionably help support cultural diversity.
The report calls for the Commission to propose a directive on this issue.
The Commission would note that the online market is developing and we must be extremely careful not to restrict its potential with an overly rigid approach.
What is more, as I have said before, it is only now that we are looking into what the situation will be like after the recommendation has been adopted.
I can assure everyone here that our goal is to guarantee right-holders royalties from their works and the users of rights the necessary licences in the simplest and most straightforward way.
I believe it is vital to support and preserve Europe's cultural diversity.
The Commission will naturally keep Parliament informed.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs LÃ©vai, on her excellent cooperation and the outcome of her important work in the report on collective copyright management.
It is a fact that the composition of the committee is an important step towards the future convergence of the various practices in the 27 Member States.
I consider that close cooperation between right managers must be maintained for the benefit of all sides.
In the digital age in which we live, the effective safeguarding of copyright and related rights is exceptionally important in order to limit piracy and ensure that royalties are paid to right-holders.
In its opinion, the Committee on Culture and Education approaches the protection and collective management of copyright from the side both of musical authors or lyricists and composers and interpreters.
The present regime, as regards on-line services, is considered not to be adequately effective either for right users or for right-holders.
Television and radio stations frequently fail to pay the royalties owed for the repertoire they use in their various broadcasts.
All right-holders, be they authors or composers, publishers, disc producers or performers need to be treated equally.
However, the biggest problem of the music industry today is still piracy.
The present system of mutual collective copyright management must, in my opinion, be maintained, so that competition can be established on the basis of the services which can be produced and the commission charged by collective right managers.
Finally, as we know, music is not a commodity.
That is why we all have a duty to protect and reinforce creativity in Europe.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am now speaking in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The Commission's recommendation for the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights throws up a multitude of problems, for it secures neither the rights of the artists nor the diversity of the music on offer in Europe, and there are gaps in the assessment of its potential impact.
The chosen legal remedy is unacceptable; recommending three options at the same time does not really do anything to solve the problem that Mrs LÃ©vai has set out so clearly in her report, and which the compromise before you aims to address.
What that means in detail is a 'no' to territorial restrictions on use, a 'yes' to fair and controlled competition in the collective management of rights, 'yes' to the modernisation of the online music market, but not at the expense of cultural diversity and the protection of the artists, and 'yes' too to transparent rights management companies.
What is worthy of criticism about all this is that the Commission is trying, by means of a recommendation, to circumvent the rights of this House, and so we call upon it to present, through the codecision procedure, a proposal for a suitable legal instrument, founded, of course, on extensive consultation with all the interested parties.
Thinking forward to the forthcoming ruling on the CISAC case, I would like to appeal to the Commission not to use 'soft law' or agreements as means of voiding Parliament's rights of codecision, and I ask the Members of this House to give their assent to Mrs LÃ©vai's report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, both the main report by the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mrs LÃ©vai, and the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, by Mr Mavrommatis, as well as the various speeches we have heard so far, demonstrate that there is considerable consensus amongst the Members of this Parliament with regard to the Commission's recommendation.
Firstly, we object to the method being used.
The use of a recommendation, of the instrument known as 'soft law' at European Union level, is always very dangerous, bearing in mind that the European Union has its own legislative instruments, such as the framework directive proposed by Mrs LÃ©vai.
Secondly, there is an objection in terms of content.
The Commission's recommendation may already be producing undesirable effects on the shape of the intellectual property market subject to certain oligopolies, that is to say, the so-called 'majors', the main organisations that control radio broadcasting.
The Commission's recommendation may encourage these 'majors' to withdraw their repertoires from the current system of collective rights management societies, which makes it possible to safeguard rights.
If that happened, the result would be that the 'minors', that is to say, the small organisations protecting intellectual property, would not be able to protect intellectual rights.
When it comes to culture, to music, the market is not the most important thing.
The most important thing is musical production.
The culture of each of the peoples of Europe.
It is not a question of creating a great market, because in a great market the Gresham law would end up being applied, according to which bad money takes the place of good money.
In other words, we are on the point of reaching a situation of an entirely unified market, in which a few 'majors' or very important organisations will end up monopolising the market, imposing their conditions on authors and ultimately preventing intellectual creativity in the European Union.
We therefore support the report by Mrs LÃ©vai and the opinion of Mr Mavrommatis, and we do not believe that this is a time to approve any amendment to these reports.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am speaking here as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Legal Affairs on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Whilst we support the gist of the LÃ©vai report as it was approved, we would like to add something, because the objective of the recommendation is to break the monopolies of management societies and make them more transparent thanks to the control measures that are to be put in place.
The compromise amendments are imperfect in places, lack either clarity or consistency and even restrict the scope.
Our amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow complement the approved report and aim to make it easier to break the monopolies, make the market more transparent whilst ensuring that it becomes workable and that the authors and right-holders are proven right and can collect their compensation.
In Amendment 5, we ask the Member States to put the licences out to public tender every couple of years, just to keep the monopolistic management societies under pressure.
Their monopolies are not a problem per se, but there is no form of control at the moment.
A study by the Dutch competition authority has shown that every country uses different guiding principles.
Since they are monopolies, it is impossible to inspect them, as a result of which it cannot be verified whether the compensation requested is exorbitant or whether the government costs are exorbitant.
This should nevertheless be possible.
I hope that this will come off thanks to the amendments we tabled.
Moreover, we are seeking, by means of our amendments, to broaden the scope, since, for example, broadcasting - when we talk about transmission via the Internet, i-pods and suchlike - falls within the scope of copy broadcasting, which is now being restricted.
We should like to reintroduce this in order to come as close to the original Commission proposal as possible.
As matters stand, there has been too much in the way of listening to management societies and not enough listening to right-holders and authors.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are today debating a difficult and controversial issue.
As regards dealing with the common problem of cross-border management of copyright and related rights regulating legitimate services in the field of online music, I note the lack of Parliament's formal involvement.
I believe this is most inappropriate particularly as the issue was already raised in the resolution of 15 January 2004.
I also note a lack of consultation regarding future regulatory work in this area.
It is difficult to regulate the legal situation of a particular sector without becoming familiar with the stance of those concerned.
The Commission's recommendation seeks merely to regulate the online sale of music recordings.
Owing to its imprecise wording, however, it could also be applied to other online services such as broadcasting services.
The aforementioned lack of precision could lead to uncertainty as to the applicability of various systems of issuing reviews.
All this could result in a lack of legal certainty and detrimental effects, especially for online broadcasting services.
There is also a risk that rightholders complying with the aforementioned recommendation in respect of their interactive online rights would deprive local collective management of copyright entities of other rights such as those relating to broadcasting, thus preventing users from acquiring user rights for a broader and more diversified repertoire from the same collective management of copyright entity.
Rightholders should have the possibility of benefiting from protection of copyright and related rights wherever those rights are established for the whole period of their validity, regardless of national boundaries or of the way they are used.
A multi-territorial licence system should therefore be established. This would ensure greater legal protection for commercial users in relation to their activity and support the development of legitimate online services, at the same time increasing the flow of income for copyright holders.
The freedom to provide cross-border collective management services means that rightholders have a Community-wide free choice of collective management of copyright body, which is essential for the provision of legitimate online music services.
This right includes the possibility of entrusting rights to another collective management of rights body or transferring all or some of the online rights, regardless of the European Union country concerned.
I believe that increased but also controlled competition in the area of collective management of copyright and related rights in the music sector on the Internet may prove beneficial to all.
Pursuant to the Committee on Culture and Education's stance, it may also serve to support cultural diversity but only on condition that fair principles and transparency are guaranteed.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not just about lofty conceptions of competition or the free choice of artists, or about the inadequacies of the rights management company system; this is quite clearly about diversity, about the reduction of the market to mass production, or about the upholding of the European quality of diversity.
Yes, there are inadequacies, and they do have to be done away with, but I do not believe it is at all possible to do that in the way the Commission has tried to.
This report has occasioned a great deal of activity on the part of the lobbyists.
We got loads of letters; I am sure you got some too, perhaps from 'Writers and Composers for Choice', but, if you read that letter and look at the signatures, you cannot be sure that all the artists actually know what they are supposed to have signed.
I know people whose names appear on this list, but had not the least idea that their names were being used by an organisation in a letter of this sort.
That shows the efforts of a number of rights management companies that want to create a monopoly for themselves in a poor light.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's approach, the result of which is the recommendation on collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services, is unfortunately further evidence of the unacceptable, and indeed completely needless, circumvention of the democratic decision-making process as regards the role of the European Parliament.
I should like to highlight a number of points in the report before us, which broadly speaking I welcome and on which I congratulate the rapporteur and those who worked with her.
In particular, I wish to highlight the need for the equitable treatment of all rights-holders and the protection of the system of agreements and the free choice of licences as well as higher levels of protection for right-holders.
As regards the issue of future competition, attention should be paid to the possible misuse of monopolies when it comes to the collective management of authors' rights.
The more we speak about economic competition across the whole spectrum of intellectual property rights, the more it is vital for that competition to be regulated, controlled and fair.
I am highlighting this because provisions aimed at protecting economic competition in the area of intellectual property rights have been extensively applied, and in a number of cases competition is given precedence over the exercise of those rights.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs LÃ©vai for her constructive cooperation on the report and the EU observer for its useful conference on creative rights.
I should also like to thank Pia Raug who, instead of just giving up, convinced the majority of us.
A year ago, the arts were in danger of losing out to the market.
People in the Commission were used by multinational companies to implement what is known as a soft-law instrument, which would never have got by elected representatives.
Tomorrow, we shall have a large majority in favour of the arts in all their diversity, and the Commission will then withdraw its threats of legal action against copyright managers and shelve its communication on the music market.
Writers, composers and users are to be listened to, then.
A fresh start should be made with a proposal for a directive that we in the European Parliament too are involved in negotiating.
The vast majority of Members of the European Parliament want to ensure an all-round supply of music.
We shall never allow the supply to be determined by a handful of multinational companies.
We also want to ensure that less visible artists can find their public.
As consumers, we will not be satisfied with popular music from only the biggest countries.
Nor will we let the multinationals' friends in the Commission expropriate KODA and other copyright law companies that, every day, make great efforts to ensure the accessibility and equal treatment of music intended for both a broad and a more restricted audience.
All users can now be satisfied with one contract with one agency, which then settles up with the others.
The system is basically sound but requires more administrative transparency in places.
As music users we are happy to pay a fair price to writers and composers, but we want to pay as little as possible to bureaucrats and multinational giants.
The LÃ©vai report is a balanced one and does Parliament credit.
(PT) I shall begin by saying that I am an associate member of the Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores (Portuguese Authors' Society), the Portuguese collective rights management society (CRM) in this area.
The report by Mrs Levai and Mr Mavrommatis deserves to be adopted.
The freedom for authors and composers to be represented by the CRM of their choice is as fundamental a principle as the ban on major publishers entering into exclusive agreements with CRMs.
The mandate granted by a major publisher to a given CRM should also be able to be granted to any other CRM.
