In the UK, peat land is regarded as precious habitat to be protected.
Peat regenerates so slowly that it would be quite inappropriate to regard it as a renewable resource.
Madam President, climate change, security of supply, price increases, incidents such as blackouts in parts of Europe, and the Ukraine Gazprom wake-up call have all increased the awareness of the European citizen and policymakers to the complexity of our energy situation, which urgently requires the availability of accurate, timely and complete statistical data.
In this respect, I welcome the Commission proposal and the work done by our rapporteur, Mr Turmes.
Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate him warmly on his appointment as rapporteur on the Renewables Directive.
Energy use is responsible for 80% of the total EU emissions of greenhouse gases.
The availability of timely and reliable baseline data on the energy situation in the EU is imperative in order for us to meet our objectives not only under the Kyoto Protocol but also in a post-2012 scenario.
How can we reliably agree to transparent targets on fossil fuel energy reduction on the international stage and the increased use of renewables without such baseline data?
We cannot.
Currently the compilation of energy statistics is slow, inefficient and often incomplete, and even inaccurate.
As the rapporteur rightly points out, there is a substantial delay in the publication of Eurostat's energy data.
Can the Commissioner confirm that this regulation will result in more timely availability of vital energy statistics and that the statistical model we use here in the EU is comparable to that used by, for example, the USA and other global players, so that we can compare like with like?
Finally, I agree with the rapporteur when he says that the new regulation should provide protection from data manipulation.
Accurate, verifiable and unbiased Eurostat statistics are crucial to the whole range of current and future climate and energy policies, such as the EU emissions trading scheme, effort-sharing and renewable energy proposals.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if as the European Union we want to construct a coherent energy policy and speak with once voice on the international energy stage, it is essential that we have complete and reliable statistics that enable us to make comparisons easily.
It is also essential that there is good coordination with and between Member States.
We therefore think that it is important for the Commission's text to state that their participation is compulsory.
It is also important, as Mrs Trautmann said, for the new proposal not to burden businesses or the other parties involved with more work.
We therefore welcome the fact that the proposal does not seek to modify the statistical tasks that are carried out, but rather establishes a common legal framework that guarantees methodological uniformity and thus facilitates data comparison.
In addition, understanding the complexity of our energy situation and conducting detailed quantitative monitoring of the progress made towards our goals also requires accurate, timely and complete statistics.
We therefore agree with the rapporteur that, in areas such as energy efficiency it is necessary to improve the statistics that we have.
Efficiency is now a priority for our energy and climate change policy.
The current statistics do not provide the necessary data for calculating coefficients that are not, in this field, absolutely necessary.
The development of the nuclear sector and renewable energy also raises considerable difficulties that need to be resolved.
These are only some examples of the limitations of our current system which, along with interesting proposals for solving them, are very well covered in the report by Mr Turmes, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work.
(PL) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a fine report.
I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner on the initiative raised by the Commission.
I support this report, mainly because it talks about a common energy policy, and in particular about a common foreign energy policy.
There is a further reason, however, and for me this one is actually more important: we are leaving Member States a choice where primary energies are concerned (the energy mix), while at the same time we are limiting CO2 emissions and creating a common energy market.
If we want to compare costs, and to find out in the future which zero-emission solutions are best and which solutions are the most economic, we must have a basis for comparison.
A common market and competition in it, and above all effective investment, require good, comparable statistical data.
Such data are needed by investors, particularly private investors, if we are to operate an efficient policy in the energy market.
We shall also be able to compare data from individual Member States concerning specific prices and costs, which is something we are unable to do with the statistical data we have at present, particularly because of a lack of data on renewable energy sources.
There is one final question: who will be able to benefit from these data and how?
All is not clear on this point, and it will be practice that decides.
It is very important for us to give attention to the extent to which such data will be accessible in future, and how we are going to protect that part of the data that should not be published.
(RO) I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
Energy and climate change are priorities of the European Union.
That is why energy statistics enabling the Union to assess this sector and to take the necessary actions are extremely important.
On 26 February 2008, Eurostat published a set of statistical indicators for energy, transport and the environment.
In the case of energy we find indicators for energy reliance, energy intensity, energy sources, final energy consumption, renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy prices.
As regards climate change, we find information about greenhouse gas emissions.
The Member States will have the obligation to provide the necessary data to obtain the indicators requested by the proposed Regulation.
Important funds will be needed for data collection and processing.
Amendment 14 also refers to time savings due to the use of information technology in data collection and processing.
Amendment 5 outlines the necessity of security in the supply of the most important fuels and the availability of exact data at European level, supplied in due time, in order to anticipate and coordinate the solutions at European Union level in case of possible supply shortages.
This is in line with the solidarity clause for cases of energy shortages under the Treaty of Lisbon.
European citizens need such correct and exact statistics.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important for us all because the details naturally form the basis for political decisions.
It is therefore also important to differentiate in future between financial and product transactions.
We all know how energy prices are influenced by the different sectors.
However, the difference between production, trade and consumption also plays a major role.
We should begin here specifically with intelligent metering, not only with the consumer, but also with the various measuring points available.
The choice of method used to get a grip on the various costs for the statistics is also important to us.
We very much want to eliminate bureaucracy as well as to achieve greater efficiency in the statistics.
The choice of method here will therefore be important in terms of future use - random sampling, fully automated analysis, just-in-time, non-decrypting, comparable across the EU, but also globally.
The proportionality is also important for the different agencies.
We need to ensure that security of supply is transparently available as a universal criterion, that there is differentiation between costs and prices and that the entire system is sustainable.
rapporteur. - Madam President, I have just a few remarks to make.
With regard to peat - and unfortunately Ms Korhola has already left - it is very clear from our definition that peat is classified under fossil energy.
We have taken up the IPCC definition of peat, which makes it very clear that peat is not a renewable.
So in that respect some Finnish politicians and Finnish lobbyists should stop dreaming, read the Directive and stick to the actual text.
The idea of having weekly petrol stock measurements in Europe is one issue which I was sorry not to be able to carry through.
Our oil price in Europe is defined by the US Department of Energy's weekly bulletin.
Because Europe has no independent statistics on oil, our prices are de facto defined by the scarcity in the US market and we are not able to show the market that the European market is often much less tight than the US market.
Because we were not able to obtain it here, Mr Commissioner, perhaps the Commission could, in the ongoing discussions on this at the IEA, take an initiative at least in looking at what we could potentially gain in Europe by having weekly oil statistics in Europe.
Some experts tell me that we could also reduce the oil price just with this measure.
We now have to get to work, as it is important that the Commission is coordinated.
The Commission has set up an energy market observatory in DG TREN, so it is important that Eurostat and this new observatory work closely together.
Finally, I would like to wish the Eurostat civil service and to civil servants in the Member States considerable energy and courage, as they will now have to meet often in comitology and to transform this into real statistics.
Thank you very much again, all of you, for your kind words.
I may even be able to offer you a glass of champagne at the end of this long evening!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Statistics on plant protection products (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Staes, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning statistics on plant protection products - C6-0457/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, I would of course like to thank Mr Staes for his excellent work as rapporteur, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their contributions to the debate on this proposal for a regulation.
The proposal is part of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
The aim of this thematic strategy is to reduce the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment.
The proposal for a regulation that we are dealing with today contributes to this aim by ensuring that reliable and comparable data is collected in all the Member States, in order to enable harmonised risk indicators to be calculated.
The Commission's proposal is the fruit of years of work with the OECD and with research bodies on developing these risk indicators.
Our initial intention in the Commission was to cover all types of pesticides, including biocides.
However, the preparatory phase of the legislation made it clear that the biocides sector is not very harmonised and neither the Commission nor the Member States have sufficient experience or knowledge to propose specific measures on biocides, therefore the decision was not to include this category of products in the initial proposal that has been presented for your consideration.
I know that in his report Mr Staes advocates the inclusion of biocides, but we had reasons for finally deciding not to include them.
I would, however, like to assure the rapporteur and all of you that the Commission will take the opportunity offered by the review of the Directive on biocides planned for the end of this year to put forward a proposal that covers this sector comprehensively, including data collection.
The report by Mr Staes also advocates extending the scope of the regulation to non-agricultural use of plant protection products, thus including production and marketing statistics.
In our proposal we decided to leave this data outside the scope of application of the regulation to avoid overlaps with other statistical regulations on production and marketing, which would increase the administrative cost of producing these statistics.
We are, however, open to examining how best to use the existing statistics on production and marketing to benefit the objectives of the Thematic Strategy.
I would like to conclude, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, by reminding you of the high financial cost of implementing this regulation, which is between EUR 10 and 25 million per year in an initial estimate made for the Union of 25, which leads us to recommend that the Member States should be given sufficient flexibility in applying this regulation.
I trust that, based on sound cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we can arrive at an agreement as quickly as possible because, as you know, the process of collecting this data is a long and complex one that takes around five years.
It would be good for the regulation to be able to be applied as quickly as possible and, of course, once the framework directive on the Thematic Strategy is adopted.
Finally I would like once again to thank Mr Staes for his excellent work on a proposal that is very complex, but at the same time extremely important for the environment and for human health.
rapporteur. - (NL) I think that the Commissioner summarised his concerns on a number of points very well.
The Commission proposal on the regulation concerning statistics and pesticides is indeed directly linked to the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
As the Commissioner also made very clear, the aim is Europe-wide harmonisation of national statistics on the use and placing on the market of pesticides, which must be achieved at the level where it is most feasible in functional terms.
The aim, therefore - and it is an important one - is to use those data to reduce, in the medium term, the risks and impact on the environment and public health resulting from the use of pesticides.
When drawing up my report, I had four objectives:
1. to ensure sufficient comparability of data;
2. to avoid duplication of data collection;
3. to extend the scope to non-agricultural uses;
4. to make full use of the data thus obtained via a moral obligation to report.
I believe I have achieved these four objectives following the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but I know that there are still difficulties.
In particular, shadow rapporteur Mr Nassauer argued on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that data collection should be regulated in a proper and efficient manner, in terms not only of the confidential treatment of those data but also of public access and transparency.
I think that Mr Nassauer and I have held very constructive discussions and that his concerns have been realised, including in the vote in the Committee on the Environment, which was almost unanimous.
We also succeeded in arriving at good wording with regard to the extension of the scope to the non-agricultural sector.
We have now opted for data collection for not only agricultural and horticultural, but also professional non-agricultural use, such as maintenance work on roads, railways and communal green areas.
Thanks to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the whole concept of biocides, which the Commissioner, too, discussed, has ultimately crept into the report.
This has met with opposition, particularly from the PPE-DE Group, and so, together with the PSE Group, and on behalf of my group, I have attempted to overcome this problem by drawing up two amendments based on an earlier text further to a report by Mrs KlaÃ, which was adopted at first reading.
I know that the PPE-DE Group, and Mr Nassauer, still have problems with this, but I hope that it will not be an insurmountable obstacle in the final vote; after all, we are attempting to bow to the majority view in the European Parliament on this.
Another sticking point with the PPE-DE Group, ladies and gentlemen, is the decision of the Committee on the Environment to extend the scope of the regulation from pesticide sales and use to pesticide production, import, export and distribution.
The PPE-DE Group fears this will mean an extra burden on businesses.
To be frank, Mr Nassauer, I would venture to doubt that, since these data are available in any case, and there is actually no need for any additional calculations in this regard.
Contrary to Mr Nassauer's assertions, I am convinced that the inclusion of these data will ensure a better overview of undesirable and even illegal flows.
I think that this knowledge will be of benefit in realising one of the objectives of the regulation, which the Commissioner, too, clearly stated, namely reducing risks and the impact on the environment and public health resulting from pesticides.
I also think that these two particular arguments will ensure that any WTO cases from third countries can be countered.
I should like to thank my fellow Members for their most constructive cooperation.
I hope that we succeed in obtaining a large majority in favour of my report, so that I am able to conduct productive negotiations with the Council at second reading.
I would also like to thank the Commission for its excellent cooperation, and also the Eurostat officials, who always made themselves available and were genuinely most helpful in bringing this report into being.
Many thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is consensus on the fact that we wish to reduce the harmful effects on people and the environment emanating from the use of pesticides.
In order to be able to calculate these effects, indicators need to be developed.
In order to be able to develop them, we need data.
To ascertain this data, we need this directive.
I emphasise this in order to make it clear that this does not involve authorising pesticides, or using them, but merely ascertaining data suitable for developing appropriate indicators.
There is agreement on this.
We have also gone to great lengths to reach common positions, as Mr Staes has rightly demonstrated, and this has also been amazingly successful.
We have agreed that the scope of application has to be extended to the non-agricultural sector.
We have also found a consistent position for protecting company and trade secrets.
Two items remain unresolved between us: the first is the inclusion of biocides.
I fully share the position expressed by the Commissioner.
There are no fundamental objections to it, but we do not have the necessary knowledge at present to take this step in a meaningful way.
I have no reservations against it in principle, as I have said.
This can take place at an appropriate time.
The second item carries more weight.
We categorically object to the fact that not only the application, but also the production of pesticides is included in the scope of application, because the production process as such does not provide any information about the application.
Products are exported to third countries; products are stored before they are used.
Hence production, as has been said, does not yield anything as such for the purpose for which we are issuing this directive and we would therefore gladly eliminate it.
Nevertheless, I would say, Mr Staes, that if the Commission manages to abide by the compromises that we have worked out, your report will not come to grief in our final vote.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I debated about whether to speak in Hungarian or English on this subject and then I realised that during the working process I used mainly English expressions on the given topic.
The PSE Group had an intensive debate on the report and reached a compromise standpoint.
Some of us, including myself, had more radical amendments but the common position of the group is acceptable to us.
I should like to welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur.
Pesticides, on the one hand, are an important and essential support to modern European agriculture but, on the other hand, the non-sufficient pesticide use and the use of harmful substances are responsible for health problems, fatal accidents and environmental pollution.
Decision-makers, authorities, local governments, farmers, NGOs and citizens need proper information regarding pesticide use in order to reduce and prevent the negative impacts of pesticide use.
Therefore, this proposal for European statistics on pesticides is a positive step forward towards environmentally friendly agriculture.
Based on European statistics, we can monitor and evaluate the positive changes provided for in new pesticide legislation, i.e. the Directive on pesticide use, the thematic strategy on sustainable pesticide use and the Regulation on pesticide authorisations.
From the beginning, I proposed and supported the inclusion of biocide products into this directive with the approval of the PSE Group.
As in most cases, the active ingredient of the biocides is also used as a plant protection product.
Biocides therefore have almost the same health and environmental impact.
It does not make any difference after it has been released into the environment whether the substance was produced as biocide or as a plant production product.
It is reasonable that, first, we collect the statistics on the biocide products only.
Business confidentiality is always a sensitive issue and, therefore, I am pleased we all accept that this directive takes into account the obligations under the Aarhus Convention on access to environmental information.
That is why I supported the amendment that obliges the producers to provide proper information for the public.
I hope that after the compromise among the political parties represented in this Chamber, we will have a good first reading agreement from the Council and within a few years, perhaps, I will be able to quote here in this Chamber the useful data from the latest European pesticides statistics.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, many congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Staes, on an excellent report and for the great efforts he made to achieve compromise and consensus amongst the different political groups.
An EU-wide harmonisation of national statistics on the sale and use of plant protection products and the proper use of such statistics would undoubtedly greatly enhance the preparation of accurate impact assessments on the use of such products in the environment and on human health, and thus enable the taking of corrective measures.
In order for this harmonisation to be effective, and thus as beneficial as possible, the rapporteur has rightly made a number of amendments, which entail a compromise agreement of most groups, which cover four main areas.
Firstly, the generation of statistical data that is comparable and compatible in the Member States.
Secondly, the avoidance of duplication of data collection in order to reduce costs and the burden on professional users.
Thirdly, the necessity to include non-agricultural uses in the scope of the regulation, and fourthly the need to make the fullest possible use of the data collected.
We find the great majority of these amendments, as approved almost unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, useful and necessary and we will support it.
We will vote negatively on only three amendments, namely Amendments 24, 27 and 29.
Furthermore, we will fully support the five additional amendments submitted by the Greens and others.
In conclusion, I wish once again to make the general point that success in achieving the aims of this piece of legislation will depend very much on its proper implementation and to this end the constructive involvement and full commitment of Member States authorities is of paramount importance.
Let us hope that this will be the case in all 27 Member States.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to offer the rapporteur my sincere congratulations.
We, too, currently offer advice here in the EU pesticides package on how we can protect people, animals and the environment from damage caused by harmful pesticides - and this is our aim. Having sufficient data is the basic requirement for this aim.
I hope that this vote sends out a strong signal for the protection of the environment and health.
Confidential operational information is not involved in the collection and publishing of the data, but the right of consumers to information and transparency is safeguarded.
I am in favour of as much data as possible being made accessible on the Internet.
This would also be totally in keeping with my report on the authorisation of pesticides.
Experience from the authorisation process shows that we need reliable figures on the use of pesticides in Europe and harmonised data collection methods.
Only when good data is available can we hope to have fewer misunderstandings and false information.
In conclusion, there is something else that is not contained in the statistics report, but is nevertheless close to my heart.
At the last reading on pesticide authorisation, we also resolved upon a pesticide passport for the wholesale and retail trade.
This also requires data on the application of pesticides.
The wholesale and retail trades want this data and I hope the Member States will not stand in their way.
This is also a good endorsement for the statistics on pesticide data.
I hope the aim unites us in achieving better protection of people, animals and the environment through more reliable figures and data.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, I first want to thank Mr Staes for a good report, which of course we support in the GUE/NGL Group.
One of the aims contained in this report is to reduce the use of pesticides by improving the statistics, which is an urgent task.
The use of toxins and chemicals in agriculture is on the increase in Europe.
Toxins persist in food which we and our children eat.
It affects us all.
This is something which should worry all who care about their health and our environment.
In my homeland, the long-term vision of the environmental movement is an agriculture free of chemicals.
Unfortunately that goal is a remote one today.
The use of chemicals is increasing in agriculture, not just in the EU as a whole but also in Sweden.
I have a specific question for Commissioner Almunia: if a particular country wants to ban a chemical in agriculture, should it not be free to do so?
Unfortunately there have been many instances of Member States wanting to ban the use of certain pesticides, yet your Commission has prevented them from doing so.
Why?
Should not the environment and public health carry more weight than the demand for total harmonisation?
(SK) The report concerning statistics on plant protection products is closely connected with the Report on the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
If the report is to conform to the strategy, it is essential that elements of the strategy that we have already agreed upon and approved be reflected in this proposal for a regulation.
This applies primarily to the title of the regulation and the replacement of the term 'plant protection products' with 'pesticides'.
In addition, the inclusion of biocides in the scope of the regulation should be seen as an element that is already approved in both the Thematic Strategy and the Directive on pesticides.
Biocides must be included in the scope even before the first report is submitted to the Commission.
All the relevant characteristics of biocides are well known to us.
There is therefore no reason not to include them or to await further information.
This would unnecessarily defer interpretation of the term pesticides, which encompasses both plant protection products and biocides.
I therefore strongly oppose Amendment 33 whereas I will support Amendment 2, since Parliament has already reached agreement on this and this amendment alone conforms to the thematic strategy and the Directive on pesticides, as approved by Parliament in October 2007.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, plant protection products are being tested and the statistics are part of a package that also contains the Regulation on authorisation of pesticides and the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.
The aim of the entire package is to keep the effects of plant protection products on both human health and the environment to a minimum.
The pressure of competition on the internal market and the cross-border environmental aspects require a common approach here.
The access to our markets by foodstuffs from across the world, however, also makes it clear that obligations have to be appropriate in order to be effective.
It is of no help to anybody if our fruit, vegetables and meat come only from third countries, because obligations render production too difficult here.
We in Europe have no influence on foodstuffs from third countries.
The only possibility is to determine the maximum residual quantities and we are not yet properly set up to do this, let alone ready for a pesticide passport.
It is right to keep records and statistics on the sale of pesticides for monitoring the flows and developments of plant protection.
The professed aim in doing so is to reduce the risk of pests.
Data collection must guarantee comparability and obligations to submit a report must be kept to a minimum.
The recording of substance flows clearly overshoots the mark here, since it is not yet certain whether a plant protection product, a biocide or perhaps even a drug is produced from a given substance.
Biocides must be considered separately and here we await the Commission's proposal on the authorisation and use of biocides.
Only then will it be possible to consider the statistics that are still needed.
The illegal use of plant protection products must be more heavily scrutinised.
To do this, we need increased monitoring of the existing law.
In my opinion statistics do not help.
Any party that violates the law, Mr Staes, is not recorded in the statistics either.
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
There is no doubt that the substances developed to combat parasites and harmful organisms in plants radically transformed European agriculture.
These chemicals, however, have a harmful effect on human health and the environment.
Plant protection products that are particularly harmful must be taken out of circulation and the use of chemicals for this purpose must be significantly reduced.
To do this, however, we need reliable statistical data that are comparable and harmonised at European Union level.
In doing so we do not want to place an extra burden on the users of these products, agricultural holdings; this is not our aim.
On the other hand we do want to see all non-agricultural uses of plant protection products included in the scope of the statistics, and hence also within the scope of future legislation. Let me cite an example.
In Europe, the stone rubble alongside railway tracks is sprayed, or rather washed, using a herbicide, isopropylamine salt.
The total length of railway tracks in the European Union is around 213 000 km, and the amount of chemical we douse them with, according to the estimates, is around 900 000 litres.
This enters surface and groundwater along with the rain, and ultimately ends up in our bodies.
Up to now, we have not given adequate attention to this, and this situation needs to change.
The report we have before us is integrally linked to the legislative package we discussed last year, and should therefore be dealt with as such.
These are the framework directive on the sustainable use of plant protection substances referred to by my colleague in the European People's Party, Mrs KlaÃ, the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides drafted last year by Mrs BelohorskÃ¡, and the regulation on the placing of new plant protection products on the market, in which Mrs Breyer, the person responsible for this topic in the European Parliament, sets out the future direction for the sustainable use of plant protection products.
I congratulate the rapporteur and support this report.
Thank you very much.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second report today on statistics and I should like to remind the Commission that we have actually set ourselves the aim of reducing administrative expenses by 25%, since, in connection with statistics, there continues to be an outcry from those concerned not to allow excessive expenses and costs to accrue here.
I am very much of the opinion that the sustainable use of plant protection products is very important for the future development of genetic engineering and biotechnology and I also believe that the risk indicators are of particular significance for human health and the environment.
We should not forget, however, the general aim of the Lisbon Agenda, namely employment and ultimately growth in these sectors, nor tighten the requirements with bureaucratic obligations such as the collection of statistics, which can in fact also be obtained very easily in many sectors.
(PL) Madam President, the main information that Member States should be gathering is the quantity of products applied.
This will enable Member States to make individual analyses - that is, analyses in line with the intention of national plans.
Manufacturers should provide information on the application of pesticides that is of vital importance.
National data should be aggregated in each Member State and sent to the Commission in the form of collective information.
Such aggregate information is sufficient for further analysis at EU level.
In regulating the duties of Member States, we should be wary of giving assistance to local institutions in the gathering of detailed information that contributes nothing but has a blurring effect and undermines the motivation of Member States to put the noble idea of the directive into practice.
Madam President, a few quick questions, if I may, through you to the Commissioner.
Could the quantities of plant protection products used in non-agricultural situations such as golf courses, parks, airports, railway tracks, roadsides, and home and garden use be deduced having regard to the overall quantities, that is the total quantity minus agricultural usage products?
Secondly, biocides are used in a very wide range of situations and use patterns, including in domestic households, and, while data on the quantity of biocides placed on the market could be collected, it is very difficult to see how comprehensive data on the use of biocides could be collected.
Or is the suggestion to include only the agricultural use of biocides?
And, if it is the agricultural use of biocides only, why are we going into the non-agricultural use of plant protection products?
My third question is: could the explicit stipulation of statistics on production imports, exports and distribution of plant protection products lead to confusion and potential double-counting of quantities of plant protection products?
Madam President, I just wanted to stress the importance of one point that applies to this report as well as to the previous report. This is the fact that statistical data is not important in itself.
It is the interpretation of the statistical data, of course, and the drawing of the right conclusions and the implementation of measures guided by the statistical data which is important.
In this respect, the rapporteur has made a very important proposition relating to expert groups to evaluate the data collected.
I would like to ask the Commissioner, in this respect, what his thoughts are about such expert groups to evaluate the data.
The Commissioner will not intervene at the end of this debate.
He has informed us that he will answer Mrs Doyle's questions in writing.
rapporteur. - (NL) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all your encouraging words.
I believe that I have found a great deal of support in this House.
As the Commissioner said in his introductory speech, the positions of the Commission, the Council and Parliament are growing together; something that it was not possible to achieve at first reading.
In fact it was downright impossible, despite the fact that I held consultations with both the Slovenian and the Portuguese Presidencies on two occasions.
The fact that these positions are growing together is evidenced by the Commissioner's words on biocides.
He said that the Commission was considering revising that directive.
I wish to remain non-committal, and I trust that the wording of the proposal for a regulation, based on a text already adopted in the KlaÃ report, is non-committal.
Secondly, I most definitely take note of the Commission's offer to make the best possible use of the statistics already available on the production of pesticides, which represents an important contribution to the debate, including with a view to the second reading.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again; I shall not keep you any longer.
It is already late and I think we have all earned a little relaxation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (RO) The proposal for a Regulation aims at reducing the impact of the use of plant protection products on the environment and human health by creating a mechanism for the calculation of risk indicators and monitoring of the objectives established in the Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
As virtual rapporteur, I considered that it was necessary to ensure consistency between the definitions in the Pesticide Package and I opted for the inclusion of biocides in the proposal for a Regulation , in order to provide enhanced protection of users.
By means of this proposal, we want to improve the data collection system and to support the harmonisation of existing statistics between Member States, in order to be able to determine the progress accomplished in this field and to implement measures necessary for the achievement of the goal of reducing the risks generated by pesticides.
In addition, the availability of official statistics all over Europe would enhance market transparency and improve the competitiveness of the pesticide industry.
At the same time, a reduction in the use of pesticides will be beneficial for society, via an improvement of food quality, reduction of drinking water pollution, environmental protection and sustainable conservation of natural resources.
The European Union must be sure that citizens' health is not endangered by these hazardous substances and must stimulate new eco-effective agricultural practices.

Preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 March 2008) (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council in Brussels on 13-14 March 2008.
Mr Janez LenarÄiÄ will speak on behalf of the Council.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am very pleased to be able to present to you the main topics for the European Council session that starts tomorrow.
In accordance with the tradition of spring summits, this one will also be devoted to economic issues, especially the Lisbon Strategy, as well as to climate change, energy and financial stability.
The Presidency is looking forward to this exchange of opinions with the European Parliament and I can assure you that the opinions of Parliament in respect of the topics on tomorrow's agenda will be taken into account.
We are all aware of the fact that the European Union is facing new challenges and that globalisation is bringing new opportunities, not only in the economic sphere but also in the social and cultural spheres.
The European Union has already benefited from these opportunities.
We are also aware of the fact that globalisation requires the European Union and its Member States to adapt and to search for real answers. The Council will devote its attention precisely to that.
The global economic environment is being tested at the moment.
We have witnessed turbulent events in the financial markets.
Recently we have witnessed a reduction in economic activity due to the recession in the United States and higher oil and commodity prices.
Despite all this, the economic foundations of the European Union are still solid; however, under these conditions, we cannot stop and relax, but must continue with our reforms.
On this subject the European Council will evaluate the state of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment.
It will welcome the positive results and confirm that this strategy is working well.
It will stress that we must now concentrate on implementation and, in this spirit, activate the new phase of the revised Lisbon Strategy.
In the area of information and innovation, the European Council will give new impetus to our efforts to introduce the so-called fifth freedom.
This should eliminate the existing obstacles to the free flow of information by enhancing the cross-border mobility of researchers, students, scientists and university teaching staff.
In our opinion, the fifth freedom should accelerate the transformation of the European Union into an innovative, creative and information-based economy.
To strengthen the competitiveness of companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Council is planning measures which will enable them to develop and operate more satisfactorily.
They should gain easier access to sources of financing, and incentives for innovation will also be improved.
Special priority will also be given to the realisation of the plan for better legislation.
Great attention will be paid to the social reach of the Lisbon Strategy, efforts to solve demographic challenges, the lack of qualifications and future political measures to increase social cohesion.
The spring summit will charge the Member States with the gradual implementation of the common principles of flexicurity by means of national regulations to strike a balance between flexibility and security on the labour market.
Allow me to move to another important topic to be discussed by the European Council. I am thinking of the challenges associated with climate change and energy.
Last year we witnessed historic commitments in environment and energy policies.
This year we must devote ourselves to their implementation. This target is an economic and environmental challenge of exceptional long-term importance.
If we respond to it ambitiously, we will be able to report not only economic but also environmental success.
The legislative package proposed by the Commission is being considered by the Council at the moment.
The first debates have reconfirmed the commitment of all the Member States to an ambitious response.
Nevertheless, it is too early to expect that agreement on all aspects of this package will be reached at this summit.
However, we expect it to be possible to reach agreement on the principles and guidelines for further consideration of this package.
We anticipate that leaders will express a wish to maintain a general balance while paying attention to the complexity of the package in respect of its economic and financial effect.
The aim is to adopt the package as early as possible in 2009 or at any event before the mandate of the European Parliament expires.
Our efforts will be successful if all the key partners start tackling the challenges of climate change.
At the Copenhagen session of the climate change conference at the end of 2009, Europe should be the leading force in negotiations on ambitious and comprehensive agreement for the post-Kyoto period.
This is one more reason to adopt the agreement as soon as possible in 2009.
Allow me to touch briefly on some other energy-related questions.
An effective internal energy market is an essential condition for a reliable, lasting and competitive energy supply in Europe.
We expect the European Council to call for speedy adoption of the agreement on the third package for the internal gas and electricity market.
It will pay special attention to further measures relating to the reliability of supply and to external energy policy.
The European Council will place the efforts relating to climate and energy policy in the context of the development of new technologies and will increase investment in those technologies.
This was recently defined in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan and should make a further contribution to the competitiveness of our companies.
The leaders of countries and governments will debate the conclusions of the joint report by the General Secretary, the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Commission on the effects of climate change on international security.
The complexity of climate change requires a more comprehensive harmonisation of policy and the European Council will call for continued study of the report in detail.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to touch on a third main point of the European Council's agenda.
It concerns the debate about the recent situation in international financial markets.
The situation in the international financial system is still uncertain.
If we want to manage the risk of its effect on the real economy, we must direct the economic and financial policies of the European Union towards securing macroeconomic stability and implementing the structural reform plan.
The Union's response was prepared by Finance Ministers and some adjustments to the financial markets have been taking place since last autumn.
The European Central Bank, national authorities, institutions of the European Union and financial institutions have adopted a number of measures to stabilise the situation.
However, the responsibility for risk management still lies primarily with the individual financial institutions and investors.
The current situation has exposed the need for further strengthening of the framework for financial stability by means of greater credit supervision and improved tools for financial crisis management.
We expect the European Council to call for measures in four main areas: enhancing transparency for investors, markets and regulators, improving valuation standards, strengthening credit status and invigorating risk management in the financial sector and, last but not least, improving the operation of the market and the role of credit-rating agencies.
I would like to say a few words about state asset funds. Their long-term strategies have a beneficial role as capital providers that guarantee liquidity.
However, the appearance of new players whose investment strategies and aims are not always totally transparent gives rise to some doubts about uneconomic practices.
The recently published report by the Commission on state asset funds is an particularly valuable contribution to this debate.
The European Council will probably agree with the need for a common approach by the European Union in accordance with the principles proposed in that report.
Let me stress once more the importance of cooperation with the European Parliament.
I would like to conclude my introduction with the thought that the spring session of the European Council, which will start tomorrow, will be devoted primarily to the realisation of the adopted commitments.
The Presidency would like to accelerate the work of changing Europe into the most competitive economy.
We are also faced with the important task of securing more stability with the help of our climate and energy policy.
In view of all these future challenges, we are hoping for truly creative cooperation with the European Parliament.
If together we manage to make progress, European citizens will be able to see that the European Union exists to secure their future.
Our debate today and the discussion with the President of the European Parliament at the European Council session are undoubtedly two important factors in achieving this aim.
Thank you for your attention.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, traditionally, the Spring European Council is the time when we review the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, and this meeting will be more important than most.
I would like to start by thanking the Slovenian Presidency for the very careful preparation of this spring summit.
Whatever other messages come out of the European Council this week, one should be clear: the Lisbon Strategy is working.
No fewer than 6.5 million jobs have been created in the European Union in the last two years.
Unemployment is at its lowest level for 25 years.
The employment rate stands at 66%, getting close to the Lisbon target of 70%.
What is more, job creation has gone hand in hand with productivity improvements.
Productivity is now growing faster in the European Union than in the United States.
These are no mean achievements.
Of course, the Lisbon process cannot shield us from negative economic developments whose origin lies outside Europe.
In today's inter-connected economy, that is impossible.
We have had to trim our growth forecasts slightly for this year but we are still predicting growth of 2% - a very respectable performance.
The reforms already carried out have made our economies more resilient and flexible. This has left us better able to cope with external shocks.
Of course when conditions deteriorate it becomes all the more important to reassure those that feel threatened by an economic downturn.
Europe needs to protect - but it must avoid the temptation of becoming protectionist.
A retreat into protectionism would be madness.
Europe has been a huge winner from globalisation.
With just 7% of the world's population, Europe accounts for 30% of economic output.
We account for seven of the ten most competitive nations in the world and, despite the rise of China and India, Europe remains the world's largest trading power.
So Europe has every reason to approach the future with confidence.
At the same time, we need to remain vigilant and cautious as to further developments. But our general line should be one of confidence.
It will not be with pessimism that we will win the next economic battles.
This is what has inspired our reaction to the financial turmoil and our policy papers on the financial situation and on sovereign wealth funds, which are also on the table of the European Council.
And we hope the European Council will support our proposals for a common European response to these challenges.
When I say that the Lisbon Strategy is working - and indeed it is - this does not mean that all is rosy and that we can rest on our laurels.
I have said, and the Commission has said, time and time again, there is no room for complacency, especially when the economic situation seems to be deteriorating globally.
A lot has to be done.
In many regions of Europe unemployment remains a serious problem. There are special social categories that are very much affected.
Rising energy and food prices are fuelling inflation, eating into the purchasing power, especially of those who depend on salaries and pensions for their income.
So we need to continue our efforts.
But the Lisbon Strategy is not a static process. Far from it.
The Commission Strategic Report sets out a series of new policy initiatives to make Europe even more resilient to economic turmoil, and to reinforce European efforts to shape and fully benefit from globalisation.
First, the most important area.
The most important area is people. The key to overcoming poverty and inequality is driving up standards of education and training throughout the Union, making sure they are available to all.
We have chosen to focus on one of the most vulnerable groups: early school-leavers.
Today in Europe, one in six young people still leaves school without qualifications.
One in five 15-year-olds does not have adequate reading skills.
We cannot afford to allow their talents to go to waste.
We must give young people the skills they need to realise their potential.
Another key pillar of the Lisbon Strategy we have returned to is research and innovation.
To keep investment coming in, Europe must increase its relative attractiveness.
We need a fifth freedom in Europe - the free movement of knowledge - to complement the other four freedoms on which the single market rests.
We need to support open innovation but at the same time we need to ensure that knowledge is suitably protected by European patents and copyright.
Here I would like to welcome the adoption of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology yesterday by this House.
This is a crucial moment for Europe.
I would like to congratulate the European Parliament on this achievement and to thank you for the support you have given to my proposal, which I remember met with so much resistance when I put it forward three years ago.
But, thanks to the good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission and the Member States, at the end we have got that agreement.
The third priority we have looked at is the business environment.
We need a single market that works for Europe and in particular for SMEs, which are the backbone of our economy and the place where most jobs are created.
That is why I will be asking the European Council tomorrow to endorse the idea of a Small Business Act to remove the impediments to the creation and the growth of SMEs.
We have to keep in mind that the most important thing we can give to SMEs is a real internal market.
This is the main difference between Europe and the United States of America, when it comes to SMEs, not because of specific legislation.
A small company in the United States can start in one state but can immediately reach the entire internal market of the United States.
In Europe it is still not like that. In Europe there are a lot of barriers in practical terms in going from one country to the next.
So we really need to complete the internal market if we want to develop SMEs and if you want more growth and more employment in Europe.
(Applause)
The final Lisbon pillar we have revisited in our strategic report is energy and climate change, the defining challenge of our generation.
It may be early days for the energy and climate package.
But, as this House knows well, the momentum cannot be allowed to slip.
The timing of an agreement is critical to its success.
The earlier it comes, the lower the cost of adjustment, the bigger the benefits for early movers.
And it is crucial to our number one goal: agreeing a comprehensive international agreement in Copenhagen next year.
The more countries are involved and the closer their ambitions are to ours, the more we will have a level playing field.
Nothing will bring this closer than the European Union showing that it means business by reaching agreement by the end of this year.
So I am really determined - the Commission is really determined - to work with the Member States so that we can have a basic political agreement on the energy internal market and on the climate protection and renewables package by the end of this year.
Of course, we would also like to have the final legislative process concluded with the European Parliament at the beginning of next year.
It is of course important to link the climate protection strategy with the internal market for energy.
We all know this is essential for our vision of competitive, secure and sustainable energy for Europe.
I have been glad to see this dossier accelerating over the past weeks, and we are committed to finding ways of ensuring that the genuine market opening targeted in our original proposals is realised.
The Commission remains fully committed to the realisation of ownership unbundling or its functional equivalent.
The efforts of this House to be ready for a first reading by June are central.
Reform is not about rolling back valuable social advances or our social market economy; it is about equipping people to succeed in times of change, giving them the chance to take control of their own lives.
It is about modernising our social systems and securing their sustainability.
Access, opportunity and solidarity must be the watchwords and will be at the heart of the renewed social agenda that the Commission will present before summer.
It is about a dynamic business environment where entrepreneurs are spending their time and resources on producing high-quality goods and services that people from all over the world want to buy, not on filling in unnecessary forms and having to battle every day against red tape.
It is also about transforming Europe into a low-carbon economy that is good for the environment and good for business.
An economy that provides rising living standards but which does not cost the earth.
I am glad to see that the hard work of the last few years on the revamped Lisbon Agenda has helped foster a broad consensus on where we stand and where we want to go.
This House has been a consistent source of critical support, and I want to thank you for this.
I was pleased to note the large degree of support for the Lisbon Strategy expressed in the European Parliament's resolution of 20 February on the input for the 2008 Spring Council.
I have also seen the amendments that this House voted the same day to the broad economic policy guidelines.
I agree with the issues you emphasise, and indeed they are already part and parcel of European Union policies on the basis of proposals from the European Commission: social inclusion, sustainability of public finance, the need to fight inflation, R&D, improved economic policy coordination, the promotion of entrepreneurship and innovation, the external dimension of the internal market, and climate change and energy.
So let us be clear: the Commission agrees with these priorities.
After consulting with various stakeholders, including the Member States, the Commission proposed in December to keep the guidelines of the strategy as they were, given their inbuilt flexibility, which allows adaptation to the evolving circumstances and accommodation of the priorities I have just cited and which the Commission endorses.
Keeping the guidelines sends a much-needed signal of stability and predictability to Member States and economic operators alike and, in doing so, reinforces the likelihood of delivery.
As the Presidency of the Council just stated, the priority now is delivery.
We have to deliver concrete results and we have to show consistency.
This being said, after contacts with Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission tried to broker a compromise with the Council, suggesting adaptations to the narrative document accompanying the guidelines to reflect the issues highlighted by Parliament.
In spite of the efforts of the Commission, the Council decided not to follow our compromise suggestion on the broad economic policy guidelines.
Anyway, I would like to reassure this House of the utmost importance that the Commission attaches to setting the right framework for Member States to deliver on our shared priorities - and the priorities are growth and jobs.
When I say growth, it is growth that is sustainable from a social and environmental point of view.
And jobs that are not only increasing in numbers but also in quality.
Because we are sure that the renewed Lisbon Strategy focusing on jobs and growth, with its commitment to competitiveness and inclusiveness, is Europe's best response to the challenges of globalisation.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council's spring priority will be to encourage European growth and relaunch the Lisbon Strategy for 2008-2010.
Our group feels it is of the utmost importance to give the EU every chance in the light of globalisation, and to reform it as the European Commission has proposed most energetically since 2005 under President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso.
This strategy is the best tool for dealing with the challenges facing us: globalisation, population and climate change.
We have a dual message here: pursuing the reforms undertaken, but also making the Lisbon Strategy more effective.
Globalisation is an opportunity for Europe, but we will never accept unbridled free trade.
That is the first challenge.
We must protect the interests of the most vulnerable and promote our own social model.
It is not time to change of direction, but rather to increase our efforts along the route already marked out.
The Lisbon Strategy proposes an adapted response to each challenge.
In the face of competition from emerging nations, our future lies in research and innovation, support for entrepreneurs, lifelong training and reform of the job market.
Europe can only be competitive if its products have added value in terms of quality and innovation.
That is why I am calling for investment in research and innovation by the Member States on the largest possible scale.
Nor will growth and jobs emerge from development of SMEs.
We must help them secure contracts and create jobs by reducing the administrative burden.
Drawing up a Small Business Act on a European scale represents a step in the right direction.
Education and training must be adapted to the needs of the economy.
We can only maintain a competitive edge if our workforce has the right training.
Teaching at schools and universities and continuous training must be reviewed, and certainly enhanced.
In this respect we welcome the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013.
Wide-ranging reforms are also required for the job market, which must be more mobile, more flexible and also more secure.
Businesses must be able to adapt to market requirements.
Employees must be able to take advantage of retraining and adaptation opportunities.
The second challenge for Europe concerns its population.
The ageing of the population is set to create a shortage of labour and pressure on social security systems.
There must be better stimulation of the internal workforce, and better flexibility and adaptability for all generations to make it easier for them to reconcile their professional and family lives.
We must also review our immigration policy, which must be European, and attract skills and know-how.
The blue card proposal must be developed.
We must also halt the brain drain.
Our investment in education will have been in vain if researchers go abroad for better pay and working conditions.
The third and final challenge is climate change.
We must implement a political system in line with a viable environment-friendly economy, and this means meeting the target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Quite apart from the ecological advantages, this will also stand us in good stead for clean-technology markets.
This is not insignificant.
We must, however, set an example and our partners must do the same.
A green policy must be accompanied by an external trade policy, which is not protectionist, but firm.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will only retain our values and our model of society if we have the courage to reform our society and tell our fellow citizens the truth.
We can only make social progress if growth plays a part.
Growth in turn can only play a part if we provide the means for it to do so.
Just this once I wish to thank the President of the Commission, Vice-President Verheugen and all the Commissioners for their work.
My thanks, ladies and gentlemen, may be considered in the context of a stable: the Barroso stable.
A ration of oats compensates a job well done, but oats also provide energy for all the work that remains.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin with an observation to the President of the Council.
We have been informed, Sir, that the Mediterranean Union is to be discussed at tomorrow's dinner.
This is an idea of the French President, and at the talks over dinner - as well as hoping that all the participants enjoy their meal - I would ask you on behalf of our Group to clarify the following. If the idea is that the Mediterranean Union will build on, or upgrade, the Barcelona process into which we are pumping a good deal of money out of the European Union budget, then we are fully in favour of it.
However, there need to be guarantees that such a policy will be pursued within the framework of the European Union.
If the Mediterranean Union is to be a success, it must be a Community policy within the framework of the existing EU institutions and policies.
If, conversely, the Mediterranean Union were to become a divisive factor in the EU, then that would be a bad sign; it would moreover isolate France on the eve of the French Presidency, something we certainly do not want.
(Applause)
We therefore ask you to pass on this message to the participants at the summit.
Not altering the guidelines is one thing.
The decision taken here on 20 February by a majority of 515 votes, namely to alter them, is quite a different matter.
However, let us not argue about whether or not to alter the guidelines; let us discuss whether or not the substantive changes contained in our demand for the guidelines to be altered are practicable.
Mr Barroso, I criticised you last week for demonstrating a lack of commitment.
I have heard in the meantime that some Members of your Commission - presumably after consultation with you - have taken up and put forward some of the ideas that we proposed here.
Hence my criticism on this point is no longer relevant.
However, Mr President of the Commission, having heard your speech today I must repeat the following: you have a guiding role in Europe.
Your words to the Heads of State and Government tomorrow must encourage them to put what you have just been calling for into practice in the Member States.
A good deal of what you say is true, naturally, but we need to address the real situation in Europe.
Allow me therefore to list five points which we believe remain crucial but have not been sufficiently flagged up or put into practice.
Yes, progress has of course been made: unemployment is falling and productivity rising, yet job insecurity in Europe is rising too.
That is also a fact.
Of course more jobs are being created, but the jobs being created are not secure; they are ever more insecure.
Pay rises in Europe are not keeping pace with company profits: in percentage terms, company profits are outstripping pay rises for workers.
(Applause)
This represents a social imbalance.
We wish to improve social cohesion; we want more social protection.
What is the point of a growing internal market, what is the point of a globally competitive Union, if the reality is this: a manufacturing company makes a 4% profit at a site and says 'this is not enough for the shareholders; they want a 6% profit, so we are closing down the company at this site'.
That strikes a blow against the basic confidence that the European Union needs.
Our citizens must have confidence!
We are discussing unbundling in the energy sector, which might or might not be necessary.
Let us talk for once about an unbundling that is taking place in the social policy field in Europe.
There is a real danger that economic growth will become uncoupled from social security, which is why the guidelines need to be revised.
We must make plain that whatever happens in the social policy field in the European Union goes hand in hand with economic progress.
We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the European Parliament this afternoon.
According to the spirit that prevailed here in Strasbourg 50 years ago, the combination of economic development and social security was the basis for the European Community's growth and success.
It is increasingly being put at risk.
You say that red tape must be cut for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Yes!
However, if red tape is cut and such companies move around Europe and then produce a case such as the Laval case, that strikes a blow against confidence in the European Union.
For if freedom of movement can be used even by SMEs to roll back social progress, companies may stand to gain but their employees will not.
Those employees, however, make up the vast majority of EU citizens.
Of course we need investment in education, training, research and technical innovation.
That goes without saying.
However, if, for the overwhelming majority of people, access to university or school is dependent on whether their parents have enough money in their wallets, then that is not a social policy.
We need equal access for all citizens in the European Union, wherever they come from and whatever their family circumstances.
If Europe is to survive, we must strengthen that potential, not only business potential.
We must above all strengthen the potential of young people on this continent who need access to research, skills and training.
It undoubtedly strikes a blow against social confidence if any rich person in Europe can take their money coffers from one country to another without having to pay tax.
That is another blow!
You are therefore right to say that we need to regulate the EU's financial markets.
All of this, Mr President, argues in favour of a revision of the guidelines.
Ultimately it matters little whether or not we call it that.
If you convey this message to the Council tomorrow, we will be on your side; but we will only be on your side if you do so, Mr President!
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this week's Council takes place somewhere along the road between despair and hope.
Although the major difficulties seem to be overcome, the Lisbon Treaty is not yet ratified, and questions linger over some of its provisions.
Uncertainties abound about the political direction of Russia, Turkey and some of our neighbours in the Middle and Near East.
Economic growth is slowing, haunted by the impact on GDP of past banking-sector crises in Sweden or Finland or Hungary or Spain, to say nothing of Argentina or Japan.
It makes concerted action by our central banks this morning all the more welcome.
Beyond these considerations, the major global challenges of population growth and migration, of international crime and terrorism, of climate change and energy security continue to weigh on the minds of our policy makers.
The urgent implementation of the Commission's proposals to tackle climate change is incumbent on the Member States and on this House.
The contours of the challenge are wide.
The report from the High Representative on the impact of climate change on security and stability shows us that there is a real and immediate concern, with the danger of military implications, including the use - sometimes discussed - of NATO as an instrument of energy security.
Yet, blinded by short-term economic thinking, some of our Member States are already busy trying to limit their commitments to the Commission's proposals on climate change.
Look at the draft Council conclusions - paragraph 18 - and see some of the weasel words that have been inserted.
These twin dangers carry the threat of a retreat into a Fortress Europe.
It is only by increasing internal solidarity that we can avoid the trap that Member States fall into, such as choosing South Stream over Nabucco.
It is only by extending solidarity beyond our shores that we can enjoy peace around the Mediterranean, that Mare Nostrum, or around the Caspian Sea.
Einstein was right when he said that peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by understanding.
We also need to lead by example.
I hope that in the Council conclusions we will see a commitment by national governments and the European Union to cut energy use in our own government and institutional buildings and in our car fleets, with binding targets to achieve that.
There have been stern warnings from the IPCC and others of the cost of inaction.
We must act and we can because, despite the strong headwinds, the economic fundamentals of the euro area economy are strong, as the President of the Commission says, with domestic demand and exports continuing to grow - a sign that the Lisbon Strategy is working and must be pursued.
We hear what people are saying in this House.
Mr Wurtz's group was leading a protest about the threat to 12 000 jobs at Unilever.
Mr Schulz wrote a letter to 27 Heads of State and Government calling for a change in economic direction, binding social standards and greater social protection.
Yet these actions ignore the reality of what is happening in the global economy where, as more and more countries have opened their economies, the global ratio of trade to GDP has grown faster than total output.
Half of our income now comes from trade and even developing countries now account for a third of world trade.
The integration of the world economy is proving that it is not a zero-sum game.
While Europe's share of that economy may be shrinking, the overall growth means that we continue to create jobs and wealth.
That is why we have created 6.5 million new jobs in the last two years.
My group has long argued this and we are pleased that it has been recognised by Mr Jacques Delors and Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in the manifesto that they drafted for the PSE Group, which was adopted in Oporto some 15 months ago.
Mr Schulz, if there is an ostrich in this room, it is not to be found in seat 21 [Mr Barroso's seat]; it is to be found in seat 6 [Mr Schulz's seat].
I think that explains why the PSE Group has lost its former role as the motor of this institution.
The European Council must show more urgency in achieving its research and development targets.
It must boost the market for venture capital and the mobility of researchers to foster innovation.
It must improve transparency and supervision in the banking sector to ward off danger.
Mr LenarÄiÄ, you must pay attention to social cohesion and environmental stability but you must do so secure in the knowledge that markets are the most powerful tool we have to improve living standards.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office as well as the President of the Commission to discuss what our elders, wise men and some would say our betters - although I do not necessarily agree with that - will be discussing during the summit over the coming days.
Rather than going back over everything that my colleagues have said, because I can agree with most of the contributions, I would say that it is not one or the other but rather a combination of all: trying to drag the best ideas out of all the different proposals that have been put forward and utilising them as the unique model which Europe must follow.
I say that because our experience over the last 30 years, and in particular the last 20 years, has shown that it is not either one or the other.
You cannot have economic growth without proper social cohesion and social protection.
You cannot have protection of the environment without proper investment in new resources, information technology and research and development to create the innovative ways of dealing with the problems we are now facing.
Likewise, you cannot solve unemployment simply by saying that we want more jobs.
You have to encourage companies and businesses to create the jobs, to invest the money and to create the wealth.
Only so much can be done by public services, whether it is public investment for infrastructure or whatever else.
Ultimately it comes down to businessmen and businesswomen in small and medium-sized enterprises - which employ 62% of all the people employed within the European Union - investing more money in creating more and more jobs.
That requires a certain amount of flexibility.
However, flexibility should not be a byword for a diminution of standards or of the protection of workers' rights.
Likewise, you cannot use one bad example, like the Laval case - bad enough as it is - to say that everybody else must be controlled to the most rigorous level.
It must be used as a starting point, not as the end game.
Look at the challenges that we face in the European Union today: our lack of investment in proper research and development.
The best and the brightest from European universities and institutions are leaving Europe to do their research and further work in America, Japan and now even China.
And look at the relocation of European industry and business: it is not to other countries within Europe, which was the case 10 or 12 years ago; it is now outside the European Union, to India, Pakistan, Malaysia and other countries.
What we really need to be focusing on now is not just where the sudden subprime market difficulties are creating short-term difficulties today.
If we look back over the last 25 years of the economic markets, they go in cycles: there are troughs and there are highs.
What we have to ensure is that the foundation stones that we put down today will be as strong in 15 years' time as they are today, that they will continue to deliver economic growth and that they will continue to deliver security of energy supply.
The President of Estonia told us here yesterday that Russia is now acting like a superpower, to use its superpower status in oil and gas to influence foreign policy.
We must ensure that there is solidarity within the European Union to face up to and to meet that challenge.
Our best and most valuable asset is our young people.
If we do not invest properly in education and training and give them skills and opportunities in the European Union, we risk losing them.
Finally, let me say to the President-in-Office that I want to pay a small tribute to the young people in Slovenia for their work during Slovenia's Presidency - particularly those in the protocol section - and the welcome and the image they give of Slovenia as a country.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by taking up what Mr Schulz said.
I would emphasise once again that we are not making an honest assessment of the Lisbon Strategy if we ignore the fact that, while Europe is indeed a major winner from globalisation, the winnings are very unevenly distributed.
In addition, employment growth has by no means resolved the problem of the working poor; on the contrary, despite increased employment and increased growth, we also have increased poverty caused by job insecurity.
We in the European Parliament called explicitly in our resolution for the issue of sectoral minimum wages to be addressed by the Commission and the Council, and for the Commission to assess the results of the Lisbon Strategy differently in view of the problem of growing social marginalisation.
This poverty indicator is an integral part of our resolution, and I find it regrettable that neither the Council nor the Commission has so far responded to these decisions of the European Parliament.
(Applause)
Turning to the subject of climate and energy, quite frankly I was shocked when a German Government representative declared in Brussels, just a few days before this spring summit, that environment policy ought to steer clear of industrial and economic policy.
This pronouncement was made by a State Secretary in the German Ministry of the Environment, Mr Machnik, who is no doubt known to my German colleagues.
Germany's Environment Ministry obviously has no real understanding of what sustainability actually means.
It is hardly surprising, consequently, that the German Government continues to oppose CO2 limits on vehicles, that it is not in favour of the single market for energy as proposed by the Commission and that it is attempting to organise an alliance against the 'new definitions of emissions trading'.
I note with regret that, in these negotiations, Germany has partially forgotten what was signed and sealed at last year's spring summit.
Some of its current policies are totally at odds with the outcomes of last year's summit.
I am not certain, for example, that the new priority attached to renewable energy - which appears so uncontroversial - really is sufficient to ensure sustainability in the field of energy and the climate.
The Mediterranean Union also raises questions in my mind.
One sometimes gets the impression that, just like those major gas deals with Russia - I mean North Stream and South Stream - this Mediterranean Union is further proof that a uniform EU policy on energy and security of energy supply is simply not possible.
If the Council fails to tackle this problem, it will fall short of its obligations.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the European Parliament today.
This should surely be an opportunity for the forthcoming summit to grant this House the right of initiative at long last!
I furthermore believe that the European Parliament's 50th anniversary is the right occasion for me and my Group to make clear that neither the Council nor the Commission should expect this House to be docile and indulgent and full of adulation in future.
It will still be our duty to stand up for those people in the European Union who are often ignored: the 70 million or more people in the EU who are living in or at risk of poverty, including 19 million children.
If, as we understand, the European Council is to welcome the Commission's strategic report on the renewed Lisbon Strategy and congratulate itself on its own success, then it should devote rather more than just a few lines to those EU citizens, those children, who derive no benefit at all from the achievements of the Lisbon Strategy.
The direction and priorities of the strategy are wrong, as are the resulting policies!
Mr Watson, it is not our protests against the aggressive global conduct of Unilever, Thyssen-Krupp, Nokia and many others that are unrealistic, but the refusal of the Commission and Council to confront the global corporations that are acting so aggressively and attach the appropriate priority to protecting the employees concerned and those who are socially excluded.
I can only agree with the European Anti-Poverty Network when it complains that the fight against poverty, social exclusion and a growing social divide is still not being tackled and backed up with the necessary clarity and determination.
The Network addressed four questions to the spring summit on 10 March, and the European Parliament should specifically endorse these questions. How precisely do you propose to strengthen the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy?
What precise actions are proposed to meet the commitment 'to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty'?
Given that 18.9 million of those who are officially poor (78 million) are in employment, what measures are proposed to address in-work poverty?
What measures are proposed to ensure that rising energy prices do not threaten social cohesion and social inclusion?
These four questions are fundamental, I believe, if economic growth really is to be sustainable in social and environmental terms.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, President of the Council and President of the Commission, together with my Irish colleague, Kathy Sinnott, I have made a proposal for a new protocol to be amended to the Lisbon Treaty before its final approval.
It will outlaw a revolutionary decision by the European Court of Justice dated 18 December 2007.
A Latvian company wanted to build a school in Sweden with Latvian workers being paid much less than Swedish workers for similar jobs. Swedish trade unions established a blockade.
This action has now been deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice.
They will only allow the Treaty principle on free movement of goods and services to be moderated by the other fundamental principle of the right to strike if there is a risk to public security, order or health.
A normal salary does not count.
Collective bargaining does not count.
The Scandinavian flexisecurity model, the voluntary cooperation between trade unions and employers, can be scrapped.
Foreign workers in foreign companies in Ireland may now work for the Irish minimum salary of EUR 9 an hour.
It is illegal for Irish trade unions to act against this Court judgment except in relation to the minimum wage.
It is even worse in my country, where we do not have a minimum wage.
This Court judgment is a disaster and must be annulled by a new wording in the Treaties or a legally binding protocol.
You can see our proposal on my website.
I urge the Slovenian Presidency and the President of the Commission to raise the question at the summit.
I have a question for the Commission and Council: When will we have a consolidated Treaty so that we can understand the content?
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I think that at the summit tomorrow the heads of states should wake up and admit that lowering the European production of CO2 by 20% and increasing renewable energies to 20% in 12 years' time is a utopian idea.
If we impose further restrictions on European industries, we will jeopardise both the competitiveness of companies and employment, and in the end investments will shift towards countries that do not raise climate-related obstacles.
In addition to that, instead of giving credence to the nonsense about crowds of African and Asian refugees are invading Europe because the climate is forcing them to leave their homes, we should give a thought to our policies that made Europe a target for the migrating poor instead of the skilled workers.
I am convinced that we should focus on innovative processes that will reduce energy-intensive production.
We should give preference to, and spend funds on, expert brains instead of green brains.
We should also shake off the unfounded fear of nuclear reactors.
If the Council wants to act in the interest of citizens, countries should invest in research, development and education precisely in the field of nuclear energy.
Mr President, this European Council takes place with great economic uncertainty in the air.
The summit will consider an update of the Lisbon Agenda, which has only two years to run.
It is vital that heads of government do not indulge in self-congratulation.
There are real threats to free trade and to the fundamental principles of free and open competition that must underpin the European Union.
In that context I was delighted to read the recent remarks of the Commission President in the Financial Times, in which he raised the ugly spectre of growing protectionism in Europe.
When asked if such sentiment was on the rise, he said, 'Yes, and I fear this rise is not only in Europe but all over.
Political forces in Europe that were traditionally pro-market are today - let us put it elegantly - more prudent'.
So there are rising protectionist threats, and not least when we hear the rhetoric from across the Atlantic from two of the front-runners in the presidential race.
Let us be clear, Europe has much more to gain from globalisation than it has to lose.
Indeed, The Economist recently lamented the anti-globalisation language used by some European leaders.
The reality, it said, was that European citizens are winners from globalisation, with cheap imports, low inflation and low interest rates.
And, notwithstanding the emergence of India and China, the EU's share of world exports rose, albeit slightly, between 2000 and 2006.
In France, where protectionist rhetoric is perhaps the most marked, a recent report stated that only 3.4% of jobs that were lost in 2005 could be blamed on so-called offshoring.
So we should get all this in perspective and back the Commission President in his strong stance on the matter.
Europe will only succeed in international markets if its improves its competitiveness, radically reforms its labour markets and cracks down hard on bad business regulation, both at EU level and national level.
The Economist asked the question: Will today's politicians ever be frank enough to tell the people that globalisation is good for Europe and for them?
President Barroso has been frank; it is time for EU leaders to back him.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the real world has caught up with the European Union.
At the 2007 spring summit, the EU27 was still free to dream of an ideal world.
Europe was on target again in terms of growth; unemployment was falling; employment was on the increase; public deficits were going down; the European Council was introducing a set of visionary targets in connection with the fight against climate change; and at the Bali Conference Europe was set to act as a guide for the rest of the world.
In August, however, the subprime crisis erupted and continues to create havoc.
After the banks and insurance companies, investment funds have now entered the turmoil.
In showing their disdain for moral contingencies, the central banks have become the speculators' flame-quellers.
The leading central banks have again been forced to inject billions into the financial circuits in order to 'deal with the pressure on liquid assets' as one says discreetly in the world of high finance.
It is the general economy that picks up the tab.
A general tightening on credit has slowed up economic growth.
Recession looms; the ECB urges moderation on employees whose spending power is continuously whittled away by higher prices for energy and food.
On the other hand, the failed geniuses of finance and industry are rewarded not quite so moderately.
The dollar is at a record low and a barrel of crude oil at a record high.
Growth forecasts are increasingly revised downwards.
Despite this changing context, President Barroso clings to the existing integrated guidelines as though they were engraved in Portuguese marble.
The Bali summit did not line up with the noble targets proposed by the Europeans.
The Americans, the Japanese, the Canadians and even the Australians, despite their new status as Kyoto signatories, did not want any compromising targets; nor did the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians or the Russians.
The roadmap meant to lead to the 2009 Climate Conference in Copenhagen is the flimsiest of documents.
The Commission, however, has no wish to adjust the decisions taken at the 2007 summit to the real problems now emerging.
A number of reasonable voices are nevertheless making themselves heard within the Commission.
President Barroso speaks out against the illusions of an industry-free Europe.
Vice-President Verheugen insists clear flexible decisions must be taken that will not help deindustrialise Europe.
Industrialists in the energy sector would, of course, have no problem with CO2 certificates being put under the hammer.
Since their customers are putty in their hands, they will simply pass on the extra cost to them.
In the steel and aluminium sectors and other energy-intensive industries operating in a global market, oncosts will not be reflected in prices, but will certainly affect the only adjustment variable remaining: employment.
This option would rapidly cause relocation to countries where social regulations and climate regulations are less strict than in Europe.
The gain for the world's climate would obviously be nil, but the social cost to Europeans would be unbearable.
The 2007 summit took some courageous decisions, but these did not square with the realities of the EU27.
Achievement of the biofuels target alone would do the environment more harm than good, and consumers would certainly lose out.
The next summit must adjust these decisions to the new economic realities worldwide and define an environmental policy that does not operate under the illusion that the EU alone can bear the burden of the fight against climate change.
(PL) Mr President, energy security ought of course to be one of the key features of the European Union's energy policy.
Energy security can only be achieved through joint action, working in cooperation with others, and only when the European Union speaks with one voice.
This is not the case regarding the Nabucco pipeline, a project of strategic importance for Europe.
In my view, this matter should be raised at the forthcoming Council, and the latter should ensure that the Union acts as a single entity where this pipeline is concerned.
It should also be borne in mind that a second pipeline, whose construction is supported by several European countries, may mean that it will not be possible to pursue the Nabucco project for practical reasons.
There simply will not be enough gas available.
I therefore have a question to put to the European Union.
Would it not be possible simply to support this pipeline with European Union funds, in order to improve the Union's energy security?
Similar action was taken for the Galileo project, which was considered to be of strategic importance.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to remind the House that the Lisbon Strategy, whose praises were sung so loudly by President Barroso, was supposed to enable our economy to catch up with that of the United States.
Unfortunately, everything we see, hear and experience indicates that not only have we failed to catch up with the United States, but we are also losing out to Asia.
Instead of heralding success, therefore, it needs to be clearly stated that in pursuing the Lisbon Strategy the Union is running a race it has absolutely no intention of winning.
If the desire really was to make Europe's economy more dynamic and effective, the European Commission would not have introduced barriers hindering our economic growth, as it has done in recent years.
I refer to the restrictions on the freedom to provide services across the territory of the European Union and to restrictions on the freedom of employment.
Either we take the declarations seriously, therefore, or we simply put on a show, presenting slogans and swearing blind about reality, whilst actually taking action that has the opposite effect and impedes development.
The Commission is responsible for over-regulating the economy, for an excessive quantity of directives and concessions and for everything involved in making the economy unduly dependent on bureaucracy, including the European bureaucracy.
As regards combating climate change, notably the carbon dioxide issue, we do not wish the cost of this effort to represent an undue burden on the economies of the new Member States.
Allowing that to happen would amount to throwing the baby out with the bath water.
(DE) Mr President, the Socialist Group is of course right to say that wealth distribution in Europe has not worked well over the past few years, and of course Robert Goebbels is right to demand a different approach to speculation and the squandering of billions of euro.
Nevertheless, I would caution against playing off social affairs against environmental affairs, as the Socialists and others in this House are once again attempting to do.
We are currently faced with the existence of a lobby, a lobby of steel barons, aluminium barons and chemical industry barons.
What do these men want? As a rule they are men!
These men want to undermine the 'polluter pays' principle.
It is clearly unacceptable for the very industries which pollute the most now to be exempted from the pollution tax, and the auctioning of CO2 allowances is nothing other than that.
What would happen next?
What would happen is that there would be no modernisation of the steel, aluminium and chemical industries internationally.
We therefore need the following model. First, there must be 100% auctioning.
Second, these funds must be hypothecated so that, as happened in Denmark in the early 1990s, the proceeds from a CO2 tax levied on industry are reinvested in the modernisation of the steel industry and other energy-intensive companies in Europe.
Third - and I think we shall have to work with the French Presidency on this point - we naturally need penalties for environmental dumping outside the single market, on other continents.
It is a misconception, however, that every steel plant outside Europe has poorer environmental and energy standards than steel plants located in Europe today.
That is not true, and so any such sanctions will only work if they are transparent.
Social and environmental policies operating hand-in-hand: that is the future.
(SV) Mr President, the picture presented by the Commission and the Council today conveys an entirely different reality to that which the majority of our citizens live with, a reality in which poverty and gaps between different groups have increased.
We are told that more people have found jobs, but we are not told what kind of jobs have increased.
They are mostly low-wage jobs which do not enable people to provide for themselves and their children.
They are casual jobs with insecure conditions of employment.
This is not the model of society which we on the left want or accept.
We know that there are other paths to follow, paths that lead to solidarity and justice and a society for all our citizens.
Any prospect of a social Europe was brought to earth when the European Court of Justice ruled in the Vaxholm and Viking Line cases.
The judgments made it absolutely clear that, in the EU, free movement and the demands and interests of the internal market are more important than the interests of employees.
The outcome of the judgments is social dumping.
Workers from different countries are played against one another.
Serious employers who want to pay decent wages and offer reasonable working conditions are outcompeted.
The Court of Justice leaves no room for doubt.
But why do the Commission and the Council remain passive in this matter?
Why approve a Treaty which further strengthens the interests of the market against those of working people?
The Vaxholm judgment gave three unequivocal answers: firstly, that the Member States may not decide on labour-market matters; secondly, that employees may not resort to disputes which disrupt the internal market - thus the Court takes away from workers their only effective means of defending the principle of equal pay for equal work; thirdly, companies which establish themselves in EU countries with lower levels of pay get the right to send employees to other countries to work for the same low wages.
Trade union organisations, political organisations, non-governmental organisations and millions of ordinary people have recognised the possibility of a People's Europe, but when will the Commission and the Council also recognise it?
(NL) President Barroso has spoken about inflation.
Inflation is a spectre that once again haunts the Member States.
At 3.2%, it is currently well above the 2% target, and this is a worrying development, a development that is stimulated by pay increases, as in the Netherlands.
Last year's debate in preparation for the spring summit was dominated by the reforms to the welfare state. That was perfectly reasonable.
The welfare states had become untenable.
Several Member States have dealt advantageously with this and are now in a better position.
However, Mr President, the outlook is not good.
Inflation is too high; the cost of raw materials is on the increase; and recently the central banks have had to avert a credit crisis in the financial markets with extensive loans.
Consumer confidence now has to recover.
Last week Mr Trichet said that, in accordance with the monetary policy stance, the European Central Bank would continue in its aim of maintaining stability, and the European Central Bank must do independently what the new French boss of the International Monetary Fund also claims.
It is, however, at the discretion of the Member States to support this policy by ensuring wage increases are controlled.
Can the President of the Council indicate which additional measures the Council will take in order to turn the tide?
Can we expect measures to check the already over-accelerated wage increase?
Thank you very much.
(DE) Mr President, it appears that one topic for discussion at the spring summit will be the Mediterranean Union, for which neither the structure nor the framework nor even the funding has been clarified as yet.
This discussion might perhaps sideline other economic issues such as implementation of the Lisbon Strategy or how to stimulate the economy in the face of the international financial crisis.
First of all we had the Baltic Council, then a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
Marine regions are therefore working together in a variety of ways.
However, the argument that a Mediterranean Union will strengthen governmental cooperation, with a view to countering illegal immigration, is a specious one in my opinion.
It would also be wrong to provide further financial support for African states under the mantle of promoting neighbourhood relations, without laying down conditions.
African countries of origin and transit for innumerable economic refugees have, after all, been pocketing vast quantities of development aid, often without showing the slightest willingness to take back their own nationals.
In general, therefore, financial assistance must be coupled with the conclusion of an agreement to take back illegal refugees or packages of measures to prevent illegal migration.
(NL) Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the agenda of the spring summit we find an almost complete list of the socio-economic and ecological challenges facing our generation: that is, if we want to take responsibility for those who come after us in a time of globalisation, climate change, technological advances and an ageing demographic.
Without doubt we are responsible for the objectives and the approaches necessary to achieve this, and of course we expect everyone to do what they have said they will do and that sufficient pressure will be exerted at all political levels to achieve results.
As group coordinator for the Lisbon Strategy I want to say how much we value the fact that the Commission has presented the Community Lisbon Programme.
Each of the 10 points gets our full support, and the same goes for the announcement of the Small Business Act.
This is on condition, however, that the Small Business Act pays more than just lip service to SMEs.
This Act, Mr President, must therefore become more than the SME Charter, which was approved in Santa Maria da Feira some years ago.
To do its job, the Small Business Act must ensure that the best possible operating environment is created for SMEs, and that applies to very small, small and medium-sized enterprises.
To this end, one condition is absolutely necessary and must apply at every stage, to substantive measures or mere simplification measures: think small first.
Take the SME as the point of departure and not as an exception, and let us take this as a binding criterion so that it at last becomes more than just a slogan.
It is only in this way that we will truly succeed in getting through to the firms that form the bulk of our business environment, but, more importantly, that provide the greatest number of jobs and the jobs that are currently being created.
It would be a very good thing, Members of the Commission and of the Council, if tomorrow at the spring Council this binding principle could be agreed upon once and for all.
Thank you for your attention.
(FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the spring summit, the economy is in turmoil, markets are deregulated, stock markets are crashing, growth is falling.
That is international capitalism for you, creating wealth or destroying value at the whim of the markets, speculative bubbles, financial derivatives and crazed traders who, by the way, are merely doing what they are asked to do, i.e. obtain the maximum profit in the minimum time.
However, though the markets are that way, no human society can live like that.
At any rate, it is this phenomenon that may give Europe its very meaning in this globalised market: a Europe that obviously cannot completely escape this turmoil, a Europe that is itself one of the main players in globalisation, often to its benefit, but that largely finds in globalisation its meaning and vocation to counterbalance crazed capitalism through public regulation, economic stabilisation, active public policies to support growth in the real economy, support for public and private investment in research, innovation, and European infrastructure.
The monetary policy, for instance, ought to protect stability, which it does, but it also ought to stimulate growth and adjust parity in the best possible fashion to defend our exports, although as things stand today this is unfortunately not yet the case.
Finally and above all, our group stresses that the EU must counterbalance this destabilised high-finance economy with effective social protection, solid public services and guaranteed social rights for workers.
Mr President, Europe must now take much more action to anticipate and protect: it cannot merely act as an internal market within the vast overall market.
It must be more socially aware.
That is also the way to recover the support and trust of its citizens.
We now support the Lisbon Strategy, a strategy fundamentally based on these three pillars, which you have already mentioned here, but your words must be matched by action, by real EU policies; otherwise your social intentions will remain a dead letter.
That is why we have called for a revision of the guidelines since they can be used to pilot the project. We specifically ask you, however, for it is the substance that is important here, to relaunch the European social agenda.
There must be, for instance, a Commission reaction to the Laval case.
It must use its powers of initiative to propose a revision of the Posting of Workers Directive.
There must be a truly ambitious revision of the European Works Councils Directive to allow social dialogue in major groups facing restructuring to be utilised effectively and in a timely fashion. There must be a revision, a real adaptation of the Working Time Directive to combat opt-outs and abuse of excessive working hours.
The Temporary Work Directive must be adopted in order to combat casual employment.
You must launch an ambitious lifelong learning programme so that this fifth pillar, this fifth fundamental freedom, is not just reserved only for an elite, but enables all people to fulfil effectively their own potential as workers to enable them to adapt to changes in the economy and the job market.
Mr President of the Commission, this is our message: use your power of initiative to help the Council to adopt an ambitious programme for a social Europe.
(SV) Mr President, it is difficult to take responsibility for Europe's future.
We must cope with globalisation and the competition to which it gives rise.
We must cope with difficult questions of demography, with a pensioner boom and a declining population going forward to 2020, the year we are to achieve the environmental and climate goals we have set, i.e. the 20-20-20 targets.
We must ensure that we have economically sustainable development in Europe.
I am glad, when we discuss matters arising from the Lisbon Strategy, that it represents a comprehensive approach to sustainable economic development, economic growth, environmental responsibility and socially responsible policy.
We see that combined efforts are giving results.
That is good.
We also see that a combined strategy is of the utmost importance.
The cooperation that has been launched between the European Parliament and the national parliaments is immensely important.
I would like to draw attention to the new area which has been included in this year's resolution, namely transport policy, on which much depends when it comes to the climate targets and growth.
We have a situation in which we shall be able to create more jobs in Europe through an effective, sustainable and environmentally compatible transport policy.
The fact is that the various policy areas hang together.
There is no point in making pronouncements on the 20-20-20 targets in climate policy when they are not also reflected in the Council's resolution on the Lisbon Strategy.
I therefore hope that, when we see the results of the spring summit, we find a comprehensive policy which responds to both economic growth and the climate policy.
That, my friends, is a challenge!
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council must take a serious look at the global financial turbulence.
Euroland seems to be reeling under pressure from waves of money fleeing from Italian, Greek, Spanish and French bonds to take refuge in German ones.
The spread between Italian and German bonds has risen to more than 63 basis points, as it did in 1999 when Italy seemed unlikely to be able to comply strictly with the Maastricht criteria.
Only yesterday, at a sale of Treasury bonds in Italy, there were very few bids.
The Telegraph reported on 6 March that a major investment bank, which speculated by means of arbitrage between the buying and selling rates for Italian bonds and credit derivatives, had been forced to liquidate all of its bonds.
The Italian Treasury had to intervene to support the value of the bonds.
There have for some time been rumours in the world of high finance about Italy exiting from the euro.
Is there any truth in this?
Europe is weak, and the national governments need to redouble their efforts to tackle such grave problems, instead of the tired, pointless measures proposed by technocrats in Brussels; the governments must intervene as necessary rather than resorting to outdated solutions such as tax cuts and injections of liquidity.
You should listen instead to the voice of the people and local communities!
Let us return to the real economy and give workers a stake in the share ownership of their companies!
(FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, spring summits leave a bad taste in my mouth.
It is true that we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Europe, and it is good to remember these things.
However, gentlemen, I also remember the Gothenburg summit, which was an enormous ecological victory because the Heads of State or Government reached an agreement to hold the spring summit to take stock of the sustainable development of our EU policies in the fields of environmental health, health and social integration.
In Europe, for example, Mittal-Arcelor, the energy-intensive organisation par excellence, is set to cut 600 jobs amid monster profits, and the EU is poised to give it free greenhouse gas emission quotas.
Our citizens are now distraught and our young people anguished by the legacy we are bequeathing them.
Gentlemen, you are announcing a revolution when you propose, for instance, that greenhouse gas emissions ought to be reduced by 20%.
We know this is well below what has to be done.
For example, Lester Brown, who visited us last week, was choked by emotion as he told us emissions would have to be reduced by 80% between now and 2020 if there is to be any chance of reversing the trend.
Therefore, gentlemen, I do not believe in your project: it is well below what is required, and is totally inadequate for the environmental crisis endangering the entire planet.
- (EL) Mr President, now the European Parliament is celebrating its 50th anniversary, I was expecting the representatives of the Commission and the Council to come here with greater sincerity and modesty.
Instead of mutually congratulating and praising each other, and embellishing reality, I should like them to talk about their failures and about the problems preoccupying European citizens.
During the past years social inequalities have increased and poverty has increased.
As for the Lisbon targets - they are the ones you set, Mr Barroso, but you are not listening to me because you are talking to your colleague - you forget the social cohesion and environmental protection targets, Mr Barroso!
In Kosovo, you are forgetting the UN and international law!
As for you, representatives of the Council, rather than ambitiously promote the Barroso package on climate change, you are trying to waste it.
This is what I was expecting you to say, rather than congratulate each other.
(NL) I am very surprised that the situation in Turkey has not been placed at the top of this week's agenda.
It has hitherto always been stated that the process of negotiation with Turkey would take place in parallel with the progress of Turkish reforms.
Well, the reverse has proved to be the case.
The reform process has almost completely ground to a standstill, but the negotiations simply go ahead.
All we can tell is that Turkey is piling up the provocations.
Freedom of expression is formally obstructed under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code.
The Turkish Government had agreed to scrap or at the very least reform this article by the end of the year, but nothing has been done.
It also laconically let it be known that there was a higher priority, namely the suppression of the ban on headscarves in universities.
The Islamisation and the stealthy phasing-out of the current state apparently take precedence.
Then the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan, went to Germany to remind the Turks living there not to adapt too well and to demand the establishment of Turkish universities in Europe.
Mr Erdogan conducted himself like a victorious commander coming to inspect his troops in occupied territory.
Furthermore, Turkey has been bombing Northern Iraq for weeks.
Approximately 10 000 troops have invaded the country.
It is almost as if Croatia, another candidate Member State, were to attack Montenegro.
Of course that would be absurd, and nobody in the European Union would accept something like that, and yet apparently Turkey can do what it wants.
My question therefore, Mr President, is how long will the European Union continue to behave like a sort of shrinking violet in the negotiations with Turkey?
(PT) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it should be noted that since 2005, thanks to the current Commission, the Lisbon Strategy has shaken off its previous state of apathy.
I must therefore say to the President-in-Office of the Council that it is vital, as with the single currency and internal market, to give more responsibility to the Commission and allow it to be the pivot of the Lisbon Strategy, instead of continuing with the idea of intergovernmentalism, which has got us nowhere.
As for the education/research/innovation triangle, the simplistic solution of indiscriminately injecting money into research must be avoided.
Rather than scientific articles or fanciful ideas, we need better innovation, which is something quite different.
Innovation requires a culture that values entrepreneurship and those individuals prepared to take risks, who are precisely the ones who know how to make money from knowledge and not the other way round, in other words, throwing money around indiscriminately to see if knowledge appears.
As regards education, it is fundamental that we also create a culture of competitiveness and directed creativity.
We should firmly reject the easy solutions that hinder the future success of both individuals and companies.
As a result, Mr President, I welcome the Commission's proposals to encourage entrepreneurship, directed research, links between schools and business, creativity in the education system, demand and competitiveness.
However, more than this, I would say that the drive for innovation and the Lisbon Strategy can be summed up in two words: what Europe, business and universities must do is create value.
(DE) You have stated before this House, Mr President of the Commission, that you have moved closer to the European Parliament's way of thinking.
My specific question is this: in what respect has this move towards Parliament's stance led to any new emphasis, or to the setting of a single new priority in the economic and social policy guidelines that are to be adopted by the Council over the next couple of days?
I take a different view.
I think you are using the Council, which was not prepared to take up various ideas, as an excuse.
I think the Council is using as an excuse the messages that you, Mr Barroso, have been sending out for months, namely that no changes are needed.
I believe that this team effort has produced a policy-blocking cartel with a shared mantra: business as usual.
That is not, however, in the interest of the European people, it is not in the interest of European firms and it is not in the interest of the European Parliament, which has issued many resolutions calling for greater attention to be paid to the economic, social and environmental circumstances in the European Union.
As our own studies have shown, we are falling behind in terms of research and development.
We have remained at a level well behind that of the US.
We have been at this same level since the early 1980s, and in the meantime we have not only been left behind by Japan but we are being overtaken by the Chinese, whose R&D expenditure in the economic sector is now greater than that of companies in the European Union.
When will you waken up?
When will you adopt a positive attitude to the quality of finance and investment in the European Union, for the sake of the EU population?
It is high time!
Mr President, at last year's Spring Council, EU leaders signed up to a '20% by 2020' target for energy efficiency, but delivery of this target remains sluggish.
Parliament's report on the energy efficiency action plan exposed major failures in implementation of energy efficiency legislation.
In January, the Commission's first assessment of national energy efficiency action plans spoke of the gap between the political commitment to energy efficiency and actual delivery.
Energy efficiency underpins all the EU's targets on CO2 emissions, on renewables, on security of supply and on the Lisbon Agenda - all the things we have been discussing this morning.
Therefore, I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission would indicate what this year's Spring Council intends to do to improve performance on energy efficiency.
(PL) Mr President, the aims of the Lisbon Strategy were defined eight years ago.
The Lisbon Strategy's priority was to ensure that Europe developed at a faster rate than the United States, whilst also increasing sustainable employment.
Failure on both counts has been officially recorded.
There is clear lack of cohesion between the Lisbon Strategy and actual implementation of the common agricultural policy, for example.
One instance of this is the reform of the market in sugar.
In many cases, the European Commission has been pressing ahead with the reforms without considering the relevant social context.
By way of example I should like to refer to the case of the sugar factory at Lublin in Poland.
Contrary even to Union provisions, it is planned to make the entire staff of that factory redundant, to knock down all the buildings and to put modern facilities beyond use.
It is also planned to deprive growers in the entire region of their livelihood.
A one-off compensation payment will not resolve the employment problem.
Such actions run counter to the stated aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
Ridiculous measures of this sort certainly do not bring us closer to achieving the aims of that Strategy.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to broach a completely new topic which has not yet been mentioned, and recall the debate that took place in this House a month ago on the future of the cohesion policy and the link with two European documents: the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda.
That debate was unfortunately held without the presence of a Council representative.
The ministerial conferences that preceded our debate, under the German and Portuguese Presidencies of the Council, expressed a definite expectation that the Territorial Agenda would be discussed at the spring summit in order to lend greater political weight to the territorial dimension.
The particular background for this is that the territorial dimension has been incorporated into the Treaty of Lisbon as a new Community objective.
According to the documents accessible to me, however, the subject goes unmentioned.
Why is this?
Cohesion policy is the practical application of the principle of solidarity; it will therefore no doubt be with us, and occupy us, for longer than the Lisbon Strategy, which after all is to be successfully concluded by 2010.
- (EL) Mr President, the state is ceding the last area of regulation under its control.
The welfare state is being dissolved, the private sector is operating without hindrance, social benefits are being reduced and the institutional framework allows employers to hire and fire as they wish.
Meanwhile, working conditions are worsening because of flexible working hours, and as a result, workers are being sacrificed to competitiveness for the sake of mega-profits for capital.
Yet another European Council summit is to deal with the Lisbon Strategy, which is deemed to have failed and needs to be reviewed.
Convergence has never been achieved, at least for workers.
Lisbon and its satellites insist on supporting the Union's business-centred philosophy, while social policies continue to play second fiddle.
What we need is a radical reorganisation that places citizens back at the centre of the EU's interests; we need an anthropocentric strategy.
Mr President, the ratification of the renamed EU Constitution threatens the democratic legitimacy of the European project itself.
The peoples of France and Holland rejected the Constitution, yet it has now come back with a new name and with what Angela Merkel called 'cosmetic changes'.
Now the institutions and the Member States, including the Labour Government in the UK, are dishonestly pretending that these cosmetic changes justify breaking their promise of a referendum.
They do not, and the pretence that they do is a huge breach of faith with the people.
In Britain a campaign group has just undertaken an independently monitored postal ballot in 10 Westminster constituencies.
Over 150 000 voters responded: 88% wanted a referendum; 89% opposed the Treaty.
In six constituencies more people voted for a referendum than voted for their current Member of Parliament.
The people have spoken.
The Treaty cannot be legitimate without their consent.
The European Council must listen.
We must have a referendum.
(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, unlike the speakers from the Socialist Group I wish to commend the Commission for not having hastily altered its economic policy guidelines in these times of global uncertainty caused by the financial crisis.
This process forms an integral part of the post-Lisbon Strategy.
I wish to explicitly commend the Commission, because it is right.
The shortcomings in fact lie in implementation by the Member States, and the President of the Council should concentrate on these shortcomings in the Member States and not on what changes the Commission can make.
That is the problem.
When Mr Bullmann talks about a 'policy-blocking cartel', his criticism is completely unjustified.
Secondly, the opportunities of globalisation should be exploited and the risks minimised.
Mr Schulz said that poverty has increased.
That is just an illusion!
Europe is a model of prosperity!
Prosperity in Europe has risen; its distribution has changed.
History has taught us, however, what becomes of societies where there are no differences in distribution.
There has to be a certain difference in distribution to stimulate modernisation and dynamism.
That is surely undeniable.
Thirdly, on the subject of cutting red tape, not enough has happened in that respect.
We have a High Level Group, but nothing is heard of it any more.
Is it still functioning?
What are its interim findings?
When can we expect any?
We should like to know before the European elections.
My final point relates to finance market stability.
It is indeed true that the greed in the finance market is greater than the fear of disruption, and the Commission needs to take action in this regard.
It has already announced some plans.
On the subject of climate change, here, too, the Commission's primary duty is to persuade the Member States at the summit to abide by their earlier goals.
Certain Member States have in fact emitted far more CO2 than was ever authorised.
How can we effectively introduce new measures unless the sinners of today and past years are punished?
(SV) Mr President, like the Commission I am happy that there are more jobs and that productivity has increased.
However, as many have pointed out, there is another side to the coin.
Many of the new jobs are insecure and impossible to live from.
The possibilities for training are extremely unevenly distributed.
Some regions cannot keep up with development.
What is needed, therefore, is a social Europe which provides secure jobs with decent wages, which offers the same training opportunities to all and which also ensures that the development is good and even across the regions.
For a long time we have been debating flexicurity.
Now a model of flexicurity is being challenged by the European Court of Justice in the Laval case, which does not think that the system applied in Scandinavia is good enough.
It is challenged on the grounds that freedom of movement takes precedence over the right to strike.
It is also challenged on the grounds that the principle of equal pay for equal work should not apply.
It opens the door to social dumping, but not just that, it also means that firms which pay decent wages in accordance with agreements will have difficulty competing.
It can lead to protectionism. I share the Commission's view that we do not need protectionism.
It is therefore important for the Commission to make it clear that the principle of equal pay for equal work must apply and that we must have good social conditions throughout Europe, so that the tide of protectionism does not advance across the EU.
- (LT) I would like to speak about the coordination of economic policy.
The European Union is first and foremost an economic union based on moral values.
In the face of new challenges the European Union has to find ways of tackling them quickly and flexibly in order not to lose in the dynamism and competitiveness stakes.
Regrettably, the recent economic policy coordination mechanism (the Treaty of Lisbon, the economic policy framework) has a number of stages and is far from being efficient.
It impedes the development of the internal market - the main source of economic growth.
I am therefore of the opinion that the European Parliament and perhaps the Commission should present a proposal to the European Council to examine this mechanism with a view to making it more flexible, enabling it to react efficiently to challenges.
This would be the best way of guaranteeing the continuity of the economic policy, consolidating the reforms and enabling the EU economy to adapt to new challenges.
The reason why some of the new programmes do not work properly is because their economic viability in the globalised world was not ascertained beforehand.
Meanwhile, we are discussing climate change, energy strategy, etc., but all these means, as already mentioned, must be coordinated and their economic consequences evaluated.
Only then will they be viable.
(PL) Mr President, plans for the internal market in energy and gas are on the agenda for the forthcoming Council.
Separating ownership of energy and the distribution networks is a crucial issue regardless of who may be in power in the Kremlin.
Under Mr Medvedew, there will be no change in Russia's policy of energy blackmail towards Member States of the Union and neighbouring countries.
Saving energy and increasing the proportion of renewable energy consumed constitute only part of the solution to these problems.
The political aspect must be taken into account too if Europe's energy policy is to be fully implemented.
We must make it abundantly clear what we expect from Russia and from Gazprom by way of reciprocity.
Gazprom is a Russian monopoly with a presence in 16 Member States of the Union either as an energy supplier or as the owner of distribution networks.
If we do not impose any restrictions on this aggressive monopoly, the Treaty of Lisbon's provisions on energy solidarity may as well be shelved alongside fairy tales.
Mr President, is it not a little odd that when we are discussing how to make Europe more competitive in order to get more jobs that the discussion is leaning more towards the belief that jobs can be created through new regulations?
That is not the case.
I should like to disclose a secret to our Socialist friends here today: in order for there to be employees, there needs to be employers - there are no employees without employers.
Their main problem is that, they are so eager to believe that jobs can be created through regulations, they forget that the preconditions and opportunities for new enterprises and new jobs need to be created, because there is no bigger social failure than unemployment and there is no bigger social success than every new job we can achieve in Europe and in our Member States.
I would like to underline what the President said about achieving results through the Lisbon Agenda.
Let us not forget that the world is moving faster and we need to be more competitive; we need to be more entrepreneurial.
There are three things I would like him to consider at the European Council and later on.
Firstly, concerning red tape and better regulation: I would like him to report annually on the achievements of reducing red tape in order to show that he will reach the goal by 2012 of 25% less red tape than exists today.
I would like him to also ensure that the Services Directive is implemented fully in each Member State as soon as possible.
I would like him to ensure that we are facilitating new businesses through a more offensive and more active broadband policy.
I think our success in making Europe more competitive lies in making small and medium-sized enterprises able to act all over the internal market.
That is a job we need to do and he should take the first steps, together with the Slovenian Presidency, at the end of this week.
- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, as you know, next year will be the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.
This is even greater evidence that the EU is very much hoping to strengthen its competitiveness and meet the challenges of globalisation.
It has recourse to the 'knowledge triangle': innovation, the promotion of research, and education.
Community and national policies on employment and support for young people chiefly in the education sector ought to adhere to these ambitious targets.
They should make systematic and coordinated efforts at regional, national and Community level in order to release the EU's significant stores of knowledge and research potential.
Within this framework, however, I should also like to stress that the recognition of the free movement of knowledge - the 'fifth freedom' - is essential; this too should be emphasised at the European Council.
We also ought to recognise this significant initiative within this framework at Community level.
The Erasmus and Comenius programmes are at the heart of the initiatives.
Let us stress that the new programme, mainly the Erasmus Mundus, which allows both mobility outside the borders of the EU as well as mobility for doctoral students, is an initiative that will have Parliament's full support.
It is up to the Member States to step up coordination on the basis of the Bologna Process and make this mobility possible in practice.
- (LT) The discussion on the common energy policy and energy security started in 2006 in the wake of the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis, the consequences of which had an unfavourable impact on Europe.
Regrettably, we still have neither a clearly defined common energy policy, nor an external energy policy.
I hope the European Council will hold a thorough discussion on the issues of EU energy security, including that of Lithuania, in view of the plans to close the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in 2009.
With the closure of this power plant, Lithuania would become fully dependent on the only source - gas imported from Russia.
The rise in oil and gas prices will result in the electricity price in Lithuania more than doubling. Consequently, it will be disastrous for the country's households and general economy.
Furthermore, Russia is prone to manipulating energy supplies to pursue its political ambitions.
Lithuania has already experienced this.
On the basis of Article 37 and Protocol No 4 of the Treaty of Accession, I urge the Commission to help find a solution; one possibility would be to postpone the closure of the safe Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant.
