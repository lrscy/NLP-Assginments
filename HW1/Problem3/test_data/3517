I would now like to say a few words on the amendments discussed and prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
There, too, we are very close to consensus and it is true that the report was also adopted by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
However, I believe that three or four delicate issues remain that will have to be discussed tomorrow, and I would like to express my feelings in that regard; that is the role of the rapporteur.
First of all, there is the issue of whether to link the cases of Romania and Bulgaria.
Although they are, of course, linked in practice, they still need to be judged on their own merits.
I myself cosigned an amendment tabled by MrÂ Lagendijk on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, adding to paragraphÂ 3 a specific mention of the fight against corruption and of the transparency of the legal system, applicable both to MrÂ Van Ordenâs report and to mine.
A second very delicate and very important issue relates to adoption.
It is the subject of an amendment by BaronessÂ Nicholson, whose commitment to the law as adopted in Romania we all know.
To my mind, we perhaps need to put more emphasis on the interests of the child and on the legal framework of the UN, in addition to Romanian law, in resolving contentious issues arising from the moratoriumÂ â and, as rapporteur, I am aware of a number of such issues.
Several amendments have been proposed by MrÂ Wiersma and MrÂ Lagendijk.
I hope that we will adopt one or other of these amendments or reach a compromise between them.
Then there is the issue of minorities.
In my report, I proposed the idea of self-governance.
It was apparent from the discussions in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that many took the view that, while respect for minorities was vital, we should not be giving the Romanian Government orders regarding the method, the procedure or the practical form that this increased autonomy should take.
We must avoid meddling and try not to provoke conflicts through clumsy phrasing.
On this subject, too, a number of wordings have been proposed by MrÂ Wiersma, once again, or by BaronessÂ Nicholson.
Be it greater decentralisation or cultural autonomy, I hope that, here too, Parliament will be able to affirm the rights of minorities, particularly of the Hungarian minority, whilst remaining flexible.
Finally, we reached a consensus last week that this report should avoid mentioning the rumours regarding the secret activities of the CIA.
I still think that this progress report is not the place to express our very real concerns on this subject; it must deal with the accession and only with the accession.
For my part, I would like to thank all those who have worked on these accessions for the support they have given to this report.
I am delighted at how it has been improved by their judicious additions.
I think that we can do even more during the vote tomorrow morning and I hope that we will take another step towards the accession of Romania on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am glad to address the House again as regards the preparations of Bulgaria and Romania for accession to the Union.
Much has happened in the past year.
Negotiations were completed at the end of 2004, and Parliament gave its assent to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, after which the accession treaty was signed in April.
Currently, the treaty is being ratified in the Member States.
Our focus, in the Commission and, I trust, in the other institutions, such as Parliament, is now firmly on encouraging and supporting Bulgaria and Romania to successfully complete all necessary preparations for accession.
Neither country should spare any effort or time in completing the challenging work still to be done on the domestic front.
I welcome the active part played by the European Parliament and its Committee on Foreign Affairs and the reports prepared by Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden, which highlight the strong and weak points relating to the progress of both countries to date.
As you have seen from the Commissionâs comprehensive monitoring reports, which I presented to you on 25Â October, our assessment is broadly the same: both Bulgaria and Romania meet the political criteria.
At the same time, they need to make further efforts, in particular to strengthen the rule of law, to improve public administration and the justice system, to fight corruption and to protect vulnerable groups effectively.
Structural economic reforms need to be continued in both countries for them to meet the economic criteria for membership fully.
As regards the EU , both Bulgaria and Romania have continued to make progress in adopting and implementing EU legislation.
They have reached a considerable degree of alignment 13Â months before their envisaged accession on 1Â January 2007.
Nevertheless, in some areas there are still serious shortcomings in preparations and, in general, more attention needs to be paid to effective implementation and enforcement of the legislation.
So, it is far from plain sailing for the moment.
Bulgaria and Romania still have a lot more to do and it is important that we, together â Parliament, the Member States and the Commission â keep reminding both countries to stay focused on the significant internal work still to be done.
On 7Â November, I sent a letter to both Foreign Ministers Kalfin and Ungureanu, in which I urged Bulgaria and Romania to take immediate and decisive action to address the gaps and shortcomings in their preparations.
As regards the remaining issues in Bulgaria and Romaniaâs preparations, the Commission will continue both to monitor and support them intensively up to accession.
I welcome Parliamentâs help and efforts in this regard.
Our next rendezvous on this topic will be to discuss a report focusing on the actions taken by Bulgaria and Romania to address the main remaining shortcomings that were identified in Octoberâs comprehensive monitoring report.
The Commission intends to present this report to Parliament and to the Council in May 2006.
At that moment, the Commission may recommend that the Council postpone accession until 1Â January 2008, if there is a serious risk of either country being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership by January 2007 in a number of important areas.
As President Barroso promised earlier this year, and in the spirit of our discussions in April to create an extended assent procedure, the Commission will use its regular dialogue with the European Parliament and will listen to Parliamentâs views on the possible use of the postponement clause.
The Commission would seriously consider these views before issuing any recommendation to associate fully the European Parliament in any possible decision to postpone accession.
I am ready to meet the Foreign Affairs Committee in the course of the spring, for instance in April, to exchange views on the situation then in Bulgaria and Romania.
Let me conclude by thanking the European Parliament for its constructive and balanced approach towards Bulgaria and Romaniaâs accession to the European Union.
This has again been illustrated in the very sound, solid reports from Mr Moscovici and MrÂ Van Orden.
The Commission always welcomes the strong commitment of Parliament in the accession process and its close follow-up of developments in Bulgaria and Romania.
I trust that together we will complete the fifth enlargement round and make a success of it.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me begin by paying generous tribute to the work of both Mr Van Orden and Mr Moscovici for their work on these dossiers as rapporteurs and also by saying what a particular pleasure it is to follow Commissioner Rehn, who has been a dedicated and effective advocate of taking forward the work both for Bulgaria and Romaniaâs accession.
I warmly welcome this debate today, which is held at an important juncture in Bulgaria and Romaniaâs accession processes.
From previous exchanges with honourable Members, I know that this Parliament maintains a close and detailed interest in both countriesâ European Union preparations and wider enlargement issues.
I look forward to a stimulating and thought-provoking discussion this afternoon.
The December 2004 European Council concluded that both Bulgaria and Romania will be able to assume all the obligations of membership from January 2007, provided they both continue with efforts to implement the necessary reforms and commitments undertaken in the .
The June 2005 European Council reiterated these conclusions and welcomed the signing of Bulgaria and Romaniaâs accession Treaty in Luxembourg on 25Â April.
As the Council noted, this marked a further important step towards accession, and it was a step firmly supported by this Parliament when it voted to approve the signing of the Treaty.
It is not difficult to see why the European Parliament and the Council have supported Romania and Bulgariaâs European Union aspirations.
The prospect of EU membership has acted as a major lever for reform already.
Since they started on the path to EU membership, both Bulgaria and Romania have implemented far-reaching political and economic changes.
Living conditions and economic opportunities have improved.
In the space of only 16Â years, two dictatorships have been supplanted, I am glad to say, with democracies.
These are substantial achievements by any measure and we should credit those who have worked so hard to bring them forward.
The stage is now set for full membership, something that will bring us much closer to healing the artificial division of Europe after the Second World War.
It will contribute to a more stable, secure and stronger Union.
Neither Bulgaria nor Romaniaâs accession processes are yet complete.
Indeed, as Commissioner Rehn has emphasised and emphasised previously in July, it is crucial to the success of enlargement that any new country joining the Union is well prepared to cope with the obligations of membership.
As the Commissioner made very clear in his public statement in October, the jury is still out on when Bulgaria and Romania will join.
It is in all of our interests that Bulgaria and Romania are ready to join the European Union on 1 January 2007, as has already been suggested in the course of our debate.
This goal is achievable as long as both countries step up the pace of reform in the short period of time left between now and that critical date.
The comprehensive monitoring reports identify clear areas where both countries must now focus their efforts.
The report on Bulgaria shows that it meets the political criteria for membership, but further work is still needed to address remaining shortcomings.
These include taking decisive action to reform the justice system and substantially stepping up the fight against organised crime and corruption, including at a high level.
Pursuing reforms of the public administration system should also be a priority.
In the area of human rights and the protection of minorities, more efforts are needed to prevent the trafficking in human beings, a subject on which this Parliament has repeatedly made clear its views, as well as to improve child welfare and the situation of the mentally disabled and to further the integration of the Roma minority generally.
The Commission also assesses that Bulgaria should be in a position to comply with the economic criteria of accession, provided it continues on its current reform path and deals with the current account deficit.
To this end, it should seek to maintain a prudent fiscal policy, improve the business environment and pursue accelerated labour market reforms.
On the adoption and implementation of the , the report notes that Bulgaria has made further progress in particular on competition rules and culture and audiovisual policy.
However, developments in a number of other areas have been frankly insufficient.
Generally, Bulgaria needs to step up its efforts to complete preparations and to develop a sufficient administrative and judicial capacity to implement and enforce our Unionâs legal order in full.
I mentioned some particularly pressing implementation gaps earlier, such as the need to tackle corruption and organised crime effectively.
Other concerns relate to the implementation of the European Unionâs external border requirements and procedures, police cooperation and the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in order to fight piracy and the broader issue of counterfeiting.
The weak enforcement of rules on motor vehicle insurance also remains an issue of serious concern, as are shortcomings in the areas of agriculture, animal welfare, veterinary public health and food safety.
Turning to Romania, the Commission assesses that she meets the conditions for membership, but further work is still needed to address remaining shortcomings.
Romania needs to take decisive action to reform the justice system and substantially step up the fight against corruption, including at a high level.
It should also pursue reforms of the public administration system and further efforts are needed to improve the situation of the disabled and mentally ill, a topic which I know is close to this Parliamentâs heart.
I would agree with the Commissionâs assessment that Romania should be in a position to comply with economic criteria by accession, provided it continues and intensifies its efforts, in particular by paying attention to its external balance, public sector wage policy and the governmentâs revenue base.
Romania has made further progress in adapting and implementing the , in particular on areas concerning the free movement of persons, telecommunications and consumer protection.
However, shortcomings remain in other areas.
Generally, as with Bulgaria, Romania needs to step up its efforts to complete preparations and to develop a sufficient administrative and judicial capacity to implement and enforce the European Unionâs legal order in full.
It too needs to tackle corruption, including high-level corruption.
As with Bulgaria, Romania must address concerns over the implementation of the European Unionâs external border requirements and procedures, and concerns over the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights.
A number of grave shortcomings that need to be swiftly and decisively addressed also relate to the area of agriculture and food safety and to the protection of the environment.
The first months of next year will be crucial periods in Romaniaâs accession process.
Romania has made substantial progress to reach this stage.
I clearly acknowledge that before this Parliament today.
However, it must now renew its efforts to tackle those remaining concerns.
Bulgaria must also in the first months of the year focus all its efforts on addressing its remaining shortcomings.
The Commissionâs report provides an effective roadmap, identifying clearly the key weaknesses, and should help guide Bulgariaâs approach.
Bulgaria too has made substantial process to reach this stage.
The finishing-line is now in sight and Bulgaria will cross it, as long as it increases its efforts and implements those outstanding reforms.
This will require hard work, but it will be well worth it.
The European Union will continue to provide any assistance and support to both Bulgaria and Romania in their endeavours to make that final push towards accession.
I hope that accession in 2007 will be achieved by both Romania and Bulgaria.
That accession will bring real benefits to both countries and â I would argue â clearly to the European Union as a whole.
As my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said to this Parliament in June, enlargement is an historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful Union.
I hope that this time next year both Romania and Bulgaria will be only a fortnight away from becoming full members of our European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, just a month and a half ago we talked in this Chamber about Romaniaâs accession to the European Union.
Then it was to discuss the report presented by the Commissioner, Mr Rehn.
We are doing so again today in order to discuss the report which this Parliament will approve tomorrow and which I hope will receive full support.
There is a fundamental coincidence between the two reports.
Much significant progress has been made in Romania, but efforts are still needed in several areas, which we are all aware of and which have been mentioned today.
The two reports also coincide on one fundamental point: it is very important that progress be made in the field of justice and home affairs, particularly with regard to the implementation of the reform in the justice system, better border controls and the fight against corruption, the latter being an essential issue and one on which Parliament wants to see results.
There is another significant coincidence between the Commissionâs report and the Moscovici report: these are decisive times.
As the Commissioner has said, in the spring the Commission will produce a report on Romaniaâs degree of preparedness and give its opinion on the possible creation of a mechanism that could delay effective accession by one year.
This Parliament will then also issue its opinion on this issue, as laid down in the text that we will vote on tomorrow.
We want to be closely involved in this issue.
The results in the field of justice and home affairs and the fight against corruption will be very important in this springâs assessment.
The Romanian Government must therefore carry on making the greatest possible effort in this and other areas.
The example of the successes achieved in the field of competition policy, which was previously an issue of immense concern, must serve to stimulate the work still to be done.
Mr President, it is true that the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria should not fall victim to the new climate of crisis and fatigue amongst the citizens demonstrated by the failures relating to the Constitutional Treaty.
But we must be realistic; that climate exists and it is difficult for it not to affect the Members of this Parliament, who are close to the citizens and who will be watching the degree of preparation of the two countries very closely.
In summary, Romania has an historic date with the European Union on 1 January 2007.
As the report states, Parliament is reiterating its desire for this to take place, but it also stresses that achieving that objective depends, firstly, on the Romanian authorities fulfilling their commitments.
We support and applaud the efforts they are making to get there on time and to achieve their goal, but that is a job for the Romanian authorities.
Â Â  .
I would like to welcome the work of both rapporteurs. One of my reasons for doing so is that as a Hungarian MEP I have been following the efforts of these two countries and the assessments of Parliament and Commission day by day since I joined Parliament.
With a few amendments, I am happy to say that both reports are balanced and accurately reflect the current situation of the two countries.
I do not wish to repeat the statements of those who spoke before me nor the criticism given by the Council and the Commission, because, as I already mentioned in October, during the debate following the country report of the Commission, the observers from the two countries are here in order to be able to provide a first-hand report to their decision makers both on deficiencies and on the desirable decisions proposed by Parliament.
In the course of the debate this morning, during the preparation of the summit that will take place this weekend, it became unequivocally clear that all Groups of Parliament emphasised the importance of solidarity throughout the European Union, because this is the only way we can maintain our competitiveness.
As the two rapporteurs have also mentioned, the importance of solidarity must be emphasised even more in the case of the two countries under discussion.
As a Hungarian I cannot avoid mentioning the situation of Hungarians living in Romania.
I expect the Romanian Government to adopt the Minority Act specified in the Coalition Agreement as soon as possible, as promised.
I know that all those present in the House are already aware of this, but I still have to emphasise the importance of cultural autonomy, which forms the basis of the above-mentioned law.
This is the law that, when adopted and observed, will be able to ensure the harmonious coexistence of the minority and majority living in Romania in the long term.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Liberal Group is appreciative of the progress that Bulgaria and Romania have made in their efforts to draw closer to the European Union.
We shall continue to support both countries as they progress along this road, while also observing very closely the manner in which they discharge their responsibilities as candidates.
As my group has repeatedly emphasised, both countries must be judged on the basis of their own performance and independently of one another.
The Commission will be producing its next progress report on the two countries early next year, and, as Mr MillÃ¡n Mon has remarked, it will be doing so in a changed climate, one brought about by the constitutional crisis in which the EU finds itself.
The debate on this will be held in mid-2006.
That makes all the more important the two countriesâ efforts, now that they are on the final straight, to become as efficient as possible and to perform as well as possible, for those are the sort of Member States that the European Union needs.
There is also the issue to the EUâs capacity to absorb new members and, associated with it, that of the future of enlargement policy.
It is worthy of note that the debate in the Council on Macedonia is a symptom of this changed climate.
Let me just say a few things with specific reference to Bulgaria.
Here we have a balanced document from MrÂ Van Orden, which gives the Bulgarian Government credit for its efforts and, while highlighting the countryâs economic dynamism and average 4% growth rates, spells out in clear terms where Bulgaria still needs to make progress.
One important aspect of the text from the Committee on Foreign Affairs is that it calls on high-ranking civil servants in Bulgaria to make public their renunciation of every kind of corruption and to support the enactment of regulations to disclose their incomes and financial arrangements.
This would make for greater transparency and enhance trust in them.
The Liberal Group would like to see Romania and Bulgaria become Member States of the EU in 2007.
I might add that I believe that we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while acknowledging the efforts made by both these countries, we are concerned by some of the points of criticism made in the Commissionâs report.
We tabled amendments to the Van Orden report relating to the environment and human rights, but they were, unfortunately, rejected.
Turning to the deadline for the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant at Kozloduj, I would like to ask Commissioner Rehn what the Commission thinks about paragraph 29, which allows for greater flexibility with regard to the closing down of Blocks 3 and 4.
To what alternative sources of energy is it giving consideration?
This House has been involved in the deliberations on the use of the safeguard clauses; we will take a critical view of accession and will base our decision on the extent to which reforms have been implemented in the justice system, in the fight against corruption, in the protection of children and in the integration of the Roma.
Â Â  . Mr President, although Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accessions have already been the subject of a vote, the disappointing situation in those countries can cause delays of one year.
My group has tabled a number of amendments on this score, including Amendment 7, about the continued extortion engaged in by the police and customs to the detriment of EU citizens of Turkish origin travelling through Bulgaria.
The developments within the European Union itself are also hampering further enlargement, though.
France is threatening to veto negotiations with Macedonia, a country cooperating closely with Croatia in the hope of joining simultaneously with it.
The possible approval of ex-Commissioner Bolkensteinâs services directive means that the economic discrepancies between the Member States will become a competitive factor.
This causes public opinion in the current Member States to turn itself against further enlargements.
The people in the Netherlands and France who voted against the proposed Constitution are opposed to the neoliberal policy that destroys their welfare provisions and takes away their social security.
There are now forces both in and outside of governments who wrongly interpret this as an aversion to payments from regional funds to countries with a low standard of living.
If we want further enlargement, we will need to ensure that those problems are resolved in good time.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Polish people are particularly sympathetic to the EU ambitions of Bulgaria and Romania, and they have always supported these countries in their efforts towards European integration.
This is not only because of our geographical proximity, but also because we have shared a difficult history over recent decades.
We continue to follow the progress of political and economic reforms in both countries very closely, and with every hope that they will be successful.
I should like to make it known, however, that I have grave doubts about whether it will be possible to fulfil both countriesâ hopes of joining the European Union.
The British Presidencyâs proposal for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective makes no provision for the costs of the new enlargement.
Contrary to the statements by its politicians, the EU will not be able to make good on its earlier commitments.
What this also means is that there will be nowhere near enough EU funding available to create a level playing field for Bulgaria and Romania in development terms, both before and after they join the EU.
This can be taken as yet more proof that the EU principle of solidarity has been a dead letter for many years.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
I have already made my support for Romaniaâs accession clear on more than one occasion.
I am sad to see, however, that no progress has yet been made on the issue of the international adoptions that were pending at the time of the 2001 moratorium, despite Parliamentâs repeated recommendations and the statements of willingness from the government in Bucharest.
On 14Â January 2005, to be specific, the Romanian Prime Minister assured the Italian press that all pending cases of international adoption would be analysed one by one by a committee of international experts.
To date, however, as far as I know, neither the families involved nor the European Union itself have been informed about the working partyâs procedures or the conclusions it has reached.
When I asked the European Commission, it was unable in fact to offer me any clarification, and I was also disappointed with the replies I received from Commissioner Rehn to my enquiries.
He defended the current Romanian law, which nobody is questioning, without giving any undertaking to resolve the cases that were pending prior to the entry into force of that law, as expressly requested by Parliament.
I myself have also addressed the Romanian Government through its ambassador in Brussels, but it has not given me any useful information or cooperation either.
I have today written a letter to the observers here, informing them of this, in the hope that they will take my appeal into serious consideration.
Europe has always been willing to help the candidate countries and human rights cases throughout the world, but perhaps for once it deserves greater recognition, when what is in fact quite a simple request is denied like this.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Romania and Bulgaria are among the twelve countries to which we extended an invitation after the Wall and the barbed wire were brought down.
Whatever other considerations we may now have in mind, we must not forget that they are among that number, and that it is for that reason that they form part of a package.
The Treaty has been concluded, but the treaties with these countries are equipped with safeguard clauses.
That is what makes it of the utmost importance that we should look to see how the timetable is adhered to, and how the Commissionâs report is presented early next year.
It is on the basis of this reportâs assessment and of our own conclusions that we will then have to take a decisions as to whether these safeguard clauses, which provide for a delay of one year, should actually be applied, and whether, as can be the case, they should apply to both countries, to neither of them, or to one of them.
Nothing has been decided, but we should be clear in our own minds about the need for the public not to get the impression that there is anything automatic about it, in other words, that if you start negotiations, you get in automatically on the date you want.
Hence the need for implementation in the areas mentioned by the Commissioner in his last report and in his letter â dated 9 November, I believe â to the governments of the two countries, and to which the President-in-Office made reference here today, namely corruption, organised crime, border security, food safety within the European single market, consequences for the internal market itself, the rule of law and the development of administration and the justice system.
The Commission, and Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden, with the reports they have presented today, deserve our gratitude for pointing out that this is not just about setting these things down in the form of laws.
What we need to do now is to exert the necessary pressure and provide the necessary support in order that these countries can meet the conditions, but accession is conditional upon their doing so, and whether or not they make the necessary progress is entirely in their own hands.
Â Â  Mr President, our group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has always been an unfailing advocate of the European Unionâs enlargement by countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession will complete the fifth enlargement round, finally bringing to an end the division in Europe that lasted for decades.
Just like the accession of ten new Member States last year, we want Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession to be a success, not only for the people of those countries, but also for the European Union.
My group believes that both countries are capable of taking, and implementing, all the necessary measures before the final accession.
The Commissionâs progress reports give an indication of what still needs to happen.
The areas of concern and criticism are, above all, a guidebook for those countriesâ governments and parliaments to take the necessary measures in the time that is left.
We assume that both countries will make every effort and take action in order to achieve the objectives for EU membership in January 2007.
They need to give more attention to the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as to the reinforcement of the judiciary.
In addition, the European Parliament, in its reports, highlights the importance of the position of the Roma in both countries.
In April of last year, we gave our formal blessing to Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession.
At that time, 20 months before the planned date of accession, we did this in the full knowledge that considerable progress needed to be made in important areas in both countries.
The inclusion of a safeguard clause which makes it possible to move the date of accession back one year was important in this respect, as well as the pledge by the Commission and Council to involve Parliament fully in the decision as to whether this safeguard clause should apply or not.
We think there is every reason to be moderately optimistic that both countries will be able to meet the prescribed requirements by the next assessment.
We will state our opinion on this in the spring of 2006.
One last point is, of course, our own readiness to enlarge.
Tomorrow and the day after, the EUâs post-2006 multi-annual budget will be discussed in the European Council, something that has already been discussed at length this morning.
I would like to stress once again that we share the responsibility of making Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accessions successful, and I would therefore urge the Heads of Government to consider this enlargement as one of their guiding principles in their decision-making, particularly in both debates tomorrow.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, two months after the last Commission and Council report on Romaniaâs level of preparation for accession to the European Union, we are once again examining the progress made.
We can agree on the fact that progress has been made, but it is undeniable that other conditions laid down in the accession treaty also have to be met, if accession is to be achieved in January 2007.
As the Moscovici report shows, today these areas still require a great deal of work.
That is the case, for instance, with freedom of expression, justice, the fight against corruption, antidiscrimination measures, child protection and the protection of people with mental health problems, the excessive use of force by the police authorities, industrial and domestic waste management, food safety and environmental protection, as well as the implementation of legislation on the return of properties.
That is not to mention â and here I absolutely underline what a fellow Member has already said â the international adoptions problem, to which no solution has been found even under the new law.
This law does not apply retroactively, but it has effectively blocked even those families who had already started adoption proceedings when the moratorium came into force.
MrÂ President, this is a question of human rights.
Denying a child a family, after the child has already hugged and come to know and love his or her potential adoptive parents, can in no way be justified; the childâs interests must remain paramount in all circumstances.
For that reason we called for an analysis of all the issues and all the situations by the committee that has been set up. Nevertheless, we have not received any response to date.
We also tabled an amendment in committee with MrÂ PodestÃ , which was subsequently taken up.
Further amendments have been tabled today by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
As the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe we shall support them, because we want the situation to be duly acknowledged by the Romanian authorities and a solution to be found to it.
I therefore believe that the observers, who have been here in Parliament since 26Â September, can very usefully help their government to fulfil the commitments it has made, including by exchanging experiences with colleagues from other countries.
Â Â  Mr President, the Verts/ALE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraphÂ 19 of the Bulgaria report.
Although the rapporteur welcomes practical measures taken to improve integration, key reforms to combat discrimination are still at the early stages.
Our amendment stresses that fact.
In other fields the situation is worsening.
The trafficking of children has doubled.
The good news is that 86Â Bulgarian institutions recently started legal proceedings against Mr Siderov, leader of the neo-Nazi party Ataka.
He will be brought to court for his hate speeches against Roma, Jews and Turks.
This initiative deserves our support.
However, if MEPs are not cautious in expressing themselves, they run the risk of being exploited by parties like Ataka.
Mr Van Ordenâs frequent use of the word âadaptâ made the rapporteur popular in Ataka circles.
I am going to show you the Ataka newspaper with a picture of Mr Van Orden and an article inside.
I think this is a sad day for Parliament.
Â Â  Â âÂ As of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007, Bulgaria and Romania will be EU Member States.
Some of the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Accession work to the advantage of these countries, whereas others are nothing short of discriminatory from the point of view of the first pillar.
After all, those of us from the new Member States have ample first-hand experience of such discrimination, an example of which is the establishment of the free movement of persons as an ideal from which the accession arrangements are far removed.
I am somewhat alarmed by the US administrationâs efforts to establish or take control of military bases in the Balkans, and by the relentless pressure to exempt US citizens from the jurisdiction of the Hague-based International Criminal Court.
The end result of negotiations on this matter should in fact be that the common interests of the EU Member States, including the new Member States, are given clear priority.
The reports pass over this issue.
Conversely, I believe that it is high time that negotiations were opened on energy security.
It is particularly important that such security be guaranteed in terms of electricity supply to the region that may be affected by the decommissioning of several blocks of the Kozloduj power plant, as mentioned by MrÂ HorÃ¡Äek.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would call on you once again to help ensure that the new Member Statesâ accession to the European Union proceeds smoothly.
We should not allow these countries to endure continued hardship after 1Â January 2007, confronted as they are by massive problems, caused by the pressure to privatise that has been exerted unscrupulously by external influences.
We should not forget that we are setting a precedent for negotiations with other Balkan states, and they should receive an appropriate welcome into the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, the Bulgarian customs officers still have a bad reputation for fleecing travellers.
In fact, travellers have now started to anticipate the officersâ behaviour, and so it is that, according to an official report by the Dutch Government published just one and a half weeks ago, many people crossing the Bulgarian border have a small amount of money tucked away in their passports that is intended for the Bulgarian customs officers.
According to one person in the know, it would certainly help if the Bulgarian media were to film the corrupt practices that go on at the border.
This may well be a piece of advice that the Commissioner will want to pass on to his Bulgarian opposite number.
The fact is that the Romanian authorities set just as much store by the fight against corruption.
What the Netherlands does regard as worrying, though, is the area of conflict that appears to exist between the wish to give the fight against corruption a public airing, both in terms of the EU and the population, and the detachment that simply needs to be displayed in court cases.
Does the Commissioner share this conclusion on the part of a Member States and if so, what concrete action is he considering taking with regard to the Romanian authorities?
After all, in this debate, we have discussed the fight against corruption and the reinforcement of the judiciary, although surely that creates an area of conflict?
The Commissioner knows this very well, given his Romanian expertise.
In short, the nascent Romanian judicial system should not be sacrificed on the altar of EU integration, for then we will miss the boat.
By way of conclusion, I should like to add a brief observation on the protection of intellectual property.
This is something for which we usually call China to account.
Mr Moscovici, in his report, is right to press Bucharest for this as well, for the Romanian shops are well-known for being stacked with counterfeit goods.
In a word, Bucharest has been asked to take action.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe Romania remains on track for accession by 1Â January 2007.
However, the new government must continue reforming the judiciary, upholding media freedom, enabling property restitution, protecting minorities and children and fighting organised crime.
Particular attention must also be paid to the reform of public administration and the fight against corruption, including delivery on the promise of indictments of high-level officials alleged to have committed serious offences.
The situation of disabled and mentally ill people is also of concern.
Romaniaâs control of its borders and collection of customs dues â with the settlement of the Snake Island dispute in the Black Sea â is important, as is improving food hygiene, environmental pollution and intellectual property protection.
However, Romaniaâs recent handling of the avian flu outbreak was excellent.
Romania continues to comply with the criterion of being a functioning market economy, but there are still concerns on state aid and bankruptcy laws.
Lastly, I want to raise the tragic issue of international adoptions, which affects hopeful parents from the European Union, the United States and Israel.
I urge the Romanian Government to consider concluding these adoptions, in particular the 1Â 100 pipeline cases of orphans and abandoned children for whom caring foreign families had registered adoption petitions prior to the January 2005 ban.
That ban was largely brought about at the request of the European Union, eager to clean up a previously chaotic and sometimes corrupt system.
The UN Convention on the Child does not forbid international adoption. It simply makes it the last permanent solution.
The Romanian Government should seriously reconsider the heartless position it is currently maintaining.
Â Â  Mr President, I first visited Romania for a skiing trip during the Christmas/New Year period in 1989.
The Romanian flags being waved then had holes where the symbol was cut out in the middle.
Sixteen years on, we have Mr Moscoviciâs report which shows quite amazing achievements and huge progress.
I speak now as one who has been a Member of the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee since 1994 and who has visited many times, seeing the significant advances, particularly in the fields of freedom of expression, justice, minorities and children.
What we are talking about is reuniting the people of Europe.
People who share a common culture, a common heritage, a common history and who have great linguistic links.
Romania is European in every sense; its mere name gives that away.
I look forward to the day when Romanian colleagues are in this Chamber as elected Members of this European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, the preparations of both Bulgaria and Romania for EU membership seem to be proceeding as expected.
Both countries have encountered problems, which can nevertheless be overcome.
It needs to be stressed that the accession of either country must be assessed on the basis of its own achievements.
Hopefully both countries can join the Union at the start of 2007.
The Union is both politically and institutionally prepared to accept Bulgaria and Romania as its members.
With regard to future enlargement, however, the situation is unclear. This is also evident from the fact that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has not reached consensus on the report on enlargement strategy.
Future enlargement and the reworking of the Treaties should be examined together.
Many are endeavouring to restrict future enlargement and believe that a Constitution which has been rejected in a national referendum should be put swiftly into effect.
This strategy is associated with debates on the Unionâs ability to accept more members and alternatives to full membership.
This is not a realistic path to follow: it will lead to a dead end.
The future has to be built on two fundamental facts.
Firstly, it is obvious that the Union will continue to expand vigorously, and, secondly, the Constitution has been rejected once and for all.
It would therefore be wise to start drafting a new Treaty more suited to an expanding Union and one that will have the approval of the citizens of the Member States.
The expanding Union may not be very close-knit, so we need more arrangements for closer cooperation.
As it expands, the Union thus needs to be internally differentiated.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, I should like to counsel meticulousness and appeal to you all to take our own criteria and procedures seriously.
This remark is addressed particularly to Members who already know that Romania will not make it next year.
They thought, or think, that Europe has, in the past, taken hasty decisions where enlargements are concerned and now believe that we should be somewhat stricter and that whatever Romania does, it will never be good enough.
It is also addressed to those Members who already know that Romania will succeed anyway, irrespective of the fact whether it will meet the conditions prescribed.
There is every reason for Parliament to remain critical to the last moment, particularly in the areas that are so sensitive and difficult as the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption.
These form the biggest problems not only in Romania, but in all candidate countries.
The questions that were asked six months ago are still crucial: is it, with the help of its very determined Justice Minister, managing to carry out the reform of the judiciary?
Will new people with new insights fill important positions?
Is it really possible to fight corruption at the highest level?
Those are questions to which we do not have to find the answers right now.
What matters now is for us to be focused, clear and unambiguous, to make it clear what we think should happen in Romania, and Judgment Day is set to fall in May 2006.
Â Â  Mr President, these reports state the wish of the majority in this Parliament to see Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union by 1Â January 2007.
However, these reports contain many instances detailing their total unsuitability to join according to the EUâs own membership criteria.
These reports highlight their levels of corruption, the proliferation of organised crime, and the need for the reform of their legal and economic systems among many other things.
It is unlikely that these countries will be able to transform themselves into the paragons of virtue they are supposed to be before they can join in one yearâs time.
But we all know that sadly it does not matter what state they are in. It does not matter what their levels of corruption and organised crime are.
They are going to be welcomed in anyway. Their membership is part of the grand plan for the creation of a United States of Europe, and all other factors are subordinate to that ambition.
Â Â  In spite of all the accusations voiced in the Romanian press and in many press briefings, I am not against the accession of Romania, I am not speaking out against the interests of Romania.
But â with deep respect for the population of Romania â I know that accession must be successful for each Romanian citizen.
This is their only chance to avoid missing the vitally important modernisation.
And the European Union constitutes a chance today, perhaps the very last chance for the population of Romania.
However, I believe that this chance must also be provided to the Hungarian community in Romania, who have already had their fair share of political window-dressing, but what they actually see is that only a few of the essential issues have been solved.
Please allow me to give an example.
When the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament votes that the situation of this community should be settled on the basis of European principles such as self-governance and subsidiarity, the Romanian Prime Minister asks the Liberal Group in Brussels to remove the principle of self-governance from the text and replace it with âcultural autonomyâ.
In the meantime, in the background, the two large government coalition parties â Liberal and Democratic â agreed in Bucharest on Monday to remove the essence of cultural autonomy from the draft Minority Act, robbing the minority community of all forms of self-governance.
They would remove from the rather unstable draft Minority Act the very essence for which it is being created, allowing no opportunity for dialogue.
This constitutes further evidence of the Romanian political window-dressing.
They say one thing to Europe, and do something else at home.
Could it be that they use the same political window-dressing in other areas, as well?
Regarding the issues of the Roma people, environmental protection, property restitution, corruption?
Please support me in ensuring that we adhere to our basic European principles, to our April resolution â and let us not amend paragraph 26 of the Moscovici report.
The report that we had voted for is good as it is, and Mr Moscovici deserves to be commended for it.
If we do not demand that these basic principles be implemented, no one else will do it in our place.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is a fact that Romania and Bulgaria have made significant progress in incorporating and applying the , thanks to consistent support in the enlargement strategy on the part of the European Union.
We welcome all these changes and reforms in the political, economic and social sectors.
Today both countries, Bulgaria and Romania, are at a critical stage and there are some real serious deficits.
The question of environmental protection, the question of external border controls, the question of the fight against organised crime, the safety of nuclear energy and food safety are questions which also worry and interest European citizens.
At a time when there is a crisis as regards the legitimacy of the enlargement strategy, the European Union must, for its part, remain constant in its decisions on the two countries, decisions which must not allow discounts in principle.
That would be a mistake for both countries and for the European Union.
For its part, the European Commission must help within the framework of the pre-accession strategy and within the framework of the programmes which exist for the transfer of Community know-how.
Finally, I should like to comment on two individual demands which particularly concern and worry European citizens: the first is the question of Bulgaria's obligation to respect the provisions and arrangements of the accession act on the safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power station and the second, for Romania, is the major humanitarian problem which has been generated with child adoption.
I believe and trust that the Romanian authorities, with respect for international law and with respect for Romanian law, will resolve this humanitarian problem, which is worrying adoptive parents in Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is good that the ground rules for the accession process should be clear and, in my view, they are indeed so.
There is no doubt whatsoever that both Romania and Bulgaria understand what is required of them.
During my visits to these two countries and my conversations with the people there, I have seen this for myself.
Everyone in Romania and Bulgaria knows that we are concerned about the remaining areas in which improvements are required.
Everyone knows perfectly well that we are watching them and monitoring every stage of development.
However, no one with whom I have spoken, from government representatives to people on the cafÃ© terraces, are as strongly convinced that we really want to see them join as early as 2007, despite our saying that we do and despite our saying so in our resolutions and reports.
Why is this the case?
Obviously, we are sending extremely clear signals about the negative things â problems, difficulties and requirements â but less clear signals of encouragement and appreciation and, above all, of the sincerity with which we shall welcome them.
What I mean is that it is good that we should carefully monitor the reforms that are implemented and the ways in which both Romania and Bulgaria fulfil the requirements for membership.
Given the repeated references in this Chamber to protection clauses, postponement of the accession, absorption ability and the debate on the EUâs external borders, I am afraid that the signal we are sending not only to Romania and Bulgaria but to the whole region is that Europe has been transformed into a colder place that is more closed in on itself.
That is not the Europe I know. It is not the Europe I fight and work for and defend.
I believe that all the reforms recently implemented by Romania and Bulgaria are testament to these countriesâ efforts and to the fact that they give high priority to their membership.
Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession to the EU will be a strong catalyst and a factor that will increase security throughout the region.
I am convinced that, with our help, these countries can successfully accede to EU membership no later than in January 2007.
I am also convinced that this is not possible without our help and support and without a positive perspective.
Â Â  Â Â Â I too should like to take this opportunity to call on the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities to step up the pace of their work and to speed up their preparations for joining the European Union.
Examples of areas where efforts need to be intensified include the functioning of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and the integration of minorities, including the Roma minority.
A very accurate account of these weak points is given in the Van Orden and Moscovici reports.
To my mind, compliance with these requirements and with the others that have already been mentioned today is of crucial importance, and there are two reasons why this is the case.
Firstly, these requirements must be met in order to make it possible for Bulgaria and Romania to become full members of the EU as of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
Secondly, and in my opinion equally importantly, they must be met so that both countries can continue to set a positive example to their neighbours, such as Macedonia or Serbia and Montenegro.
Both Bulgaria and Romania played a very positive role during the 1990s when war was raging in the Balkans, and acted as a stabilising force.
It is my firm belief that the two countries will continue to play such a role, and that they will set an example not only to their Balkan neighbours, but also to certain small-time politicians, most of whom hail from the old Member States, who are starting to lose heart and to cast doubt upon the very purpose of European enlargement.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too agree with everyone in this Chamber who has stressed that, only with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania on 1 January 2007 will the fifth enlargement be complete.
It is important that we remember this.
Throughout the accession procedure, both Bulgaria and Romania have achieved a great many things.
There are without doubt still a number of matters outstanding, but the fact that they have achieved this much illustrates the political will of both countries to honour the commitments which they made towards the European Union, so that they can become full and active members of the European family.
As far as Bulgaria is concerned, I have two comments to make: the first comment concerns the Kozloduy nuclear power station.
I believe that Bulgaria should honour the commitment it made when it signed the Accession Treaty and close units 3 and 4.
At the same time, however, I consider that Bulgaria needs help in filling the energy vacuum which will be created, help like that which is to be given to Slovakia, according to my sources, so that it can honour its commitments relating to nuclear energy.
My second comment concerns the strategic position of Bulgaria on the external borders of the European Union.
I believe that it is very important, precisely because with Bulgaria we shall have new borders, for controls to be coordinated, in order to prevent and combat organised crime.
Finally, as far as Romania is concerned, I too believe that the very important question of adoptions must be addressed in its correct dimension.
Â Â  Mr President, the enlargement has been of great benefit to the European Union, including its old countries, and we must turn away from the populists who claim otherwise.
I am convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will also enrich the EU.
Their accession will not only benefit them, but will also add something to the EU.
When I say this, it does not mean that we must not be strict where the EUâs criteria and values are concerned.
The simple fact of the matter is that much remains to be done in that area.
According to last monthâs Transparency International list, Bulgaria is ranked Number 55 and Romania Number 85 on the list of corrupt countries, which puts them alongside such countries as Mongolia and the Dominican Republic.
What is particularly cause for concern is the fact that corruption even pervades the highest echelons.
Another area for improvement is border control and all the related activities, as well as the rights of minorities.
Bulgaria and Romania have done a great deal, but much is yet to be done before the criteria are really met.
This House was forced to decide really early on, 20 months prior to accession, but we will not take the actual decision on the question when those countries can join until we have received the last piece of information, namely in April, although it is more likely to be May, of next year.
I think we should be fair in this, that we need to let the facts speak for themselves, that we need to ratchet up the pressure now and that Romania and Bulgaria should now pull out all the stops in order to make actual progress in the area of corruption.
It would be tremendously symbolic if we were to see representative senior officials and former political figures brought to court on account of their corruption.
That would be a wonderful symbol.
Our verdict will depend on this: fair but objective and also faithful to our values.
Knowing the Commissioner, I trust that he will also operate along those lines, that, if the outcome is good enough, the countries in question can join in 2007, but that, if there is a shortcoming, the Commission will suggest postponing their accession by one year.
It is good to maintain the criteria in order to retain the support for enlargement.
It also benefits the EUâs credibility and, last but not least, it is a very good thing for the people of Romania and Bulgaria who deserve our level of freedom and democracy.
Â Â  The government of Romania is systematically working on meeting the requirements raised by the European Union and the European Parliament.
However, there are still a great number of issues to be tackled in numerous areas.
The tabled motion for resolution addresses deficiencies critically but fairly.
I would like to call attention to the importance of the following amendment proposals, accepted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The situation of the draft Minority Act included in the programme of the Romanian Government is uncertain.
The delaying tactics of the Romanian governing parties is unacceptable, and this is why it is necessary to issue a strict warning to Bucharest.
A further important issue is the provision of mother-tongue university education for ethnic minority citizens, particularly in view of the fact that the situation of the more than 1.5 million indigenous Hungarians, of the Hungarian community, is not satisfactory in this respect.
I emphasise that the unquestionable means of protecting minorities and ensuring their legal certainty is the actual implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and self-government, including the establishment of certain types of autonomy.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us not amend paragraph 26!
The draft report mentions property restitution, but the issue of church property restitution has not been settled yet.
Romania needs reforms and many new laws in the area of environmental protection.
Once more, I would like to point out critically the exploitation plan of the gold mine at Rosia Montana, which must be solved taking into account the opinion of the competent civil organisations and affected countries, such as Slovakia and Hungary.
Finally, it is very important to express firmly the possibility of enforcing the safeguard clause.
Compliance with the requirements listed means the implementation of the Copenhagen criteria.
Like all candidate states so far, Romania can only obtain the licence needed for accession on the basis of actual results.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very glad to participate in this debate, mainly to give a voice to the many children, young adults with handicaps and those living in inappropriate state institutions in Romania, which I visited recently.
However, before I do that, let me just say a few words about the EU budget talks that are ongoing for 2007 onwards.
The British Presidency proposal does not make adequate provision for the enlargement of Romania and Bulgaria and we can only hope that the talks will change that situation.
Whatever emerges, there is a duty on the EU to continue to press for reform in Romaniaâs state residential institutions.
This is detailed in the monitoring report of the Enlargement Commission.
It is no coincidence that practically the only area that has experienced substantial reforms is that of child protection, to some extent due to the interest taken in this by the European Parliament.
The adult handicapped sector has plans for reform but there are no substantial initiatives as yet, again reflecting the recent interest we have taken in this in the EU.
As for the mental health sector, where some of the worst conditions can be found, there are no substantive plans for reform and this area has been largely ignored by the European Union.
We need to address it.
I would like to mention, as some of my colleagues have, the issue of the âpipeline childrenâ, the inter-country adoptions.
I share the concerns of colleagues.
We need to get clarification from the Romanian authorities about these children.
They need to give us assurances that it is in the best interests of the children to stay in Romania and indeed we need to know that they are in appropriate homes as we speak.
I understand the anxieties of the adoptive parents, but I also appreciate the reasons behind the ban on inter-country adoptions.
However, what is most important is that the needs of the children are placed above all else.
In some cases, this may mean allowing the adoptions to proceed.
Human rights lobbyists I have spoken to contend that much of the reforms in Romania are of the âsmoke and mirrorsâ variety and that the theory does not always translate into real progress on the ground.
I hope that is not the case and I applaud Romania where it has made improvements, but much remains to be done.
Too many people still live in unacceptable conditions in Romaniaâs institutions.
We represent their best hope.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of MrÂ PodestÃ , the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee, and therefore my speech will deal particularly with the situation in that country.
We agree with the basic points illustrated in the Moscovici report.
The considerable progress made by Romania is also clear from the progress report put forward by Commissioner Rehn in the last part-session.
On 22 and 23Â November this year, the EU-Romania joint delegation met to discuss this candidate countryâs actual current stage of advancement.
The meeting was also attended by Vice-President Frattini, Commissioner Rehn, the Romanian observers to the European Parliament and the Romanian Government representative.
Following all these reports, which bear witness to the efforts made by Romania, we reaffirm the need for that country to sustain its commitment in order to be able to join us on 1Â January 2007.
Notable and undeniable improvements have been achieved in the areas of freedom, communications, the media, education, and human rights for the countryâs ethnic minorities, without forgetting the significant results achieved in the economic field.
The situation of the Romanian market today is no different from that in which Spain, Portugal, Greece and the 10 countries of the fifth enlargement round found themselves 12 months before their accession.
While acknowledging that there are still important areas for improvement, such as justice, the fight against high-level corruption and the return of confiscated properties to others, in early December the Romanian Government launched an action plan setting irrevocable deadlines in order to meet the conditions agreed with the European Union.
Work had started on the monitoring systems and the reorganisation of the institutions responsible for those areas back in April 2005, and now they need to be given the time they require for their activities effectively to come on stream.
A serious problem that remains unresolved, however, is that of the children who have already made contact with their potential new families, because of the new legislation that prohibits international adoptions.
In that respect, we shall maintain Amendment 38 to paragraph 14 of the Moscovici report, in the hope that the Romanian Government will adopt immediate decisions to resolve this issue.
In any case, I should like to give our Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues my best wishes and hope that from 1Â January 2007 they can be sitting on a par with us here in Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the informed and thought provoking-debate that has taken place this afternoon on this important issue for the European Union.
The interventions we have heard have reinforced the importance of enlargement in my mind and underlined the benefits it brings to candidate countries and indeed the wider Member States.
As in our previous debate, honourable Membersâ points and questions went to the heart of the issue and raised some interesting issues for us to consider about Romania and Bulgariaâs accession processes and the wider policy of enlargement.
Given the constraints of time, I shall limit my concluding remarks to a few of the points that were addressed directly by honourable Members.
Mr Tannock and Mr Belder mentioned the issue of corruption and, in particular, concern in relation to border guards and the security thereof.
Both countries certainly face major challenges in tackling corruption, and Bulgaria, in particular, must step up the fight against organised crime.
The new governments have demonstrated a real commitment to tackle these problems and we have seen some progress, but there is still a long way to go.
It is right to acknowledge that before this House today.
In Romania examples of progress include: a new head of the anti-corruption department in the General Prosecutorâs office; 11 new senior prosecutors removed for ineffectiveness; and 22 cases of corruption by former and current senators and deputies now under way.
In relation to the further work that Romania has undertaken, border police and customs have dismissed large numbers of senior border and customs officers at several posts for ineffectiveness and corruption.
But let us be very clear: there is considerable and important progress that needs to be made on these important points.
Mr Beglitis and Mr Tannock also mentioned the issue international adoption, a point that was then touched upon by Ms McGuinness in a later contribution to the debate.
Corruption in international adoption has been clearly a problem.
Recent measures have been introduced to protect the interests of the child, as we have heard from a number of speakers, to improve domestic child protection and family facilities and to reduce the numbers of institutionalised children, in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and European Union norms.
In relation to the specific question as to why the Romanian Government is blocking pre-arranged adoptions, for example to the United States, a number of the so-called pipeline cases, which have been mentioned in the course of contributions to this debate, relate to requests made during the period of the 2001 to 2004 moratorium on international adoption.
The Romanian authorities set up a group of experts in June 2005, who are working through the files of the children concerned, to analyse each specific case and to look for solutions within the context of the legislation currently in force.
Ms McGuinness, Ms Sbarbati and Ms de Groen-Kouwenhoven also mentioned children in the wider sense and asked what is being done in relation to the treatment of children in both of these countries.
We are certainly concerned about the plight of institutionalised children whose living conditions are generally inadequate in both of these countries.
More work is needed to improve conditions, but we are encouraged by both governmentsâ recent actions.
For example, in the case of Bulgaria, the government has established six regional offices of the State Agency for Child Protection since early 2005 to take forward improvements.
It has started to implement a new action plan to close old state care homes.
In the case of Romania, the government is working hard to take children out of care homes and move them in with foster parents or relatives.
It has closed almost all of the 85 large, old-style institutions for children and replaced them with modern child protection alternatives.
Since 2000, it has reduced the number of children in care homes from 37 000 down to the present figure of 32 000.
Mr Piotrowski suggested â on a different matter entirely, but one that it is apposite to respond to, not least given the timing of this debate â that the Presidencyâs proposals on the financial perspective for 2007 to 2013 could not accommodate Romania and Bulgaria and failed to meet the criteria for solidarity.
I do not accept either charge.
On Romania and Bulgaria, our proposals fully respect their allocations under the accession agreements and provide for a historic shift of spending towards the new Member States and accession states and offer them greater flexibility as to how to distribute those European Union funds to the greatest possible effect.
That historic shift in funding, which includes significant cuts in receipts for the United Kingdom, shows why our proposals are all about solidarity, which featured prominently in his remarks.
There is no virtue in repeating the word âsolidarityâ, while avoiding the difficult challenge of finding the common ground on which both net contributors and net recipients can meet in the course of the coming hours and coming days.
In relation to both Bulgaria and Romania, I would recognise that significant progress towards European Union accession on 1 January 2007 has been made, but more work needs to be undertaken.
The Commission, under the capable leadership of Commissioner Rehn, will continue to monitor progress closely and will produce a follow-up report in April or May next year.
This report will provide the basis for any decision on whether to activate the so-called âsafeguard clauseâ.
To avoid delay, Romania and Bulgaria must now step up the pace of reform in the critical months at the beginning of the coming year and, in particular, tackle corruption, which has featured so prominently in this debate this afternoon.
They have a short space of time in which to implement these reforms, but accession in 2007 is still achievable, as long as they fulfil those important, outstanding commitments.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank the Members for their objective and informative debate and their well-chosen words.
It is also good that there was emphasis in the speeches on the fact that this is now about bringing to conclusion the latest, which is to say the fifth, round of enlargement.
This is an addition to the historic upheaval which started with the collapse of the Berlin Wall more than 15 years ago.
My opinion is that the Commission and the European Parliament, as well as the Presidency, with reference to MrÂ Alexanderâs important speech, should consider Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs preparations for membership very much in the same way and putting emphasis on the same things.
Reform of the judicial system in particular is absolutely essential.
It is essential for the legal protection of the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, it is essential from the point of view of economic dynamics and foreign investment, and it is also essential for the implementation of EU legislation in these countries.
We have a responsibility for ensuring that we assess fairly and objectively whether these countries are ready in this respect to accede to the Union in 2007.
The same also applies to administrative reform, and especially the fight against corruption and criminality, and the elimination of problems in the area of agriculture and food safety.
The coming months will be decisive for both countries.
Both have a chance to join in 2007, but only if both do all they can to meet the requirements and take the challenge absolutely seriously.
I trust that there is nothing unclear about this, but, to be quite sure, I will repeat my message.
What is crucial now is not any charm offensive in the capitals of the EU countries, but purposeful, practical action to carry through reforms in the legal system and in administration, and very determined action to combat corruption and crime.
Come spring, I would not like to find myself in a situation where, on behalf of the Commission, I have to propose recourse to the safeguard clauses, but it needs to be said that they have not been entered in the accession treaties for fun.
This chance should be taken seriously in Bulgaria and Romania, and every endeavour should be made to achieve eligibility for membership, so that both countries can join in January 2007.
We will be completely objective in our assessment of how prepared these countries are in the light of hard facts.
The Commission will support the reforms in Bulgaria and Romania, follow developments and in due course present Parliament and the Council with an assessment of this progress.
It needs to be emphasised that we will need regular dialogue, as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Elmar Brok, as well as others, said.
I would suggest that we return to the matter during the spring, when we will have a more accurate idea of how Bulgaria and Romania have progressed in their efforts to achieve eligibility for membership at the beginning of 2007.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  I would like to draw your attention within the framework of the Moscovici Report on the importance of safeguarding the rights of the Hungarian minority, the largest minority in Romania.
More specifically, I would like to draw your attention on paragraph 26 of the Report.
I understand that attempts have been made in order to erase from this paragraph the references to the principles of subsidiarity and self governance.
My opinion is that these principles are fundamental principles of the European Union and therefore should not be erased.
Many promises were made by the Romanian political leadership for the safeguard of the rights of the Hungarian minority.
It is about time now that Romania shows real political will to concretely implement these promises.
The question is: if there is no problem with Hungarian minority's rights why would the Romanian leadership want to erase parts of paragraph 26?
I strongly believe that it is the political responsibility of the European Parliament to ensure that all aspects including minorities' protection are appropriately dealt with while addressing Romania's readiness to access the European Union.
In my opinion, minority issues are indeed at least as important as economic issues.
Â Â  In spring 2006, the European Commission will submit to the Council its Final Opinion on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in JanuaryÂ 2007.
The accession of these countries depends on their ability to meet the commitments made in the accession treaty.
If they cannot, the safeguard clauses delaying accession to 2008 could be invoked.
Although the reports relating to the readiness of Romania and Bulgaria stress how much progress has been made, particularly in terms of the market economy, it is clear that the pace of reform needs to be increased, particularly in Romania, in order to strengthen the administrative and legal system, fight corruption, integrate the Roma and improve border controls.
Worrying delays have also been observed in implementing the in the areas of agriculture, public contracts and the environment.
This enlargement faces the European Union with a twofold challenge: we must not disappoint the Bulgarian and Romanian citizens who have great hopes for this accession; but at the same time we need to explain to our citizens, at a time when the European Union is going through a major political and budgetary crisis, the good reasons for this enlargement, which is opposed by the large majority of public opinion.
Â Â  A delegation from Austria, headed by Vice-Chancellor Gorbach, has arrived in the Chamber.
It will take part in political meetings ahead of the Austrian Presidency, which is due to begin on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0343/2005).
We will take the following questions to the Council.
We will not be taking Questions Nos 2 to 8, as they deal with a matter that has already been on this afternoonâs order of business.
Addressing the European Parliament on 26 October, in preparation for the next informal European Council, the Council President remarked, âOn the Working Time Directive, I hope that we can reach agreement under the UK Presidencyâ.
What exactly has the UK Presidency done to achieve this objective and what progress has been made?
Â Â  . I can assure the honourable Member that we are endeavouring to reach an agreement on the amended proposal for a directive amending the Working Time Directive.
In-depth discussions, both bilaterally and in the Council working groups, have enabled progress to be made on some key issues.
Discussions at the Employment Council only last week were very positive.
We made significant progress towards identifying the possible elements for an agreement.
Regrettably, however, due to differences in labour market situations across the Member States, as well as the complexity of new provisions, it was not possible to reach overall agreement at this stage.
It is obviously vital that any solution strikes the right balance between the objectives of health and safety protection for workers, and the protection and promotion of Europeâs competitiveness in the context of globalisation.
Â Â  President-in-Office, thank you for that reply.
I understand that, as you said, no agreement was reached.
It is becoming very clear that a lot of Member States that are trying to get rid of the individual opt-out â which you are working to retain, as I am â are trying to get around the use of the opt-out, either by using autonomous workers as a way of opting out or by making sure that there are multiple contracts, i.e. two or three contracts for one employee, which makes the whole idea of the Working Time Directive seem ludicrous.
I should be grateful if you could say whether the Socialist Group of MEPs, including the Labour MEPs, might support us now on the retention of the individual opt-out?
Â Â  . I am sure that honourable Members as experienced as Mrs Lynne recognise that it is not my responsibility to answer on this occasion on behalf of individual Members of this Parliament or of any group within this Parliament.
My responsibility instead is to answer on behalf of the Presidency.
However, I can assure her that she is correct in her analysis, in recognising that one of the main outstanding issues is how to apply the directive: per contract or per worker.
This confusion has arisen out of the discovery that, as she suggested, some Member States were applying the limits in the Working Time Directive per contract, thereby allowing people to work much longer than 48Â hours per week by having more than one contract.
We now need to consider further how to resolve this and seek to build on the significant progress that was made in the course of our Presidency, including last Thursday.
Â Â  Minister, I do not understand the British Presidencyâs concern about multiple contracts.
It would be all very well if you were against the opt-out but, with a directive with an opt-out as you advocate, it is irrelevant whether the contract or the worker is seen, because everybody will be able to do more than 48 hours.
I believe that this is a tactical manoeuvre; a manoeuvre that has divided the Council, which is wasting time and which is not going to bring us any closer to a final solution.
You should read this Parliamentâs resolutions more carefully.
Parliament has found a way that is flexible and secure.
Please do not invent new issues and get down to the job of resolving the important problems.
Â Â  . With the greatest of respect, it is not the British Presidency that has been inventing responses to the working time directive.
Let me assure the honourable Member that we remain committed to securing a European solution that respects national labour practices whilst providing appropriate levels of worker protection and promoting European competitiveness in line with Europeâs jobs and growth objectives.
Â Â  I should like to congratulate the Presidency and indeed those other countries within the Council that recognise the importance of retaining the opt-out.
I know this is a difficult dossier which all of us would like to see resolved some way or another.
Although the âdouble dealâ of the opt-out is potentially on the table, and taking into account the issue of on-call time, given that it is clearly impossible to do the double deal, is it not at least still sensible for you and/or the Austrian Presidency to try and clear up the issue of on-call time in isolation?
Â Â  . In response, I am grateful to the honourable Member for having rushed to the Chamber to ask the question.
Let me seek to assure him that we came very close to being able to find that agreement which secured the objectives that I described last week.
That is what gives me cautious optimism that we will, in time, be able to find a way forward in relation to the question that he put to me.
Our proposals, tabled for that discussion last week, marked a serious attempt to meet practical objections on the opt-out and reflected extensive consultation with Member States.
No doubt there will now be further opportunities for discussions within the Council to see whether we can finally reach the consensus that has so far eluded us.
Â Â  . I hope I do not disappoint the honourable Member, who has now joined us in the Chamber, with the answer that I can offer, but the Council has received no proposals from the Commission on this subject and it therefore has not addressed the issue.
Â Â  â Madam President, I thank the Minister for his reply, but I should like to ask if any such measures will be included in future planning for development, job creation or mobility, which we are celebrating in 2006.
Preparations should have been made in 2005.
Â Â  . I fear I must simply reiterate the point that I made in my earlier answer that no proposals have been received by the Council from the Commission in relation to this matter.
I would respectfully suggest that, if this is a matter which she feels is more appropriately directed towards the Presidency rather than the Commission, it might be a matter she would wish to raise with our successors, the Austrian Presidency.
Â Â  As the author of the question is not present, Question No 10 lapses.
What is the Council's view of the situation in Macedonia and what are the next steps in the pre-accession process for this country?
Â Â  . On 9Â November, the Commission presented its opinion on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and its application for European Union membership, and recommended that it be granted candidate country status.
The European Council next week is likely to assess the opinion with a view to establishing the European Unionâs position.
The Commissionâs opinion notes the important progress achieved by FYROM.
Less than five years ago, the stability of FYROM was threatened by an internal conflict.
Fortunately, the country is today engaged in a constructive drive for European Union membership.
The Commissionâs opinion notes that FYROM is now a functioning democracy, with stable institutions generally guaranteeing the rule of law.
Important steps have been taken towards establishing a functioning market economy, and FYROM is likely to be able to take on most of the obligations of membership in the medium term, provided that considerable efforts are made in its alignment with the .
Although important progress has been made, it is clear that there are many areas where more and harder work is now needed: the effective implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement must continue, public administration and institutions should be strengthened, the rule of law has to improve, including through a determined fight against crime and corruption, and the economy needs to develop.
The Councilâs recommendation to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at this stage is to stay focused on reforms and to implement fully all the measures identified in the new European partnership.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to ask you, by way of a supplementary question, what the European Union is doing in practical terms to address the youth unemployment and the sense of hopelessness among young people in Macedonia, and whether it is envisaged that the country will actually receive more substantial economic aid, since the very vague prospect of accession to the EU will do the country no good.
Apart from that, what is the situation as regards the mobility of young people, specifically their opportunities for study and training in the European Union?
Â Â  . In the course of our Presidency, I myself have had the opportunity to travel to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and meet directly with the Deputy Prime Minister of that country.
That meeting afforded me the opportunity to discuss with her the very ambitious plans she had for continued economic reform.
I believe that the kind of economic reforms of which I spoke in my initial answer is the surest foundation on which to tackle the kind of youth unemployment of which the honourable Member speaks.
In relation to the specific financial contribution that the European Union is making to that country for the year 2005, the European Union will provide EURÂ 34.5Â million intended to support its European integration reform agenda, as well as an additional EURÂ 2.8Â million for cross-border cooperation.
Between 1992 and 2004 the European Union committed some EURÂ 736Â million to the country.
Â Â  Question No 12 has been withdrawn by its author and will therefore not be taken.
The Council has indicated that it would like to see the public sector play an exemplary role in energy end-use efficiency.
Does the Council agree that the monthly movement of the European Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg is an example of energy being used inefficiently by the public sector, and what steps does the Council propose to take to redress this situation, given that the Council alone has the power to decide where Parliament shall sit?
Â Â  . As the honourable Member will be aware, ArticleÂ 289 of the EC Treaty provides that the seat of the institutions of the Community shall be determined by common accord of the governments of the Member States.
In accordance with the Protocol (8) annexed to the EC Treaty, and I quote directly from it: âThe European Parliament shall have its seat in Strasbourg where the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions, including the budget session, shall be heldâ.
The Council has not discussed the question of energy efficiency and the monthly movement of the European Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg.
Â Â  Is this key issue not a sort of litmus test for the adaptability of the Union?
Energy saving was not an issue in Europe 50 years ago but it is now and the Council and Parliament agree on that.
The public is entitled to some joined-up thinking.
So, as you say, it is in the Treaty but it is up to Member State governments to change that.
Therefore will the Council agree to include discussion on a single seat for the Parliament in the forthcoming Plan D post-Constitution debate?
Â Â  . Let me reply, firstly, by saying that the spirit of the honourable Member's question suggested that the process of Treaty change could be easy or quick.
I have to say that one needs only to reflect â during this period of reflection â on the fate of the draft Constitutional Treaty in the hands of the voters of France and the Netherlands to call that assertion somewhat into question.
I certainly take seriously the question of energy efficiency and there have been various steps taken by the European Union â commendably â in that regard.
However, again, if this is a matter which is of concern to the honourable Member, I would suggest that, given the very heavy programme that we face in the next couple of days in relation to future financing, it might be an issue better directed towards our successors.
Â Â  It is not just a matter of energy efficiency, but of financial efficiency.
The EURÂ 300Â million a year spent on bringing Parliament here for part-sessions amounts to EURÂ 2Â billion over a financial perspective.
You mentioned the need to ratify any change to this system.
Seeing that the own-resources decision is likely to need national ratification, could not a few extra clauses that would save the European taxpayer an enormous amount of money be added at the same time?
Â Â  . The honourable Member who raised this question is not the first colleague from the EPLP to do so.
I perhaps have a clearer understanding of the potency of this issue for MEPs after taking up my responsibilities as Minister for Europe in the course of the Presidency and having seen for myself the challenges that all Members face in negotiating the journey between Brussels and Strasbourg on a monthly basis.
I have to say, respectfully, however, that, given the sentiment within Parliament this morning about the urgent and pressing need to find agreement on future financing, I am not entirely convinced that raising this issue with our colleagues from Paris, at this particular stage, would be considered the most constructive contribution the British Presidency could make to finding agreement on future financing.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, can you confirm that, according to the Treaties, the European Parliament has one single seat?
The fact is that it is wrong to describe it as having two.
That single seat is Strasbourg.
We could well, without further ado, do away with the mini-plenaries in Brussels and would thereby save an enormous amount of energy, since we could, in the weeks left to us, stay at home and get the work out of the way on Fridays here in Strasbourg.
Â Â  . I do not wish to intrude on what appears to be an interparliamentary debate now on the relative merits of Brussels and Strasbourg.
Suffice to say, on the legal basis for the establishment of Parliament, I have nothing to add to my previous answer.
Â Â  . The Council is not in a position to comment on the ranking of the Member States in the United Nations Human Poverty Index 2004.
The Joint Council-Commission report on social protection and social inclusion provides useful information on policies for combating poverty within Member States.
There is no single European social model.
Although we share a common and distinctly European commitment to social justice and, indeed, solidarity, there is enormous variety in national responses to welfare and social challenges within our Union.
It is right that the different models should reflect the very different traditions and practices in individual Member States.
Heads of State and Government agreed back in October in Hampton Court that, whilst the operation of their social systems was a matter for individual Member States, Europe needed economic reforms and social modernisation to safeguard its values and meet the challenges and opportunities of globalisation and demographic change.
This agreement will build on the outcome of the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy agreed at the European Council in March, which set out a new strategic focus on jobs and on growth.
The spring European Council specifically reaffirmed that strengthening social cohesion would remain a core objective of the Union and that modernising social protection and fostering social inclusion were key priorities.
Â Â  I suppose, very much like motherhood and apple pie, everybody in the European Union, the Member States, all the political groupings, rhetorically at least, share a commitment to social solidarity, social justice, social cohesion.
However, I would put it to the Council that, particularly in the course of this Presidency, much of the credibility around that rhetoric has been undermined.
I do not believe that there is a faith amongst people in the Member States that in fact what we rhetorically commit ourselves to we are prepared financially to commit ourselves to.
Can I ask you to comment on a number of things, please: Firstly, on the issue of the budget and the financial perspectives, I am sure you have a view in terms of how this will be financed, and secondly to comment on measures such as the Services Directive ...
Â Â  . I shall endeavour to answer at least the first part of the honourable Memberâs question.
Firstly, if she is talking about solidarity, I recognise that is a concept that is of relevance to us, as is social justice, not simply within the borders of Member States or European Union, but far beyond the boundaries of the European Union.
That is why it is a matter of immense pride to me that, in recent months, we have seen a commitment from European Development Ministers, and then a decision endorsed by European Finance Ministers, to effectively double the level of European overseas development assistance, from USDÂ 40Â billion to USDÂ 80Â billion.
I make no apology, therefore, and in no way resile from the fact that every Member in this House should feel huge pride in this matter as we seek to meet our obligations towards the worldâs poorest people.
In relation to the honourable Memberâs specific question in relation to the Services Directive, the charge is often levelled at the British Presidency that an element hostile to the founding principles of the European Union is present in Britainâs national approach towards this Union.
I believe in completing the single market and I believe the services directive, given the original terms of the Treaty of Rome, has a contribution to make towards finishing and completing that single market.
However, we must recognise that the market has to be balanced by the kind of social funding which has been provided historically within this Union.
That is why, on the second point raised in relation to the coming financial prospective, I want to see the position articulated by the British Presidency this afternoon, the second negotiating box, form the basis on which agreement can be reached.
The sums of money in question are considerable and will provide the basis on which not just the new accession countries but all countries can strengthen their economies and thereby strengthen their capability to secure the very solidarity and social justice so often discussed in this Parliament.
Â Â  Which social model is chosen has an incredible effect on equality.
Recent studies I have examined show that the model of society that best favours equality is that involving a public welfare system and relatively high taxes etc.
My question is: does the Council share my view of this modelâs importance for equality, linked as it is to a commonly and publicly funded welfare state?
Â Â  . There is an important gender perspective towards the policies that we should advocate for our welfare states, but it is right to recognise that there is, as I said in my introductory remarks to this question, a diversity of social models within Europe.
It is a matter of profound concern to me that 20Â million fellow European citizens are out of work.
Upholding the European social model, as is often suggested, is of little comfort to those 20Â million citizens.
The necessary practical steps must be taken to secure the economic reforms that will create the prosperity to provide further opportunity for those individuals.
The core insight that the surest means to tackle poverty is to provide somebody with a job â one of my main political convictions â must also be recognised.
Â Â  May I say again that I welcome your remarks about there being no such thing as a single European social model.
I believe that is absolutely right, but could you confirm to me and colleagues whether, in making that remark, you feel that you are just saying that on behalf of the Presidency, or are you speaking on behalf of the Council as a whole?
Â Â  . I am reflecting both the spirit and the outcome of the discussion at Hampton Court of which I spoke earlier.
There was a clear recognition both of the challenges that Europe faces in the face of globalisation and that different courses have been set, in the face of those challenges, by individual Member States.
Â Â  . Any amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded can enter into force only after being ratified by all Member States.
Under the current Treaty, the Council can already adopt specific measures aimed at the outermost regions. This includes common policies.
The regional state aid guidelines, which are currently being revised, already make special provision for the outermost regions.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his comment on the planned new guidelines in the field of State aid for the outermost regions, but it is the case that treaties signed but not ratified have certain legal consequences in international law.
Specifically, in my region, the Canary Islands, the European Constitution was approved with 90% of the vote.
As things stand, more than half of the European population has approved the ratification of this Constitutional Treaty and my impression is that this ratification is not irrelevant in terms of European law.
Â Â  . I stand by the answer I have just given in terms of European law.
In relation to the Canaries in particular, however, Parliament should be aware that the NUTSÂ levelÂ 2 region of the Canaries will benefit from an additional envelope of EURÂ 100Â million over the 2007-2013 period under the envisaged proposals.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to tell us how it is envisaged that such provision can be made for our outermost regions, which are to be found in both the South and the North, in the absence of any budget framework for all these measures.
Â Â  . I hope that we are able to secure that budget framework.
The important first step is to secure the agreement at the European Council on the future financial perspective and I assure the honourable Member that we will be giving it our very best endeavours in the hours and days ahead.
Â Â  . It would not be appropriate for the Council to comment on the specific recent events in France, but while Member States are and remain primarily responsible for the adoption and implementation of their national integration policies, the Council seeks to provide support to them, in particular by promoting the exchange of experience and best practice.
The Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, approved by the European Council in November 2004, has invited Member States, the Council and the Commission to promote the structural exchange of experience and information on integration, supported by the development of a widely accessible website on the internet.
In December, ministers agreed on the need to reinforce cooperation on integration, in particular via the network of national contact points on integration.
This commitment built on the Commission communication: A common agenda for integration of third-country nationals in the European Union.
This integration network, established in 2003 and supported by the Commission, has played an important role in the framework of the exchange of information and best practice and has provided very valuable contributions in the drafting of the âHandbook on integration for policy-makers and practitionersâ, published by the Commission in 2004.
An expanded handbook is due to be published next year.
Â Â  I should like to ask the President-in-Office to continue the good work done during the UK Presidency of looking at the best possible models of diversity and of best practice and integration.
It is valuable work, which we must keep up in the coming months.
It is a very serious issue for EU Member States, in particular EU cities.
As this is your last Council Question Time, let me take this opportunity to say what many Members across this House have said to me: that you have answered criticism with good grace and you and your civil service team sitting behind you will leave this Presidency with a reputation for listening to Members and making every effort to answer their questions.
Â Â  . I am almost speechless, given the level of criticism usually directed towards me, that such a generous compliment has been paid, albeit in the final hours of my appearance before Parliament.
Let me return the compliment by saying that I know that the honourable Member has a strong reputation in the United Kingdom for his committed work on diversity over many years.
It was therefore no surprise to me to see that he had tabled such a question before this Chamber today.
I can certainly give him the assurance he seeks: we will continue to work hard to share the best practice, as I described, to ensure that there is effective cooperation on this issue of diversity, both in the remaining period of the British Presidency and well beyond that in the years to come.
Â Â  . The Council has on several occasions noted the possible benefits of an agreement on further changes in the World Trade Organizationâs outcomes during negotiations in the framework of the Doha Development Agenda within the WTO.
The Council has expressed support for future comprehensive multilateral negotiations, which reflects its wish for substantial progress in world trade liberalisation, securing continuing global economic growth, increased job creation, prosperity and sustainable development, and addressing the concerns of civil society.
The Council has noted that a further multilateral change of trade was the best way to meet the challenges posed by economic and technological change and increasing globalisation.
The Council sees this multilateral change as the most appropriate approach for achieving substantial and balanced results for the benefit of all WTO members.
A number of studies have tried to assess the magnitude of the benefits for the European Union.
For example, a widely-cited World Bank study in 2005 estimates that the potential gains from full liberalisation of global merchandise trade would be around USDÂ 65Â billion for the EU-25 and the EFTA countries by 2015.
The Council has not explicitly commented on the consequences âif no deal is doneâ.
The ramifications of a failed round go much wider than trade.
It would send a negative message about multilateral cooperation.
On the contrary, a good trade deal is an important part of our efforts to tackle poverty and promote global security in the long term, which have been such a focus of our work in the course of our Presidency.
Â Â  As it is Christmas, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his handling of Question Time and his wit.
Very often a laugh is no harm in this Chamber, and you have given us a few this evening.
Well done!
If we had the chirpiness of your voice in airports when they called for the last passengers to board, I would be grateful!
With regard to the WTO, could you comment on the difference between free trade and fair trade?
There is a world of a difference.
We need to be honest in terms of what we are looking for.
When you talk about the benefits, we need to know how they are distributed.
Who gains?
Because not everyone gains equally.
Â Â  . I am increasingly humbled by the compliments that are being paid to me.
I now see a whole new employment possibility opening up before me.
If we fail to reach agreement at the European Council this weekend, you will be able to enjoy my dulcet tones at Brussels airport in the future, announcing flights departing for Dublin and for Edinburgh.
I sincerely hope that does not turn out to be the outcome of the European Council this weekend.
I am not sure if my observations were always intentionally humorous, but I shall take the compliment in the spirit in which it was intended in this holiday season.
On the serious and substantive point that the honourable lady raises with me, I can assure you this has been a matter that we have given much thought to in the course of our Presidency, both as a result of the extraordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council that took place to discuss the terms of the mandate for Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, in light of the fact that, from the government that presently holds the Presidency, not only Margaret Beckett but also Hilary Benn and Alan Johnson are presently in Hong Kong doing what they can to sustain our case that the best outcome in Hong Kong would be a balanced and ambitious outcome which would allow a successful conclusion of the round.
However, that raises exactly the point that the honourable Member addressed: what is a balanced and ambitious outcome for the Hong Kong talks and, indeed, for the Doha development round in general?
I have always been clear that there is and should be no contradiction between an agenda which is pro-jobs in the European Union and pro-poor in the world.
One need only consider the potential gains for the developing world from a successful outcome to the Hong Kong meeting and indeed the Doha round to be encouraged to take whatever steps are necessary to see the progress that would not only be in the interests of this Union, but in the interests of the broader cause of proving that globalisation can work, not simply for a minority of the worldâs citizens but, if the right public policy choices are made, in the interests of the poorest people and well as the rich people in this world today.
Â Â  . The Council is aware of Parliamentâs long-standing interest in this issue and has already had the opportunity to reply to several questions from Parliament on these matters.
This was a subject that featured prominently in the debate we have just concluded on the potential accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Parliament has consistently stressed the great importance that it attaches to the issue of care of children, the disabled and the mentally ill in Romania.
The Unionâs clear position that Romania, as a future member of the European Union, must comply with high standards in these areas, has been expressed throughout Romaniaâs accession process.
The Unionâs views were reiterated during the latest meeting with the European Union-Romania Association Council on 14 June 2005.
The Commissionâs 2005 comprehensive monitoring report on Romania, to which the honourable Member refers, is still being examined by the Council.
The Councilâs general opinion, however, remains clear on these issues.
These are priority areas, in which remaining shortcomings must be adequately addressed as soon as possible.
The progress already made needs to be followed by further implementation, further improvements and the allocation of both adequate funding and staffing levels.
This applies to all areas of care, but is particularly important with regard to the situation for the disabled and the mentally ill.
The Council will closely follow and evaluate future developments and continue to raise these concerns directly with Romania.
Â Â  I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
The EU monitoring and advocacy programme of the Open Society Institute has stated that there is a total absence of reliable, comprehensive data on mentally disabled persons in Romania, which has contributed to a general lack of public attention to people with intellectual disabilities.
From the Ministerâs reply, I take it that assistance in this area would be an immediate priority as part of the EUâs monitoring of issues in relation to persons with mental disabilities in Romania.
I should like to ask the Minister, in the spirit of Christmas, by wishing him well, if he does get that job at the airport, could he do something about direct flights to Strasbourg?
Â Â  . Firstly, in relation to his final remark, I have even more sympathy with him on exactly that point than I did at the beginning of the UK Presidency.
If I do not manage a job in Brussels airport, perhaps I will manage one in Frankfurt airport, to where I often have to travel, given the length of the questions I face here in this Chamber.
In relation to the substantive point that he raises, however, this matter was addressed directly in the Commission monitoring report to which I referred.
Romania has started to develop a strategy to close large residential institutions for the disabled and replace them with alternative Community-based services in smaller residential units.
A public campaign is also under way to raise awareness of disabled rights, I hope addressing some of the points that the honourable Member raises.
However, clearly, as he suggests, more work is needed.
But the new policies, I have to say, are encouraging.
Psychiatric care requires more immediate attention: living conditions for patients are poor and budgetary resources, as was implied, are limited.
The 2002 Law on Mental Health and Protection of People with Psychological Disorders is still not being implemented.
The government has begun to tackle this issue and we want to see this work stepped up.
Â Â  This is a very serious issue.
I have recently been to Romania and visited some of the institutions we have discussed.
The conditions are deplorable from a health and safety point of view, if nothing else.
I ask you to do whatever you can, in your last days in office, to ensure that this issue is given a higher priority in the progress towards accession.
Â Â  . The comments that have been put to me today are communicated, in turn, to the European Commission, in view of their ongoing monitoring role in this accession process, and given the strength of feeling being communicated in the Chamber this evening.
Â Â  . Fisheries quotas for the Baltic Sea for 2006 were jointly agreed by the European Community and Russia in September on the basis of scientific advice produced by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in May.
The relevant details are set out in the Commissionâs proposals to put such quotas into Community law.
This should be adopted at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 20 and 21Â December 2005.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I should like to thank MrÂ Alexander for his answer.
I would have preferred, however, to receive a clearer response to the substance of my question, which related to the rules governing the sharing of quotas and closed seasons.
It is high time that the annual negotiations in this field were based on objective and convincing findings.
I do not believe that the advice to which MrÂ Alexander referred meets these criteria.
As we are all aware, the scope of research into fish stocks in the Baltic has so far been limited by an inadequate number of fishing surveys, and by what essentially amounts to a lack of consensus on the methodological basis for biomass assessments.
When MrÂ Alexander grows weary of airports, I should like to invite him to the Baltic.
We would be delighted to welcome him there.
Â Â  . The Council will meet on 20 and 21Â December to agree next yearâs fishing deal for European Union waters.
I referred the honourable Member to the relevant details that have been set out in the Commissionâs proposals and, for his assistance, I would recommend document COM(2005)0598, which sets out the relevant details for the Commissionâs proposals to put such quotas into Community law.
It may also be of assistance to the honourable Member to be aware that there will be two separate regulations, one for the north-east Atlantic, but one, which I judge to be his primary interest, for the Baltic, in particular.
Â Â  . There is at present no proposal before the Council to establish a European Union ban on corporal punishment of children in European Union Member States.
The Council does not have information on, nor does it deem it appropriate to comment on the state of the domestic legislation of Member States in this regard.
Â Â  â Thank you for that very succinct answer.
We do have a community of values in the EU.
I wonder if it is conceivable that, just as they have done regarding the social situation in France, the EU countries, headed by the Council, might alter their practice so that children are not exposed to violence in the home or at school in our democratic European countries.
Â Â  . I would reiterate that the Council does not deem it appropriate to comment on the state of domestic legislation of individual Member States, but I would certainly recognise that the use of corporal punishment in individual Member States and the rights of children are not within the competence of the European Union, which explains the brevity of my response.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, unfortunately I have to say that I did not find MrÂ Alexanderâs response very convincing.
The Council has done very little to encourage the EU Member States to ratify the Hague Convention on parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, which regulates such issues.
We are all aware that only six Member States have ratified this Convention.
The other Member States have not yet done so, which means that such forms of punishment can still be used.
I should like to ask what action the Council has taken in this respect.
Â Â  . In relation to this question, I would suggest that this is not a matter for the Presidency.
Member States are signatories to conventions individually, rather than collectively.
I would, however, refute the allegation that no action has been taken on the general issue of child welfare.
Over the past few years, the European Union institutions, working with Member States, have made significant progress on childrenâs rights.
The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (2000) explicitly recognises the rights of children as fundamental to European values.
ArticleÂ 24 of the Charter is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which has been ratified by all Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  Madam President, I too am not satisfied with the answer given by the President-in-Office, on the grounds that, even if the Presidency of the Council has not given priority to this issue during its term in office, I do believe â as probably everyone here in this House does â that we, in the European Union, live in a community founded upon values, and that violence aimed at children, which includes corporal punishment, really is a crime committed against them.
I ask emphatically that there should in future be action on this front with the support of the Member States.
Â Â  . Nobody is denying that there can be a community of values.
What, I sense, is an issue between me and the honourable Member is whether there is a legal basis for the Council to take action in this regard.
In that sense, I would simply reiterate the points that I have made previously, that I judge this not to be a matter for the Presidency.
Member States are signatories to conventions individually, rather than collectively.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question 21 lapses.
When will the period of reflection, introduced following the results of the referenda in Holland and France, come to an end?
Is the Council now prepared to consider proposals for reform which happen to be included within the EU Constitutional Treaty?
Â Â  . Given that the period of reflection will itself extend beyond the British Presidency, it somehow seems fitting that the final question that I answer in this Parliament, as the representative of the British Presidency, anticipates what will be an important subject in the months to come.
Perhaps with your indulgence, Madam President, I could also take this opportunity â given that you have intimated that this is the final question to be answered â to thank all the members of the Council secretariat for their very considerable hard work in producing the draft replies in the course of our Presidency to the questions that have been raised by Members of this Parliament.
Rather like an author in the foreword to a book, I would, at this point, respectfully say that all the mistakes are entirely my own, and I am sure all the factual accuracy is reflective of the considerable expertise of the Council secretariat.
To address myself directly to the honourable Memberâs question, as he is aware, Heads of State and Government agreed on 17Â June that there was a need for a period of reflection to enable a broad debate to take place within each Member State.
Provisions for reform within the Constitutional Treaty â and I have certainly experienced this in the course of our Presidency â may be sensible to one Member State but controversial to another.
Therefore, the focus of the United Kingdom Presidency has been to engage consciously in a wider debate about the future of Europe.
It was agreed to come back to the matter in the first half of 2006, in the Spring Council of the Austrian Presidency, to make an overall assessment of the national debates and agree on how to proceed at that stage.
Â Â  If you indulge me, may I take the opportunity to thank the representatives of the Presidency for all the help and assistance they have given my colleagues over the recent months.
May I thank the President-in-Office in particular; I have much enjoyed these exchanges over the recent weeks, taking place in a rather empty public library though, sometimes it may seem.
I welcome the opportunity to come back to an oft-repeated subject.
Every head of government has publicly supported the principle that the Council should meet in public when it is debating legislative acts.
If the fine words and good intentions of the President-in-Office could deliver firm results, the Council would have ensured that changes in its Rules of Procedure were now on the way to being put into practice.
Instead we have the suggestion that the Council will review the functioning of these measures in future presidencies and examine how further to increase openness and transparency, including the possibility of amending the Rules of Procedure.
Will the President-in-Office say where the substance is in this proposal?
Â Â  . Let me seek to answer the honourable Memberâs question directly.
Firstly, we will both recall the terms of the statement made by our Prime Minister before this Assembly at the outset of the British Presidency and that has informed the approach that I have taken to this issue of transparency in the Council.
It explained the basis on which I first sought the agreement of colleagues within the United Kingdom Government and the process on that basis that we then took forward with other countries in the course of our Presidency.
The Presidency tabled an options paper on improving Council transparency in November 2005.
The proposals have been discussed by the Antici Group and by both Coreper I and II, and we now aim to agree Council conclusions on 20Â December.
The honourable Member will have to wait a little longer before, I hope, we secure the kind of agreement that will give him the satisfaction he seeks this evening.
Â Â  On the wider package of the Constitutional Treaty as a whole, does the President-in-Office of the Council accept that the European Council was right, in the light of the fact that a majority of Member States have actually ratified this Constitutional Treaty?
It was right not to declare the text dead, but to inaugurate a period of reflection â one which has been much more about the context than about the text.
Does he agree that in due course, once we are in a new context, we will have to return to the question of the text and what to do about it, if not in 2006, then in 2007?
Â Â  . I find myself in agreement and sympathy with the point the honourable Member makes.
The British Government, even before assuming the office of the Presidency of the European Union, argued for the need for a period of reflection.
We did not feel it was appropriate for any one government to make a unilateral declaration as to the status of the draft Constitutional Treaty, given the fact that the Constitutional Treaty was owned by the totality of the members of the European Union.
It is right to recognise that, even before the decisive votes in France and the Netherlands, there had been, in the case of Spain, a referendum which had found in favour of the draft Constitutional Treaty and a whole range of other countries had in turn ratified the draft Constitutional Treaty by parliamentary procedure.
That is why I hold to the position that was first articulated immediately prior to the British Presidency.
During our Presidency we have maintained that position.
In the course of that Presidency our Prime Minister has made clear his personal judgement that he believes it is necessary to get the politics in a better place before returning to the institutional question.
But in the course of this Presidency we have also made it clear that we regard it as necessary to have the kind of practical, sensible reforms that will allow a Union of 25 to operate more effectively than on the basis of the present Treaty arrangements.
Â Â  If I could join with other colleagues from the United Kingdom to thank you for your efforts over the last six months and also say that, in connection with the Constitution, we were delighted that there were two ânoâ votes in Holland and France and we will not â unexpectedly to you â be demanding a referendum in the United Kingdom if any part of the Constitution is proposed for bringing forward in future.
Â Â  . I am deeply conscious of my responsibilities, not least in my final answer, to seek to answer on behalf of the Presidency and not simply indulge in what would be a fascinating debate with a domestic political opponent in relation to their present position, not only in terms of where they sit within this Chamber but where they sit on the issue of the draft Constitutional Treaty.
The statement I have just heard is clearly in contradiction to at least some of the assertions that have come from other Conservative colleagues in relation to some of the practical and sensible changes of which I have just spoken.
However, I have a clear feeling that there are much bigger issues at stake for the modern Conservative Party in terms of its engagement with Europe than even the answer we have just heard.
Â Â  I wondered whether the Minister would like to make any comment on the possibility of British Conservative MEPs sitting on the same bench as MrsÂ Mussolini?
Â Â  .
If I can manage just under the wire before the conclusion, let me simply say this. Kenneth Clarke is a serious figure within the United Kingdom, a figure well known to this Chamber.
He has described the modern British Conservative Party under its new leader as being faced with a proposal â and I quote directly â that is âhead-bangingâ in its extremism.
He has said that the modern Conservative Party is more extreme than the Conservative Party under William Hague or indeed Iain Duncan Smith.
It is up to the honourable Members on the Conservative benches in this Chamber to decide whether to marginalise themselves further, not simply within the United Kingdom, but also within the European Union.
I have already paid generous tribute to the work of one of the British Conservatives in this Chamber today, who through his role as a rapporteur in relation to the accession of one of the potential candidate countries of the European Union, has undertaken important work on behalf of this Parliament.
The marginalisation of what was once a great political party, as envisaged by its new leader, would be a diminution not simply of the Conservative Party but of Britainâs national interest.
But ultimately it is not the only misjudgement they will make.
I fear it will be the first of many by the new Conservative leader.
Â Â  Question 23 lapses on the grounds that it relates to a problem that we have discussed this afternoon.
Since the period of time allotted to questions has expired, Questions 24 to 54 will be answered in writing (for questions not taken see the âQuestion Timeâ annex).
Perhaps I might be permitted to close with a personal comment.
Mr Alexander, you have discovered today that you get not only criticism from this House, but also praise for the work you do.
I wish you a successful career in office, a relaxing holiday, and thank you for your cooperation.
Question Time is closed.
Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0338/2005), on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC [5786/2/2005 â C6-0267/2005 â 2001/0004(COD)] (rapporteur: Andreas Schwab).
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before turning to the Machinery Directive itself, I should like to start by extending very warm thanks to all those involved in this process, and especially to the shadow rapporteurs of the various other groups.
They were prepared to make many compromises, and I am particularly grateful to them for that fact.
I should also like to thank the Commissioner responsible, who is present in the Chamber today, for his willingness to compromise on many points of detail that were of crucial significance for Parliament.
This will make it a great deal easier for Members to vote in favour of a slightly amended version of the Common Position.
I should like to address five issues that we regard as being of paramount importance.
The directive â which, it must be admitted in a spirit of self-criticism, is not immediately comprehensible to the general public â was aimed at establishing a clearer distinction between this and other directives.
One problem has arisen in this regard, however, namely the Tractor Directive.
Whereas tractors did not previously fall under the scope of the Machinery Directive as well as that of the Tractor Directive, they are now covered by both.
This is a heavy double burden to impose on manufacturers, and one that we would have liked to avoid.
The Tractor Seats Directive is of course a further issue, and MrÂ Verheugen cannot have failed to notice the reports in German newspapers claiming that this Directive is regarded, both in Germany and elsewhere, as nothing less than a bureaucratic monstrosity.
It is for this reason that I am extremely grateful to him for working together with us towards our goal, even though the work is perhaps not progressing quite as quickly as we might all have liked.
This goal is to achieve a solution whereby machinery falls under the scope of only one directive, or in other words whereby the Tractor Directive applies only to tractors, and the Machinery Directive applies to all other types of machinery.
Our task now is to ensure that we achieve this goal as soon as possible.
My wish would of course be for the revision of the Tractor Directive, and the incorporation of all the risks not yet addressed, to be completed within the 18Â months that the Member States will need to implement the Machinery Directive.
I am aware that such wishes cannot always be granted immediately, but I should like to set a goal of 18Â months, which would take us up to the deadline for implementation.
It goes without saying that I would have liked to make more headway on certain issues in my capacity as rapporteur. An example of one such issue is the granting of exemptions for harmless types of machinery such as wristwatches.
In the end, however, I withdrew my amendment to this effect in response to the serious concerns, most of which were voiced by the Commission, over the safety loopholes that could arise as a result.
At the same time, however, Parliament has made a considerable step forward from the original Common Position as far as the confidentiality of trade secrets is concerned, and in my opinion the same also applies to the scrapping of machinery.
We are of course all aware that sustainable production is crucially important for Europe, with a view to meeting the Lisbon goals, but there can be no question that we were right to avoid making manufacturers responsible across the board, as it were, for the scrapping of machinery, since it is genuinely impossible for them to know all the details of the scrapping process in advance.
Furthermore, these manufacturers are often small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is also my belief that we still have more work to do together on the matter of certification, and especially third-party certification, since the position outlined in the Common Position with regard to the CE marking was in no way acceptable for the Members of this House.
Regardless of the number of meetings that were needed to draft this Common Position, in our opinion it is not enough for the Council to cater to the lowest common denominator, and to put forward formal compromises worded in such a way thatÂ it is hard for anyone to understand them, let alone a member of the public or an SME owner.
Needless to say, we too are aware of the difficulties faced in this respect, for example with regard to translation.
In spite of this, however, our goal must be to draft legislative texts that the general public can understand, and indeed this is a cause that MrÂ Verheugen has made his own.
I am delighted that we have taken a small step forward on the issue of the CE marking.
Although in my opinion we still need to do more, you did in fact make express reference to the ânew approachâ to the CE marking in your 2006 work programme, so I do not want to spend too much time complaining about it now.
I believe that the time has now come to take a broader and more coherent approach and to ensure that the regulations governing the use of the CE marking are the same in all sectors.
Not only would this be advantageous in itself, but in my opinion it would also fall under the heading of better regulation.
Nevertheless, when drafting this legislation we must once again give serious thought to the role of the CE marking in the European Union, to the quality and safety standards that we associate with it and to the bodies that are responsible for monitoring these standards.
The reason I say this is becauseÂ I believe that we still have work ahead of us in the Member States in terms of explaining and debating the issue of market surveillance.
It must not be the case that the European Union is made responsible for any problems that arise, even when the Member States have shirked their duties with regard to the time spent on surveillance.
All in all, I should like to reiterate my warm thanks.
I believe that we have made a certain amount of progress in terms of achieving better regulation and reducing red tape, but that much remains for us to do.
In this connection, I am counting on the Commission to make good headway with new proposals, in particular on the subject of tractors, in order to bring us closer to our goal of better regulation.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ Schwab, and the shadow rapporteurs for their commitment and their constructive cooperation, without which an agreement would not have been reached at second reading.
The situation in which we find ourselves today could be aptly summed up by the famous proverb, âgood things come to those who waitâ.
The history of the revision of the Machinery Directive is a very long one.
It originally began with a recommendation by the âMolitor groupâ, which was a forerunner of the present Commissionâs âbetter regulationâ initiative.
When the Commission presented its proposal for a directive in early 2001, following lengthy discussions with all those involved, noÂ one expected that it would take fiveÂ years and a record-breaking 43Â Council working group meetings to complete this revision, to say nothing of Parliamentâs work.
The length of these discussions was due to the considerable size and complexity of the sector affected by the directive, by which I mean the mechanical engineering sector, which covers a very diverse range of products, including machinery, mechanical appliances and their components.
At the same time, however, it is also a sector that is of crucial importance to the EU economy, and one of the best-performing industrial sectors.
In 2004, the mechanical engineering sector in the European Union produced goods worth EURÂ 402Â billion and employed over 2.6Â million engineers, technicians and other workers, most of whom were highly qualified.
Mechanical engineering production in the EU exceeds that in Japan and the USA by a long way.
The European Union is the worldâs largest exporter of machinery and mechanical appliances with exports worth EURÂ 150Â billion, which puts us ahead of the USA with EURÂ 62Â billion and Japan with EURÂ 67Â billion.
This is proof that we are dealing with a sector which can rightly be called a jewel of European industry, and which therefore really does merit particular attention.
Now that we have a recommendation concerning amendments to the Common Position, we are very close to completing the legislative process involved in drafting a new Machinery Directive.
I am delighted to be able to tell you that the Commission can accept in full the compromise reached by Parliament and the Council.
In actual fact, the outcome of this compromise represents a significant improvement over the Machinery Directive 98/37/EC that is currently in force, and, as MrÂ Schwab has already mentioned, it is an excellent example of better regulation.
The scope has now been defined in more detail and ambiguities ironed out, which means that legal certainty has been improved.
The Directive had previously been given a number of different interpretations, which will no longer be the case.
A much clearer distinction has been made between this and other directives, such as the Lift Directive or the Low Voltage Directive.
Implementation of the Directive, including market surveillance and the monitoring of bodies charged with the task of certification by the Member States and notified to the Commission as such, has been made more efficient as a result of Parliamentâs far-reaching amendments at first reading.
The manufacturers of certain types of machinery which the scope of the Directive has been extended to cover will now also reap the benefits of the internal market.
Users and workers will benefit from improved health protection and consumer protection, with such improvements having been made on the basis of our experience with the present Directive.
Turning to the highly contentious matter of the relation in which other markings stand to the CE marking, I should like to confirm that this issue will be resolved in the course of the revision of the ânew approachâ, as stated in the following Commission declaration.
I shall read out the Commissionâs formal declaration once again:
âWithout prejudice to respect for Community legislation, the Commission, within the context of the revision of the new approach planned for mid-2006, will clarify the conditions for the affixing of other markings, whether national, European or private, in relation to the CE marking.â
As far as the equally contentious issue of tractors is concerned, I should like to make it known that the Commission is absolutely committed to the principles set out in the two declarations, which I should also like to read out again.
The first declaration reads:
âParliament, the Council and the Commission declare that, in order to cover all aspects related to the health and safety of agricultural and forestry tractors in one harmonising directive, Directive 2003/37/EC on type-approval of agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units needs to be modified so as to address all the relevant risks of the Machinery Directive.
Such a modification of Directive 2003/37/EC should include an amendment of the Machinery Directive, in order to delete the expression âfor the risksâ in Article 1(2)(e), first indent.â
The second declaration is as follows: âThe Commission recognises the need to include in the Agricultural and Forestry Tractors Directives further requirements for risks not yet covered by those directives.
To that end, the Commission is considering appropriate measures that include references to the United Nations regulations, CN and ISO standards, and OECD codes.â
I hope that that answers any remaining questions to everyoneâs satisfaction.
I should like to reiterate my thanks for the genuinely positive and constructive cooperation afforded by the House, and also to thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Schwab, on the excellent job he has done on a very complex and difficult text, made more difficult because he took it over from our previous rapporteur and colleague, Mr Wieland.
I am very pleased with what the Commissioner said and with the agreement that we have reached to secure a second reading confirmation with the Council.
I would like to pick up one or two of the policy issues.
As the Commissioner indicated, it has been a long and sometimes bumpy road towards the final agreement on this very complex text.
Looking forward, and in the light of his determined commitment to the better regulation agenda, we need to keep a close eye on the implementation and effectiveness of this directive.
I fear that it may be extremely costly to implement and we need to make sure that his services are keeping an eye on it and that it is not being duplicated by the national regulation.
I welcome what he said about different marks, but we need to give serious consideration to the cost of regulatory compliance.
In that connection, I want to make two other points.
I am pleased that the Council has recognised that it has to speed through the issue of tractors, because the lack of a harmonised type-approval process for a very important sector is scandalous, and Member States should be ashamed of their foot-dragging on this.
I want to draw his attention to another crucial machinery category, which is also partly affected by this directive, which is the whole issue about road-going machinery.
I recently went to a conference of construction equipment manufacturers.
They told me that, on their estimates, 70% of their research and development costs are absorbed by complying with regulation.
How can we run a competitive European economy when we saddle a major industry with those sorts of compliance costs?
I think we may have problems with this machinery directive, but the Commissioner must address that.
I want to bring a delegation from the construction equipment manufacturers to see him as soon as possible to address their issues as well.
Â Â  .Â âÂ MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no question that 18Â months is a long time for a debate to go on within the Council.
Yet this is no time at all in comparison to the service lives of machinery.
Speaking as someone who has worked in the field of mechanical engineering for 20Â years, I am of course aware of the significance of this directive, in terms of making legislation more consistent.
Although many users were initially sceptical, it is my belief that more or less all doubts have now been dispelled.
The first letters have arrived from people expressing their approval, and since our aim is to focus on the user and not to ignore public opinion, this approval is important.
This directive is not only important for users, however, but also for millions of consumers, since it contains legal provisions that are of crucial significance for their health and safety.
As the Commissioner said, one of the reasons why this revision was necessary was because earlier directives did not go far enough.
Further reasons included the need to improve the necessary legal certainty, to define the scope in more detail and to safeguard the free movement of goods at the same time as ensuring a high level of health and safety protection for consumers. This should also be a priority goal for European industrial policy.
I should like to thank the Members of this House and, above all, the Commission and the Council for their excellent cooperation.
It was nonetheless necessary for the Social Democrats to incorporate a number of key considerations, and indeed this meant that we had more in common with the Council during most of the rounds of discussion.
For example, we want the Commission to develop guidelines to help the Member States to increase their capacities.
This would enable effective market surveillance with a view to the uniform application of the directive.
At the same time, however, the Social Democrats also believed that confidentiality and trade secrets must not have a negative impact on personal health and safety.
Another of our goals, and one which we have now achieved, was to lighten the burden on SMEs, without affecting the substance of the Directive or imposing additional costs.
A further important aim for us was to ensure that the standards for disabled people using lifts were not compromised as a result of the revision of the Directive.
We have achieved all these goals.
We were opposed to agricultural and forestry tractors not being included, but we accept the Commissionerâs explanation.
We would have preferred him to set a date, and to set a date of 2008, but since we will all still be Members of this Parliament at that point we will be able to ensure that the necessary steps are taken.
We do not want to exclude small appliances, MrÂ Schwab, because it is not just wristwatches that we are talking about, but fire extinguishers and similar small appliances that are relatively dangerous.
Nevertheless, I believe that we have achieved a good compromise.
The Social Democrats will vote in favour of it, and for once this week I should like to praise the British â and such praise is not something that can be taken for granted â since our cooperation with the British Presidency on this matter has also been excellent.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on machinery we are looking at today revises a directive, as you said, dating from 1998.
It is a highly technical subject, but it will have a major impact on the European engineering industry and on the European economy as a whole.
I would like to remind you of the figures that MrÂ Verheugen has already quoted, which, in fact, are even better than the ones I had.
I cannot resist reminding you that the annual turnover in the sector is EURÂ 402Â billion, of which EURÂ 113Â billion a year comes from exports to third countries.
The first reading reflected a reasonable compromise reached after years of debates.
I well remember that simply laying down the definitions of machinery and partly completed machinery took considerable commitment during the previous mandate.
During the second reading, for my part, I paid particular attention to the provisions of that directive relating to CE marking, as I felt that the wording was insufficiently clear in legal terms.
I am grateful to the Council for having accepted my amendment, but I am delighted that the Commission is working on this subject, which still needs to be looked into more deeply.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the way he led the negotiations.
We were able to make considerable progress towards a common position thanks to the informal three-way talks he arranged, bringing together the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the shadow rapporteurs, the representatives of the European Commission and those of the Council.
We have reached a consensus awaited by all those in the industry.
There are still some points that need to be clarified, particularly with regard to tractors, but I remain optimistic and I hope that the problems will be resolved by the effective implementation of this directive.
As a consequence of this, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will vote for the compromise.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard that mechanical engineering is a crucially important sector of the European economy.
Although this is the case throughout the European Union, there can be no question that it holds particularly true in my home country.
An interesting point that should therefore be stressed in this connection is that this Directive was drafted, , in response to calls from industry, which went to a great deal of effort to get this Directive on the table, with the slogan of âone product, one regulation for the internal marketâ.
It goes without saying that this is a positive development, given that one of the advantages of this legislation is that the same type of machinery, with the same design, can be put into circulation anywhere in the internal market.
Additional tests in the various EU Member States would of course be unnecessary.
On the occasion of this second reading, and with the debate on the Services Directive in mind, I should like to make the following comment.
If we were always to take this approach as our starting point for debates on the Services Directive, we would doubtless also make progress with that dossier.
In this connection, I cannot help but mention that mechanical engineering in Europe is in fact particularly dependent on the Services Directive, because services as well as products are sold with machinery.
While on the subject, I should like to make a second comment of a political nature.
It has been reiterated during todayâs debate that this Directive was a very long time â five years, to be precise â in the making.
For most of this time, the European Union had only 15Â Member States.
As we are all aware, the EU is now operating with 25Â Member States.
In view of this fact, and also in view of the planned reduction in the number of regulations, it should be noted that it will probably take a great deal longer to reach agreement on similar regulations in the future, and both industry and the political bodies responsible for such matters should be aware of this fact.
The principle of âless is sometimes moreâ also applies in this instance.
If I may, therefore, I should like to emphasise once again how much I welcome this Directive.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join in thanking MrÂ Schwab for his excellent work.
I should also like to thank MrsÂ Weiler and MrsÂ DeÂ Vits, who have shown a high level of commitment and involvement on behalf of my group, thus ensuring that a certain amount of progress has been made in the course of their work with MrÂ Schwab.
Previous speakers have already referred to such key considerations as health, safety and consumer protection.
These considerations are the basis for the quality characteristics that ensure that products such as machinery are market leaders, and that mean that our manufacturers are able to capture a large global market for their products.
This is very much to be welcomed.
In this context, I can only agree with MrsÂ Weiler, who said that legal certainty is crucial in this connection.
What legal certainty means is that mechanical engineers know exactly what rules they have to follow and what regulations are actually in force, and that they are not left in the dark.
This in turn would also make it possible for us to have a well-functioning market in this sector.
At the same time, however, legal certainty also means that we must avoid a situation in which several different directives apply to one product.
It means that we should push forward measures to put in place a uniform regime, especially in the case of the tractor directives.
It is far from ideal that manufacturers should have to juggle different regulations, and it is also highly regrettable that we were unable to gain approval for our proposal that this issue should finally be resolved by 2008 at the latest.
This is a real shame.
I have not forgotten that we were told, when we discussed this issue once before with the Commission and the Council at first reading, that the goal was to have everything settled within the next six months.
That was eighteen months ago.
We were told the same during this yearâs debate on the issue, namely that it would all be sorted out within the next six months.
I would therefore call on all those involved to ensure that this problem really is resolved without delay.
We should not leave people in the dark, and this includes mechanical engineers.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the Machinery Directive, on which we have to deliver a verdict, as much more than simply a technical internal market directive.
It illustrates that we in the European Union can make social legislation, even though we like to give it an economic twist.
The upshot of the negotiations illustrates that Parliament very much has what it takes to make the difference, and I am indebted to the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and to Mrs Weiler for the way in which they have dealt with this issue.
It is thanks to Parliament that consumers can no longer be led up the garden path and that the administrative burden for our companies will, as a result of markings other than CE, no longer be excessive.
Parliament also made sure that real inspection of the most dangerous machinery becomes possible and that this will not be a formality, but it is now up to the Member States to really make something of this directive and turn it into an ambitious working instrument.
That is why all Member States must get down to effective market control, for without this market control, this directive remains a paper tiger, as was already the case with the previous directive.
I would like to say to the Commissioner that the Commission should, in my view, closely monitor the Member Statesâ commitment, check whether they carry out this market inspection and if necessary in future, take an initiative if it were to transpire that they fail to deliver on their promises, in the interest of workers, consumers and manufacturers alike.
Our work is done for now, and I think that we will therefore be able to approve this directive tomorrow.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by MrsÂ Attwooll (A6-0341/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on women's networks: fishing, farming and diversification (2004/2263(INI)).
Â Â  .
Mr President, frequently in this House, speakers in a debate will pay some kind of tribute to the rapporteur. This ranges from a rather guarded expression of thanks for a great deal of hard work, to the offer of congratulations on the production of an excellent report.
Were I in that situation on the present occasion, I could not in all honesty take the congratulatory line, for I believe the report to have some obvious shortcomings.
That is not to say that it does not make very valuable points, or that there is anything in it with which I am in substantive disagreement.
I am very grateful, too, to colleagues for the interest that they have taken.
My concern is two-fold: first, the extent of redundancy in the text â there may be circumstances in which repetition is used to good effect, but I do not consider that this is one of them; secondly, the range of issues covered â I believe that the European Parliament should be taking seriously all aspects of the lives of women in the fisheries sector and doing its best to address the problems that affect them.
But the original intention of this report was to concentrate on the role of womenâs networks and their potential to contribute to the socio-economic fabric of fisheries-dependent communities.
We have mentioned two of the parallels between their situation and that of women similarly engaged in the agricultural sector and of the possibility of joint action on their parts.
That focus has been lost.
I find that unfortunate, since womenâs networks are central to achieving the other objectives itemised in the report.
So, I shall state quite simply and briefly what my own message to the Commission and Council would be: please give your encouragement and support to the creation and development of womenâs networks, at both domestic and pan-European levels.
Please also give your encouragement and support to their activities in diversifying local economies, in contributing to the development of the common fisheries policy and in providing a coordinated approach to tackling issues of common concern.
Encouragement and support, however, call for more than just a few kind words; they entail active assistance in accessing the necessary financial means and specific measures to remove all existing social and administrative barriers to womenâs full participation and progress in all areas of the fisheries sector.
Commissioner, thank you for listening.
I thank you, too, in anticipation of concrete actions to come.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report.
I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament and share the rapporteurâs commitment to equal opportunities in the fisheries sector.
I also share her opinion that the participation of womenâs networks is particularly important in this context.
In the next programming period, 2007-2013, the Commission will attach great importance to promoting the role of women in the fisheries sector.
The proposed European Fisheries Fund reflects the Commissionâs commitment to equal opportunities.
The future fund is even more specific about the role of women in fisheries than the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance.
The integration of the gender perspective is promoted during the various stages of implementing the Fund.
We will ask the Member States to ensure that operations to enhance the role of women in the fisheries sector are promoted.
The report under consideration calls on the Commission to provide active support for existing womenâs networks and the creation of new networks.
I am very pleased to inform you that the European Fisheries Fund proposal will support specific actions like networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities between men and women.
For the next programming period, the Commission suggests including the actions relating to networking and the exchange of experiences among organisations promoting equal opportunities in the Member Statesâ operational programmes. This replaces our past approach of launching calls for proposals for innovative actions directly managed by the Commission.
We believe that this option will have more added value than funding small-scale projects, which was the case under the innovative actions formula.
An ex-post evaluation of transnational projects for innovative actions was conducted in 2005.
One of the main findings of the evaluation was that the operational programme projects were more highly performing than the innovative action projects.
The evaluation also showed that the EU added value of the innovative actions, as well as the exchange of experiences and good practices were fairly limited.
In your report you called on the Commission to promote more vocational training and education specifically geared to the activities of women working in the sector.
I am pleased to announce that the European Fisheries Fundâs new priority â the sustainable development of fisheries areas â will make an important contribution to these needs.
Support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of multiple employment opportunities for fishers outside the sector.
Measures, such as the promotion and the improvement of professional skills, worker adaptability and access to employment, particularly in favour of women, are foreseen.
The measures aimed at the diversification of economic activities, as well as education and professional training, will be of particular benefit for women in fisheries-dependent areas.
The Commission also shares with you the concern about the difficulty in recruiting young people in the fisheries sector.
The sector suffers from a poor image with the younger generation and an effort has to be made to attract young people to join the profession.
In this regard under the European Fisheries Fund, we are considering more incentives for young fishers, in addition to the measures already foreseen under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance such as training, including training on health and safety, and the upgrading of professional skills.
There will also be limited assistance offered under the EFF for first-time young fishers entering the profession.
In addition, there will be increased possibilities for the participation of women in the decision-making process.
The new priority âsustainable development of fisheries areasâ will be implemented through a bottom-up approach.
The local actors, including womenâs associations, will be the motor in designing and implementing the local development strategies.
This new approach is a further opportunity for women at local level to get involved in decision-making and to ensure that their specific concerns are taken into account in the local development strategies.
