Men and women react differently to economic changes.
Financial institutions are not only dominated by men. More importantly, they continue and maintain gender structures in the economy.
Menâs and womenâs work is valued differently.
Womenâs work in the reproductive sphere is unpaid and has been rendered invisible.
These factors mean that women and men are affected differently, and a gender analysis is therefore incredibly important if we are to be able to design a trade policy that promotes equality and breaks down patriarchal structures.
Womenâs role in the economy must be made visible.
Trade policy negotiations must take practical account of all the conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, like other European Union documents, the report on prospects for women in international trade confirms that liberalisation, globalisation, and the free market are a paradise open only to very rich, well-educated and powerful individuals who are totally bereft of scruples.
This is borne out by one of the reportâs conclusions, which states that only highly qualified women benefit from trade liberalisation, and that the rest of the male and female population, which is generally not affluent, tends to be exploited and subjected to propaganda.
This is all the more disturbing because it is happening behind a faÃ§ade of lofty ideals such as human rights, equal rights, equal opportunities for all, equal treatment in the workplace and many other popular slogans that are, on the whole, light years removed from reality.
Â Â  World trade influences womenâs social status today in the same way as it does for all of those who are involved in some form of economic activity.
Trade liberalisation has had its benefits and its drawbacks.
The benefits associated with trade liberalisation and globalisation as far as women are concerned include, in particular, new and often well-paying jobs.
Employed women generally become more independent and self-confident, their social status improves, and they become more aware of their rights.
Compared with men, however, their compensation is in most cases 20 to 50% lower for the same work.
In the majority of instances, trade liberalisation benefits only big business.
As female entrepreneurs are most often employed in the management of small- and medium-sized companies, they effectively benefit from the opening up of markets only to a limited degree.
What has the World Trade Organisation done to further gender equality policy and make it a part of the WTO agenda?
The answer is, very little.
According to the WTO, trade is aÂ neutral area, based on the assumption that trade and market liberalisation are gender neutral, which means that gender equality policy has no direct involvement with this area.
In this context, IÂ think the WTO should pay more attention to gender equality in the future.
It is interesting to note that almost all WTO Member States have signed the Beijing Platform for Action.
Its implementation, however, is more than a formality.
It is necessary to keep in mind womenâs contribution to international trade.
Women in general, and educated, multilingual women in particular have excellent communication and negotiation skills, and as managers they employ methods that are different from their male counterparts.
Even though the participation of women in private sector trade is remarkable, we need to increase the number of women working in international organisations, such as the WTO, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other institutions dealing with trade and business.
This should ensure that women are not only part of the production process but also part of the decision-making process, and not only at lower levels but also in executive and managerial positions.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, every day thousands of people, mainly women and children, die due to poverty.
The figures are startling: 2.5Â billion people living on less than USDÂ 2 per day, and, as I said, most of them are women.
Poverty lies at the root of the trafficking of women and children, sexual slavery and gender-based violence.
It leads to the non-completion of schooling, to child labour, to increased numbers of children in danger, to illegal immigration, to fundamentalism and to terrorism.
Without financial independence, there is neither freedom nor equality.
Women, and especially young women, are easily recruited by international criminal gangs, who promise them well-paid jobs in wealthy countries only to throw them into forced prostitution.
Women do not generally benefit from globalisation, which tends to favour workers with good qualifications.
Rather, they tend to suffer the detrimental consequences of the liberalisation of trade.
This is a most timely report, on which I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Breyer.
It contains important proposals, of which I wish to highlight the use of microcredit as a means of reducing poverty.
Microfinancing instruments have proved effective in combating poverty and it is women who have benefited most and benefited best, and have succeeded in improving their familiesâ economic situation.
Unemployed women and those on low incomes â that is to say, women without access to the usual financial institutions, as is the case with most women in developing countries â have benefited particularly.
Studies have shown that women can take part in economic decision-making.
Further studies show that companies with women on their boards have gained better results.
Let us, too, follow the example of Norway, as mentioned earlier.
Â Â  â Madam President, not very long ago now, a report on trade and poverty put in an appearance in this House, and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality tabled a number of very good amendments to it, all of which were adopted.
It is with that in mind that I would like to thank MrsÂ Breyer for this own-initiative report, which is the logical response to the imperative need for the issue of the relative roles of trade and women to be once more addressed.
Nothing will be done about the problem of the unequal treatment of women for as long as there is no radical rethinking of economic and trade policies.
Do you remember trade agreements?
There was the Agnoletto report, which stated that human rights clauses should be incorporated in all international treaties.
Since there are both individual and social human rights, it follows that it is justified â to say the least â that all trade agreements should include clauses on human beingsâ social rights, namely the right to education, the right to training, and the right to free health care.
If you want those things â and we do â then you cannot, of course, want to implement a European services directive that makes them into market commodities and hence dependent on peopleâs ability to pay for them.
It is quite clear that that approach is eventually going to be taken to GATS, so that women in certain countries will be denied what opportunities they currently have, for those countries will not have the financial resources.
Turning to the subject of quotas, these are always crutches, but they can be bridges.
That I can tell you from my own experience as a member of the left-wing PDS party in the Federal Republic of Germany, which applies a 50% quota to all its parliamentarians, and that is something that should be brought in everywhere, for if it were, we and our society would have achieved a major advance.
Â Â  Madam President, the role and perspectives of women in international trade is something that has yet to be sufficiently analysed or promoted by the governments or those responsible for commercial policy.
Little is known about the impact of trade on women, and neither do we know anything about the effect of trade on gender inequalities.
We have seen very few examples of concrete policies in the sector for promoting equality between men and women.
This lack of knowledge is due to the lack of sufficient data differentiated by gender in the statistics on trade and also the lack of a gender perspective in economic models and analyses.
It is possible and necessary to contribute to gender equality by means of trade.
In this regard, we applaud, for example, the Norwegian Governmentâs decision to impose by law a 40% quota for womenâs participation on the boards of directors of limited companies.
In my country, Spain, too, a law is being negotiated, known as the equality law, which includes making it obligatory for there to be a balanced presence of men and women on the management boards of commercial companies, a balanced presence meaning that there must be no more than 60% of either sex and no less than 40%.
We therefore applaud MrsÂ Breyerâs amendment urging the Commission also to draw up a legislative proposal of this nature.
I would like to take this opportunity, MrsÂ Breyer, to congratulate you most warmly on your work.
Â Â  Madam President, even if we speak frequently about gender inequality issues, the role of women in international trade is neglected, and that is why I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because she raised that very important issue, which is very rarely debated.
Women are often negatively affected by the process of globalisation, as we heard, and I absolutely agree on that.
They do not have the same access to education and employment, and are not properly involved in trade.
They are often excluded from the decision-making process and from services.
As we know, only highly educated women benefit from liberalised trade, and women all over the world often suffer from the side-effects of globalisation and liberalisation.
That is why we all agree that equal treatment should become a reality, and in order to achieve it, clear monitoring of employment policies is necessary, together with collecting gender-disaggregated data.
Trade can be identified as one of the six priority areas for development policy.
Achieving gender equality is the key to development in general.
The strategy of gender mainstreaming is a long-term, step-by-step approach, based on integrating gender issues into both the political and the practical areas.
Development effectiveness requires that gender analysis should be systematically integrated into the conception, implementation and evaluation of all development strategies.
Development effectiveness makes it appropriate to envisage specific activities aimed at ensuring adequate attention to gender issues across the mainstream of Community financial instruments, which should increasingly assume responsibility for these key questions.
Strengthened womenâs representation and participation in economic and political life contributes significantly to poverty reduction and development and creates more hope for a better future for the next generation.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, economic liberalisation provided the basis for Estoniaâs rapid growth.
Liberalisation is now the motor for the economies of Europe and the world, but success has its price, which is increased emotional and economic pressure on families, the uncertainty of labour relations and social stratification.
Globalisation affects women more than it does men, as has been mentioned here.
Women bear a disproportionate share of unpaid work.
Their role in making political and economic decisions, however, is unjustifiably small.
This argument, which until now has taken place mostly on the level of emotions and beliefs, requires more facts.
The compilation of a scientific ranking of gender equity in the labour market would be an effective measure for the reduction of inequality, but one must also find the facts on oneâs own.
I have for some time called on Estonian society to set the objective of 40% female participation in the councils of companies.
What is possible in Norway could become a reality throughout the world.
The report also states the same position.
Europeâs message should be simple and unanimous â gender inequality is a thing of the past.
That is indeed the message of the report, which is an excellent document from which to move forward.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the honourable Members of Parliament for their comments on this significant area which touches upon many important facets over and above trade issues.
I should like to refer to some points raised during tonight's discussion.
As to the issue of European companies that profit from EU market access programmes, within the framework of EU cooperation policy that should not contribute to the exploitation of women employees, I must underline that recent EU cooperation agreements include commitments to the ILO core conventions on labour standards.
The EU has included commitments to the ILO core labour standards in all its recent bilateral trade agreements and the GSP and the GSP-plus, which provide trade preferences to developing countries that ratify ILO conventions.
On the impact of trade liberalisation, I should like to underline that this has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and, in many cases, reducing the gender gap in wages leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society.
The evidence suggests that over one million women in India have increased their social standing as a result of trade openings.
The majority of these are from poor backgrounds.
Let me now turn to the inclusion of gender equality in international trade policies, the European Union has been a strong supporter of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and more generally of the integration of decent work and social issues in the OECD investment activities.
We remain in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO, though we have to acknowledge that there is resistance from other members.
On gender-impact assessments, gender has been included in recent trade sustainability impact assessments.
As quality of gender data increases, the trade SIAs will be strengthened in the future, and certainly progress can be made in this area.
That is why the Commission will explore the potential of decent work indicators, including data on the work of women and men.
As regards the question of gender budgeting as a standard tool in budgetary policies, the Commission will respond in writing.
On the issue of gender budgeting more generally, that is an issue that covers many different areas of operation.
However, we look forward to hearing about the progress made on this issue from the European Parliament and we will follow the committeeâs work with interest.
With reference to the 40% quota for women on boards of joint stock companies, as in Norway, I must point out that this is primarily a matter for the individual Member States.
Finally, with regard to the formation of a formal trade and gender desk within DG Trade, I must underline again that within the Commission DG RELEX leads on the monitoring of human rights in third countries.
DG Trade liaises regularly with the RELEX family on human rights with regard to trade agreements, such as GSP, and liaises with the International Labour Organization and DG Employment on labour rights with regard to trade agreements.
The European Union, in fact, withdrew GSP from Myanmar for serious and systematic violations of the ILO core labour rights and this shows that the system currently in operation works well.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0266/2006) by MrÂ Guerreiro, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry (2006/2110(INI)).
Â Â  . â Madam President, I should first like to thank all the members of the Committee on Fisheries who made this report on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry possible.
The report was adopted unanimously.
I also wish to thank all of the organisations in the sector, who, by staunchly protecting fisheries and the workers in the sector, have helped the report to include a range of proposals that we feel address the serious social and economic crisis facing the sector.
We hope that Parliament will support that result in tomorrowâs vote.
Just a few days ago, at a meeting with a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries in the Algarve, representatives from the sector gave a description of the situation, which can be summed up as follows: the fishing industry is facing a serious economic and social crisis that has been getting worse over the years.
This difficult situation has been exacerbated by rising production costs, in particular the cost of fuel, along with the stagnation of first-sale prices, all of which threatens the financial viability of many firms and has had a terrible impact on crews, whose wages depend on income from catches and, to a large extent, on the cost of fuel.
The common fisheries policy has fallen short, by promoting the regular, significant scrapping of vessels, resulting in thousands of fishermen leaving a sector that is of strategic importance to some Member States.
What is needed is to reverse the common fisheries policy pursued to date, in that it should acknowledge the particular characteristics of each countryâs fishing industry and the right to fish sustainably while allowing fish stocks to recover.
The policy should be aimed at feeding the people, full employment, improving the social conditions of the workers, and ensuring the sustainability of companies.
The sector will move forward if practical measures are put in place: emergency measures to address the sharp rises in fuel prices, such as the creation of the guarantee fund, direct temporary support to offset the cost of diesel fuel and petrol, and an increase in aid under the rule.
There should also be a range of measures to guarantee the income of those working in the sector, for example in the setting of first-sale prices, which entails a review of the current rules of the common organisation of the market in fishery products.
Studies should be carried out aimed at identifying measures to increase the value of fish, with a view to channelling the added value into the manufacturing sector without the consumer being penalised.
Support should be provided for modernising and renewing national fishing fleets, which would mean a definitive end to the policy of the indiscriminate scrapping of vessels.
There also needs to be a targeted support programme for traditional, small-scale inshore fishing.
These were the measures proposed by the sector at its meeting with Parliament.
Although it has described the situation in the industry as serious, the Commission has proposed measures that fall well short of addressing it.
The difficulties currently facing the fishing sector are rooted mainly in the problem of the cost structure, as costs are high in relation to the income obtained.
These costs have suddenly been exacerbated by the steep rise in the cost of fuel, which is why the proposed solution of reducing fishing effort and adapting â in other words, cutting â the fleet will not solve the problem.
What is needed is to improve the economic situation in the sector, which above all means addressing the problem of the balance between falling incomes and rising operational costs in the sector.
Similarly, given that successive restrictions on fishing have served to worsen the economic situation in the sector, albeit this is not the only factor, it is difficult to understand why they would be even considered, let alone accepted, as measures to improve the economic situation in the sector.
As the sector itself has highlighted, extraordinary situations demand extraordinary measures, and that means exhausting all possibilities and stretching the financial limits of the Community budget this year, not least because what is at stake is a common Community policy, the common fisheries policy, which, to be consistent, should be responsible for funding its own costs, within the framework of the European Fisheries Fund.
I shall finish by stating once again that the fisheries sector has potential and a future and it should not be pitted against aquaculture.
New priorities demand more resources and new resources.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Guerreiro, for his report, and the Fisheries Committee for having taken up this important subject in the form of an own-initiative report.
It brings a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the economic situation of the European Union fishing sector.
I also noted with satisfaction that the Conference of Committee Chairmen expressed its appreciation of the Commissionâs communication on the economic difficulties of the sector.
The Conference of Committee Chairmen welcomed the positions expressed by the Commission in its communication, in which it envisages a number of possibilities for aiding the sector in the short term, in the existing context of Community legislation on State aids; in particular, our willingness to examine the national rescue and restructuring aid schemes, submitted by Member States in the two years following publication of the communication.
I shall therefore also touch upon some of the recommendations of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, which converge largely with those of the report we are discussing.
We share the same concerns and objectives regarding the fishing sector.
We agree with many of the proposals and assessments contained in your report, although we have different views and perspectives on some others regarding, for instance, the short-term support to be given to the sector.
Let me state from the beginning that I strongly disagree with the statement that the Commission appears to take advantage of the current economic crisis to reduce the size of the fishing fleet.
By calling a spade a spade, by highlighting the state that the Community fishery is in because of years of over-fishing, we are not taking advantage of anything.
I also find unfair the suggestion that we have done too little, too late.
The imbalance between fleet capacity and available resources and the oil price increase are objective causes of the current difficulties faced by the sector.
The Commission has done everything possible to help the sector, taking into account the parameters of Community legislation and the need to ensure that the aid actually contributes to fishing sustainability.
No mandatory capacity reductions are foreseen under Community law.
Indeed, our challenge has been to balance the necessity to help the segments most affected by high oil prices with the need to address long-term structural problems.
We have, therefore, sought to design instruments to rescue and restructure fishing enterprises in difficulty, to help them adapt and become profitable within the context of high oil prices.
It is no use giving aid to fishing enterprises in difficulty if they do not, or cannot, undertake the restructuring that will make them profitable again.
For that reason, we have excluded from the rescue schemes all forms of operating aid, which apart from going against Community legislation, will only prolong the problem without solving it.
Action can be taken in the short term by Member States willing to provide support for financial and physical restructuring of fishing enterprises in difficulty, in the framework of national rescue and restructuring schemes.
That is precisely meant to allow fishing enterprises in difficulty to obtain loan capital and bail them out, as requested both in your report and in that of the Conference of Committee Chairmen on the work programme of the Commission.
The Community is strongly committed to these rescue and restructuring schemes, since Community funds will be available mainly through the European Fisheries Fund, to cofinance the restructuring of fishing enterprises, as well as to alleviate their social consequences.
Socio-economic support can indeed be provided through the EFF, as requested in your report.
The new EFF will also provide for more advantageous conditions for scrapping vessels, which was a concern expressed both in your report and that of the Conference of Committee Chairmen.
Besides EFF support, we have worked hard to establish new rules for aid, in collaboration with the Commissionâs other services, in order to facilitate the handling of small State aid schemes by Member States.
This goes in the direction of your request, which point was also made by the Conference of Committee Chairmen.
You must appreciate that our proposal already represents a tenfold increase on the former threshold, which was fixed less than two years ago.
We have also noted the request for a specific treatment of the long-distance fleet, expressed both in your report and that of the Committee Chairmen.
We are prepared to consider if, and under what conditions, a special register for this segment of the fleet would be justified.
Beyond the rescue and restructuring of fishing firms in difficulty, we must create in the long term an environment that is conducive to their sustainable success.
The communication therefore highlights some policy areas that I want to develop in the coming years to create this more favourable environment.
I am not going to repeat them here, but I would like to highlight some areas where our views converge.
We fully agree on the need to better involve fishermen in the management of fisheries.
That is crucial for the success of the reformed common fisheries policy and I am determined to move in that direction.
Due attention will also be paid to the financing of regional advisory councilsâ operation.
In line with your recommendations, we have taken serious steps to strengthen the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) at international level.
Our 2002 action plan is being updated and a new piece of legislation is being considered.
That has been given high priority in our agenda.
We share the view that small-scale coastal fishing has specificities that deserve to be taken into account. We have done it extensively, both in the rescue and restructuring schemes and in the EFF.
We have launched a study to assess objectively whether more can be done.
We also agree with you that special attention needs to be paid to marketing, with a view to increasing the added value of fishing products for fishermen.
As mentioned also by the Conference of Committee Chairmen, research should also be pursued in the Seventh Framework Programme to help address some of the most important challenges of the sector.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you once again for your contributions and interest.
They demonstrate how much we all strive to ensure a sustainable and healthy future for the fishing sector.
I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion with you.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, our rapporteur set himself a very difficult task.
Efforts to regulate the situation of specific professional groups carry with them a considerable temptation to heighten social sensitivity, which then often turns into hypersensitivity when short-term political needs accumulate.
Our rapporteur hails from the Left of the Chamber and chose his own âthird wayâ, deeming the economic situation of the fishing sector to be an extraordinary problem, requiring the Commission to take extraordinary measures.
The essence of MrÂ Guerreiroâs stance is illustrated by amendments such as AmendmentÂ 23, which describes the social impact of economic solutions.
In these amendments, the Commission is strongly urged to create new instruments for creating economic programmes that will guarantee the growth of funding in particular.
More moderate opinions are reflected in the amendments relating to long-term maritime policy such as AmendmentsÂ 3 and 5.
They do not play down the need to keep a between a sustainable income and the taxation of fisheries and a specific form and level of social aid.
This principle should be applied not only to long-term activities leading to the sustainable development of fisheries, but also short-term actions such as the replacement of engines and fishing equipment.
MrÂ Guerreiroâs report is important to the Community fisheries policy and was also the subject of detailed scrutiny in the Committee on Fisheries.
The final version represents the result of multilateral negotiations and a determined effort to arrive at a version with which Members could be satisfied.
It received the unanimous support of our committee.
The European Parliament should support this document in the conviction that two fundamental issues for European fisheries are to be covered by the regulatory process for European fisheries, namely a broadly-focused economic strategy and everyday matters that are closer to the hearts of those in the sector.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, the fishing industry uses a great deal of energy, and as such it has been especially badly hit by the rise in fuel prices, a problem that has worsened an already precarious economic situation.
A challenge such as that faced by this sector requires solutions that, in trying to improve the situation, do not make matters worse.
I refer to responses such as across-the-board regulations that are cannot be properly monitored or that are ill-matched to the specific conditions of the sector that they are regulating.
Rather, what are needed are regulations that take account of particular situations in all their complexity.
It is generally held that the best way forward is to reduce fishing effort, to use more selective methods, and to introduce positive discrimination in favour of local, small-scale fishing, which is the best way of keeping fish fresh.
In the case in question, however, these general objectives may have to be achieved by means of an increase in the engine capacity and the size of the vessels, which will afford more comfort and safety at work, and by means of investment in diversification into activities such as tourism.
An overly detailed, centralised legislative fabric, far removed from its practical implementation and its actual impact on the situations it is designed to regulate, leads to a proliferation of illegal, unreported and unregulated catches within and outside the Community area.
This in turn widens the gap between the imagined world of the legislation and the real world of the European fish market.
The common fisheries policy needs to be thoroughly decentralised and local fishermen, their representative bodies and the fishing communities must be much more involved in this policy and in improving fisheries management.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organisationâs manual on preserving the quality of fish, the key principle of a sustainable fisheries policy is to prevent the tragedy of the commons; in other words, if something has no known owner, be it buffalo or fish, everyone will rush to exploit it and will eventually destroy it.
Consequently, it is only by extending responsibility to fishermen and involving them directly that we can think of improving their economic situation on a sustainable basis.
Â Â  I agree with the rapporteurâs idea that in regard to improving the economic condition of the fishery sector we need to table the proposals for the attainment of objectives both in the immediate future and in the follow-up monitoring of the measures aimed at triggering material changes in the medium- and long-term.
Since the sector is especially sensitive to the impact of natural conditions, we must develop a system of compensation for losses incurred due to factors beyond our control.
It is necessary to develop a national and Community-level state insurance system that would help the fishery sector survive in the face of natural crises.
Similar measures have already been put in place in other sectors.
I would like to say that I fully support the short-time measures proposed by the rapporteur.
As for long-time measures, sufficient investment in the framework fisheries research program is of paramount importance, especially with a view to enhancing energy efficiency.
The European Fisheries Fund should continue aiding the upgrading and modernisation of the European Fleet.
In this respect I would like to draw your attention to the need to thoroughly consider the proposals included in the previous resolutions of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Madam President, fishing-dependent communities in Scotland have suffered a drastic downturn in their economic wellbeing in recent years, directly as a result of political decisions made under the common fisheries policy â decisions made with the active cooperation of the Scottish and the UK Governments.
Large numbers of vessels have been forcibly scrapped, the remainder are forcibly restricted to ports for half of each month; and, on top of all that, fuel prices have drastically increased.
The effect on fishing communities, on the families who depend upon the catching and processing sectors, has been very serious and very stressful.
Regrettably, Scotlandâs coastal communities continue to suffer while its own Government repeatedly declines to make use of available opportunities to make financial assistance available.
Our rapporteur takes the view that greater decentralisation of the CFP would be an improvement, and I agree that would be a step in the right direction.
However, ultimately, I regret to say that the CFP is destined to fail; and the scrapping of the CFP, coupled with a change in government in Scotland, is the only hope for fishing communities in the long-term future in Scotland.
Â Â  . â Madam President, allow me to congratulate my colleague, MrÂ Guerreiro, on his report, which is remarkable and very thorough.
Let us be clear.
Fishing in general, and small-scale fishing in particular, are, in Europe, in danger of dying out.
If nothing is done, there will no longer be any small-scale fishermen in 15 yearsâ time within the territory of the European Union.
If there are no longer any small-scale fishermen, then all of the tourist and economic activity from sales by auction and specialist catering will also disappear.
Without the presence of those who are, first and foremost, sea lovers, the odds are that the Member Statesâ territorial waters will be abandoned, in that case, to the atrocities of the hooligans of the sea, who fear neither God nor man.
How can one fail to understand the desire of some people to see fishing disappear when it is clear that the disappearance of certain fishing ports could offer new prospects of developing the pleasure-boat market, something that would not leave the particularly influential economic and financial interests indifferent?
In order to support my argument and to prove that the aim is indeed one of putting paid to fishing, I invite you to refer to the scandalous and criminal decision taken by the Commission, which, on the pretext of a distortion of competition and at the very time when the price of diesel fuel has not stopped rising, has put an end, in France, to the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing, with the result that the entire profession has been put in a very difficult position.
As the report recommends, this fund for the prevention of risks to fishing should have been extended to the entire Union, not banned by the Commission.
It also seems necessary to me to demand central buying offices for supermarkets, with the prices taking account of the real costs incurred by small-scale fishermen.
To conclude, I believe that, if we are to reverse the trend and save European fishing, it is important for us to adopt this report and, above all, for the Commission very swiftly to implement the proposals it contains.
Â Â  . Madam President, I welcome this motion for a resolution, which highlights the detrimental effect that high fuel prices are having on the fishing industry, resulting in job losses and severe problems in fishing communities.
I agree with the proposal that a guarantee fund should be set up to ensure the stability of fuel prices in a level playing field for the Community.
I agree that the Commission paper of last spring is insufficient, particularly in relation to short-term aid.
That temporary tie-up funding is part of a rescue and restructuring package severely curtails its usefulness as a support measure; and that the aid ceiling has only increased to EUR 30Â 000 over 3 years is also very restrictive and inequitable in relation to other sectors.
The fishing industry is in crisis and the Commission paper has not helped.
It remains to be seen whether its medium- and long-term measures will be any better.
I support recommendations that a review of the common organisation of the markets would provide for greater assistance to fishermen and their organisations to become more involved in the marketing and production of fish.
I also agree that fish imports from outside the EU should be subject to the same conditions and should at least be legal.
I agree that the EFF reduced funding is insufficient.
This will be a problem for the restructuring of fishing fleets by implementing decommissioning schemes.
Â Â  Madam Chairman, I share the disappointment expressed in this report at the inadequacy of the Commissionâs response to the crisis in the fishing industry, but I will not pretend to be surprised.
For the Commission, socio-economic pressures are, I fear, something to be exploited rather than alleviated, because fundamentally, in pursuit of the common fisheries policy the Commission desires savage reduction in fishing effort.
Mr Commissioner, deny it as you will, but is that not the truth of the matter that these socio-economic pressures help you attain that goal?
There can be no doubting the depth of the crisis, with, across the EU, a 35% fall in jobs in ten years, falling prices, falling catches, a 40% dependence on imports, and a 100% hike in fuel prices in the last two years.
There is no doubt about any of that, but there is much room to doubt the worth of the Commissionâs response.
Such permitted assistance as there is in that response, is for many regions, particularly in the United Kingdom, likely to be more theoretical than real because of national governmentsâ resistance to match funding or any form of state aid.
Here, Commissioner, we come to a matter I would like you to focus on: a glaring flaw in the common fisheries policy.
How can you deliver a common fisheries policy if some governments avail of options and some do not?
Oh yes, we all get to share the downside of binding CFP regulations and quotas and restrictions, but not all get to share the upside which flows from permitted assistance.
The result is a fisheries policy of disparity, not of commonality; and until the Commission and this House find a way to address that issue, even its modest proposals here will accentuate the difference between the haves and the have-nots under the common fisheries policy.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being here.
Like all of my fellow Members, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this timely report, since, as previous speakers have said, there is no denying the serious economic situation being experienced by the fisheries sector, which has mainly been damaged over the last two years by the rising prices of fuel.
Precisely when we need to tackle this situation, however, the lack of commitment and support contained in the Commissionâs Communication is regrettable, since it only provides for measures offering a long-term solution and, even then, they are the most painful solutions for the sector, such as restructuring of the fleet.
Given the current situation, however, we also need short-term solutions, and the Commission has ignored these completely.
Not only is the minimal aid announced ridiculous compared to that offered to other production sectors, but also the Commission is still failing to fulfil its promise to publish the regulation authorising it and which we have been waiting for for more than two years.
This is inexplicable given that, furthermore, this type of aid is exclusively national and does not therefore imply any additional cost to the Unionâs budget.
As MrÂ Guerreiro has said, we have just returned from a visit to the Algarve and, a few months before that, we were in Greece.
We are all aware of the fisheries situation in our own countries, and I therefore believe that this document offers the minimum support we politicians must provide for the fisheries sector at this time.
I too would therefore urge that it be approved tomorrow in plenary.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the exceptional work in his report.
As you know, the fishing industry makes an important contribution to the prosperity and to the economic and social fabric of coastal and island areas and to the maintenance of their cohesion.
It also makes a contribution to the supply of fisheries products with a high organic value, to the employment of a large number of workers in related industries and to the maintenance of local cultural traditions.
I think that it would be a good idea to create a Community support programme for coastal and small-scale fisheries using traditional methods, especially in my country, Greece, where it is the basic source of income for thousands of families in island and remote areas.
There should also be direct Community aid due to the increase in fuel costs.
To close, I agree with the rapporteur that the eco-labelling could significantly promote product differentiation and provide a fundamental incentive for a sustainable fishing trade.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the points made in MrÂ Guerreiro's report have the merit of being a positive response to the demands made in recent years by fishing operators, and therefore they should clearly be taken on board in the Commissionâs decision.
The report comes out strongly in defence of employment levels in this sector, which comprises 90Â 000 vessels and employs some 190Â 000 workers in Europe.
Previous fisheries directives led to considerable job losses, with the result that Europe now imports 40% of its needs.
Over the last 10 years, 35% of jobs and 20% of vessels have been lost, in an industry concentrated above all in regions with a weak and particularly fragile economy.
One of the most important points in the report that I should like to highlight is its appeal to the Commission to guarantee and support the operation and adoption of measures to remedy the high instability of fuel prices, both by creating a guarantee fund for the sector with Community participation, and by implementing the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance in order to reduce operating costs to a minimum.
The period for rescue aid must be extended to 12 months, and the ceiling raised from EURÂ 30Â 000 to EURÂ 100Â 000.
The European Fisheries Fund must continue to grant aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet, in particular to allow the replacement of engines, so as to guarantee crew safety and environmental protection.
The role of research in this area must not be forgotten either.
Research needs to be performed and developed to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs and ensure protection for fish stocks and fishing systems.
If we just bear those points in mind, we can help those parts of the weakest regions in the European economic system that have close links with fishing to protect their jobs and to continue supplying Europeâs consumers.
Â Â  â Madam President, congratulations to the rapporteur on his report.
The fishing industry is in a bad way and is shrinking constantly.
It is estimated that over the last 10 years the number of fishermen has fallen by 4 to 5% per annum, the number of vessels has fallen by 20% and the quantities landed have fallen by 28%; the only thing that has increased has been the cost of fishing.
For example, fuel costs have risen by 100%, while fishermen's incomes have fallen by 25% since 2004.
Support measures need to be taken.
I am delighted that the Commission has been the first to establish the need to take support measures.
I am less than delighted that the measures provided for are inadequate.
We need to make use of every possibility for granting aid from the Community budget for the remainder of the 2006 financial year.
We need tax relief, because otherwise fishing undertakings will not be able to compete with undertakings from third countries, as they have triple the operating costs.
We need to increase compensation and we need to increase the period of support to 12 months.
We need â as we all acknowledge â to have measures to protect the seas, but we also need to support Community fishermen who, in the last analysis, are the only ones fishing under environmental protection rules.
In the long term, the replacement of engines without reducing their power must be supported.
The sea conceals many dangers.
We do not want our fishermen to drown; that is why they must have new, safe engines for their protection.
Coastal fishing must be supported due to its important social role.
We need to take measures to combat pollution of the seas and measures to combat illegal fishing, so as to protect fish stocks.
Finally, the fishing industry must be saved, because fishermen are an important part of tradition, civilisation and European culture.
In addition, may I remind you, they provide consumers with healthy food.
Â Â  Madam President, in general terms, we take a positive view of this Commission Communication, since we believe that it responds to the sectorâs demands in that it seeks solutions to ensure the viability and sustainability of the fisheries sector and to guarantee that it has a viable future.
We also welcome the immense work of the rapporteur, MrÂ Guerreiro.
We would also say to the Commission that we believe it to be necessary to improve and extend some of the measures contained in that Communication, such as those relating to improving marketing and those relating to research into the development of more efficient energy use.
We also need more ambition when it comes to promoting innovative actions to increase the presence of fishermen in the commercial chain and improve their living and working conditions, as well as their level of training.
I am therefore in favour of the Commissionâs proposal to carry out a review of the current COM.
Improving the marketing of fish and fisheries products would increase their added value, Commissioner.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission communication on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry, which, in itself, is indicative of the fact that something must be done to help the sector, with the emphasis on the weakest areas of the common fisheries policy (CFP).
The purpose of the CFP is to guarantee and preserve the balance between the economic and social development of fishing communities and the sustainable management of fishing resources.
It should be noted that, with respect to both aspects of this common policy, the fishermen and their communities are often in a situation that is as vulnerable as, or more vulnerable than, the situation in which many of the threatened species find themselves.
I am not suggesting that we need to jettison the sustainability of resources in favour of the sectorâs economic viability, because that would lead to the collapse of environmental sustainability and of these fishermenâs future.
The Commission communication makes its diagnosis, yet fails to provide the solutions that the sector needs and that are largely mentioned in the report by MrÂ Guerreiro, whom I take this opportunity to congratulate.
The consequence of the balance between the two strands of the CFP is that we must invest in promoting more selective methods, in small-scale fishing, in aquaculture, in scientific research and in socio-economic aid.
This aid must compensate for the permanent loss of income arising from the disappearance of jobs, and for the reduction in income resulting from recovery plans and from far-reaching changes in cost-effectiveness due to external circumstances.
That is precisely the case of the current difficulties arising from the rise in fuel prices.
The Commission must do more in this area.
Similarly, some Member States should make better use of existing opportunities.
Thought must also be given to the process of setting the price of fish.
It is unacceptable that fishermen should simply take what they are given as regards price-setting, when the price to the consumer is sometimes double that of the first-sale price.
Thought must be given, moreover, to support for producer organisations, albeit within existing legislative frameworks, in order to ensure greater fairness and to protect those who sustain the sector.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, we all agree on the economic and social importance of the fisheries sector in the EU and on the Commissionâs diagnosis that the situation is critical.
Similarly, no one doubts MrÂ Borgâs sensitivity to the problem or his desire to minimise the impact within the limits of currently available resources.
The responses put forward by the Commission, however, fall well short of what was needed and the sector considers them disappointing.
This is particularly true of small-scale coastal fishing, which is the most socially vulnerable part of the industry.
If there had been any doubts, they would have been completely dispelled by the missions undertaken this year by the Committee on Fisheries in Greece, Italy, France and, in recent days, Portugal.
The Commission communication and the report before us â and I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur â are right to warn of an unsustainable situation that must not be allowed to go on.
We cannot have a common policy that imposes Community-level restrictions and then leaves it to the Member States to cherry-pick the problems they solve depending on the funds they have available.
The Community must respond quickly to the problems of fuel prices, which several previous speakers have mentioned, the stagnation of the price of fish, and the renewal of the fleet without increasing capacity.
I therefore hope that Parliament adopts the report and that the Commission ensures that it is put into practice.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, fishing is an important part of the Unionâs economy, yet it has been in crisis for many years.
There is an imbalance between excessively large catches and the resources available.
Greater exploitation of the fishing grounds has contributed to the problem of overfishing, which is now common and occurs in most waters.
The increased cost of fuel leads to higher operating costs.
We should remember that many economically weak regions are dependent on the fisheries sector.
On the one hand, we have environmentalists and the views expressed by many scientists, drawing our attention to the disastrous situation of the resources in our seas and oceans, and on the other hand we have to think about the fisheries, the fishermen and their families.
We need to find a golden mean, so that we can have our cake and eat it.
Both short and long-term measures are called for if we are to overcome the difficulties afflicting this sector.
These measures include fishing quotas, restrictions on fishing time, a wide range of subsidies and other forms of assistance.
Difficult changes and adjustments must therefore be devised.
Intervention by the European Union is required if we are to tread the straight and narrow path of sustainable development.
Scientists, civil servants and fishermen must all unite in order to overcome the difficulties in this sector.
It was unfortunate that at its December Summit the European Council cut funding for the European Fisheries Fund from around EURÂ 4.9Â billion to EURÂ 3.8Â billion for the period 2007-2013.
The Unionâs fishing industry really needs these financial resources.
Fisheries could be viewed as maritime versions of farms.
They do more than simply supply consumers with healthy food and represent more than a source of income for people living in coastal areas.
They are also part of a rich culture and heritage.
Much like farming, fishing is dependent on nature.
It is therefore necessary to understand the specific nature of fishing and consider the ecosystem as a whole.
Only then will we be able to pull the fishing sector out of its state of crisis.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for the various points they have raised.
I will try to respond to some of them.
Firstly, with regard to the need for a guarantee fund, the basic problem with guarantee funding is that it can amount to operating aid, which is not permissible under competition rules. We are looking further into this and welcome any proposals from Member States on how such funds may be operated in accordance with competition rules.
The Commission could approve such schemes at national level if they guaranteed reimbursement of all public aid under commercial conditions.
As regards the long-term aim to help the industry adapt to high fuel prices, the Commission places a high priority on research and development for more fuel-efficient and more environmentally friendly fishing techniques.
Significant funds are being provided to support such work under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research.
Renewable energy, in particular biofuels, represents one such measure.
Research on the design of new, more selective or more fuel-efficient fishing gear is encouraged and can be funded under the framework programme, with initial acquisition of such equipment also financeable under the European Fisheries Fund.
The European Fisheries Fund, agreed to last June, provides for engine renewals and, in this regard, small-scale vessels are treated more favourably.
In fact, regarding small-scale coastal fisheries, we have catered for specificities in the rescue and restructuring scheme and in the European Fisheries Fund.
One example is the acquisition of new engines or engine renewal.
We are studying what else can be done in order to help small-scale coastal fisheries.
Regarding the comment by Mr Allister and others that the Commission is taking advantage of the increase in fuel prices to reduce the fleet, let me repeat the facts as I know them.
There have been years on end of over-fishing and this has caused falling catches.
This means a vast over-capacity today: we have vessels with a capacity vastly exceeding what can sustainably be caught.
Those are the facts.
The vast majority of stocks are being fished in a completely unsustainable manner.
Acknowledging this will help us find solutions for the long-term benefit of future fishermen.
If we continue to bury our heads in the sand, we will only prolong the agony before fisheries die a natural death through continued over-fishing.
We agree that special attention needs to be paid to marketing with a view to increasing the added value of fishery products for fishermen.
We are actively looking at this and the renewal of the common organisation of the market should answer the sectorâs concerns in this area, in particular by helping the sector to improve first-sale prices.
The ceiling of 30Â 000 proposed by the Commission is a balanced and reasonable compromise.
The Commission has proposed raising the ceiling from the previous amount of 3000 to 30Â 000.
The review of this threshold has been carried out in the light of the specific characteristics of fishing enterprises, independently of the sectorâs current difficulties.
It was commented that the Commission was proposing too little too late.
I acknowledge that the communication was issued later than desired, but one has to appreciate the complexity of the situation we are dealing with and the constraints of Community legislation, in particular regarding competition rules.
This is why it was important to describe carefully the rules and conditions necessary for designing rescue and restructuring schemes.
Many fishing enterprises will benefit from the measures proposed if Member States take up the challenge and prepare the necessary framework swiftly.
These measures are substantial: financial restructuring, renewal of engines and of fishing gear and aid to temporary cessation.
According to the guidelines, state aid for the rescue and restructuring of SMEs in the area of fisheries can cover up to 75% of the total cost of a rescue and restructuring plan.
May I suggest that we work together and do our utmost to make the best use of these possibilities.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â We are all aware of the difficult situation in which the fishing industry finds itself, in view of the ongoing and, in some cases, serious depletion of fish stocks, the cuts imposed on fishing activities and the rising costs of certain production factors.
The industry plays a major role in our development economy, in the sustainable management of marine resources and in the achievement of full employment in coastal communities.
In order to support and promote the sector, it is essential, in our view, to invest in modernising the fleet, training fishery workers and improving the living and working conditions of seafarers.
We cannot just push for a restructuring of the sector without taking into account the damaging effects on full employment: the measures called for by the Commission are reasonable but insufficient.
In short, I fully support the reportâs specific and detailed proposals.
Â Â  MrÂ Guerreiroâs report on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry worries me a lot.
The way in which the Communityâs fishing fleet conducts its activities will lead to the oceans becoming irrevocably depleted of fish, and all to protect an industry that is uncompetitive internationally.
Allow me to give an example.
At the beginning of September, the Commission presented a proposal on fishing in the Baltic Sea.
The ICES, or International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, again repeated the demand for a total ban on cod fishing in the eastern Baltic, but the Commission believes that it is enough for it to be reduced by 15%.
This shows very clearly that the EU does not put the environment first but, rather, seeks the best for industry.
The last remark requires qualification, however, because the fishing industry will die out once the seas are depleted of fish.
A global view of what is just should be adopted when the EUâs fisheries policy is discussed.
The rapporteur says explicitly that the EUâs fishing fleet is forced to compete with third countriesâ fleets.
The latter have much lower costs, and their products are consequently cheaper.
By introducing tax relief, which is definitely not something for the Community to do, MrÂ Guerreiro wishes to distort the international market and thus deprive poor people of their only means of income.
That is frightening and, at the same time, very tragic.
The EU is, however, showing its true face in this case: that of an uncompetitive economy that is prepared to do anything to protect its production, at the same time as excluding the worldâs poor.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0265/2006) by Mr Albert Jan Maat on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a management plan for fisheries exploiting stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea (COM(2005)0714 â C6-0034/2006 â 2006/0002(CNS)).
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries for the preparation of this report concerning the Commissionâs proposal for a long-term plan for the management of plaice and sole fisheries.
This is an important topic.
Since the Commission first began discussing the long-term management of these stocks and fisheries in 2004, there has been a significant worsening of the state of these stocks.
In particular, the size of the sole stock is now declining rapidly due to low numbers of incoming young fish.
High fuel prices and lower catch rates have combined to create a very difficult situation for this sector and this fits very well into what I have been saying before.
The Commissionâs proposal is intended to reverse this trend by leading to more efficient and more profitable fisheries and I am keen to see it adopted soon so that fisheries can begin to recover and to improve.
I thank you, therefore, for this report and I now turn to the specific amendments that you propose.
I can support Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 18 and 21.
However, I should mention that the Commission has already begun a debate, as requested in Amendment 4, with the regional advisory councils concerning the implementation of maximum sustainable yield management and has also already arranged for the impact assessment foreseen in Amendment 5.
The final text should reflect the fact that these measures requested by Parliament have already taken place.
I can accept in principle that there could be a two-step approach in long-term plans, and that different measures would apply in situations where stocks are outside safe biological limits from those applicable in situations where stocks are within those limits.
Therefore, I can accept the principles behind Amendments 1, 7, 9 and 10.
However, it is important to improve the state of the stock and the finances of the industry.
More consultations with the sector and the Member States concerned will be needed to refine the details, as will careful consideration of the results of the impact analysis.
I fully support provisions to revise long-term targets at periodic intervals of about five years in order to take account of changes in the environment and the ecosystems.
However, I am not in a position to accept Parliamentâs amendments intended to provide stability for the industry by setting TACs that are stable for three-year periods.
Stability for the industry can better be provided by limiting changes to TACs between years.
The North Sea RAC has revised its opinion on this topic and in its latest advice no longer advises such a measure.
Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment 8, the second paragraph of Amendment 9, nor Amendments 10, 11 and 24.
Concerning Amendment 12, I can accept the widening of scope to include a wider definition of fishing effort for plaice and sole, though a more precise legal wording may be necessary.
However, here again, I cannot support a proposal that effort limits be adapted only at three-yearly intervals.
Concerning Amendment 13, a legislative text for a long-term plan must define clearly how efforts should be adjusted in order to achieve the targets of the plan.
Parliamentâs text does not seem clear enough from a legal and technical point of view.
Advice from scientific committees indicates that significant amounts of cod are caught and are discarded.
As the plaice and sole fisheries exert mortality on cod, it is necessary to keep this mortality under review and to adjust relevant efforts if necessary.
This is why I am not in a position to accept Amendment 14, because it would create a non-equitable situation in comparison with other fisheries sectors that also have an impact on cod and are subject to cod-recovery measures.
Amendment 15 asks for a change in the log-book tolerance from 8% to 10%.
However, the 8% figure was adopted in the Council as a common value in other long-term plans after a long discussion.
I believe this figure should be retained for plaice and sole as for the other long-term plans.
The practical implementation of Amendments 16 or 17 would require that fisheries inspectors be able to distinguish between plaice or sole caught in the North Sea and fish of these species caught in other areas, a task which does not seem possible.
I can accept the principle and intentions behind Amendments 6, 19, 22 and 23, but I believe it should be implemented in a different way.
The Commission is preparing an evaluation of technical measures and the regulation of fishing gears should be reviewed as soon as possible in that context.
If either plaice or sole enters into biologically very high-risk situations, the Council should be more cautious in setting fishing opportunities.
This is consistent with the guiding principles of the common fisheries policy and will provide additional protection to stocks that are in their most vulnerable state.
For this reason, I cannot accept Amendment 20.
In conclusion, I thank Parliament for its careful scrutiny of this document.
Raising and addressing the issues I have just mentioned will, I am sure, improve the quality and efficiency of the regulation that is eventually agreed in order to achieve the objective of improving the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stocks of plaice and sole, as well as reducing discarding.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I am indebted to the Commissioner for starting this debate on a good note, for I notice that he is meeting Parliament half-way on a number of issues.
Whilst I share his concern with regard to the development of the plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea, it is at the same time becoming clear that this is not related to the fishing effort, but may be attributable to climate changes that cannot always be fully explained.
To make it absolutely clear, though, I do share his concern in this respect.
I am pleased that he is nevertheless moving towards Parliament in a number of areas.
One important point of criticism that I made with regard to the Commissionâs working method was that the proposal was tabled before the North Sea Regional Advisory Council had issued its recommendation.
That does not strike me as going about things the right way.
It appears to me essential that, if we want to retain a support base for fisheries, we should accord these Regional Advisory Councils a fully-fledged place in the debate and that we get them to make a contribution prior to the debate as well.
I am saying this emphatically because those Regional Advisory Councils not only involve fisheries organisations, but also the Word Nature Fund and other nature organisations.
That is precisely the sort of thing that injects stability and provides a support base for policy in a certain region.
With regard to the application of the objectives for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), I am pleased that the Commission has just now issued the communication on that subject which was still missing prior to the management plan for sole and plaice, although it had, in fact, already presented the MSY objectives.
My criticism is mainly to do with the fact that that did happen for sole and plaice, but not for a number of other management plans, for example the Gulf of Biscay.
It also strikes me as the right way of doing things if we in this House have a fundamental discussion about the application of the MSY objectives before these are introduced for a certain fish species.
I welcome the fact that the Commissioner is taking a few steps in the right direction, but there may need to be more consultation in a number of other areas.
I also hope that the Council will as yet move a little closer in the direction of Parliament to ensure that we in any event end up with a balanced approach.
The Commissioner has stated that the establishment of three-year quotas is a problem for him after all, because they do not allow any adjustments.
I would question that, also because sole and plaice fisheries may well be the best controlled fisheries in Europe, and also on the basis of the way in which the fisheries organisations use these.
I would draw your attention to, among others, the producer organisations in a number of ports that work closely together and where there is excellent cooperation between the Member States, the authorities, the inspectorates and the fisheries organisations themselves.
It would, in fact, be appealing, also for the European Commission, in time, to switch to a three-year Total Allowable Catches (TAC) scheme after all.
I may be prejudging the discussion on the communication about the Commissionâs MSY objectives, but the point that is essential in my view is that Regional Advisory Councils will be given a dominant role in Europe's decision-making, that they, every time the Commission tables a proposal, will be given a hearing beforehand, and that their opinion will be taken into consideration in the argumentation of the proposals.
After all, we will increasingly have discussions in Europe, also within fisheries, in which, seemingly, a large number of Member States take hardly any interest.
Indeed, the number of Member States is no longer 6 or 15, but 25.
And how could a Hungarian Fisheries Minister contribute to a discussion, say, about shrimps in the North Sea or a Dutch Fisheries Minister about fisheries around Cyprus?
There are, of course, general policy lines, but in order to keep a support base for fisheries, it is essential for these Regional Advisory Councils to be accorded an important role, also in future, also in the implementation of the plans.
That is why this point receives a great deal of attention in my report too.
It can provide a support base for the fisheries decisions.
Even more important, however, is the following.
We are often in a fix with scientific recommendations for the establishment of quotas and subsequently â let us be honest about this â find out that the Council plays under one hat.
That is why scientific recommendations are drafted conservatively to take the Councilâs outcome into consideration.
We must put a stop to this!
We must ensure that the sector and scientific institutions cooperate much quicker and at a much earlier stage in order to weigh up the plans effectively.
I should once again like to express my thanks to the Commissioner for meeting us half-way on a number of issues.
Parliamentâs position will be apparent in tomorrowâs vote.
I am firmly convinced that the Commissioner will place Parliamentâs contribution at the heart of the Councilâs discussion.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Maat for his report.
I believe that when we look at fisheries, especially at catching plaice and sole â and basically they are mixed fisheries because other species are being caught, cod included â we have to be much more radical than we are at the moment.
The Commissioner knows that full well and I have raised the issue of discards in general with him several times.
Let us land all the fish that are caught, instead of having so many species quotas with the result that a lot of healthy fish are discarded.
Of all the problems with the common fisheries policy, throwing healthy fish overboard is the one that the general public in Europe see as particularly ridiculous.
I also think we must be sure that powers are devolved to the North Sea Advisory Council and that the Commission takes notice of it.
Mr Maat made the point that it is no good the Commission coming up with a proposal before it has taken note of what the North Sea Advisory Council has said.
That gives people the impression that the Commission is not listening.
I also think that with the age-old problem of stocks in general there is always a conflict between the scientific advice and what the fishermen believe the stocks to be.
It is not always easy to come to a conclusion.
My final point is â and I stress the need to be more radical â that I think the way forward is to look at the total quotas of fish caught and see if we cannot change that into days at sea and fishing effort, so that we can land all the fish caught.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me thank the rapporteur for his good and important work.
In my country, Estonia, fishing is more than just an industry or a means of earning a living.
Fishing is an integral part of our culture.
In a country surrounded by water on three sides, it could not be otherwise.
I know families that have been involved in fishing for many generations.
For them, fishing is not a business project, but a way of life.
Industrial fishing has brought the lives of coastal fishermen to the brink of disaster.
According to the World Wildlife Foundation, the flounder and sole mentioned today are among the most endangered fish species.
Half of the flounders caught using beam trawling prove to be undersized and must be thrown back.
Most of these fish perish.
Such waste is incomprehensible to fishermen whose families have been in the business for generations.
It is clear that the use of wasteful fishing methods should be ended sooner rather than later.
I hope that the European Commission will be able to conduct the relevant research as soon as possible and present proposals for the rapid replacement of existing fishing methods with naturally sustainable methods.
I am well aware that the nature of fisheries does not permit as quick a response as would be possible in information technology management, for instance.
I concur with the reportâs recommendation to establish three-year fishing quotas instead of one-year quotas.
This will ensure continuity in the fisheries.
In ensuring continuity and sustainability, close cooperation with organisations that are familiar with local conditions will be very important.
Of these, the rapporteur emphasises the North Sea Regional Advisory Council.
The attempts to restore fishing stocks in the Baltic Sea, which feeds fishermen from five Member States, would be much more successful if they were supported by regional cooperation.
As regards the Baltic Sea, I would like to emphasise here today that the Baltic Sea region deserves a separate entry in the European Union budget, as has long been the case in the Mediterranean region.
Â Â  . Madam President, given the state of our seas, the Commissionerâs first priority should be to save the fish.
When safe biological limits are being exceeded, we all expect action and I commend the action that is being taken.
I also commend the attempt to move towards a policy of achieving maximum sustainable yields.
I do not see how anyone can be opposed to that.
It is like apple pie and motherhood.
The difficulty is how we move from the present disaster to future perfection, without disrupting the lives and occupations of fishermen to an impossible degree.
That is my doubt about this particular policy.
The purpose of the Regional Advisory Councils is to try and ensure that fishermen are integrated into the process.
So when their advice seems to be being ignored, it may be the wrong advice.
Perhaps that is the Commissionâs fault for not communicating the message.
It is the opportunity for greater long-term prosperity.
Fishermen, as we all know, need to be included in the process.
I agree with the Commissioner when he says that we must go for only one-year quotas.
The danger is that if we set a quota at the wrong level, in three yearsâ time there may be no more fish to set the next quota for.
Â Â  We think of sole and plaice as extremely good fish that are a great pleasure to eat, but future generations will not experience that pleasure if we do not now accept our responsibilities.
I think that MrÂ Maatâs report is, for the most part, sound, but I would criticise precisely the same things as the Commissioner.
AmendmentÂ 8 about having a three-year quota would have precisely those implications pointed out by MrÂ Davies.
It could not be adapted in time and would be inappropriate.
The same applies in the case of cod.
There is a connection here, which means that AmendmentÂ 14 cannot be approved either.
If the number of days at sea is to be limited for the reason stated, the restriction will have to apply to these vessels too, as there cannot be exceptions where this matter is concerned.
When it comes to AmendmentÂ 15, involving a ten per cent, instead of eight per cent, margin of tolerance, I would point out that, with modern computer technology, there would be no complications in having an eight per cent margin.
We could manage to calculate eight per cent instead of ten per cent.
Increased flexibility would damage stocks.
The same applies to AmendmentÂ 20.
Increased flexibility for the Member States in determining when they need to take measures would not work.
Attempts to obtain increased flexibility would actually lead to reduced flexibility, as, if fish stocks are depleted, there is no flexibility at all left.
There would then be no fishing quotas, no days at sea and 100% unemployment among professional fishermen.
That, presumably, is what no one wants to see.
Â Â  Madam President, for centuries British fishermen looked after their fishing grounds â the waters up to 200 miles off the coast.
They achieved a sustainable industry by care, not by chance.
Then we joined the EC, and that all changed.
The wretched CFP, with its bureaucratic plans, crazy quotas and enforced discards has reduced stocks to their lowest level ever, closed fishing ports and reduced the UK fishing fleet to a quarter of its size.
Many species are down to danger levels â plaice and sole today, something else tomorrow.
And to think that the CFP was not even in the Treaty of Rome: it was invented overnight to let Edward Heath have something to give away in exchange for the right to sign!
Now, in answer to the desperate shortage of fish in the North Sea, all we hear about is too many boats chasing too few fish â Iâll say!
They are mostly boats from Spain, which has a fleet as big as the rest of the EU put together.
No wonder the Norwegians said no!
They saw it coming, and with their fishing industry such a boost to their economy, they were right.
Norwegian stocks remain in good order.
Are there any lessons for the CFP there?
This report will do nothing.
While the management plan acknowledges the North Sea Advisory Council, it ignores its findings.
It is inconsistent in departing from similar decisions in areas like the Bay of Biscay, and it is based on a maximum sustainable yield before that is even defined.
This report is well named, for âexploitationâ is exactly what has happened to the once abundant North Sea fisheries.
Tell me: who benefits from the destruction of the richest waters of Western Europe?
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for taking on the Commission and for taking it to task in relation to its glaring omissions and its oversights.
On the one hand we have the Commissionâs explanatory memorandum openly acknowledging that the North Sea Regional Advisory Council is a principal forum for advice in relation to the management plan for the preservation and regeneration of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea.
Then, on the other hand, in its document the Commission makes no further reference to the NSRACâs opinion.
I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could tell me who is or was responsible for drafting the Commissionâs management plan.
How can the Commission justify omitting the body or agency it openly recognises as an authority on North Sea fisheries and then studiously ignore the NSRAC?
As has been stated and restated time and time again, forums such as the NSRAC were established in order to canvass and to utilise the wide body of expertise and opinion among people on the ground, people on the coalface, people who know the industry and to counteract the perception that Brussels or Strasbourg make policies which are often seen as âabout you, without youâ.
Is it any wonder that people turn off Brussels or Strasbourg?
The NSRAC has provided a bridgehead for bringing fishing interests, biologists and environmentalists together, getting them to agree collectively on ways of conserving stocks of plaice and sole.
The proposals, if adopted, would increase the level of plaice stocks to above the precautionary levels of three to five years.
I have to say that the rapporteur has other reservations about the Commissionâs approach, with which I agree, but time restraints do not permit me to elaborate on them, except to make a brief reference to the issue of MSY â maximum sustainable yields.
The Commissionâs proposal to launch a debate on MSY in advance of agreement by the Council and Parliament simply is not on.
It is simply not acceptable, Mr Commissioner.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions.
Let me start by trying to clear the air with regard to the North Sea Regional Advisory Council.
The Commission has held a series of consultation meetings and exchanges of views since June 2004.
I do not believe that any other fisheries issue has been the subject of such extensive dialogue with the RACs.
After the North Sea RAC decided to reserve its position until the Commission had made a specific proposal concerning long-term management targets and reference points, the Commission stated that it would put forward a proposal and even inform the RAC of its technical content at a meeting in November 2005.
A discussion has since proceeded in good order on the basis of the Commissionâs proposal.
I am pleased that the North Sea RAC has recognised that many elements of the Commissionâs proposal are valuable and appropriate.
Regarding maximum sustainable yields, a number of stocks were brought into long-term management plans some years ago, which included low-target fishing mortalities, such as mackerel, herring and, more recently, haddock.
These plans have proved valuable and helpful to the industries concerned.
I believe similar benefits can be extended to the flatfish sector.
Discussions concerning the maximum sustainable yield should also take place, but that is a wider-scale issue.
The immediate concern is to provide the flatfish fishery with a sound economic basis.
With regard to the point raised concerning TACs for three years, I must again underline that a three-year TAC would not help to recover the stock, simply because adjustments cannot be made in good time.
How can one make adjustments mid-course if there is an urgent reason to reduce the TAC?
The North Sea RAC has revised its position and it no longer advises such a measure.
I can accept the argument that a three-year TAC will give greater security to fishermen, but not the argument that a three-year TAC would mean greater sustainability.
With regard to discards, we are actively considering what can be done to solve this problem.
It is one of the top priorities for the remainder of my mandate.
I cannot agree more with Mr Davies that fishermen need to be integrated into the process.
We are doing our utmost to meet with and consult all fishing representatives.
Â Â  That brings the debate to a close.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6-0263/2006) by Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels (2006/2054(INI)).
Â Â  â Madam President, without taking up any of my speaking time â since this has nothing to do with the issue we are dealing with, but is more a point of order â I would like to put a request to the Presidency of this Parliament arising from an incident in which I have just been involved.
Barely a quarter of an hour ago, I left the Chamber for a moment and went into the aisle behind us here and found myself happily looking at the waters in the canal, when I found myself quite literally swept aside by an entourage, which I then discovered was surrounding the President of Lebanon.
So far, it was nothing we have not seen a million times in this House.
The thing that shocked me, President Borrell, was the attitude of the two people, parliamentary staff, who were leading the entourage.
First they made gestures at me. Then they shouted at me: âMettez-vous sur le cÃŽtÃ©! [move to the side]â, they told me, and I do not know whether you are aware, but the ââ behind us here is made up of boards with holes in which womenâs high heels can get caught, and it is therefore very easy to fall over.
I tried to avoid going ââ.
I pointed out to them â I must put it like this â that I was a Member of Parliament, but I can assure you that it did not do me much good.
They practically swept me aside until I was where they wanted me to be: âTo the side immediately!â.
Madam President, since we are talking about staff of this House, and given the unfortunate timetable for these night sittings, I would ask you whether it is possible to find other ways to treat Members or, perhaps, other routes by which visitors can leave.
Having said that, Madam President, I shall move on to the matter in hand.
I shall move on to fish belonging to the taxon Elasmobranchii, which are generally highly vulnerable to exploitation given their life-cycle characteristics.
The practice known as finning, involving the removal of fins and disposal of the body, is prohibited on board Community vessels, both in maritime waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States and in international waters and those of third countries.
Nevertheless, given that these species are often caught as by-catch, on 26Â June 2003, the European Union adopted a Regulation on the removal of fins of sharks.
The Regulation allows sharks to be handled on board the vessel, with fins separated from bodies, provided that that is designed to achieve greater efficiency in the use of the entire shark, with the fins and the rest of the animal stored on board separately.
In order to ensure that is not practised, the quantity of fins must correspond to that of bodies and, to that end, a ratio or proportion compared to the total live weight is established, and in 2003 that ratio was set at five per cent of fin compared to live weight.
This five per cent was decided upon on the basis of United States legislation designed for a different reality and for species of shark that are coastal and have different presentations.
The scientific reports of the ICES and the ICCAT indicate that that ratio is not applicable to the pelagic species caught by the Community fleet, whose fins are far larger than those of coastal sharks.
I would like to point out that the current 5% in the regulation in force and the 6.5% that I am proposing for a single species â in this case the Prionacea glauca â are in line with the most recent scientific reports.
In any event â and I address this to the Commissioner â the main objective of the Community legislation must be to reinforce the prohibition of but â and I say this to him too â in order to ensure that the rules are effective and accepted by all of the parties, they must reflect the specific characteristics of fleets, the morphology of the different species and calculation methods that include cutting techniques and presentation methods used.
Furthermore, Commissioner, this is a very specific and identifiable fishery and, therefore, the recognition of these issues would enable us to prevent situations in which the European Unionâs longline fleet is prejudiced.
That fleet is currently obliged to throw away a proportion of the fins in order to comply with the rules, since more than 80% of the catches are of a species that I have already mentioned, Prionacea glauca, whose ratio, as we have said, is 6.5%.
I would say to the Commission that not using realistic conversion factors poses a risk to the European Union since it leads to errors in the estimates of catches, estimates that are obtained indirectly from the international market in fins in Asian countries, where they appear as being of European origin.
At the same time â I address this also to the Commissioner â the updating of this percentage, I would repeat, on the basis of the data and the scientific reports, would enable the Community immediately to lead the review that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Communityâs own Scientific Committee, is going to take place within the ICCAT and that will probably be followed by other RFOs.
I would stress that the increase requested in no way implies an increase in the catch of sharks nor a relaxing of the measures intended to prevent the practice of .
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez.
I take good note of your complaint.
I shall pass it on to the head of Parliamentâs security service so that he may take the appropriate action.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos and the Fisheries Committee for the opinion on the Commission report on the operation of the so-called Shark Finning Regulation.
I am pleased to note that the rapporteur praises the clarity and conciseness of the Commissionâs report and shares the view that this regulation is achieving its objective.
Let me assure you that the Commission is committed to monitoring the application of this regulation to ensure its proper implementation, including of Member Statesâ obligations regarding control and reporting.
The Commission will also continue to promote the prohibition of shark finning in international forums.
In addition, the Commission will continue in its endeavours towards the adoption of measures based on scientific information and other considerations within Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.
I would also recall that the prohibition of shark finning practices is not the only way to ensure a sustainable fishery for these species.
A more comprehensive set of management measures is required.
We have already taken some measures in this respect.
I refer, in particular, to special efforts to improve scientific knowledge and data collection, to establish catch or effort limits for certain species, including deep-sea species, to prohibit drift nets that may catch some large pelagic sharks and to control and limit fishing capacity.
As rightly pointed out in Parliamentâs motion for a resolution, the Commission has identified numerous actions to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond, including Community plans of action for sharks and sea birds.
My department is currently looking into the request for the presentation of a Community plan of action by mid-2007.
While it is too early to have a clear overview of the detailed work programme for 2007, it is clear that a formal, complete and detailed plan of action requires a comprehensive assessment of the situation and of the possible measures, together with an early consultation of all interested parties, which will take time and resources.
The desired timeframe seems rather too ambitious, and setting too short a timeframe for preparation and consultation could even be counterproductive.
I would prefer to be less prescriptive in terms of deadlines.
However, I can assure honourable Members that my department will undertake to complete the plan of action at the earliest possible date.
Returning to the reportâs core concerns, I have taken good note of the proposed calls for the Commission to present amendments to the Shark Finning Regulation, especially with a view to reviewing the 5% fin weight versus live body weight ratio on the basis of a species-dependent approach, and to revise the possibilities for separate landings of fins and carcasses, as well as to report again on the operation of this regulation within two years.
When deciding on this regulation, the Council did not consider it appropriate to adopt a species-specific approach regarding the fin to body weight ratio.
I think the reasons mentioned in the debate then are still valid now.
A single 5% fin to live body weight ratio applicable to the whole shark-catch of a vessel is a realistic, feasible, controllable, simple and proportionate method of preventing shark finning practices from spreading.
The Commissionâs report also confirms this.
I am not, therefore, of the opinion that amendments to the regulation should be proposed at this stage.
Firstly, because the regulation was only recently adopted and is working well overall.
Secondly, because the Commission believes it would be unwieldy to start revising the fin to body weight ratio or introducing some species-specific approach to the Shark Finning Regulation without new measures to ensure sustainable shark fishing.
The much broader exercise of preparing a Community plan of action for sharks will necessarily include a reassessment of developments under the Shark Finning Regulation and its possible need for review, especially on the basis of the national annual reports, which are available for all those interested.
It is at this point, therefore, that we will be able to consider once more the situation with respect to body-fin ratio and make any recommendations accordingly.
Parliamentâs necessary full involvement in a proposal for a plan of action will also provide another opportunity for Parliament to be informed about and to play a role in developments on shark finning matters.
The Commission will continue to monitor the situation.
You can rest assured that I am always ready to act and to present all supporting evidence if new information becomes available indicating significant changes in the situation.
I am committed to advances in the area of shark conservation and other aspects of marine biodiversity, and will inform you in due time of the progress made.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank MrsÂ MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
First and foremost, it should be clarified and highlighted that the practice of finning has been regulated by the EU since 2003, meaning that sharks cannot be caught solely for their fins.
In other words, this type of fishing is centred on a species, just as any other, which means that sustainability is just as important for this species as for any other.
The issue of encouraging more catches does not therefore form part of the objective of this report but falls instead under the scope of quotas or perhaps recovery plans on the basis of the usual scientific reports.
What is under discussion here is the fact that the Commission communication has acknowledged the positive effect of the 2003 regulation and compliance with it.
A more contentious issue in this debate, however, is the weight of fins as a percentage of the total weight of the shark.
According to ICCAT reports, the total use of the fins by the Community fleet differs, for example, from the US fleetâs partial use.
We must therefore look into the possibility of changing the percentage, on the basis of these reports, which have proposed an increase from 5% to 6.5%.
This is the crux of the matter.
To ignore this issue would be to confuse the total use of fish with the preservation of a fishing resource.
We must indeed preserve the resource, but that must be done by other means.
The nub of this debate is that, by ensuring that rates of use reflect reality and scientific reports, we will be able to plug all gaps.
The compromise reached between the three main political groups implies that Parliament realises that this is the way to proceed, in line with the existing studies carried out by recognised bodies, to which the EU belongs, and in accordance with the law, thereby contributing to genuinely sustainable and regulated fishing.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted that the UK Government was one of the key supporters of Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1185/2003 concerning the disgusting practice of removing shark fins on board vessels.
The regulation is designed to prevent shark finning, where shark carcasses are thrown overboard after high-value shark fins have been removed.
You could call this âslit and chuckâ.
Without their fins, the sharks suffocate to death.
The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species.
Only today American researchers using fish auction records from Hong Kong have calculated that the trade in shark fins kills 26 million to 73 million sharks a year.
Against this background, I am appalled and disappointed that this report threatens an increase in shark finning.
Paragraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5% fin- to live-weight ratio to 6.5%, particularly for blue sharks.
Paragraph 3 of the report incorrectly implies that ICES and ICCAT support an increase in fin- to live-weight ratio for the blue shark.
A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005, but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion.
The same goes for ICCAT, where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the ratio.
Amendment 1 is placed first on the voting list, and I recommend support for it.
I fear that the European Parliament may not give its support to any of these amendments, a retrograde step, and I ask colleagues to say no to âslit and chuckâ.
Â Â  Mr President, we can argue whether a 5% ratio of fin weight to body weight is appropriate or whether a larger proportion is needed.
I have no doubt that an increase would be wrong, but no doubt the Spanish and Portuguese fishing interests would argue the other way.
I hope Parliament will be able to support my proposal for a study based on best scientific evidence before any decision is made.
I hope it will do that not simply because it represents a compromise in those positions but because it is the most appropriate way forward.
So far as I am concerned, the whole shark fin regulation has always been too weak.
It was far too weak when we introduced it.
Enforcement is problematic to say the least and, as in so many aspects of fishing, varies from one Member State to another.
It certainly needs to be reviewed at regular intervals.
The idea that we should just have one review and that is the end of it, as originally intended, is simply nonsense.
I hope the Commissioner will support the idea of more regular reviews, just as I support him in opposing the idea that quotas should be set for long periods of time.
The real issue here is so much bigger.
We face the prospect of the extinction of many shark species â slow-breathing creatures that have lived on this planet for many millennia longer than our own species.
The risk is that with this particular regulation we are simply playing at the edges.
We are killing too many sharks. We have to stop that.
We need the Commission to come forward with a shark management action plan.
We have heard from the Commissioner why it will take time to do that, but I seem to remember joining with other Members of Parliament in calling for this some three years ago.
I hope that the Commissioner will be able to finish this debate by telling us exactly how much work has already been done over the past three years in preparing the groundwork for publication of the shark management action plan.
My impression is that absolutely nothing has been done.
I hope the Commissioner can correct that impression.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope that the Commission will maintain its firm position in the face of the attempts to reduce the requirements for the cutting off of the fins of sharks.
With this proposal, sharks may be even more threatened than they are already.
According to the scientific studies, it is not at all clear how far the ratio should be increased; there is even one study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature that restricts the ratio to 2%.
We must seek out all of the scientific information available, because this amendment is intended to change the rules in order to increase the percentage of weight of fins compared to the bodies of sharks, and in that way more and more catches would be thrown back into the sea.
Sharks are being wiped out in the oceans in order to satisfy the Asian whim of making soup from their fins, and that is not a good thing.
It is difficult to monitor what happens at sea, and there is sufficient evidence to suggest that many Member States are not controlling compliance with Community legislation.
To besiege an animal even further, when two thirds of its species in Europe are already on the International Union for Conservation of Natureâs Red List, is not a good idea.
Â Â  Mr President, the UK, Germany and Belgium fought very hard to implement a ban on shark finning in 2003.
They received wide support in the Council.
Spain and Portugal now appear to be the only Member States pushing for an amendment to the regulation in respect of the 5% ratio of fins to live weight of shark catch.
They say that the current regulation is unrealistic, particularly for the blue shark, which is the main target of their fishery and which they claim is in great abundance in EU waters.
I think the strong international market for shark fins, mostly as we have just heard for the Asian shark fin soup market, coupled with the relatively low value of shark meat, has motivated Spain and Portugal to support this drastic amendment.
It remains a fact that the 5% ratio of fins to live weight contained in EU legislation is the weakest in the world, as Mr Davies told us.
The proposal in this report for a 6.5% ratio would quite simply allow more sharks to be killed.
It would send all the wrong negative signals to the international community.
The higher the ratio, the more likely it is that the illegal practice of finning will recur.
That is why I have tabled an amendment which proposes that the figure be lowered to 2% of live weight.
That would ensure the protection of sharks in EU waters, increase that protection and fall in line with international standards.
The IUCN, the World Conservation Union, has confirmed that the blue shark is endangered and will be placed on its red list as a vulnerable species when that list is updated later this year.
In such circumstances, it would be madness to permit more of these sharks to be killed.
Indeed, we should be seeking to impose a strict regime of TACs and quotas on blue sharks to offer the species additional protection.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I wish to thank Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos for all the work she has done in preparing this own-initiative report.
The corresponding Commission report is clear in reiterating that finning is prohibited within the Community, and in its conclusion that the percentage equivalence ratio of shark fin to body weight does not need to be altered.
The rapporteur disagrees with this percentage ratio figure, and she is of the opinion that it should be increased from the level of 5% to 6.5%.
This is the main issue of disagreement with the Commission report, and with some of us.
Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos argues that some scientific evidence favours her 6.5% ratio position, but let me say respectfully that other scientific evidence supplied by at least equally reputable sources supports the view that the 5% figure is in fact more than adequate.
The latter scientific evidence further supports the view that if the ratio is indeed increased, this will result in the enhancement of the very practice we want to stop, i.e. finning.
Such a practice, coupled with the general failure of implementation of the relevant Community regulation, will, in my view, lead with mathematical accuracy and in the not-too-distant future, to the endangerment of the very existence of certain shark species.
In this respect, please note that an increase from 5% to 6.5% may seem small at first glance, but in reality it is not.
It in fact represents an increase of 30%.
In other words, potentially 30% of the shark catches could end up in finning.
Much as we wish to help increase the profits of our fishermen, it is our primary concern and duty to prevent the extinction of any shark species.
I therefore urge you to support Mr Daviesâ amendment tabled on behalf of the ALDE Group and aimed at maintaining the ratio at 5%, as proposed by the Commission and as supported by the Commissioner in his speech here tonight.
Â Â  Mr President, I am surprised by Commissioner Borgâs statement that legislation that is recent cannot be modified.
I believe that legislation that is not good must be updated.
That is precisely what the 2005 Report of the ICCAT says about ratios for sharks.
According to that report, the ratio applied to Prionacea glauca is wrong.
Furthermore, the scientists of the ICCAT argue that it should be corrected.
There are two reasons for this: the first is that data on landings based on an incorrect coefficient may lead them to make the wrong estimates; and, secondly, that the inconsistency in the ratio hinders the work of controlling the fleet, since, because it is impossible to comply with the rule, the control makes no sense.
Commissioner, this is demonstrated in the report that you have sent to this Parliament.
Commissioner, Mr President, I wish to ask that we update and correct the legislation once and for all, because otherwise we are creating a serious lack of confidence in the sector as a result of having rules with which, as I say, it is impossible to comply.
I would also like one of the people who have spoken here, claiming that there are scientific reports, to tell me of at least one, supported by the international scientific community, that contradicts what the ICCAT said at the last plenary meeting of the Regional Fisheries Organisation that regulates all of these very species.
I would ask that we act rationally, that we do things properly, that the coefficients be reviewed and that we choose those that can be fulfilled by the fleet.
I must also say that the problem of over-fishing will not be resolved by means of ratios.
It will be resolved by means of quotas for sharks.
Â Â  Mr President, I also welcome the Commissioner's statement at the beginning that he wants at least to remain at the 5% level of finning for the present.
I believe â along with Mr Stevenson, and we have tabled an amendment to this effect â that instead of leaving it at 5% we need to reduce it to 2%.
To take it up to 6.5% would only encourage the catching and finning of more and more sharks.
Over 70 million sharks are taken each year and we really need to reduce the number.
To increase it to 6.5% would be crazy.
We in Europe very much want a sustainable fisheries policy.
We also want high welfare standards.
If you increase the percentage of shark fins that can be landed, the chances of increasing the number of sharks caught and of finning are greater.
We need to set an example to the world.
In most parts of the world the percentage of fins that can be landed by fishing is lower.
I therefore urge the Commissioner to go further and reduce the percentage of fins that can be landed.
However much more valuable shark fins are than the rest of the body, it is absolutely right that the whole of the body should be landed and used.
It is crazy to carry on as we do when nearly 50% of the 130 species of shark are now endangered.
We must take action.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to thank honourable Members for their contributions.
The only problem that has been raised substantively relates to the whole issue concerning 5% versus 6.5%.
In this regard, I should say that the ratio between fin weight and body weight varies significantly depending on the shark species concerned.
Scientific information was already available at the time the regulation was adopted, especially as regards the blue shark.
The Council, however, did not consider that a species-dependent approach was appropriate, and the maximum 5% fin- versus live body-weight ratio set in the regulation was certainly not presented as being based on scientific considerations alone.
The 5% fin- to body-weight requirement represents the only current restriction on a number of shark species caught in fisheries, notably the blue shark.
This should not be reviewed, at least until other management measures are in place to reduce their fishing mortality.
I have no problem with further research, but this has to be done before any amendments are proposed.
Again, I have no problem with regular reviews.
I have made reference to an overall consideration of a Community plan of action for sharks, when we will have ample time to discuss this and other issues concerning conservation of sharks.
On the point raised by Mr Davies concerning the plan of action, the EU has not yet formalised a plan of action for sharks.
Nevertheless, many of the actions that would constitute such a plan of action are already incorporated into Community legislation or other initiatives under the CFP.
The EU has taken considerable management action with regard to sharks, for example the improvement of data collection for large pelagic shark species, the establishment of catch limits for certain shark species, skates and rays in the North Sea, deepwater sharks in the north-east Atlantic, prohibiting trawl fisheries within littoral areas in the Mediterranean, banning the use of driftnets that may catch large pelagic sharks, prohibiting shark finning and establishing specific conditions under which only the removal of fins of sharks may be authorised â which is what we are discussing today â and the control and limitation of fishing capacity.
It is important to note that many of these measures apply to EC vessels, irrespective of whether or not they operate in EC waters.
Such measures should also be promoted in the international context, especially in other FMOs where we support measures to ensure appropriate management in respect of high-sea fisheries.
The Commissionâs departments are currently reflecting on whether a formal plan of action for sharks should be developed in the very near future and I am favourably inclined to doing so.
However, considering the importance of the work to be done, the necessary collection of information, reflection and consultation and assessment of possible measures, it would not be realistic to set the finalisation date of any comprehensive Commission proposal for a plan of action for sharks within the time limit indicated in Amendment 8.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto in agricultural products and foodstuffs (COM(2005)0671 C6-0033/2006 2005/0279(CNS)) (A6-0253/2006).
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for the opportunity, even if it is fairly late, to speak about our proposals for new import provisions for organic products.
And thank you, MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf, for the valuable report.
With more than 150 000 holdings on 4.4 million hectares, an estimated turnover of almost EURÂ 11 billion in 2002 and a clear tendency to further growth, this is a very important sector.
Considering the very wide range of products on the market and the number of processed products that contain one or more imported ingredients, it is clear that imports are vital for the development of the organic sector within the European Union.
We need to be sure that consumers are confident that the products that they buy as being organic really are so, whether they are imported or produced within the European Union and that there is no unfair competition for European organic producers.
At the same time, we need to make firm arrangements for our trading partners so that organic production can continue to increase.
Since 1992, imported products have been able to enter the European Union either from third countries that are recognised by the Community as providing equivalent official guarantees â there are now seven countries on that list and about the same number of applicant countries â or through Member State authorisations for the entry of specific consignments.
The latter system derogates from the common rules, which expire at the end of 2006.
With this proposal, we want to fill the gap between that date and 1Â January 2009, the date of entry into force of the overall proposal we have submitted, which contains exactly the same provisions on imports as we have on the table tonight.
There is no difference between what we are proposing now and what will be included in the main proposal entering into force on 1 January 2009.
We propose to keep the third country list as it is, but to replace Member State authorisations with a permanent Community system.
Finally, our proposal provides for direct access for fully compliant products in order to respect our international trade obligations.
I have noted that the report calls for extra guarantees on this last possibility of direct access.
I do not think that our positions on this issue are very far apart.
We want to go as far as we can in requesting guarantees from third country operators that are willing to take that route, but without putting ourselves in a position where we could be challenged by the WTO system.
Therefore, I can partially accept Amendments 1 and 2.
To a great extent, I can agree in principle to your other amendments, but I would prefer to keep this proposal as concise and simple as possible, setting out all the main rules needed, but not more than that.
Further details should, in my view, go into the future implementing rules.
I have also noted with pleasure the great willingness to support the development of the local control bodies in third countries.
This is a policy element that I support, but it does not belong in this regulation.
Â Â  Commissioner, I would ask for your understanding.
I am very sorry, but we must work within time limits that are already entirely stretched.
The rapporteur has five minutes. I am going to ask him just to use four.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, since we are still here at this hour â you have to be, we have to be, and the Commission is here too â we should not spend a quarter of an hour arguing.
It really does not matter whether the clock is striking midnight or quarter past; I intend to make full use of my five minutes.
We, Commissioner, are pretty much in agreement where our assessment of the situation is concerned; the organic market is going through a boom, with a shift from the producers who formerly marketed their products directly, from shops specialising in them and in health foods to chain stores who now want to cash in and exploit the boom in the organic market.
If they get into the business, they will demand a cut of 10% or 20%, a quite considerable sum that the European producers cannot afford.
Your attitude to the existing regulation is inconsistent.
At one point, you say that you want to change what it says about transactions with third countries, which amounts to a revision of it.
You want a whole new regulation to deal with what is at the heart of this one, and that is what we have found questionable, since your way of dealing with most â almost every third article â of the draft regulation involves you saying that the details will be sorted out through the comitology procedure, that is to say, in the implementing provisions.
We find that too imprecise.
What we, in this House, asked you to do was to make improvements; that is why we have put forward only a working paper rather than a report.
As far as imports are concerned â that is to say, the relationship with the third countries â we see it as necessary that the products be obtained in the quantities that the chains need; the problem is that their production in those countries is not in line with EU standards, and so the rules applicable to this urgently need to be tightened up.
We support that, even though, where the core regulation is concerned, we have misgivings as to whether you are perhaps not being too accommodating to the demands made by the chains, who are no longer interested in the names of the producers or the names of traditional organic farming associations, but want to get people buying anonymous food so that they can market it under their names.
Here, then, there are divergent tendencies; we may well have our misgivings in one case, but in this one we are on your side in that we would like to see the EUâs standards maintained in third countries.
Although reference has been made to the notified third countries, it is still the case that 70% of imports reach us by way of what are termed import permits, which involves scrutiny, not of the production process, but, basically only of the accompanying documents that certify that something is âorganicâ.
We all know that paper is patient; so we also need to see to it that the European Unionâs standards apply in these countries.
According to you, we have gone rather further in our amendments, but that is not so, Commissioner; the fact is that we are in agreement with you.
We are seeking greater precision in certain areas, and would like the European Parliament to have a hand in this notification process in the same way as the individual countries are to be involved in it; we would like to see this documented in a report from the Commission detailing how far you have got with the compilation of the data and how far the notification has progressed.
We would also like to see a database set up to contain the data thus collected on the third countries, so that the risks can be monitored by means of checks â which, since we know the sort of people we are dealing with here, will have to be targeted â the object being to ensure that no cheating is going on.
We would like this report to take into account the criticisms we have made, and hope that you will not hold back from this House any of the data you have compiled.
We would not want to see a repeat of what happened with the study on qualified market access, where all that was left at the end was market access full stop and qualification got lost somewhere along the road.
All that we are looking for now â since you have mentioned the WTO â is an example of something that will take us towards trade, too, being âqualifiedâ.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to join in the rapporteurâs protest.
A Commissioner who is always present and regularly attends the committee meetings is being silenced this evening after five minutes!
We had to wait for her fellow-Commissioner, MrÂ Frattini, for 10 minutes during this afternoonâs vote, and he was given 15 minutesâ speaking time.
This Commissioner is always present, whatever time slot she is given.
The fact that we hold debates on agricultural policy at 11.30 at night is nothing to do with her, but with your agenda.
I join in that protest and I will also report this to the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development tomorrow.
I will presently turn to the subject in hand, but I would first like to repeat my strong condemnation of the silencing of a Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development who did not ask for this time slot, but who is nevertheless here and seriously engaging with us in debate.
The time at which she is here is not of her choosing but is the choice of your Bureau.
The Commissioner said that she understands Parliamentâs wishes.
The essence of the subject we are discussing today is that import products must meet the requirements of production in the European Union.
That is essential and that has been clearly stated in the report.
My group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is pleased with the outcome in the Agricultural Committee and what has been discussed there is reflected in amendments.
I should like to add a remark of a political nature.
In the forthcoming world trade agreements, it is essential that import products meet the same requirements as European products.
That applies not only to organic agriculture but also to agriculture as a whole.
I hope that we in this House will give sufficient backing to the Agriculture Commissioner on that point, also giving our support in the discussion at Commission level involving her fellow-Commissioner MrÂ Mandelson.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report, and I shall advise my group to vote in favour of the report as amended in the Agricultural Committee.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
I would ask all of the Members to appreciate that the interpreters are due to finish work at twelve.
We can hold on a few minutes longer, but not much more.
I do not want to run the risk of our not having interpreting tomorrow and you should not run that risk either, and I would therefore ask you simply to remain within the time allotted to you.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said that he was going to speak for the five minutes allotted to him and that is what he has done.
He has spoken for precisely the five minutes allotted to him.
You therefore have no reason to protest.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall restrict myself to the allotted time.
At the end of 2005, the Commission presented two legislative proposals: a proposal for a Regulation on organic production, which will replace the current one from 2009, and the proposal that we are debating now on the import scheme.
With regard to imports, improving the Community system was desirable and urgent, particularly in order to simplify definitively the system of authorisation of imports from third countries in which there is no or was no general equivalence in terms of organic production and in order to facilitate access to the market for organic products, which currently have a weak administrative structure.
My group believes that the modification proposed has those laudable objectives.
Nevertheless, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we cannot and must not allow it to reduce the guarantees to the consumer of the imported organic product â as the Commissioner herself has said quite rightly â or to create unfair competition for European operators.
I believe that those are the risks that we may run.
Inspection procedures that take account of these risks and that are based on clear rules have become crucial, and it is therefore essential to regulate the recognition and accreditation of certifying bodies at European level.
In this regard, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Having said that, however, I would like to say briefly that we are only talking about one part of the legislation on organic products.
The report on the regulation is in deadlock because, amongst other things, the rapporteur alleges that she has not received all of the documentation from the European Commission.
I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission to do everything it can to put an end to this situation and to allow the work on the report to continue and to complete the parliamentary procedure so that we can establish clear, simple and effective rules for this market and clear up the uncertainty currently faced by organic producers.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur for his excellent report on the Commissionâs proposal to amend the current regulation relating to third-country farming and importation into the EU of organic products.
It is clear for everyone to see that there is a worldwide growing demand for organic produce, and the EU Member States are no exception.
The importation of organic products from third countries can thus be a very lucrative enterprise, but the current practices involving such importation are, sadly, not sufficient to necessarily guarantee the quality of a product.
We therefore very much welcome this much-awaited Commission proposal.
At the same time, we recognise that the proposal has a number of weak points and gaps, which the rapporteur has detected and seeks to correct through a number of amendments, all of which we find both rational and fair.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has complemented his effort by also putting forward a series of valuable amendments.
We have no strong objections to any of the amendments, but we wish to draw attention to the fact that the main problem relating to safeguarding the strict adherence to the regulations shortly to be made into EU legislation is that of implementation.
This in fact is the weak link in bringing together many EU legislatures with application effectiveness.
And we fear that, despite the undoubted improvements to be effected by the numerous amendments, this legislation will still be crippled by inefficiencies in actually and properly implementing it.
Hoping that time proves me wrong, I once again congratulate the rapporteur on a job well done.
Â Â  MrÂ President, todayâs debate on the draft concerning the labelling of organic agricultural products is in line with the general global trend of an increased demand for healthy food.
We are currently having to deal with surplus food production in the countries of the European Union.
We are also witnessing a noticeable growth in the number of cases of illnesses caused by the consumption of food saturated with chemicals.
Consumers are therefore choosing to buy food that is more expensive but safer.
It is not possible to produce such food in many countries because of the poor condition of significant areas of land.
Neither is it possible to produce such food on large farms.
This situation represents an opportunity for countries where the soil is relatively undamaged and which have small or medium-sized farms.
It also represents an opportunity to at least partly resolve the problem of unemployment in rural areas.
Of course, we also have concerns regarding the introduction of unhealthy food into the European Union.
Deception is very common in international trade.
We may shortly be overwhelmed by so-called healthy food, originating from China for example.
The appearance on the European market of theoretically healthy food produced from genetically modifed plants poses an additional risk.
In order to deal with both cases, we should introduce provisions placing an outright ban on the importing of organic produce from outside the Union unless there is complete certainty about the quality standards under which it was produced.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even in his absence, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report, which really is a very good one.
For many farmers, organic farming represents an alternative mode of production.
The advent of genetic engineering is prompting a constant increase in demand for organic products from monitored and certified farms.
Organic foods account for some 5% in terms of quantity of the turnover of the retail trade in food, with consumers opting for organic products not only because of their richer flavour, but also out of a sense of responsibility for the environment and for animals and in order to make a real contribution towards keeping the countryside intact and diverse.
If strategy is to be based on quantity, then countries like Austria â from which I come â can never succeed in tough competition with the big agricultural countries; we must instead go all out for quality â the highest possible quality â products from a high-quality environment.
A high proportion of Austrian agriculture is organic â organic farms accounting for 11.2% of the total â and we are very pleased about that.
The total organic food turnover in Austria amounts to some EURÂ 450Â million per annum.
Confidence in organic products can be maintained only if stringent checks are carried out in all areas, in other words on all products, whether originating from the EU or from third countries.
Only then is there any guarantee that consumers will be willing to pay the higher prices demanded for these products.
Â Â  Mr President, organic food production is becoming increasingly important in my constituency in Ireland.
Over the years, Irish farmers have taken great pride in high quality food produced naturally.
Going organic has been a logical development for many of them.
I am involved in several amendments.
One seeks to limit organic seeds to less than 0.1% GMO contamination, adding another safeguard to the original regulation which only specifies that the parent plant, not the seed, should have been produced organically.
The amendment to Article 16 reinforces the definition of organic agricultural products.
The Commissionâs proposal allows for a series of exceptions from organic production rules, such as the case of setting up organic farms or solving livestock management problems.
This would lead to products that are not organic and not GM-free being on the market labelled as organic.
Instead we need to amend this article to control abuses, only allowing for exceptions in specifically stated and unusual conditions, such as an outbreak of avian flu.
If we are going to ask consumers to choose organic, we are going to have to ensure that what they buy is actually organic.
Â Â  â Mr President, my congratulations to the rapporteur.
We pay a high price nowadays, because much of our diet consists of unhealthy products, many of which are contaminated with various agrochemicals.
We need to adopt a Mediterranean diet, using products without a lot of fats and pesticides.
Organic products are starting to guarantee a better diet, which is why they have been growing over recent years and quite right too.
The European Union, in a bid to protect consumers, has laid down proper production rules and strict controls and, in my opinion, quite rightly so.
However, I still have doubts about organic products imported from third countries, as to whether they are produced to the standards which apply in the European Union.
The certificates which accompany organic products from third countries must refer each time to the specific consignment.
Undertakings in third countries producing organic products for export to the European Union should be inspected once a year.
The European Union wants organic products, but for reasons of consumer protection and equal competition with our farmers, all these controls are needed, because otherwise we shall not have results.
We shall simply help the supermarket chains to get richer at the expense of consumer health and at the expense of European farmers.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for a very good report and the Commissioner for being here at such a late hour.
I should like to ask you, Mr President, to give the Commissioner enough time to sum up properly at the end of the debate.
As she is good enough to come here at this time, we should finish our debate properly.
Concerning organic farming and organic products, I want to stress that people are increasingly buying organic produce, which is to be welcomed.
However, they naturally expect those products to be organic, not to be produced with chemicals or chemical fertilisers.
One of the problems with organic food is the difficulty of testing it to see how it has been produced.
It is very important, therefore, to monitor production in the countries from which we import organic produce.
One problem I foresee with organic production generally, not only in Europe but also outside, is that one of these days a TV documentary will be shown following this food production process from beginning to end that finds that the food is perhaps not as organic as it is believed to be.
That will turn people off the whole process.
It is important, therefore, that people are absolutely certain when they buy a product imported from outside the European Union that those high standards of organic production have been met.
This report and the Commissionâs work are therefore very important, not only for imported organic food but also with regard to ensuring a completely level playing field across Europe in terms of the definition of organic products.
That way, consumers can buy them with great confidence and we in the farming community can produce them with great confidence.
I should like to thank the Commissioner again and shall leave her a few seconds to sum up.
Â Â  I should like to raise five issues relating to organic farming.
The first issue is the labelling of organic products, which means the use of a Community logo for organic products or a national or regional logo, together with information on the place of origin and similar data.
The second matter relates to the conditions in which the organic product is produced, the standards applied and the monitoring carried out.
It is essential to have a list of substances whose use is permitted in organic agriculture, such as plant protection substances, fertilisers, substances used to improve soil quality, enhancers and substances used in processing.
Organic food production takes place in a safe and clean environment that is free from antibiotics, growth hormones and genetically modified organisms.
The certification control system should be subject to compulsory accreditation and continuous monitoring.
Thirdly, there is the issue of the value of organic food and its promotion.
Consumers need to be made aware of the advantages of organic products in order to increase demand.
Better marketing and awareness-raising measures are required to increase the consumption of organic products.
Fourthly, organic farming meets consumersâ needs and expectations regarding food quality.
Organic farming provides an opportunity for farmers to increase their income.
It is also an opportunity to strengthen regional and local development, notably in less developed areas.
Finally, support for organic farming by means of subsidies for organic farming and support for the creation of a system of appropriate distribution and promotion.
This is the weakest link in the relationship between producers and consumers.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, and the rapporteur for his report.
Mr Parish has made the point that consumers place great faith in the word âorganicâ and in organic produce, and we need to ensure that those who want to buy organic are actually getting what they believe is a very pure product.
But the truth is â and I am indebted to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for this gem of information, which I think we in this Chamber probably all know about â there is no recognised scientific test to differentiate organic and conventional produce.
It means that we need to make sure that from the seed onwards there are checks and balances in the system.
We probably have it right on paper, but it is in terms of implementation where this may fall down.
People are paying higher prices for organic produce.
On the Irish market less than 1% of food is organic.
We import 70% of our organic needs and again I have to refer to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, because there are over 70 countries listed.
Some of them I would not have thought would be in the organic league I have to say, but they are on the list and I think that because they are on the list we need to reassure consumers, certainly in Ireland and across the EU, that if they buy organic produce from those countries, they meet the same standards of organic produce from within the European Union.
I think a paper trail is great and the EU is very good on that.
My biggest concern relates to who is monitoring the control bodies and who is checking the auditors.
This is a concern I have across all of our legislation and it is perhaps something that the Commissioner might address in the short time she has available to her.
But yes, the organic sector is growing.
It is a small sector, but I share Mr Parishâs concern that any crack in confidence will destroy it.
It will destroy the market for producers, it will ruin consumer confidence and it is something we should seek to avoid.
My fear is that some organic produce being imported into the EU is anything but organic.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Members for all their comments, although some of them seem to be related more to the general regulation on organic products.
I hope that next time we have a discussion on this issue we will have a bit more time so that I can go into more detail.
Regarding Amendment 13, a meaningful report cannot be drawn up before the first list of control bodies has been functioning for longer; in any case, not before the date of entry into application of the full regulation on 1Â January 2009.
The idea of training of local certifiers is a good one, and we will have to find ways of planning this training.
Training support and technical assistance is also foreseen in the official food and feed control regulation.
The idea raised by the rapporteur of a databank seems to be difficult to implement, but I would be willing to look further into it.
The requirement for the control bodies to be accredited in the context of the list of third countries in paragraph 4 is not applicable, as there is governmental supervision in these cases.
For the control bodies that are listed in paragraph 5, I agree in principle to the request for formal accreditation, but adequate governmental supervision should also be acceptable as an alternative in that situation.
We should also be able to show some flexibility to local bodies in developing countries and in countries at an early stage of development, from whom it is not always feasible to have international accreditation.
I agree with the idea of the supervision of control bodies â I think that it is crucial and essential.
But we would prefer a more general wording on supervision.
More detailed rules can be set out in the implementing rules; but, as mentioned in my introduction, I would prefer to have a very simple and concise proposal.
To conclude, Amendments 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15 and 16 are partially acceptable or acceptable in principle.
The other amendments cannot be accepted.
Thank you for the debate.
I think â maybe not in the letter, but at least in spirit â we are heading in the same direction.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Please forgive me.
Please appreciate our time limitations.
Despite everybodyâs efforts, we have finished almost a quarter of an hour later than planned.
I would like to thank the interpreters for their understanding, allowing us to finish the debate with all of the limitations that I regret having had to impose on them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0216/2006) by MrÂ Ransdorf on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on nanoscience and nanotechnologies: An action plan for Europe 2005-2009 [2006/2004(INI)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor on the issue of nanotechnology with some trepidation, because we have seen that the original plans in this area, from the point of view of the budget, have not been fulfilled.
We have seen expenditure cut by 38%, and, even though in the last framework plan there was a substantial increase from EURÂ 140Â million per year to EURÂ 600Â million, this figure still falls short of what we would have wanted, especially given the EUâs dynamism in this area.
We are still in a great position in the area of fundamental research and publication â the EU is ahead of the United States in the field.
As regards patents, however, the United Statesâ worldwide share is 42%, whereas the EU stands at 36%.
We have also seen that when it comes to getting products onto the market, the EU works more slowly.
US federal expenditure is approximately equivalent to that of the whole of the EU in the area of nanotechnologies and nanosciences, and the individual Member States have unequal spending levels.
In fact, only Ireland spends more per head of the population than the United States.
I wish to stress the fact that opinion polls carried out in 2001, based on a sample of 16Â 000 people, showed that very few people in the EU are informed about nanotechnologies.
In this regard, I should like to quote two great scholars.
The first is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
In Faust, Mephisto says: âDespise reason and science, and you are mine, all mineâ.
I do not wish to take the same position as Mephisto, but, in any event, I should warn against cutting spending in this area in comparison with other countries.
The other great scholar I wish to quote â and I hope this makes him happy, even though he is not here today â is GÃŒnter Verheugen, who last week listed the ten priorities for the Union in this area, one of which is of course preparation of staff, that is to say, investing in educating the public so that it is ready for the new technologies.
We cannot move forward without such change, because public opinion in the EU is often not in favour of these technologies.
Some safety issues are of course exaggerated, for example, some proposed amendments tabled to this report by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Amendments 3 and 6, for example would mean the virtual collapse of a whole framework of progress in research into nanosciences and nanotechnologies in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme.
It is unacceptable that an entire complex research programme should be dismantled on the grounds that there can only be investment in areas where there will be no exposure for people and the environment.
I believe that the European public, the European citizens, should be given safety guarantees, but it is not possible for us to wipe out an entire complex research plan.
Let me say that it is vitally important to emphasise the social aspect of nanotechnologies.
They represent a huge opportunity for creating new jobs, for increasing investment in people, and for strengthening the whole area of medicine and health science.
In this regard, nanotechnologies represent a huge opportunity.
They are comparable in scope with microelectronics in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.
Just like microelectronics, nanotechnologies permeate every area of peopleâs lives.
They have major implications in the field of energy, for example, in terms of the possibilities of new lighter, more reliable and more robust materials.
The possibility also opens up of building transport equipment that will use less energy.
Demand for materials and energy can be cut substantially by means of using nanotechnologies.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the challenge that we have to meet head on if we are to guarantee that the European Community remains competitive on the world stage.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are my introductory remarks and I look forward to the debate.
I should like to thank MrÂ PotoÄnik and MrÂ Verheugen of the Commission, the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and MrÂ RenzoÂ Tomellini, head of the nanosciences and nanotechnologies unit.
Â Â  Mr President, I am here today to talk about the big issue of small technologies.
Over 2000 years ago, the ancient Greek politician Demosthenes said: âSmall opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises.â
I believe he was right. And I mean enterprise in every sense of the word â not just as a business, but as a project and a voyage of discovery.
Nanotechnology has already shown that it holds a lot of promise.
It not only offers new solutions to many current problems, but also opens up new innovation opportunities, boosting the economy and creating jobs.
Nanotechnology is already making a difference in many areas.
For example, new medical treatments are being developed for severe diseases such as brain tumours and Alzheimerâs disease; it is helping the environment through more efficient catalysts, better batteries and more efficient light sources; and smaller, lighter and better-performing materials, components and systems are being created.
But nanotechnology could also make a huge contribution to major global challenges such as how to tackle threats to the environment, how to make better use of resources and create less waste, and how to improve energy generation technologies.
Europe is in a leading position in the world today, partly thanks to the Commissionâs framework programme.
European industry should now reap the benefits of that knowledge through innovative products and processes.
But to follow through, we need to take action on several fronts, which are outlined in the Commissionâs communication Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An Action Plan for Europe 2005-09.
These include the need to increase investment, boost interdisciplinarity, create necessary infrastructures, expand human resources and foster innovation.
Much progress has already been made in implementing the action plan: Commission funding for research in nanosciences and nanotechnologies has steadily increased to about EUR 470 million in 2005.
In fact, the Commission has now become the worldâs largest single public funding agency for nanotechnology.
It accounted for 30% of public funding of nanotechnology research in the European Union last year.
Significant funding increases are expected over the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme.
The Commission has proposed expanding funding for nanotechnology, with a new emphasis on developing infrastructures and projects assessing the risk of nanotechnology for humans and the environment.
That is a key area, because, as well as the benefits, we must also recognise the potential risks.
These must be carefully assessed.
Some concerns have already been raised about new applications.
The action plan addresses these too.
Special projects and publicity in many languages will provide information and communication.
There are projects to engage the public â presenting both sides of the argument; brochures explaining how nanotechnology works; and even DVDs explaining the issues in simple terms for children.
In addition, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies is working on an opinion on the ethics of nanomedicine, which we expect to be delivered to President Barroso soon.
The Commission is committed to ensuring a balanced approach. What is fundamental is to have a high level of public health, safety, environmental and consumer protection.
