Report: Pervenche BerÃšs
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, it is about an important dossier in the area of commitology. I shall not trouble the House for long, but I should like us to be able to vote against the first part of the European Parliament's amendment and in favour of the second part.
I think all Members will have understood the importance of this vote.
Thank you, Mrs BerÃšs.

Energy Star (vote)
Report: Nikolaos Vakalis
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to emphasise that a positive vote by the European Parliament today will be a huge leap forward and will break a taboo that has prevailed in Europe for decades.
For the first time, public money will have to be used, through public procurement, to increase energy efficiency, which is quite rightly considered to be a basic pillar of sustainable energy policy.
I trust that this will mark the start of taxpayers' money being used for high-priority issues.
Finally, I should like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs and the German Presidency for making approval of the regulation at first reading possible.

Thank you, Mrs Lulling.
The House is obviously grateful for your advice.
Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, the House will recall that we had to refer this text back for further discussion because, following conflicting votes, our rapporteur had called for a vote against.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs carried out a serious piece of work, which, obviously, does not correspond with our rapporteur's opinion and no doubt she ought to have withdrawn her name from the final result.
It was not obtained by a small, chance majority but following very thorough work, with the Commission and with the Council, for an extremely reasonable proposal which, I hope, this House will be able to support.

Report: Alejo Vidal-Quadras
- Before the vote on Amendment 2:
rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to speak with regard to Amendment 2, which refers to the role of transport system operators.
In the text of the report there appears the word 'institutional'.
In the language of the European Union, 'institutional' has a very specific meaning which is too high for what is intended here.
My suggestion, therefore, is that we replace the word 'institutional' with 'official'.
It would thereby read thus: 'Welcomes the proposal to grant existing associations of TSOs an official role with formal obligations and objectives (the ETSO+\GTE+ solution);'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)

Production of fishmeal and fish oil (vote)
Report: Struan Stevenson
Madam President, on a point of order, you are obviously having trouble seeing me at the moment.
I asked twice for a check on my own report, which was refused.
I just want to put it on record that perhaps this has happened because you cannot hear a woman sitting at the back, perhaps you will not give the floor or listen to that kind of request.
You and your colleagues have been wrong several times, and although you listened to the request for a check, you did not in the case of my report, and I asked for twice.
I think that should be put on record.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We have heard what you say, but believe you me everybody here does their utmost to listen and to watch, but we take note of what you say.

The next item is the vote.

Convening of the Intergovernmental Conference: opinion of the European Parliament (deadline for tabling amendments): see Minutes
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (DE) Kiev is by no means as far along the 'road to Brussels' as some may believe.
An unambiguous retreat from Moscow which Lukashenko has for some time given the appearance of preparing would have consequences, not least regarding oil and gas supplies.
Any instability in this area would also have consequences for the European Union.
Although the latest round of enlargement has taken us to the limit of our capabilities, it has not yet been resolved whether we will respect Russian influence in the post-Soviet territories, or whether we will continue to blindly ape the US striving to expand in Eastern Europe.
Despite the resulting zigzag course and political tension in Ukraine, it is in our interests to deepen neighbourly relations with Ukraine.
In the confidence-building measure of easing visa restrictions, we should nevertheless ensure that the old scandal is completely cleared up, and there will be no further abuse of the system.
Under the terms of the 2005 Treaty of Accession for Bulgaria and Romania, a simplified system was created allowing their accession to conventions and protocols concluded under Article 34 TEU or Article 293 TEC without the need to negotiate or conclude specific accession protocols to these conventions, thereby reducing the huge bureaucracy which would result from the need for ratification by the twenty-seven Member States.
Thus, the annex sets out a list of seven conventions and protocols relating to justice and internal affairs where the present convention can be found.
I welcome this kind of initiative aimed at reducing Community bureaucracy and the exaggerated amount of time taken up over such simple matters as this.
I, therefore, support this Council Decision determining the date on which the Convention of the 26 of July 1995 on the use of computer systems in the field of customs, and respective protocols, should enter into force in Bulgaria and Romania.
I am voting in favour of Mrs Grabowski's report on the Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Europol Convention of 26 July 1995.
According to the act on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, these states are able to join conventions made by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union according to a simplified procedure.
For this reason there is no need for negotiations and special accession protocols, which would also involve the need for them to be ratified by all members of the Community.
All that is required is that the Council, after consulting with the European Parliament, adopt a decision setting the date on which the Europol Convention becomes effective, along with the necessary protocols.
The Council should also take into account the new deadlines for the effectiveness of the three protocols, dated 30 November 2000, 28 November 2002 and 27 November 2003.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Stubb, on the special report of the European Court of Auditors concerning translation expenditure incurred by the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
I am pleased to have been able to table an amendment deploring the fact that more and more documents and communications - not least compromise amendments when they are voted on in committee - and, for example, annexes to reports, are being submitted in just one language.
This trend goes against the need to maintain a democratic functioning model of our Union involving various peoples from different cultures and language backgrounds.
Our model can be of use to other regions in the world, not least the Mediterranean area, and we must fully respect the use of languages.
I regret that I was unable to prevent the report from encouraging the parliamentary committees and delegations, as far as possible, to submit texts solely in the languages of their full and substitute members and from demanding that other language versions be provided on request.
The latter restriction will result in Members being deprived of the opportunity to follow the work done in committees other than their own.
Respect for the official languages of each Member State of the European Union is laid down in the Treaties.
However, the idea that some translations are dispensable is being encouraged on grounds of the financial question, and by appealing to the need to define priorities and restrictions such as the size of documents.
We do not accept these guidelines, as they counteract respect for multilingualism.
We, therefore, reassert our firm rejection of any effort to limit the use of any official (and working) European Union language on the grounds of high costs, an example of which, as we pointed out at the appropriate time, are the current criteria that determine the languages used during the EU-ACP parliamentary assemblies, which make the use of Portuguese unfeasible in a discriminatory manner.
We also reject a reduction in numbers of interpreters and translators on the pretext of fallacious budgetary arguments, and any precariousness or degrading of their working conditions in Parliament, Commission or Council, namely by promoting the outsourcing of these services which are essential to the adequate functioning of these institutions and to guarantee the citizens of the different Member States of the European Union access to pertinent information in their own language.
in writing. We abstained on today's report from Mr Stubb as we are concerned that the term, 'controlled full multilingualism', could be used to restrict the amount of written material available to Irish speakers in comparison to speakers of other official and working languages.
At present a range of services which could be made available in Irish are not made available because the European Parliament administration shows no wish to do so.
Such unnecessary limitations placed upon the Irish language as a working language should be removed.
Some of the suggestions in Mr Stubb's report with regard to respect for multilingualism, quality control, user satisfaction, translation memory systems and a common database for terminology are positive.
in writing. - (DE) The Court of Auditors' criticism of the 25% rise in the cost of translation, which cannot be explained solely by the increase in the number of official languages from 11 to 21, should be examined in detail.
For this reason it is worth considering whether it would not be advantageous in future to break down the costs of translation by target languages in order to better evaluate need, demand and translation output.
We also need a strategy for the ongoing pre-accession negotiations, because if Macedonia alone has six official languages, we will soon have our own Tower of Babel.
When all the information is made available, the potential for any rational savings will become clear.
However, this audit should not be misused so that even more important EU documents are classed as 'working documents' or 'annexes' to close the door on the obligation for complete translation.
In particular, the use of German, due to its importance as the most widely spoken mother tongue and the second most important foreign language in the EU, should be promoted.
in writing. - (NL) Madam President, I voted in favour of the Stubb report on the grounds that I agree with its gist.
Our actions should remain based on complete multilingualism, out of respect for the principles of equality of all citizens, and for the benefit of the best possible communication and democracy.
At the same time, however, we should exercise caution where costs are concerned because, if not, we run the risk of losing the social support for the multilingualism of our institution.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mr Mulder, on minimising administrative costs imposed by European legislation.
The European Commission's objective of better regulation must be encouraged and monitored.
Pointless administrative costs are the scourge of our societies based on the rule of law, which, at times, do not realise that the inflation of law results in its depreciation, for Europeans do not apply pointless and costly rules.
It is not illusory to envisage a 25% reduction in administrative costs by 2013, provided that we conduct a thorough analysis of what is at stake and do not lose sight of the fact that false economies can be far more costly.
Everyone knows that mediocrity is far more costly, in the long term, than quality.
If we must constantly fight against all pointless laws and their associated administrative costs, we must ensure that we regulate economic activities carefully and with proper judgment, in the best interests of consumers and manufacturers.
in writing. - (DE) If we continue to conjure up new EU agencies just to assuage national sensibilities, and their tasks overlap with existing ones, we really should not be surprised at increasingly vociferous criticism of burgeoning red tape, unchecked organisational nonsense and creating unnecessary jobs.
Citizen-friendliness needs more than e-government and similar publicity stunts, and we have to avoid and cut down on duplication.
We should also make use of the present savings potentials. These include: reducing the seats of Parliament to one single location, assessing expenses on the basis of the actual costs incurred, a top-class anti-fraud system and the real recovery of grants that have been improperly paid out, along with the millions to be saved by not foisting enlargements on reluctant citizens.
In no way should the EU follow the example of some Member States, where increasing numbers of migrants are taken up in the administration.
This will cause irreparable damage to the creation and development of a European identity.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Wallis, on the draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (ROME II).
This extremely complex matter is a step in the direction of harmonising the Member States' conflict of law rules applicable to non-contractual obligations, that is to say, the consequences of road traffic accidents, unfair competition, environmental damage, defamation and, more generally, violation of personal rights, etc.
Overall, the European Parliament has not been sufficiently heard by the Member States, and the countless studies and reports that are to weigh up the consequences of this agreement will be crucial when we return to this important matter.
For example, regarding road traffic accidents, how can we be content with applying the law of the country of the accident, and not that of the country of residence of the victim, and are we sure that recitals of this regulation on their own will make it compulsory for the courts to assess losses?
How are we going to manage defamation in the context of a globalised and dematerialised press?
The examples go on.
A considerable amount of work awaits us on these issues.
in writing. - (FR) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the balanced text that she is proposing to us.
The object of this text is the setting up of a coherent legal framework for relations between international civil laws and other Community instruments.
This regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ('Rome II'), seeks to harmonise national rules of conflict of laws.
These rules determine the law applicable to non-contractual obligations such as, for example, road traffic accidents, product liability, unfair competition or environmental damage.
We are in favour of the principle of adopting standard rules in relation to conflict of laws, although they still need to be, let us remember this, sufficiently clear and precise.
This was not the case with the controversial provisions on defamation by the media.
Freedom of speech and of the press must be protected and be able to be fully exercised.
In the absence here of rules for the protection of editorial independence, it was reasonable to exclude the provisions relating to violation of personal rights by the media from the scope of 'Rome II'.
We shall, therefore, vote in favour of this report.
in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased about the adoption of the compromise negotiated with the Council concerning the second programme of Community action in the field of health 2007-2013.
The European Union can no longer do without a common programme for health with common public investment.
It is unfortunate that the budget has been revised downwards.
A large number of investments are needed before we can have preventive and technical resources.
Prevention is better than cure and good information on lifestyle or a healthier diet in order to reduce mortality due to serious illnesses is an essential prerequisite.
It is necessary also to make generally available technical solutions for emergency situations.
Widespread availability of defibrillators is one of many examples.
Health, however, does not come down to a simple matter of accountancy.
It is also and above all a benefit for everyone.
Making patients more responsible is a central factor.
Setting up clear and applicable provisions everywhere in the European Union is undoubtedly the most essential way forward for the future.
The action programme proposed as the common position of the Council of the EU does not seek to protect and upgrade public health, but to manage its problems, extend the commercialisation and privatisation of health services and help private groups of companies penetrate what is a profitable sector for capital.
The responsibility and obligation of the state to protect and improve public health is being transferred to local authorities, to NGOs, to 'civil society', while personal responsibility is being promoted as the basic determining factor for public health.
Capitalist restructurings in the public health sector come under the general anti-working class policy of the ÎU, the deteriorating terms of insurance and the increased retirement age of the workers.
We are radically opposed to the anti-labour proposals included in the Community action plan in the public health sector.
The Greek Communist Party is fighting for solely public health and welfare services which meet the contemporary needs of working families.
(NL) Madam President, I am right here in the centre.
Allow me to make a brief observation with regard to reducing the use of mercury, of which everyone is in favour.
It is a good thing because, in many sectors, the use of mercury has been superseded and, indeed, has to be replaced by other materials, but a total ban on traditional objects, including the traditional mercury barometer, is taking matters too far in our view.
I recently paid a visit to the Dingens company in the Belgian town of Leopoldsburg, where, for decades, they have proved that mercury barometers can be produced in a sustainable and ecologically responsible manner.
Moreover, these traditional barometers have an unlimited lifespan, unlike their digital successors, which work on batteries and therefore use energy.
Also, since the producers of traditional barometers have become skilled in maintaining these devices in a sustainable manner, mercury from barometers no longer ends up in the waste cycle.
I would therefore call on the Commission - and this is my final comment - and all those involved to send out a signal at this stage to the sector involved and for the benefit of the assessment, which has taken two years, to give due account to this justified specific situation of the mercury barometer products so that they, hopefully, continue to qualify for exemption schemes.
(NL) Thank you, Madam President.
I voted in favour of Amendments 1 and 2, because I take the view that the production of traditional barometers must remain an option.
I resent any kind of European interference which leads not only to traditional customs and production methods, but also employment, falling by the wayside.
Moreover, it is very much the question whether the ban on mercury barometers would be an effective measure.
Other forms of mercury use are far more extensive and far more problematic than those in the production of barometers.
Also, as mercury barometers do not require any batteries, they have an unlimited life span.
This House has once again managed to miss out on an opportunity to give due account to a specific reality, namely that small and medium-sized enterprises occupy a critical position in our economy and in Europe.
The last thing these SMEs need is even more European busybodying and interference.
in writing. I voted in favour of the amendments to exempt barometers from this overly prescriptive legislation and, upon defeat of the amendments, I voted against the report.
The total ban on mercury instruments destroys a long-standing craft industry in the UK and is the product of obsessive meddling by Brussels in matters far beyond what is necessary or sensible.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the wise decision taken in relation to the Council common position, which takes up most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament.
The main difference between the positions of Parliament and of the Council concerns mercury barometers and the derogations to be implemented, in view of the fact that the ban that would subsequently be introduced would only apply to new mercury barometers, as barometers that are already in circulation can always be resold, repaired and maintained.
Given the very hazardous properties of mercury and the much larger amount of mercury contained in traditional barometers in comparison, for example, with fever thermometers, the solution proposed by the Council to grant a limited derogation is a balanced compromise: the aim, in fact, is to grant a temporary derogation in order to allow the manufacturers of traditional barometers to adapt to the new arrangements.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury.
I am in favour of restricting the marketing to the general public of measuring devices containing mercury, which have been banned in France since 1998.
The Council common position accepted by Parliament establishes a balance allowing both a reduction in the release of mercury in the environment while allowing a transition period for certain articles such as traditional barometers.
A transition period of two years after the date of entry into force of the directive will allow the industries concerned to develop their technology to produce mercury-free devices.
in writing. I am appalled that we are still producing legislation which puts jobs at risk for no real environmental benefit.
UK barometer-making, like that in other Member States, is a traditional industry dating back several centuries.
It is clearly necessary that the use of mercury is properly controlled and we have made substantial progress in recent years on related matters such as storage and export.
However, it should be possible to safeguard traditional barometer-making by ensuring that proper safety warnings etc. are used.
There is no need to destroy a long-established craft simply because it is easier to have 'one size fits all' legislation.
Social Europe means nothing if it means putting people in traditional crafts out of work.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, mercury is a dangerous product that should be handled with the necessary caution.
Nobody in this House is in any doubt of this.
Unfortunately, this House has pursued this position today with regard to the vote on the Sornosa MartÃ­nez report to absurd levels, something which I deeply regret.
By holding firm to a total ban on the production of traditional barometers, the Commission, backed up today by a majority of this House, has sounded the death knell for a sector that stands for 360 years of European tradition.
The fact that all barometer manufacturers in the European Union only account for a few tenths of percentages of the annual mercury consumption, mercury which, by the way, is recycled 100%, makes the matter only worse.
Today, we were clearly not guided by common sense in our decision.
in writing.
(SV) The votes on Mrs Westlund's reports are not just about which food additives may be used. They are mainly about who is to decide on individual issues concerning food additives.
In contrast to the rapporteur, we Swedish Conservatives do not believe that the European Parliament should evaluate, and take decisions on approving, individual food additives, for example on the basis of details such as the risks posed by individual food additives to people with allergies.
That would involve a politicisation of important issues that should be decided on a scientific basis and at the level of the relevant authority.
We therefore reject the proposal concerning increased powers of codecision for Parliament.
As a consequence of this, we have voted against unduly detailed regulations in today's vote.
(CS) Commissioner, I supported the more flexible authorisation of food additives.
The Commission should look specifically at the impact of these additives on the environment and on health.
I should like, if I may, to draw your attention to the high number of people with allergies, whose lives depend on keeping to a gluten-free diet.
In addition to specially made goods, they buy normal foods that do not normally contain gluten. Additives must be properly labelled so that consumers are not misled.
Manufacturers and supervisors often ignore the fact that the labelling of every product must explicitly show whether it contains gluten.
Statistically Europeans suffering from food allergies are unfortunately not provided with the necessary information when they make their purchases, so either their choice of food is restricted or, much worse, they put their health at risk.
I therefore call on the Commission to oversee a proper investigation into gluten in additives and to promote the comprehensive labelling of all foods so that those Europeans on a gluten-free diet are also able to understand it.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Swedish fellow Member, Mrs Westlund, on food additives.
While it is normal to simplify the European Commission's task by agreeing that decisions on authorisation of food additives should come under the comitology procedure, the Commission must, for its part, take account of the comments that Parliament has been making non-stop for years now in the new regulation on food additives, and in the new regulation establishing a common food authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings.
These comments chiefly concern the environment, public health and allergy sufferers.
We should be pleased that the current legislation stipulates that the authorisation of additives must not mislead consumers.
However, colourings sometimes give the impression that a foodstuff contains fruit, when that is not the case.
Consumer protection must therefore be strengthened on this point, without this affecting manufacturers.
in writing. Although I agree with the principles contained within the amendments on the labelling of GMOs, I abstained because I believe these matters should be addressed by national governments and should not become an EU competence.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my esteemed Irish colleague, Mrs Doyle, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on food enzymes and amending a number of existing texts.
In order to remove the barriers to trade and to prevent not only legal uncertainty, but also differing health and consumer protection standards among the Member States, it is vital that we harmonise, at Community level, the rules on the use of enzymes in the food processing sector, which has developed considerably over the last few years (baked goods, cheese, beer, fruit juice, starch, etc.).
Major scientific and technological developments, which make it possible to have new enzymes made from genetically modified micro-organisms, must lead us to accept this prospect of harmonised legislation on the use of food enzymes within the European Union.
This is in the best interests of consumers and manufacturers, provided that we do not have too costly a form of legislation.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Slovenian fellow Member, Mrs DrÄar Murko, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending a number of existing texts.
At present, all natural tastes and odours can be copied synthetically from 2 600 molecules with flavouring properties, with the possibility being there to create new tastes that do not exist in nature.
Technological developments in the flavourings sector and the rapidly changing tastes of our fellow citizens must encourage us to monitor food safety and consumer protection and to give the industry concerned the opportunity to pursue technological development, with the aim of all this being to strengthen the internal market.
Many questions have been raised, and I welcome the compromises reached by the rapporteur, which ensure that the proposal for a regulation represents an effective initiative aimed at modernising and simplifying the legislation on flavourings.
in writing. I will be voting for this report.
I welcome in particular the commitment to labelling GMOs.
I do not share entirely the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues as to the safety of GMOs.
My judgement is different.
As a scientist I believe GMOs have a role to play.
Nevertheless, I do accept that others have the right to make their own choices.
Therefore, labelling enables those whose judgement differs from mine to avoid products they chose to reject.
in writing. Although we agree with the principles contained within these amendments on the labelling of GMOs, UKIP has abstained because these matters should be addressed by national governments and should not become an EU competence.
in writing. Amendment 38 - providing that GMO-derived content of food be indicated by labelling - attracts abstention (rather than support) despite its inherent desirability, owing to its dangerously and irreformably undemocratic source (EU institutions).
In other words, I consider centralist EU rule, without democratic accountability, to be more of a threat to civilisation than are unlabelled, GMO-derived food additives.
Therefore, I abstain rather than voting for this amendment.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the package relating to the rationalisation of procedures for the authorisation, use and consolidation of directives relating to additives and flavourings, as well as the harmonisation of legislation relating to enzymes.
A certain number of additional guarantees have been introduced to ensure the transparency of decisions and the protection of consumers and I am very pleased about that.
The aim of future legislation will be to ensure consumer protection and food safety while preserving innovation and competitiveness in the food processing industry.
The food industry uses many natural and artificial flavourings: no fewer than 2 600 are listed.
More and more enzymes enter also into the manufacture of food stuffs and the texts adopted seek to improve the safety of the use of these substances.
The competitiveness of the food processing industry in the market should be preserved.
Natural flavourings are wholly made up of natural flavouring agents.
The ratio of 90/10 proposed by the Commission made it possible to produce a natural flavour with tastes differing according to the products, targets or the culture of Member States.
The 10% came from natural sources other than the substance concerned.
I regret therefore the adoption of the arbitrary rule called 95/5 which could penalise the food processing industry but without giving the consumer better information.
in writing. I voted against the report on excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
The ECON Committee voted for a 4,5% increase in minimum rates.
As I am against any tax harmonisation or increase, no matter how small, I have had to vote against Astrid Lulling's report.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, emotions run high each time we discuss beer, wine or other alcoholic beverages in this House.
This was also true of the brewery agreements.
Today is no different.
Fifteen years ago, the Council agreed on minimum rates for excise on alcoholic beverages.
The intention was clear: bring the vastly different rates in the Member States into line with each other.
So many years later, we have to conclude that the decisions taken at the time have overshot the mark.
Accordingly, for public health reasons, some Member States, including the Scandinavian countries, apply rates that are much higher than the minimum rates.
Which is not a bad thing at all.
Every Member State is entitled to adopt excise policy that is commensurate with its national traditions and policy preferences.
Let us, however, also admit that the inflation correction of existing rates, proposed by the Commission, will not make any difference.
As the current excise straddle between the Member States and the existing competitive distortions will persist without any sign of let-up, I supported rapporteur Lulling in her no-vote.
- (DE) Madam President, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert's target for the proposed directive should be supported because it is quite simply a matter of protecting important infrastructure which affects several countries against terrorist attacks.
That is why we need to identify and define the infrastructure, as well as security plans.
The Commission's proposal goes too far, though.
It undermines the principle of solidarity by confusing anti-terrorist activities with economic instruments.
The Commission should also ask itself whether the centralised compilation of critical infrastructure will not serve the terrorists and thereby increase the risk.
This House has made constructive amendment proposals, which, thank goodness, we have approved with a large majority.
I therefore propose that the Commission revise these.
I have voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, on the proposal for a Council directive on critical infrastructure.
Firstly, I applaud the vision of the European Council of June 2004, which is behind this proposal for a directive.
It is, in fact, imperative that the European Union support the Member States in protecting critical infrastructure from the risks, including terrorist risks, that we face.
Although the responsibility for this type of infrastructure lies with the Member States and the owners/operators who are generally linked to them, it is logical to communitise certain aspects of prevention, identification, designation of critical infrastructure, as well as the evaluation of the need to protect this infrastructure better.
Internet development and the liberalisation of certain markets (electricity, gas, telecommunications, rail freight, etc.) must lead us to be more vigilant regarding our critical infrastructure, which is becoming more and more interconnected throughout Europe and of which the interruption, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, or destruction could have serious repercussions for health, security and the economic and social well-being of Europeans and for the proper functioning of the Member States' governments.
The establishment of a common framework for action to protect European critical infrastructures means that we are once again faced with the central question of transferring competencies that lie at the heart of the States' sovereignty to the sphere of the EU.
The definition of the protection of these infrastructures at Community level, in the name of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', will mean that the Member States will be faced with the responsibility of implementing binding measures, as, indeed, is mentioned in the justification of this proposal.
Despite the rapporteur's having mitigated the scope of the initial proposal, by underlining, for example, that 'the responsibility for the protection of critical infrastructures lies solely and exclusively with the Member States' and considering 'that a Community approach is only justifiable if at least three Member States, or two Member States besides the one in which the critical infrastructure is situated, are affected', the fundamental objectives are not called into question.
It should also be emphasised that, as recent events have shown, measures which compromise the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the citizens have been implemented on the pretext of the said 'fight against terrorism'.
Let us hope that the concept of 'protection of European critical infrastructures' does not come to be used as an argument in favour of curtailing legitimate industrial action by workers defending their rights.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for the report on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructure and the assessment of the need to improve their protection.
Damage to, or the outage of, an infrastructure facility in one Member State may have negative consequences for other Member States and on the European economy as a whole.
For this reason, protecting critical infrastructure is essential for the internal security of the EU.
I also agree with the report's proposal for setting up a list of priority sectors containing critical European infrastructure be made subject to common criteria.
However, the Member States should not be obliged to disclose their critical infrastructure in great detail, as this would go against the interests of national security.
Horizontal legal provisions at EU level, which would take into account the complex processes and the interfaces of critical infrastructures with a trans-national dimension is a justified concern.
It should, however, be recognised at the same time that the EU should support, not duplicate, the work done by the Member States.
For this reason I also approve of the proposal for a bottom-up approach, as national authorities know best what is going on in their own countries.
in writing. There is no European critical infrastructure, it is national.
Its protection is the responsibility of national governments, particularly given the threats facing the democracies from terrorism.
I am, of course, in favour of measures that would genuinely enhance security.
However, the directive is a further step in the EU's attempts to extend its reach into the security and defence sphere.
This is its most objectionable element.
The Commission seems to view security as a means to ensure that the, 'stability of the Internal Market is maintained', which misses the point.
The proposed system of reporting risk and threat assessments to the Commission merely creates additional bureaucratic burdens and structures.
The requirement for Member States to notify the Commission of specific critical infrastructures is counter-productive, as it would produce a list of targets that would be of great interest to the wrong people.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against Mr Vidal-Ouadras' report, not because I oppose opening up the electricity and gas markets - quite the contrary, but I cannot agree with one of the core requirements, which is ownership unbundling - or rather, I cannot do so at present - for three reasons: firstly, because we have to give national regulatory authorities more time to build up effective regulation for competition; secondly, it has by no means been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that ownership unbundling will promote investment in supply networks, and thirdly, because the unbundling proposal does not apply where networks and generation facilities are still under state ownership.
This is the point where we should impose those strict liberalisation conditions that have so far been denied to competition, instead of undermining those that are on the right market economy track through unbundling provisions.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague, Mr Vidal-Quadras, on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market. The report has made it possible for us to review this matter after a long process of energy market liberalisation and, above all, for the European Council of March 2006 to adopt an 'energy package' aimed at safeguarding security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability in relation to EU energy policy.
I regret that the amendment tabled by my colleagues, Mr Reul, Mrs Laperrouze, Mrs Trautmann and others, for which I voted, has not been adopted by Parliament, since it provided for a balanced alternative to the mere ownership unbundling of energy networks, while safeguarding the independence of that unbundling.
These are subjects on which the political debate is far from over.
The same is true of the role of the regulators, the lifting of the barriers to interconnections, the development of new massive generation from renewable energy sources, the substantial investment in infrastructure to meet growing needs and so on.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against the Vidal-Quadras report on the prospects for the internal gas and electricity market which prepares for the presentation next September by the Commission of a third 'liberalisation' package.
First of all I am opposed to the liberal dogmatic principle of ownership unbundling (ownership and management of the network), because it brings no guarantee in relation to investments, supply, safety or access for third parties and renewable energy to the network.
It does not ensure availability of energy at the best price for citizens and it does not fulfil public service obligations either.
Why then disrupt the present organisation, which works well and ensures the effective independence of system operators, thanks, in particular to strong intervention by the regulator and putting in place strict rules to guarantee equality of treatment and a quality service to all users of the networks, even those who live in regions with a natural handicap and very remote regions.
Furthermore, I think that the problem of the independence of the transmission system operators does not relate to the issue of the system of ownership, but to that of regulation.
Why, therefore, ask for the elimination of the public character of energy operators?
in writing. - (FR) I regret the adoption of ownership unbundling defended by the fierce defenders of the dismantling of large companies.
In my opinion, the liberal right has struck another blow to the principle of public service mission, which is so dear to European citizens.
I think that ownership unbundling brings no guarantee in relation to investments, safety or third party access (including renewable energy sources, which could be penalised because of their high costs).
Nor does it ensure availability of energy at the best price for citizens.
I believe it would have been preferable to retain a system like the French one, which integrates into its working the legislative rules from previous European directives.
This is another one of the steps towards the liberalisation of the internal gas and electricity market in the wake of the Lisbon Strategy.
The keywords in this report are 'liberalisation' and 'market'.
The basic idea from which they set out is always the same.
The premise, already refuted by innumerable examples, that the market alone will resolve the problem of energy supply and consumption, is defended with growing fervour in an effort to conjure away what is increasingly difficult to ignore: that the 'market' has only been a success for some, who have accumulated fabulous profits, but not for the consumers, who find themselves confronted with ever-higher energy bills.
Its strategic nature means that the energy sector is vital for a country's independence and sovereignty.
To subject it to private national and transnational interests is an affront to the sovereignty of the peoples and the rights of the workers and populations.
We, therefore, once again, reject the liberalisation of gas and electricity, advocating that they should remain in the public sector as the sole guarantee of access to a continuous service offering quality and accessible prices.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors because I do not consider that transmission ownership unbundling is the most effective way of stimulating investment in these infrastructures.
As the report recognises, 'this model might not address all of the issues at stake, such as interconnections and congestion points'.
The fact is that the electricity market and the gas market require significant investment.
It is not by eliminating the big operators in the market that the European Union will be able to guarantee its security of supply.
A strange fact remains that the European countries that have liberalised the most also have the highest prices for consumers.
in writing. Sinn FÃ©in rejected the Vidal-Quadras report on the internal gas and electricity market because of its emphasis on privatisation and "unbundling".
Member States should retain the right to fully own and operate their energy systems if they see fit to do so.
As an all-Ireland party we look forward to the development of an all-Ireland energy market which is fully integrated and managed in an accountable way.
Interconnections between north and south are important infrastructural elements in the creation of an all-Ireland economy.
in writing. - (FR) The Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP) delegation wishes to point out and highlight the fact that ownership unbundling is not the best answer to current market dysfunctions.
In a context of strong competition, which sees the emergence of powerful non-European operators, we feel it is dangerous to dismantle the European energy companies in the name of a dogmatic approach to competition policy, far removed from the industrial strategies that ought to strengthen the European Union in global competition.
European energy supply is a strategic long-term issue that requires its security to be guaranteed beyond the duration of a single contract.
This security of energy supply depends upon investments that are already clearly inadequate.
They will, however, have to increase significantly in order to meet our future needs whether for gas or electricity.
Ownership unbundling means that our traditional energy operators will not be able to realise these investments in the energy networks.
Handing over this opportunity to new entrants, who will not necessarily have the financial resources needed, or to non-European companies, who do not necessarily share our assessment of our future needs is very dangerous and very worrying.
In these circumstances, the UMP delegation expects the European Commission to develop an alternative approach to ownership unbundling.
Animal proteins are not a natural part - and I emphasise the word 'natural' - of the diet of, for example, an adult bovine.
Currently, many appear to have forgotten - or make out that they have forgotten - the consequences of the 'mad cow' crisis - BSE - on human and animal health, and the socio-economic consequences underlying the intensive production model which caused it.
The current report supports the lifting of the ban on the use of fish oil and flour in ruminant fodder.
The intention is to further increase the profits of the agro-industry and large-scale farmers.
We should reject this intention. Not only because this measure is linked to the development of intensive production and the verticalisation of agricultural production, and because it would encourage fishing on an industrial scale to obtain fish flour and oil for fodder, namely for ruminants - when, at a time of scarcity, maritime fishing resources should be put to better use as foodstuff for human consumption - but, above all, because there are still risks for human and animal health.
Thus, we consider imperative the application of the principle of precaution.
We therefore regret the rejection of our proposal to reject the lifting of the current ban.

Posting of workers (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the secondment of employees. (0-0041/2007-B6-0312/2007) by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
rapporteur. - (SV) I believe it was Jacques Delors who said that the internal market for goods and services would never succeed without a strong social dimension.
Why did he say that?
What he meant was that we must not use poor working conditions, low wages and so on to compete with each other in the internal market.
Why not?
Because European workers would never accept such a policy.
The flexicurity debate also shows that we cannot use low wages and poor working conditions to compete with countries outside the EU.
Nor, then, can we adopt a similar approach within the EU.
It is in that perspective that we should view the Posting of Workers Directive.
The Posting of Workers Directive has come about with a view to guaranteeing fair and decent working conditions for employees: wage conditions, working times and other working conditions.
Minimum rules have been talked about, but if we are to proceed on the basis of the Advocate General's opinion in the Laval case it is not minimum rules but, rather, normal rules that should apply.
That is what the Advocate General goes so far as to say in his opinion.
That is important for employees.
It is important if they are to have decent conditions, and it is also important for companies.
If we had not had these regulations, we should have benefited those companies that pay poor wages and those that have rotten working conditions.
There would have been no competition-neutrality - something that is important for both employees and companies.
The Commission has produced an interpretation.
I can say that there are parts of it with which we agree, but that there are also parts with which we disagree.
Allow me to begin with those parts with which we agree.
A better exchange of information is needed between the authorities in the various Member States.
Those companies that happen to operate in another country need to be significantly better informed of the conditions in that country.
This is an area in which we can do a lot in the future.
The Commission has looked at case law and has sometimes come up with over-interpretations, but sometimes also with correct interpretations.
When it comes to third-country citizens, we have no views on the interpretation produced by the Commission, but when it comes to a number of other matters we do not share the Commission's approach.
Allow me to give two examples.
The first concerns the requirement for a representative.
In this area the Commission has produced an over-interpretation of the existing conception of justice.
The case that exists is about the need to force the representative to be resident in the country in which the activity is taking place.
We are not laying down that requirement.
That being said, it is important that countries be able to make demands of a representative who is not just anyone but who has a genuine mandate to represent the company.
That is important in my country, where we have collective agreements, and it is also important in other countries from the perspective of the authorities and in terms, for example, of the conditions of the working environment.
It must be possible to make demands of a representative who has a mandate to speak on behalf of the company.
The next issue is that of social documentation.
There are legal cases to which the Commission refers.
We are concerned here with Belgium and with the issue of whether documentation should be kept for five years.
That is an unreasonable length of time; I can agree about that.
However, documentation is needed to show who is employed and working and what wages and working hours they have.
Such information is undoubtedly needed during the period that the work is being carried out and also for a reasonable period thereafter.
We are, of course, aware that a certain amount of cheating goes on in these matters, so a reasonable period after the work has been carried out is needed.
The mistake made by the Commission is to have over-interpreted in its communication.
It has over-interpreted the case law.
The requirement for a representative is important, as is the demand for social documentation.
The Commission states that we must not challenge any labour market model within Europe.
That is an important statement, but that is precisely what is being done when criticism is directed at those Member States that lay down requirements in terms of representatives and social documentation.
If it is not permitted to lay down such requirements, it is of course impossible to have a regulated labour market and impossible to maintain our labour market model.
It is, then, another model that we are speaking of, and that is something that the Commission should take on board.
Germany has put forward precisely the same criticism as the Nordic countries have done.
Finally, I should just like to address the issue of balance.
Those countries that do not exercise any control at all should also be criticised.
There are countries that do not have sufficient controls in place, which means that employees perhaps work in conditions that do not comply with the requirements of the Posting of Workers Directive.
These countries should come in for criticism.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, honourable Members, on 13 June 2007 the Commission adopted the final communication relating to the 2006 communication, in which it expressed its full support for the Member States' objective of stamping out illegal practices in the labour market.
The Commission acknowledges that national bodies must carry out appropriate checks in order to ensure that service providers comply with national working conditions.
Nevertheless, assessments of the progress made since 2006, which the Commission carried out on the basis of information from the Member States and the social partners at EU level, indicate that some measures implemented in some Member States are disproportionate and overstep the mark in terms of what is needed in order to guarantee effective protection for posted workers.
As the June 2007 communication pointed out, it appears that this situation has arisen from ineffective cooperation between the relevant bodies in the Member States and from inadequate access to information.
In its communications, the Commission points out that as regards the free movement of services, which is enshrined in the EC Treaty, rules can be restricted only on grounds of overriding public interest, for example the protection of workers, and these reasons must be appropriate.
We should assess on a case-by-case basis whether particular national measures can be viewed as justified and appropriate - for example the requirement to have a representative who is resident in the host country or the obligation to hold certain documents relating to social and labour conditions in the host territory for monitoring purposes.
The Commission is looking very carefully at the situation in every Member State so that it can determine which control measures might be deemed unjustified and inappropriate.
Where necessary, the Commission will initiate proceedings on grounds of non-compliance with obligations, so that Community law can be enforced.
Let me stress that the Commission is also examining the possibility of whether measures adopted by individual Member States are adequate and effective.
If not, they will proceed in the same way, because the objective is to protect workers effectively without hindering the internal market.
The Commission does not currently intend to publish any further guidelines.
The final decision on compliance with national measures rests with the Court of Justice, which has already issued a number of rulings, and not with either the Commission or Parliament.
As regards cooperation on information, checks carried out by the Commission demonstrate that there has been an encouraging improvement.
Yet further improvement is essential.
The Commission is therefore proposing to enhance and strengthen administrative cooperation with the Member States, above all to bring together other interested parties - in particular the social partners - that play an important role in monitoring compliance with the rules.
Assessment of enforcement measures indicates that although the implementation of the directive has not led to many formal complaints or legal proceedings, there are some problems that require further consideration, such as the effectiveness of cross-border enforcement of sanctions or the protection of workers in the case of multiple subcontracting.
The Commission would like to involve the social partners and the Member States in that work.
Lastly, I should like to stress that the June 2007 communication demonstrates that, as a matter of principle, the Commission does not in any way wish to undermine the various social models of the Member States nor the way in which Member States organise their systems of labour law relations and collective bargaining.
It is of course the Commission's job to guarantee that European Community law is strictly complied with, and in cases where inappropriate measures have been adopted, leading not to the protection of workers but rather to restrictions on the freedom to provide services in the internal market, the Commission has to take action, as enshrined in the Treaty.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, one of the challenges of trying to produce an oral question followed by an immediate resolution in a very short space of time is to get it to reflect fully everything we want it to say.
I think on this occasion, as in maybe some others, the very rush has meant that not all of us agree with the wording of every detail of the resolution.
That is not meant to be a criticism of political opponents on the other side of the House.
It is just meant to be a comment, a statement of where it is.
I would like to add - unofficially in any response and consideration the Commission gives to this - the following question.
If the current directive is not being implemented satisfactorily in all Member States, could the Commission please consider taking a bit more time out to understand why?
Are there some intrinsic problems with the directive?
Are there some issues that certain Member States still have with it?
So rather than us just forcibly saying 'the directive is the directive is the directive, thou shalt implement it without delay', please can we look at listening a little bit more, because I am sure there is something we can learn.
In principle, we are all for having a directive in this area so that there is clarity.
The final thing I would just say is certainly from this side of the House.
We are interested in helping workers being posted.
We are interested of course in their security of work conditions, but we are interested in promoting their mobility.
We are not interested in using this as a device for protectionism to prevent workers being posted.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I can tell you that my group has very mixed feelings about this new communication by the Commission.
On the one hand, it is, of course, good that the Commission wishes to continue to focus on the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive, because, almost weekly, we get to hear about new cases of social exploitation of employees posted elsewhere, a situation which, moreover, has placed a considerable strain on our working conditions in our countries.
On the other hand, we have the distinct impression that the Commission still has not managed to strike the right balance between guaranteeing the freedom of provision of services on the one hand and protecting employees on the other.
It should be clear to you, Commissioner, that a number of control measures which Member States have taken, including the requirement to keep documents in the workplace, imposing posting of workers declarations or the presence of an authorised representative, are essential in order to be able to protect the working conditions of workers posted elsewhere.
It is, moreover, abundantly clear, Commissioner, that Member States can only rely on their own national measures, because the desperately needed transnational cooperation between administrations and access to the necessary information is virtually non-existent, and international force mechanisms simply do not work.
Nevertheless, the communication suggests that a host of these measures are incompatible with Community legislation, and you even threaten to institute infringement procedures, even before the desperately needed steps have been taken to guarantee the flow of information, to allow cooperation between the Member States to really function and to put an effective system of penalties in place.
Needless to say, my group welcomes the Commission's intention to set up a permanent high-level committee to help the Member States enhance their cooperation.
Administrative cooperation is not enough, though, Commissioner.
What we also ask for is a European platform for cross-border cooperation between the competent inspectorates of the Member States.
Until this aspect has been addressed, a crucial instrument to enforce compliance with the Posting of Workers Directive will be lacking.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, I wish, on behalf of my group, to support the approach chosen by the Commission in connection with this directive, namely that of putting its faith in the provision of better information and in enhanced cooperation between Member States and, in cases of serious infringement, in taking Member States to the European Court of Justice.
Unfortunately, we do, of course, have to recognise that, in an enlarged EU with large differences in income, there is a lot of insecurity, including insecurity associated with this subject.
On the one hand, there is the fear that employees posted to another Member State will work under poorer social conditions than normal in the host country and that this situation will create a threat to security of employment.
On the other hand, there are still many bureaucratic obstacles to the free exchange of services in the EU.
These factors impede competition and mean that people receive poorer services.
What, of course, the Posting of Workers Directive is precisely designed to bring about is a proper balance between the freedom to provide cross-border services and the simultaneous maintenance of labour market protection in the host country.
At consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have previously been told by employers' representatives and unions that the Posting of Workers Directive is, in actual fact, good enough, but it is very complicated.
Employers and employees do not, therefore, have a good enough knowledge of their duties and rights, and that is a situation that we must do something about.
It needs to be simple and straightforward to do things in a law-abiding way, and such a state of affairs needs to be brought about through the provision of information - understandable information, mind you - in people's own language.
People also need easy access to help in solving problems.
The Commission has observed that the Member States do not always have confidence in the information exchanged between countries, and I therefore think it a good idea now to strengthen the ongoing cooperation between the Member States in this area.
Moreover, the Dublin Agency on Living and Working Conditions should take it upon itself to exchange good practice and, in that way, involve both the labour market partners and the Member States in a positive process.
On the issue, mentioned by Mr Andersson, of the host country requiring there to be a representative and on the issue of documentation at the workplace, I too think it important that we maintain the right balance, and I really do basically think that this balance is what the Commission has found.
That is the background to our amendments to the report.
The representative need not necessarily be physically present in the host country.
That is something on which we agree, and I should like to see it made clear.
Regarding the reference to the Laval or Waxholm case, I think we must await the final decision before using the matter as guidance as to the state of the law.
That concludes my observations.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the present debate is also a warning: if this communication is yet another attempt to smuggle the deleted Articles 24 and 25 of the original Services Directive through the back door, then this House will unambiguously reject it.
The Posting of Workers Directive is there to protect workers, and this protective function must remain sacrosanct.
In the Posting of Workers Directive the local principle prevails, which means, amongst other things, that all measures by Member States that serve to protect posted workers and protect their interests are legitimate and desirable.
The Directive is a law for a free internal market for services. But this freedom cannot come at any cost.
It is not the go-ahead for social dumping.
I am tired of having to make armchair decisions about the theoretical possibility of providing evidence of fair pay in the worker's country of origin within two or four weeks.
The situation on big and small building sites all over Europe tells a different tale.
The lack of possibilities for checking payslips on site gives additional opportunity to criminal machinations.
Surely that is not something you want to take the responsibility for?
Go and see the building sites for yourselves before proceeding any further.
See how workers are deprived of fair wages, and how social dumping distorts fair competition on those sites.
Equal pay for equal work in the same place must be the overriding principle.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, first of all we need to remember that the Posting of Workers Directive is about workers' rights, and it just lays down minimum standards in terms of pay rates, holidays, working hours and so on. Without the Directive, workers are open to all sorts of abuses through post-box companies and bogus self-employment, a fact which some employers have not been slow to exploit.
However, it seems to me that, in its emphasis, the Commission gives primacy to removing obstacles to the provision of services and the orderly functioning of the internal market.
I believe the resolution associated with this oral question represents a step back from existing Parliament positions, most recently expressed in the Schroedter report.
The fact is that the Commission has not enforced the Directive, and many Member States ignore its provisions.
These failures should not be sidestepped in arguments about proportionality or protectionism.
When Parliament adopted the Services Directive, those of us who were concerned about its impact on workers' rights were assured that the proper enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive would deal with our concerns.
That has not happened, and the Commission has failed to enforce this Directive properly.
This leaves many workers exposed, without the minimum standards necessary to avoid exploitation and abuse.
(DE) Madam President, On 13 June the DG Employment notified the Commission that some Member States are not implementing the Posting of Workers Directive conscientiously, Germany included.
My country is accused of exercising excessively stringent controls, and thereby driving workers from other Member States away.
How provocative can you get?
I expected a different position from a Commissioner whose fairness I otherwise greatly value.
Although cooperation between sending countries and recipient countries is important, it cannot replace effective controls.
Our common aim must be to secure worker protection, to prevent social dumping and to uncover and punish illegal working.
But this can only be done if we have valid documents, which should be in the language of the host country.
The following should be ready for presentation: work contracts, pay calculations, timesheets.
The General Prosecutor at the European Court of Justice supports this view, because inspectors will obviously have considerable problems with documents that have not been drawn up in the language of the respective country.
Secondly, in order to allow notices to be properly sent, the recipient must prove an address in Germany, and not just a mail-drop abroad that has been specially chosen for anonymity and everyone is obliged to appoint as an official representative anyone they consider appropriate.
The place of work could also be an address.
This I consider to be a fair solution.
Threatening infringement proceedings are an insult.
In Europe, Commissioner, things must be fair, not least as regards controls.
Mr Å pidla, I ask you, please keep the sense of scale and balance we are used to seeing from you.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those who thinks that posting of workers is an opportunity for the European Union and its citizens.
An opportunity both in economic terms and in terms of contributing to strengthening the European idea.
Workers who are posted on European territory are first of all Europeans and they must be treated as such, which, to my mind, means that for the same job in the same territory, no inequality should be allowed.
One of the problems raised today by the Directive 96/71/EC is that, on account of the lack of harmonisation of national systems in relation to labour law and the disparities existing between new and old Member States in this field, a fear arises that this directive will allow arbitration between Member States and be linked with 'social dumping'.
I repeat once more: it is from the top that social Europe must be built, and not by smashing to bits its social acquis, as some here would like.
I cite as evidence certain amendments tabled on this report in relation to modernising labour law.
In this field, I advise them not to play at alchemy, at the risk of finding themselves confronted with uncontrollable social conflicts.
To my mind, in order to avoid these pitfalls, Member States must be able to continue to retain some restrictions but also, when they receive workers on secondment, they must be able to impose certain conditions.
I think in particular that workers on secondment must have authorised representatives who must be independent.
They must be able to supply relevant information regarding working hours and health and safety in relation to this work, so that they can be guaranteed protection.
Employees on secondment must make a prior declaration, so that the social partners in the host countries, where wages are fixed by collective bargaining, can come into play to negotiate directly with the home company of the seconded workers.
We must, however, go further still in this field by giving further thought, for example, to establishing a minimum European wage.
We must have a political commitment to convergence towards a floor of social rights common to all the European Union.
It is with such practices that we put ourselves on the road towards a social Europe, a united Europe, a Europe of workers that we all wish for.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, when we were discussing the services directive, we stated quite clearly and definitely that it should in no way affect social rights in Member States.
That is why we removed the infamous Articles 24 and 25 from the directive, because it should not be possible to override these rights by exploiting loopholes.
We also agreed that, to clear up any ambiguities, the Posting of Workers Directive should be amended if any problems arise.
I would like to remind you of this compromise, which the European Commission also agreed to, and would like to demand this agreement again.
Commissioner, I share your view that lack of, or poor, cooperation among the authorities is one of the main reasons why we are having such problems with the Posting of Workers Directive, but do you really believe that by removing opportunities for control, documentation and everything else that is needed for control, will improve poor collaboration?
On the contrary, lack of documentation and poor cooperation among authorities equals social dumping pure and simple.
I cannot believe that that is what you really want.
So let us work together towards improving administrative cooperation, and to open the market for services and the markets for workers at the highest level of social protection.
Then we will be doing something positive for Europe, and, instead of a destructive approach to the Member States, strive positively for solutions that really will help things to progress.
That is the direction we should take.
Otherwise we will end up not achieving what we set out to do.
Madam President, I am disappointed that Commissioner Å pidla has told us today that he does not propose a new communication on this issue.
If European workers are to move from Member State to Member State without triggering a race to the bottom, we must ensure that the law is clear, that there are standards applied commonly across the European Union and that they are fully implemented.
The Posting of Workers Directive, as it stands, does not meet those criteria, nor do the guidelines which the Commission published only a year ago.
Right now, we need the Commission to insist on the retention of documents in the Member States where a worker is posted and we need to insist on an identifiable employer who carries legal responsibility for compliance.
Even that will not be enough unless all Member States put in place compliance mechanisms and severe penalties for breaches of the law.
There is no possibility of progress on issues like flexicurity and reform of labour law unless we deal with issues such as workers' security in this area.
Workers in Europe will not stand for a diminution of their rights or a race to the bottom.
We will not get any legislation through this House which weakens their rights in any way unless they can see that there are advantages for them in preventing a race to the bottom.
I believe the short-sightedness of the Council and the Commission in this area is unbelievable, and it is simply inexplicable if they are serious about creating a European social union.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Honourable Members I should like to make it clear that the correct implementation of the posted workers directive is not, under any circumstances, a back door through which we are seeking to weaken and compromise the protection of workers in the European labour market.
Quite the opposite, correct implementation of the directive will lead to the effective protection of workers, and this is of vital importance.
It is not true at all that the Commission is placing restrictions on monitoring powers: let me state categorically that any measures that a Member State deems necessary, and which are proportionate to the objective, will of course be correct and applicable.
I must also point out that the decision on this directive, did not take place in some ivory tower any more than the decision on the communication did - it has been discussed on countless occasions on the ground with the social partners.
I feel that when it comes to implementing laws, we all know where to draw the line between instances when the law becomes a matter of mere bureaucracy, and fails to achieve its objectives, and on the other hand instances when it achieves different and incorrect objectives.
Checks must therefore be thorough and effective, but within the framework of an applied method, as the directive and the law in general do not allow everything.
In other words, not everything will be acceptable - only that which falls within the framework of the law, and which is effective and is proportionate.
As regards amending the directive, which has been suggested, I should like to say that Parliament has itself addressed this issue at least twice or three times before, as have the social partners, and no overriding position was formulated whereby the directive could be recast in a substantive way.
On the contrary, the positions formulated were always in favour of improving cooperation and implementation.
I should also like to point out that the implementation is a matter for the Member States, and the Commission is responsible for ensuring that implementation is carried out within the framework of European law.
It also has an obligation to use the legal resources at its disposal.
In this regard, the Commission of course checks what the situation is in labour markets in the individual Member States and proceeds in a considered way, as is laid down in the law.
It is of course extremely important to improve administrative cooperation.
It is also important to improve cooperation between individual monitoring bodies in the Member States, and the Commission will proceed and channel its efforts in this direction.
If it is shown in subsequent debates that there are grounds for extending the law, this point will certainly be opened up, and fervently debated.
At the moment, neither the preliminary political debate in Parliament nor the debate with the social partners suggests that it would be right to take any new legislative action in this field.
Honourable Members, I must stress once again that the objective of this directive is the effective protection of workers, and any monitoring measures that contribute to effective protection will be appropriate.
Member States that do not carry out effective monitoring are in breach of the directive.
It is clear that monitoring in any area must be pursued in a manner which is proportionate, in the legal sense of the term, and we are often in dispute over what is proportionate.
The Court of Justice in Luxembourg has the authority to settle such disputes between European institutions.
To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007.

First railway package (debate)
The next item is the report by Michael Cramer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the implementation of the first railway package
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation on the first railway package.
Generally speaking, the first railway package can be described as a complete success.
The opening of the networks in Europe to rail freight traffic has proved its worth.
The countries who have done particularly well are those who prepared themselves for this early on rather than waiting until the networks were opened.
For example, Germany has been able to increase rail freight traffic by 25% and the Netherlands by 42.5% since the opening of the networks, and the United Kingdom and Poland have managed to increase the proportion of freight transported by rail by 60% - albeit at a low level in the case of the United Kingdom.
This benefits the environment, and it benefits transport in Europe.
The countries who did not prepare for this, and waited until the last moment, are not doing so well.
For example, France, which did not open up its freight networks until the beginning of this year, saw a 28% decrease in rail freight traffic for the same period.
Its volume of road freight traffic has increased - which hardly fits in with prevailing climate policy.
In my report, I also discuss the fact that the overall modal split has not changed - the reason for which being, of course, the absence of fair framework conditions between the different modes of transport.
Our framework conditions are spectacularly unfair!
Transport in Europe could also be described as too cheap, with only rail transport - which is environmentally friendly - being too expensive.
We also have unfair subsidy practice: approximately 95% of total EU cofinancing for transport is spent on road transport - not on rail transport, as is always called for and claimed in soapbox speeches.
For this reason, I am delighted that the committee was able to agree that, in future, 40% of spending on transport should be channelled to the railways.
It is unacceptable that our efforts should be counteracted by poor financing practice.
The unfair framework conditions also take the form of, inter alia, the imposition by the EU of mandatory rail tolls applying to all trains on all routes and having no upper limit, whilst road tolls do have an upper limit, are voluntary - the Member States can decide whether to levy them or not - and apply only on motorways and only to lorries above 12 tonnes.
This is unfair competition, and must change if the railways are to have a chance.
For example, some of the new Member States are levying very high tolls on rail freight services.
The eight highest track charges are levied in the new Member States.
At the same time, these high tolls are used to subsidise passenger transport, which receives hardly any State subsidies or none at all, whilst road freight transport escapes with no charges.
This is a model of how to move transport from the railways to the roads - exactly the opposite of what the competent Commissioner and the EU always claim to be aiming for.
We want fair competition; but this fair competition is not yet complete, as particularly those railway undertakings that do not have a long State tradition are frustrated time and again in Europe.
They have complained, for example, that access to the network or to a favourable route cannot be granted because this route has already been allocated to the rail undertaking belonging to the dominant group, that their wishes cannot be met since points have previously been extended or passing loops dismantled by the State undertaking, that low-speed stretches of route (speed limits) have been ordered - for no good reason - in order to frustrate the wishes of the new rail freight operators, that route prices have been drastically increased when State railway undertakings have been sold to another undertaking, that cross-subsidisation is not being prevented, and that non-State undertakings often pay higher energy prices than group subsidiaries.

This shows that much remains to be done in spite of our success.
After all, the overall modal split between road and rail in Europe has not improved, but actually worsened.
One thing that can be said, however, is that the first railway package has halted the decline.
If we are to improve the situation, we now need fair framework conditions for rail transport in Europe.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the European Parliament has taken up the report by the Commission on the implementation of the first railway package of 3 May 2006, and I should like especially to thank Mr Cramer, the author of the report, for his very serious and solid work.
The challenge of European railway policy is to put in place a regulatory framework that encourages new investments and the provision of competitive transport services in a common railway area.
The creation of this common railway area demands the full and correct transposition of Community provisions.
In its report in 2006, the Commission identified the conditions to be met to take up the challenge: I will mention the most important of them.
Firstly, restructuring of the historic enterprises must be completed.
It must be done while respecting conditions of separate accounting and of neutrality of the essential functions such as allocation of capacities and levying of charges.
Secondly, the principles underlying the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure must be established taking into account the levying of charges for other modes of transport.
That must be part of an overall strategy encouraging fair competition between modes and therefore sustainable development.
Thirdly, the good functioning of the supervisory and safety bodies demands that these same bodies should be granted the necessary financial and human resources.
These bodies must enjoy genuine independence.
The European Parliament largely takes up the priorities for action that have been identified by the Commission.
These priorities put forward the conditions of intermodal and intramodal competition, as well as rules governing the separation between infrastructure and operation.
With regard to the conditions for intermodal competition, the Commission wishes to create a fair and balanced competitive framework.
In your report, Mr Cramer, you mention fairer competition between modes of transport, particularly through internalisation of the external costs of road transport.
At the time of the adoption of the Eurovignette directive, I made the commitment to submit, in June 2008, a methodology for the internalisation of external costs.
Well, this commitment will be kept!
As for the conditions for intramodal competition, I support your position in favour of rapid deployment of the European signalling system European Rail Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS) and the reduction in the noise level of wagons.
On this last point, that is, noise nuisance, I shall present a Commission communication on the measures to be taken.
We are in agreement also concerning infrastructures.
This needs to be a priority in order to promote good performance of rail freight transport.
In October, I shall propose to the Commission a communication on a rail network focussed on freight in Europe.
This document will present a plan of action which will cover the main suggestions in your resolution.
Finally, I quite agree on the need for strict neutrality of the essential functions to realise the policy of market opening and the strengthening of competition.
Your report describes the positive effects of opening up on the performance of rail freight in the Member States that have been the first to open the markets.
Finally, I should like to remind you that the Commission intends to do everything in its power so that Member States effectively implement the provisions of the railway packages.
If necessary also, we shall start infringement proceedings.
A European market can only develop if the regulatory framework is consistent over all European territory.
Non-discriminatory access to services linked with rail transport, for example in the marshalling yards, is vital for the good functioning of the rail market.
My services are also assessing options with a view to recasting the legislation of the first railway package on this point, which will lead us to a recasting of the European railway code next year.
That is what I wanted to say in reply to Mr Cramer, whom I thank once again.
I wish, of course, to confirm to him that the intention of the Commission and of myself as the Commissioner is certainly to do everything so that the modal shift in favour of the railways is as substantial as possible in the years to come.
I shall now listen, Mr President, to the Members of Parliament with close attention, so that I can answer them at the end of the debate.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Cramer, you already know that I have not always been enthused by your report in all respects - we do not need to discuss this fact today.
The report lacks balance and practical relevance.
For example, it contains many provisions unrelated to the implementation of the first railway package in terms of content.
Therefore, we - our coordinator Mr Jarzembowski and I - have tabled 20 amendments, only 11 of which involve the deletion of whole paragraphs.
I was pleased with the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
The important points are, firstly, the call for the Commission to take action, without delay, against Member States who have not implemented the first and second railway packages by the specified date.
Secondly, we consider it important, with regard to the financing of the further development of the European transport routes, that support be given in particular to the 30 priority trans-European network projects.
Unfortunately, the complete deletion of the paragraph headed 'Regulation of the separation between network and operation' could not be pushed through.
I reject out of hand a limitation of the choice between the various organisational models.
We need solid evidence.
We need to know the advantages and disadvantages of such a separation.
We still need flexibility for railway undertakings.
That is why we have requested a split vote.
I should also like to say a few brief words about the problem of 'gigaliners': that is, ultra-long lorries of 60 tonnes and upwards.
We cannot support Mr Cramer's amendment concerning these in tomorrow's vote on this report - which, after all, concerns the railway package.
I do fully agree that goods belong on the railways, and thus my position may appear contradictory, but an amendment on gigaliners has no place in this report.
We shall discuss this within the framework of the Ayala Sender report - when we shall also have time for the debate.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, at a time when we are drawing up the statement for the first railway package, we have to recognise that we are still far short of the target.
In spite of the progress achieved and particularly the fact of having stemmed a decline which seemed unavoidable, rail's modal share remains still too weak.
It is all the more unfortunate because in these times of climate change the choice of rail sees its relevance confirmed every day by what is happening.
We know what the reasons are for this mixed statement: we have staked too much on opening up, the contributions of which cannot be denied, without worrying enough about the technical barriers, in particular the lack of interoperability, knowing that this ought to have accompanied the opening up gradually, instead of lagging further and further behind.
This situation is probably due to the fact that in general liberalising does not cost the Member States very much, while harmonisation is a different matter.
Today at the very moment when we are at last beginning again to tackle the problems of interoperability, it therefore seems to me worrying that, under cover of co-modality, the objectives of modal shift towards rail, in particular, move into the background.
Instead of revising the objectives downwards, we ought to have revised the intellectual as well as the financial means upwards.
I hope that this report will contribute therefore to reminding us of the way we have still to go in order to give back to rail the place it deserves.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you stressed before me, the object of the first package was to lay the foundations of an integrated European railway area and, by modernising the network, speed up the modal shift of freight traffic from road to rail, so as to reduce CO2 emissions and also, obviously, all the road congestion from which Europe is suffering.
I wish to thank my colleague Mr Cramer for his own-initiative report which sets out a full assessment of the implementation of the first package, without omitting to underline nonetheless all the factors which affect the performance of rail and those which hold up the achievement of the objectives that we have set ourselves.
In the first place we should emphasise that the opening of the rail network, while maintaining a very high level of safety, has allowed a very significant increase in freight traffic at least throughout the European Union, and small rail undertakings have also been able to take an interest in niches considered unprofitable by the historic operators.
I am pleased that the report also places the emphasis on the current system of levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure, which does not allow the setting up of fair competition between the different modes of freight transport.
I think that it is essential today to achieve as rapidly as possible a harmonisation of user fees capped by sector which can better take into account the internalisation of external costs and which limits the exponential increase that we are witnessing currently.
I think also that it will be necessary to have more discussion about the Eurovignette directive, as this represented an advance that we must continue, and I am pleased that you have confirmed this evening, Commissioner, that discussions about this are planned from June 2008.
I would like, moreover, Commissioner, the Commission to commit itself rapidly, with you, to a process of modernisation and development of intermodal infrastructures, mainly on the international corridors of Road Transport Telematics (RTT), through a European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) equipment system and allowing a genuine junction with the port infrastructures on the one hand and river infrastructures on the other.
Finally, I would like the Commission to present recommendations with a view to financial stabilisation of the railways which, in my view, will have to take into account the reduction in debt from which some historic operators have benefited, in order to put all the rail transport actors on an equal footing.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mr Barrot, first of all I would like to thank Mr Cramer for his report, even though it has, certainly, been assessed in highly contradictory ways.
In my own brief comments I would like to touch on just one aspect - I was pleased to see that the report stressed that, despite the liberalisation of the rail freight transport market, the European Union's border states, such as the Baltic States, in reality depend on freight customers, and in our case this usually means Russia.
If Russia, however, chooses to work with a rail monopoly company, then it is relatively difficult for us to discern a real impact arising from the introduction of this first package of rail legislation.
I think, therefore, that this issue needs to be discussed further with Russia, with other potential aspects in mind also, and this is particularly true in view of the announcement by Mr Ivanov, Russia's vice-premier, concerning moving the flow of container freight to Russian ports alone.
Thank you.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, for many years, everyone has been saying that, in relation to the transport of goods in all European countries, rail is losing the battle.
The same applies even to cross-border, long-distance transport.
The railway system is suitable for mass transport and, in some cases, special goods lines have been built for this purpose, mainly in and around industrial areas in Germany.
Similarly, the recently opened Betuwe line in the Netherlands, which forms part of freight corridor No 1 from Rotterdam to Genoa via Germany and Switzerland, is a special line of this kind which is totally unsuited for the transport of passengers.
Despite this favourable starting position for rail, the proportion of goods transported by rail has decreased and, in some cases, even the volume is declining.
Much of this transport has been taken over by the lorry, and the huge increase in the volume of goods is largely being handled by motorway, as a result of which these are increasingly becoming congested.
This shift is, to a considerable extent, related to infrastructure.
Before, rail boasted a very intricate network, opening up both villages in the countryside and ports and factories in the cities.
Apart from goods lines, there were also container stations where goods carriages came together and were redistributed across different trains.
As many companies had their own connections to the railway network, goods carriages were able to shuttle directly between a harbour quay and a remote company without any interim transhipment of goods.
Everything people want to achieve these days using multi-modal systems was already in place then.
Unfortunately, the governments have decided to shrink the railway network, because it is deemed loss-making.
Many small railway lines have been discontinued and many connections to companies have disappeared.
Billions have been invested, on the other hand, in extending the space-guzzling motorway network.
In many cases, door-to-door goods transport is only possible by lorry these days.
It is indispensable for pick-up and delivery, and it seems the easiest option then to use the motorways for the much longer, in-between section as well.
If the company connections and container stations were restored, this could make a considerable contribution to reinstating goods transport by rail.
The first railway package is partly based on the assumption that rail transport should adopt the working methods of transport by road and air.
In this case, it is international companies that arrange cross-border transport from beginning to end, and this is the most attractive option for those people with a transport requirement.
My group has always pointed out that this is not the only possible solution.
There is an alternative, namely better cooperation between national railway companies.
They should not see each other as competitors, but as partners in a comprehensive European railway network.
It is precisely by encouraging them to enter into competition with each other that cooperation runs less smoothly.
To date, we have not yet seen any positive results in respect of the course taken.
The free market is often not a solution to a problem, but its very cause.
The rapporteur is right in always arguing in favour of the new standard safety system, European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS).
We see eye to eye with him on this.
We also notice that the launch of this system is far less swift than had been expected and that, alongside the new system, a second old system should remain in place.
Thanks to the average low speed in freight transport, ERTMS makes for fewer problems compared to the high-speed lines for passenger transport.
Finally, we share Mr Cramer's view that transport by air and road are kept artificially cheap and that transport by rail is kept artificially dear.
If we do not change this in any way, the least environmentally friendly mode of transport will continue to prevail.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, that was interesting: Mr Meijer virtually recreating ancient railway history before our eyes.
He, too, should have perceived the very idea of laying railway tracks from one village to another for freight transport as being as slow as it is unrealistic.
Mr Cramer, nor can I share your simplistic demonising of the lorry.
After all, lorry operators pay corporation tax, vehicle tax, petroleum tax and tolls - and so the assertion that lorries drive for free and competition is distorted is simply unrealistic.
I fully share your view that it is not right for Poland's Ministry of Finance to charge excessively high route prices - but that is an issue for the Polish Government, not European legislation, to deal with.
We should perhaps remind the Polish Government that route prices are intended to promote rail transport rather than to reform the Polish budget situation - but this has absolutely nothing to do with the lorry.
Mr President, I should like to ask you to ensure speedy implementation of the second railway package, too, by all Member States.
After all, we pushed through the requirement that networks must have been opened up to the national and cross-border movement of goods by 1 January of this year, and I see this as a great opportunity to help European markets operate across borders.
I should like to discuss one of the points the Commissioner raised, and I would ask him to elaborate on this.
He said that the Commission is willing to help reduce the noise caused by rail trucks, and announced a communication on this.
What I should like to know is when he plans to present this communication.
Does he believe that this will put greater focus on European aspects, or will it open up possibilities for the granting of aid at national level?
Noise pollution - for example, from trains passing through residential areas at night - is unacceptable in cities, in particular.
If the Commissioner is prepared to provide help with this, we would be very grateful.
(PL) Mr President, Mr Cramer's report on the implementation of the first railway package shows the difficulties and problems it faces.
If railway transport develops and runs properly, it can result in more people and goods being carried, thereby taking the burden off road transportation and cutting CO2 emissions.
Rapid passenger transport can also compete with local airlines and coach services.
Interlinking rail, road and water transport can reduce its costs and increase the efficiency of the economy.
In implementing this package, we should pay particular attention to supporting railway projects, particularly in countries that lack the funding to expand and upgrade their railway network and infrastructure, supporting all activities relating to the exchange of good practice, including for establishing flexible and competitive modes of operation for railway companies, monitoring and removing organisational, administrative and financial barriers to the development of transport, and support for the railways taking over a portion of international road haulage operations.


I would like to thank Mr Cramer for his necessary and insightful report.
(PT) The report being debated today contains aspects that reflect the demands of the large private interests that lie behind the liberalisation and privatisation of public rail transport services promoted by the European Union, which we reject.
Our view is that the report should, instead, denounce the dismemberment in EU countries of public services and public companies, the closure of branch lines and stations, service reductions and cuts in the number of trains, the brutal reduction in the number of rail workers, and the increase in precarious work in this sector.
We also believe that the report should, in other respects, fight for the promotion of public rail services through the existence of strong public companies with all their merits, with effective management to ensure high-quality services and high safety standards; for a guaranteed, high-quality, high-capacity, comfortable public rail service with affordable fares, fully meeting the needs of passenger mobility and goods transport; and for job security for the workers in the sector, promoting their inclusion in the companies' senior management teams, enhancing careers and wages and ensuring continued training.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, I thank each of the speakers for the wise observations they have shared with me.
Nonetheless, I shall say a few words on a point which, to my surprise, has not really received the attention of the European Parliament.
It is about the separation between the management of the rail infrastructure and the provision of transport services.
It is, in fact, this separation which makes it possible to give to competition its full scope.
We have to ensure non-discriminatory access to facilitate the entry into the market of new entrants.
That is a very important point.
I should like to answer some questions.
In talking about co-modality, our goal was simply to explain that rail transport, which is indisputably the best solution over long distances, must be able to be completed by local transport which, in certain cases, can only be provided, as Mr Jarzembowski has said, by road.
Therefore, the idea is not to take something away from rail but on the contrary to allow it to have its rightful place.
Oh yes, it is very clear!
I am speaking in particular to Mr Navarro: one must make no mistake about the intention.
The intention is really to make a success of this modal shift, which is very important to me, as it is to you.
I must say also that what we are doing, be it about financing infrastructures across trans-European networks or interoperability, which the European Rail Traffic Management System and European Train Control System is going to make possible for us, or the cross-acceptance of rolling stock or the promotion of freight traffic on European corridors, all these achievements seek to obtain the most substantial modal shift possible.
I think that, on this point, our approach presents no ambiguity.
Mrs Griesbeck, I would like to confirm the Commission's intention to present guidelines on state aid in the rail sector before the end of the year.
I should also like to confirm to Mr Jarzembowski that the communication on the noise of carriages is planned for the autumn of this year.
I cannot say any more about it for the time being; we are in the process of working on it.
There are certainly other questions which deserve an answer.
I would like you to know, in any case, that I really have listened with close attention to all that has been said by each of you.
I consider for my part that the work carried out by Mr Cramer and his committee is enlightening for the Commission.
I should like to repeat again that what we want are fair intermodal and intramodal conditions of competition which make it possible effectively to develop this modal shift to which, I repeat again once more, we are very committed, particularly for reasons of environment and relief of congestion on our road network.
For all the reasons that you can imagine, we have more need than ever of the railway.
I must say that, each day, I work towards this with much determination.
I have moreover realised that, with the opening of Betuwe in the Netherlands, a willingness is really establishing itself in Europe with a view to giving rail its rightful place; and indeed, if in certain cases, problems of charging arise, it is incumbent upon the Member States to accept their responsibilities.
This modal shift is a real priority cause in Europe.
It is necessary also that governments accept making it their priority.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July 2007.
Common rules for air transport services (debate)
The next item is the report by ArÅ«nas Degutis, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the operation of air transport services in the Community (recast) C6-0248/2006.
rapporteur. - (LT) This future regulation should replace three regulations currently in force, which make up the third set of guidelines for the domestic air transport market.
The aforesaid regulations set out the procedures for issue and cancellation of air transport firm licences and the principles for free use of Community air routes by Community air transport companies, and liberalising prices of airfares.
Once the third set of guidelines began to be applied, an unprecedented expansion of the European air travel sector took place: the old monopolies disappeared, a system of local air transport was instituted, and consumer-friendly competition increased in all markets, especially in the area of pricing.
What had been a regulated European aviation market based on bilateral agreements became a particularly competitive market.
It is natural that after a few years of applying the third set of guidelines, some guidelines became obsolete, others were applied poorly, and now they need revision, reconsideration or straight-out abolition.
The proposal under consideration urges correction of the three sets of guidelines that have been mentioned to make them easier to apply, to simplify the legal grounds, to remove the obsolete parts and to set new, firmer requirements.
In my opinion the Commission's proposal is logical, and I agree that it would not only be meaningful but also purposeful and essential to review the regulations now in force.
In any case, in the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I of course support, some important parts of the regulations need to be made more precise.
I would like to mention a few of these parts:
Rentals.
There is variation among the Member States in regard to rental agreement practices. This can distort the market and cause social and aviation safety problems.
Therefore, without a doubt, new general requirements need to be set. The rules proposed in Article 13 are too strict and do not take into consideration certain characteristics of the air transport industry, especially its seasonality.
Therefore, it would be good to find a logical compromise between social concerns and safety, and simultaneously improve the performance of airlines.
In my opinion the compromise reached by the Transport Committee may help to resolve this problem.
Transparency of prices. We support the Commission's aim of banning advertising of and publicity about airfares which do not include any costs, surcharges, payments and levies.
I believe that the airlines' commitment to publish only final prices has to be clearly formulated.
Here too we have found a compromise which also reflects consumer needs.
Particular social considerations. Suggestions concerning particular social considerations put forward by colleagues from other groups are, in my opinion, premature unless the possible consequences are analysed assuming adoption at this time.
Therefore, we request that the Commission prepare a study, on the basis of which it would be possible to regulate these matters without creating obstacles for the improvement of aviation industry competitiveness.
Passenger safety. In the Commission's proposal there is no provision for any clear mechanism, which would ensure that passengers would not suffer from the effects of bankruptcy of airlines; for example, not getting compensation for cancelled flights or being abandoned to their fate at overseas destinations.
Therefore, we believe that guidelines for passenger safety should be included in the regulations (Amendments 15-16).
Commitment to provide public services and regional airports. I believe that any formulation of the term 'regional airport', which obliges to provide services to the public, will inevitably include airports in economically more affluent regions, whereas airports in regions that need economic or social support may not be included in the definition.
Since the commitment to provide public services on this principle is applicable only to airports serving regions having economic and social problems, I would suggest that the difficult-to-define concept of regional airport be dropped from this document.
As well as the points mentioned earlier, one should explain several definitions and conditions in order to avoid misunderstandings and erroneous application of the regulations.
Community's domestic air services. While we suggested some amendments for the subjects mentioned earlier, we support the proposed extension of the Commission's powers in relation to deciding on questions concerning the provision of domestic Community air services.
Since the Commission can more effectively negotiate concerning certain rights than can individual Member States, it should have the opportunity to do so. This has been demonstrated by the agreement with Russia on transit flights over Siberia.
Therefore, it is recommended that the Commission's proposed wording for Article 15 be accepted.
That is a brief characterisation of service provision.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating today represents a great success for the European Community.
It seeks, in fact, to modernise and complete the 1992 regulation that set up the single aviation market in Europe.
The creation of this single aviation market has allowed air transport in Europe to enjoy unprecedented expansion.
The number of airlines has increased and there has been a general increase in traffic and competition.
Since full liberalisation in 1997, the number of routes has increased by more than 60%; more cities are served, notably in the isolated regions.
The appearance of new competitors has brought a significant reduction in fares on numerous routes.
More and more Europeans can travel by plane.
This development contributes to economic growth, as well as to the creation of direct and indirect employment.
Taking this success into account, the Commission intends to maintain the fundamental principles of this liberalised market.
The proposal seeks simply to simplify the consolidation of current legislation.
It proposes also some adjustments to improve the effectiveness of its application.
Firstly, the revision makes it possible to clean up the text to remove the obsolete parts linked to the transition phase towards the liberalised market.
The text has been clarified, ambiguities have been removed and three regulations have been consolidated into a single text.
Secondly, the proposal seeks to achieve effective and uniform application of Community rules.
At present there are divergences between Member States in the application of the third package.
Thanks to this revision, we shall have a more uniform application especially in relation to the granting and overseeing of operating licences.
The proposal strengthens, moreover, the monitoring of the financial viability of companies, in particular of the new entrants.
Thirdly, the proposal strengthens coordination of Member States on intra-Community services and transit overflight by companies from third countries.
It is important to encourage a coordinated Community approach to ensure the integrity of the European market and to facilitate the work of the negotiators with the third countries.
Finally, fourth point, the proposal advocates new rights for passengers.
The right for passengers to have complete information on the real price of a ticket with taxes, charges and costs included.
The right not to be discriminated against according to nationality or place of residence at the time of purchasing a ticket.
Consequently, this updated version should further strengthen the appeal of the single European market in many third countries.
These principles apply not only to Switzerland and to countries in the European Economic Area but also to Morocco and to the countries in South East Europe and they serve as a benchmark at international level.
That is why I thank, Mr President, the European Parliament for the speed with which it has taken up this dossier.
I would like to commend the work carried out by your rapporteur Mr Degutis, and to thank the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Paolo Costa, as well as all the members of that committee because, I must say, Parliament has certainly improved on our text.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, and all the Members involved, for their cooperation.
I firmly believe that, since the vote in committee, we have a balanced, practical report on the operation of air transport services.
The original Commission proposal was well thought-out and goal oriented in this case, so I am much obliged to the Commission, too.
Since I am basically satisfied with the outcome of the vote in committee, I should like to discuss only the transparency requirements with regard to the listing of air fares.
From the outset, I have stood up for the creation of transparency without additional bureaucracy, and for the equal, fair involvement of everyone concerned.
The air fare advertised should show clearly what charges, duties and taxes this includes and what they are used for.
Air-ticket prices should be easy for consumers to understand and transparent.
This is particularly applicable to the advertising of air fares on websites.
Nevertheless, there is still disagreement over the means, and the precise extent of this.
Amendment 48 lays down that duties and charges must be listed and summarised in four categories: firstly, taxes and other State charges and duties; secondly, air traffic control charges; thirdly, charges, duties, fees and other costs for the benefit of the airlines; and, fourthly, fees, levies, charges and other costs for the benefit of the airport operators.
The problem is that air traffic control charges cannot be clearly stated in advance.
Tomorrow, then, on behalf of my group, I shall be requesting the deletion of this second category, air traffic control charges, by means of split voting.
Despite this amendment, the compromise reached fully meets the transparency requirement, whilst taking into account the interests of passengers and also airlines, and so I and my group cannot support the rapporteur's new amendments, Amendments 54 and 55.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Commission proposal and also, of course, the rapporteur's report, as both make a contribution to the completion of the European internal market for air transport and to increasing safety levels.
I should like to mention and highlight four points.
Firstly, the provision on price transparency that has been adopted is a clear victory for consumers.
It will no longer be possible in future to lure citizens with false bait advertising.
Irrespective of the sales channel, all air fares are to be set out comprehensively and in detail.
Naturally, air traffic control prices are estimated on a flat-rate basis - although, at the end of the day, prices must be comprehensible.
We do not need to argue about this, however.
On the whole, we are creating clarity for passengers and strengthening competition.
Secondly, with regard to wet-leasing contracts, this is a balanced Regulation that, on the one hand, takes account of airlines' needs in the event that seasonal pricing movements occur or an exceptional need arises and they have to rely on such a model; and, on the other, makes clear that the circumvention of European safety and social standards is unacceptable.
Thirdly, like many reports on aviation legislation, our report contains numerous amendments on social legislation for employees.
The Commission is urgently required to make a proposal on this at long last, to close the loophole that the Services Directive has left and the present Regulation cannot close.
Fourthly, the new one-step procedure for traffic distribution is simpler and quicker than all previous procedures.
This is a good decision, including in terms of the future, that enables a more flexible response to capacity bottlenecks in infrastructure.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, my thanks to Mr Degutis for his report.
We must agree with Commissioner Barrot's words that the third package in the internal air market, which is now fifteen years old, has significantly contributed to the development of European civil aviation.
Now change is needed, in particular as regards leasing, licensing air transport services, social matters, protecting passengers against carrier bankruptcy and so forth. Other important factors are proper observance of the eight Freedoms of the Air.
The question that raises the greatest emotion is the transparency of air ticket prices.
Passengers expect to know how much they will actually pay for tickets, not publicity stunts in disguise.
I support the view that the regulation and the directive we have adopted preventing unfair competition, which will come into effect in five months, will lead to an increase in passenger rights.
A passenger must be the subject both of the activities of the carrier and of the airport.
Unfortunately, it is too often the case that passengers are simply treated as cargo.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I associate the common rules for the operation of air transport services in the Community with the third aviation package or with problems relating to its practical implementation.
Perhaps the biggest problem here is transport safety, which involves securing the social conditions of employees, including cases where aircraft are hired out together with crews, as well as the safety of passengers, who are traditionally the priority.
Alongside this is the issue of the financial health of airlines and the stricter requirements for the terms and conditions that apply to aircraft leasing, including proposed time limits.
I feel that it would also be desirable for consumers to know what exactly they have bought for their money.
You too would surely feel suspicious about airline advertisements promising fares of EUR 1.
Another issue is that of how detailed the price breakdown should be, and what exactly it should contain.
In this regard, it is very important to clarify the distribution of cost items for processing passengers and aircraft, including the endless discussions on the concept of reasonable profit.
I am definitely opposed to the idea that has emerged during the debate that this is about technical standards and that social issues do not come into play.
I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Degutis, who has also referred to social issues in his speech.
His work was outstanding and his report deserves our support.
As regards the proposed amendments, we agree with all of them apart from Nos. 16, 29, 37, 40, 42, 49 and 50.
In most cases, this is not a matter of substantive disagreement: our objections mainly involve instances where the same thing has been proposed in two places or where better options are available.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer to three more aspects.
In the consolidation of the third aviation package, it is crucial in terms of the transparency of air fares that there be no false bait advertising, and it is also relevant in this regard whether the flat-rate security charges levied on passengers actually match the costs of the security measures.
I have the feeling that airports are using some of these security charges to obtain further remuneration for themselves.
It is very important in the interests of the transparency of costs that security charges do indeed correspond to the costs incurred by security measures.
Secondly, I should like to discuss competition between airports, and to do so from two angles.
I should like to ask the Commissioner to give one or two examples without delay to show the extent to which the Commission's guidelines for permissible (or impermissible) aid for regional airports in the Community are actually being applied.
As I see it, there are a great many regional airports that are only being kept afloat by subsidies and will never be able to support themselves economically.
In these cases, the Commission guidelines should actually be putting an end to the subsidies.
Thirdly, this consolidation of the third aviation package changes the definition of an 'airport system' slightly.
I would ask that the Commissioner elaborate on this, too, at some stage.
It is unacceptable that, by law, an airport system can only exist if it serves the same conurbation, and that airports such as Frankfurt and Frankfurt Hahn can claim that, despite being 120 km apart, they serve the same conurbation and must therefore be recognised as an airport system.
The Commissioner should on no account permit such mushrooming of what is recognised as an airport system.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, on the wonderful flexibility he has shown in accepting some of the proposals of the various Members.
I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner on his magnificent presentation, because it has demonstrated that this text represents a definitive improvement of the legislation, since it updates, simplifies and consolidates the best aspects of rules that had become obsolete and which needed rapid updating, given the sector's development.
In reality, all of this benefits all of the actors in the sector, particularly passengers, in a sector such as aviation that has suffered so much.
Furthermore, inconsistency amongst these kind of regulations does not just usually distort the operation of the internal market, but we believe that it also leads to risks in terms of the quality of service, safety and working conditions.
Of the improvements and achievements that Parliament has introduced - most of which have been mentioned by other Members already - I would like to stress the demand for greater transparency and control of the financial situation of companies and operators in the sector.
In view of the exponential growth of this sector and the appearance of tempting pockets of potential customers - such as immigrants, who have increasing purchasing power thanks to work regularisation, in my country for example - it has become much more urgent to apply rules and conditions rigorously in order to prevent the fraud and abuse that usually arise in the sale of tickets and also the deceitful offers from companies that appear all over the place.
We also believe the provisions to prevent and alleviate the social consequences of such fraud and of possible bankruptcies to be very reasonable.
Furthermore, transparency of prices and non-discrimination in acquisition, through whichever channel the passenger acquires the tickets, also seem to us to be fundamental improvements to this text.
Other aspects that I believe have emerged and have also improved are those relating to the social conditions for workers in the sector.
Preventing social dumping, which disrupts the economic and social situation, and preventing games from being played with displaced workers employed by transnational companies operating from different bases, has been a positive achievement and an improvement.
Better still is the fact that the debate that has opened up during the process of drawing up this report has led to the request, in Amendment 61, for a legislative proposal on social and working conditions, which I believe the Commission must present urgently.
Mr President, the opening-up of air travel to millions of citizens has been brought about by the low-fares airlines.
I agree with the Commissioner that the single aviation market has been a singular success.
Airlines such as Ireland's Ryanair have revolutionised the aviation sector and have put pressure on the older, more established and more expensive airlines to follow suit.
Such competition is good for the consumer and the traveller.
However, I want to focus on what has already been mentioned by four people tonight, and that is that there is a problem.
In such a competitive market, airlines have indulged - and still continue to indulge - in extremely attractive but grossly misleading price advertising.
A travel fare advertised at five cents looks very attractive indeed, but when the consumer goes to book, either online or otherwise, the five-cent ticket can be several hundred euro when taxes and other charges are factored in.
I raised this issue by way of a parliamentary question here last January, and the Commission replied, 'the Commission, while maintaining the general rule of price freedom, proposes that "air carriers operating within the Community [...] provide the general public with comprehensive information on their air fares and rates and the conditions attachedâ.
Consumers will thus be informed of the actual price (price of ticket plus the various charges and taxes).'
The Degutis report, which we are debating here tonight, will give practical effect to this, and that is extremely welcome.
The obligation on airlines to introduce full transparency is extremely welcome and very important, because the consumer will now see from the very outset exactly what he or she will have to pay.
That alone will not reduce the numbers of people travelling - as a lot of people think it might - but in my opinion it will further enhance competition and benefit the travelling public.
Finally, could the Commissioner tell us when exactly we can expect this to come into effect?
The sooner the better, in my view.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank all the speakers and I am pleased about most of the amendments proposed.
These amendments usefully clarify several points, especially concerning the economic and financial monitoring of companies or again the issues about leasing of aircraft.
I fully support the proposed improvements concerning the principal place of business in order to ensure effective monitoring of companies for which a national authority has responsibility.
The Commission also agrees with your proposals in relation to the conditions for granting or revoking licences, even if we cannot accept that this action could be taken on the basis of suspicion alone.
The simplifications regarding public service obligations and coordination of airports will allow a more flexible and effective implementation of these measures.
Moreover, although the Commission can support the major part of the amendments without any problem, I am going nonetheless to tell you about some reservations.
I can understand and support the need to find solutions for passengers who are stranded when an airline goes bankrupt.
Mrs Ayala referred to that.
It is, indeed, such situations that have led to this updating of the regulation, which seeks to strengthen the conditions for granting licences and the economic and financial monitoring of companies.
I cannot, however, at this stage, accept a new obligation whose feasibility and scope in economic and financial terms we have not yet analysed.
That is why, in my opinion, we should make reference to the need to make provision for conditions for reimbursement and repatriation, without, for all that, deciding on a solution the real impact of which we do not really know yet.
My second reservation concerns the social dimension.
It is of the utmost importance that national authorities correctly apply the appropriate national and European legislation.
It is a good thing to remind Member States of these obligations, which are laid down by the Treaty and by national legislation, but this sectoral regulation does not seem the most appropriate to deal with this matter.
We must look more closely at this subject in order to grasp all the implications and to define the real needs that call for a response at Community level.
Also, the proposal made by your rapporteur seems to me right, that is, to make reference to the obligations of Member States in a recital.
Furthermore, I wish to answer, of course, those who asked me about the proposal.
Yes, the Commission is carrying out a study on the effects of the internal aviation market on employment and working conditions.
This study, which will be finished at the end of 2007, will give us food for thought and enable us to decide what practical measures to take.
As Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned, the Commission is hesitating in relation to the obligations that are too specific for the distribution of traffic between airports.
It is legitimate to require reasonable and effective connection times with city centres.
Is it not, however, going too far if we insist on a fixed time, as well as an obligation for there to be links between airports?
I come to the problem of prices.
The provisions on transparency of prices and full information for passengers are necessary, but they must be feasible and intelligible.
Your rapporteur is right to wish to cover all flights leaving from an airport in the European Community.
However, the extension of this obligation to only the Community companies in third countries gives rise to serious legal and commercial difficulties.
I should like to respond to the question of costs linked with security.
It is true that the Commission is in favour of the cost of security and the portion of the price resulting from it being known.
Moreover, it also wants the various costs, charges, taxes and surcharges to be clearly shown.
However, if it is true that this regulation seeks to ensure information for passengers, we cannot use it to lay down the use and characteristics of each charge or tax; provisions of this kind will have their place in the directive on airport charges under discussion in our institutions.
Mrs Jeggle, with regard to advertising on the Internet, I agree with you, but Amendment 48 seems to us very complicated.
It really needs to be clear and practical.
I want also to respond to Mr Stockmann and Mr KohliÄek concerning the issue of wet leasing.
It is necessary to allow relative flexibility to meet exceptional needs while laying down strict conditions for safety and frequency.
I am in favour of a system that makes it possible to reconcile safety requirements with the need for recourse to wet leasing in exceptional circumstances and for a limited period.
Finally, for reasons of fair competition with third countries, I consider it is justified to compensate for the removal of Article 23 on price leadership by the possibility of imposing restrictions, when a third country with which an agreement has been signed does not recognise the same duties.
It is a principle of good sense which should help us in the negotiations with third countries.
I thank Parliament also for having supported the Commission's approach concerning relations with third countries, which must be conducted in a coordinated fashion.
There too, I shall still need the support of Parliament, Mr President, for the next stages.
I do not pretend to have answered all the questions.
I say again, quite simply, that Parliament's work has improved our text.
Therefore, Mr Degutis, Mr Costa, it is really with much satisfaction that I thank Parliament for its work; the questions that you have raised are also very sound.
I observed that, for some of them, it was not necessarily in this text that an answer needed to be provided.
On the social level, I pointed out that we are in the process of working, and that by the end of the year, I would have a better idea for a possible proposal.
Mr President, I felt it was necessary to provide rather detailed answers in order to close a debate of high quality.
(FR) Commission position on Parliament's amendments:
Degutis report
