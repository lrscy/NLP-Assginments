in writing.
We are opposing a continued expansion of the EU-budget, which today is already too extensive with a large part of the funds going to the wrong ends.
Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing via EU.
These mean new demands on payments from the Member States, but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic, inefficient and complex.
However, there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget, and we support reasonable changes of existing means.
But our opposition to a constantly increasing budget is firm, and therefore we have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote.
in writing. - (FR) This vote is in response to an unacceptable multiannual budgetary framework.
Detailed examination of the budget headings shows the blatant inadequacy of appropriations to many areas such as research, innovation, the big technological projects such as Galileo and the great trans-European networks.
This budget will not encourage the stimulation of growth in Europe.
European aid to the countries of the South, Africa and the Maghreb is light years away from a development policy such as needs to be implemented as a matter of urgency in order to tackle extreme poverty and unbalanced migration.
It is urgently necessary to devise a European tax guaranteeing a high level of own resources for a European budget that is finally a match for what is at stake.
in writing. Once again we are adopting a budget which does not meet the commitments entered into by the EU institutions.
This is particularly true in relation to foreign and security policy and development policy.
It is bound to increase the impression in the world that the EU is very poor when it comes to putting its money where its mouth is.
That said, I welcome the emphasis in this budget on proper control and getting value for money.
(FR) Mr President, I regret that paragraphs 18 and 44 of the Grech report were not subject to a split vote, as I would have voted against them.
A number of members of the Commission on Budgets continually mount rearguard actions against the decisions of Heads of State or Government regarding our Parliament's three places of work.
It is true that having three sites gives rise to costs.
To call such expenditure 'superfluous' is, however, inappropriate, to say the least.
Decentralisation also has some very positive repercussions for MEPs and for Parliament.
Moreover, to bring into question the need for our officials to be present in Strasbourg during plenary part-sessions is a veritable affront to the administration which, I know, is very careful in choosing the officials it sends out.
I would also have voted against paragraph 44, which takes a dim view of the 'Strasbourg experience'.
I protest against the implications of this paragraph.
By purchasing the three buildings in Strasbourg that it did not own, Parliament has, indeed, obtained real bargains.
This is an extremely judicious piece of expenditure which, unlike expenditure on rent, will enable large public savings to be made.
I should have liked a number of members of the Committee on Budgets to have made a more objective judgment, especially since they are required to respect decisions concerning Parliament's seat, whether they like them or not.
Mr Grech and Mr Elles, the rapporteurs, are right to opt in favour of increased efficiency when discussing the 2007 budget.
Setting priorities is also a necessary and sensible component in Mr Elles strategy.
This does not automatically mean, however, that more funds should be made available for priority budget lines.
Instead, non-priority budget lines should be given a more critical evaluation.
In the majority of the amendments, however, a decision has, unfortunately, been made to increase the budgeted means after all.
With regard to multilingualism, I welcome the fact that efforts are made to enhance efficiency in that area too.
Cost-reducing measures should not lead, though, to multilingualism being under threat.
All in all, it is positive that, following the Council's position, there is now more attention for efficient and more economical budgeting.
It is for this reason that Mr Grech's resolution receives my support.
in writing. (SV) We have today voted in favour of the reports on the EU's budget for 2007.
We welcome efforts to ensure that taxpayers obtain more value for money.
We also support the investments in research and development and the ambition to strengthen the EU as a global actor.
We reject, however, the proposals to increase the appropriations for agricultural aid and regional aid.
As always, we are sceptical about centrally devised campaigns and opinion-forming.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on appropriations to the European Parliament. I regret, however, that paragraphs 18 and 44 were not subject to split votes, as I would have voted against them.
A number of members of the Committee on Budgets continually mount rearguard actions against the decisions of the Heads of State or Government regarding our Parliament's three places of work, namely Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Brussels.
It is true that this arrangement gives rise to costs, but to call such expenditure superfluous is rash, to say the least.
For MEPs, as well as for Parliament, decentralisation - which a majority of the Committee on Budgets unfairly refers to as geographical dispersion - has some very positive repercussions.
To bring into question the need for our officials to be present in Strasbourg for the plenary part-sessions is a veritable affront to the Bureau and, especially, the administration which, I know, is very careful in choosing the officials it sends to Strasbourg.
I would also have voted against paragraph 44 which asks the administration, after what it pejoratively calls the 'Strasbourg experience', 'to apply more stringent, water-tight and transparent procedures when purchasing buildings'...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)
In view of the structural, economic and social situation in the fishing sector in the outermost regions, and the adoption of the new European Fisheries Fund, it is crucial to extend the derogations laid down in Regulation (EC) 639/2004 on the criteria and conditions governing structural actions relating to the preservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy.
The proposal for a Council regulation providing for an extension of these derogations for the outermost regions until 31 December 2006 and the practical implementation of measures adopted in the interim by 2008, must of course be adopted at the earliest opportunity, so that it can actually have the desired effect on the ground.
Although I agree with the thrust of the proposal and the content of this document, I am very disappointed that the implementation plan for renewing and modernising the fleets in the outermost regions cannot be put in place until the period of the next financial perspective, rather than the timeframe established for 2008.
In spite of this, and because this derogation represents positive discrimination in favour of the outermost regions, I shall be voting in favour of this proposed regulation.
The purpose of this proposal is to extend the derogations granted to fishing fleets in the outermost regions until 31 December 2006, and subsequently until 31 December 2007.
These derogations relate to the entry/exit schemes of the fleet capacity and the provision of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet.
It was a matter of great urgency that this proposal be adopted, in view of the specific structural, social and economic realities of the fishing industry in the outermost regions, for example the Azores and Madeira, coupled with the permanent difficulties and constraints faced by these regions, such as their limited markets and their remoteness.
The crux of the matter is that the existing economic activities - in this case fisheries - of many of these regions are of major socio-economic importance, for example in ensuring that people have fresh fish to eat.
Given the need for these derogations, and in view of the fact that the situation facing the fleets is down to structural rather than economic factors, as the Commission and the Council have acknowledged, the derogations should be made permanent and be included in the European Fisheries Fund for 2007-2013.
in writing. - (FR) Today, the European Parliament is voting under urgent procedure on a Council Regulation on the management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions, which extends the regulation currently in force by one year.
The main derogations authorised relate to the addition of fishing vessels to the fleet, public aid for the renewal of vessels and aid for modernisation.
This regulation takes account of circumstances in the fishing sector in the outermost regions, where there are still abundant fishery resources and significant potential for development.
It would therefore be inconceivable and counter-productive to prevent the fishing fleets in these regions from benefiting from such facilities!
I hope that those involved in fishing in the outermost regions will be able to take advantage of this new extension to develop and modernise the fleet.
Nevertheless, I find it regrettable that the European Commission has still not put forward any longer-term guidelines.
I have already asked on numerous occasions for these derogations to be extended beyond 2006.
It would have been more sensible to accept this proposal right from the start, instead of coming to Parliament each year asking for the derogations, which are absolutely vital for fisheries in our regions, to be extended for another year.
in writing. I will be supporting this resolution.
The tragedy of this failed revolution, brutally put down by Soviet imperial troops with the death of thousands, is that it closed down an evolutionary path out of Soviet oppression to engagement with the rest of the world, a slow but sure path to pluralism and democracy.
Instead, tens of thousands fled as refugees.
I remember as a six-year-old schoolchild being sent to collect a Hungarian refugee child who was to join my class at my school in Gloucestershire, on his first day.
Seeing the misery and distress of him and his family was probably my first experience of the consequences of oppression for the lives and future of ordinary people.
I have never forgotten it.
in writing. - (EL) We MEPs of the Greek Communist Party refused to take part in the vote on the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian uprising which developed into anti-communist hysteria.
The final resolution jointly signed and supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and by the neo-liberals and other groups with the exception of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left adopts the anti-communist memorandum taken from the Council of Europe and reintroduced into the European Parliament.
They are calling events supported and organised by imperialism to overturn socialist regimes popular uprisings and democratic movements.
They collectively consider everyone who furiously fought socialism to be resistance fighters and democrats.
It is now clear that the political forces that support the ÎU are the same forces that morally and politically advocate the revival of fascism in the Baltic and other states and are urging and leading the ban on communist action, as in the Czech Republic and other countries previously.
The call by the servants of capitalist barbarism in paragraph 3 of the resolution on the 'democratic community' '... to unequivocally reject the repressive and undemocratic Communist ideology...' expresses their fear of it.
We want to remind all those dreaming of the ultimate prevalence of the barbaric, exploitative capitalist system that the communist ideology gave birth to the biggest social uprisings and will give birth to even bigger ones, precisely because it is fighting for a society free from the exploitation of man by man.
One of the most positive aspects of the recent EU enlargement is that it has also led to an enlargement of our memory.
For most of us, the 1956 Hungarian uprising is a distant memory in terms of time, geography and even in politics.
The accession of countries like Poland, the Baltic States, Slovenia and Hungary itself has brought with it another memory that we have incorporated, and this memory has been a full part of our consciousness for a year and a half.
This has led to a fresh geo-strategic perception of our place in the world, which we need to incorporate and to keep up to date, and has shed new light on the democratic struggles of the 20th century.
On the other hand, this moment should naturally serve to remind us that Communism was neither romantic nor utopian.
The history of Communism is one of repression, violence and inhumanity, and we should not forget this.
The European Parliament resolution on the situation in South Ossetia is an expression of the EU's imperialist plans in the region.
We know that Georgia is already one step away from joining ÎÎÎ€Î, while the imperialist lackey Saakashvili government has already agreed to the installation of American basis on its territory.
The EU's ambitions to encircle and exert pressure on Russia, with one eye firmly on the Russian market, especially the energy market, within the framework of the vying and infighting between the imperialists are hiding behind self-righteous pronouncements about respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and condemnation of the independence movements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
With the same ease with which the EU is allegedly defending the territorial integrity of Georgia today, it can undermine it tomorrow by supporting the secessionist movements which it condemns today, if the strategic interests of the monopolies in the area so require.
The peoples in the area have a great deal of experience of Community interventionist policy, with incitement and support for all manner of 'domestic uprisings' and the 'carrot and stick' policy.
That is why they need to draw their own conclusions and to stand up and resist and overturn the policy of the ÎU and the other imperialist forces and governments which serve it.
in writing. I welcome this vote on the export of toxic waste to Africa.
The recent incident involving a Dutch company dumping waste in the Ivory Coast demonstrates that many in Europe still see Africa as a dumping ground.
I hope the Dutch authorities leave no stone unturned in bringing those responsible to justice.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hieronymi report stems from a worthy aim, namely that of supporting European audiovisual production against the crushing competition exerted by US productions, as well as others.
In order to reach that goal, it seeks to encourage coproduction, support coordinated marketing strategies and promote the distribution of the Union's products on the internal and international market.
However, the budget allocation appears fairly limited.
Moreover, precisely because of the fact that resources are limited, it by no means seems a good idea to open the programme to participation by non-European countries as well.
I believe that public support for this sector, at both national and European level, should be directed towards audiovisual productions intended to inform and to instruct, to educate in the strictest sense, and towards projects making a real difference in breaking down the present situation in which Europe is made a cultural colony of the United States.
I do not feel that the report goes far enough in this respect.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report.
It is clear that many companies and individuals routinely abuse laws designed to protect the environment.
They often find it cheaper to pay fines than to comply with laws on dumping or transporting toxic waste.
If we want to protect the environment we must consider criminal as well as civil action against the abusers.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the EU should not interfere in other countries' internal affairs.
It is important for reasons of principle to pursue the policy we went to the polls on.
There is no doubt that Syria should improve its relations with Israel.
The June List is an uncompromising opponent of all totalitarian regimes, and we condemn all countries that choose to support terrorism in all its forms.
It is obvious that the EU's foreign policy is governed by various special interests possessed by certain Member States in regions around the world.
I find this policy to be very disingenuous and destructive, and to be so in a way exemplified clearly by the current report.
The EU is trying to influence Syria's relations with its neighbours, and that cannot be regarded as acceptable.
I am choosing to abstain in the vote for reasons of principle.
Naturally we have no quarrel with the conclusion of an association agreement with Syria, which, as we know, is the only country in the region with which the EC does not have an association agreement.
We are vehemently opposed, however, to some of the key points in the report.
The report is marked by an approach based on interventionism and meddling on a broad range of issues over which sovereignty should rest with the Syrian people.
What is more, Parliament holds Syria responsible for the situation in the Middle East and makes accusations against the country, something it has failed to do in relation to Israel and the USA, which are primarily responsible for the dangerous, tragic situation in the region.
Among other points, the report's objectives include the transition of the political system in Syria and the creation of 'an open and market-based economy'.
It seeks to force Syria to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on Lebanon, yet fails to mention the fact that Israel continues to occupy part of Syrian territory, attacks Lebanon and continues to pursue its policy of State terrorism against Palestine.
It criticises Syrian politics and calls on the country to review 'its current foreign policy and regional alignment'.
We find this unacceptable.
in writing. I welcome this Agreement.
Syria has much to do in terms of improving human rights, its relationship with its neighbours and its treatment of its minorities.
However, I believe constructive agreement is the way forward.
Europe must keep Syria at arm's length, not because that country forms part of the axis of evil, as America's President Bush claims it does, but because it oppresses its own people and represents an unnecessary burden on others.
Syria has, for many years, been a dictatorship that was run by the El-Assads, both father and son.
Many Syrian residents were forced to flee abroad, because they otherwise faced being locked up or disappearing utterly, and no organised opposition is permitted.
Not only political opponents, but also Kurds and Christians feel themselves under threat.
In neighbouring Lebanon, Syria was responsible for years of military occupation, for political assassinations and for arming Hezbollah.
In another of its neighbours, Israel, it is considered to be a most unreasonable neighbour, one that never wants peace or reconciliation, and Syria's actions can be used as one of the arguments not to actively broker a peace agreement with a Palestinian neighbour.
Syria has recently secretly extradited a Dutchman of Iranian descent to Iran.
The EU's position on Syria is still too much focused on good relations with the Mediterranean Sea countries and too little on democracy and human rights.
The statements by the Council and the Commission and the European Parliament resolution are a blatant and unprovoked attack on Syria, from which they want a statement of apology for its policy and its subjugation to imperialism.
Taking advantage of the debate on a Euro-Mediterranean association agreement, threats are being launched about its stand against the war in Iraq, solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and refusal to bow down to imperialist plans.
The escalating aggressive policy of the EU reveals the nature of UN Resolution 1701 by announcing in advance the role which the military occupying forces of the Member States of the European Union will play in the area.
The report constitutes the European version of the American propaganda which is targeting Syria and calling it an axis of evil country.
We voted against the report in an expression of solidarity with the peoples of Syria and the Middle East which the American and European imperialists have in their sights.
The EU, USA and ÎÎÎ€Î are jointly promoting the application of the NATO 'Middle East' plan in a bid to subjugate countries and peoples.
We consider it politically unacceptable for this specific report to be passed by political forces which call themselves leftist, because they are joining sides with the imperialist policy of the ÎU and the USA, thereby providing an alibi for unleashing new wars.
Although this is, broadly speaking, a balanced report in the version negotiated by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I still have one or two reservations about its adoption.
As a result of both its status and logistical difficulties, the EU has neither the power nor the ability to act as a world power.
It also has neither the military nor the financial resources to do so, and most importantly, it does not have such a mandate.
This does not mean, however, that the EU should be a passive member of the international community.
The dimensions of Europe as a market, as a provider of financial aid, as a place of refuge for immigrants, and as a neighbour make, or ought to make, the EU a partner in external policy.
I am not talking about the traditional reference to the virtues of soft power or the debate on the need for alternative axes.
What I am referring to is the ability that the EU should have, on account of these dimensions, to influence and change policy in the Mediterranean, one of the most important regions in the world.
In the medium term, the EU should be capable of having the same effect on its neighbours as it has had on the countries that have joined it in successive rounds of enlargement.
What we should be doing is reproducing in our Mediterranean neighbours the effects of pre-accession expectations.
Unfortunately, this agreement does not convey that ambition.
in writing. - (FR) The Conference of the Parties in Montreal last year concluded with the minimal decision to continue discussions on the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives after 2012.
On the eve of the next annual conference, the situation is still just as uncertain, and it therefore presents a serious threat to the future of the Kyoto Protocol, particularly in the wake of the statements by the new Canadian Government.
This situation is incomprehensible and unacceptable given that the warning signs are continuing to multiply and that forecasts are certain of a 50% increase in CO2 emissions by 2030, which runs counter to the objectives in this matter, to which our institution refers on a regular basis.
There is a very broad consensus within the European Union, as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) has lent its support to some very ambitious objectives to combat climate change.
We must act as a matter of urgency, and take decisions and measures that match the challenges facing Europe and the whole world.
Our response to those challenges represents a powerful driving force for research and technological innovation, and for the modernisation of our production facilities.
in writing. One of the most important issues facing the world today is the issue of climate change and how to tackle it.
This is no longer an issue for tomorrow, but now.
The time for action is upon us.
All the evidence from the world's scientists tells us exactly that, even if the Bush Administration is lying to gag its own experts' contributions to the debate.
It is the American Administration that is the problem.
Everyone is horrified by the consequences of the second Gulf War for the ordinary people of Iraq, with the recent estimate that there have been more than 650,000 deaths amongst the civilian population.
Yet the failure to sign the Kyoto Agreement threatens billions around the world, and the very existence of nations like Bangladesh and the Maldives.
This will be the legacy of this United States Administration unless they are prepared to look again.
But I am afraid there are none so blind as those that cannot see!
(FR) Mr President, the Naiades programme for the development of inland waterways and Mrs Wortmann-Kool's report contain some excellent things.
I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the need to complete the Rhine-Rhone link.
This link is an extremely important route that will enable us to connect the South of France and the Western Mediterranean with the Rhine-Main-Danube basin, and hence with the new and emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe all the way to the Black Sea.
In my opinion, this programme is a top priority, and I hope that it is to the completion of this link - the technical and environmental difficulties of which I am well aware of but do not consider to be insurmountable - that the resources mobilised under this programme will be allocated as the first priority.
The Wortmann-Kool report calls for the active promotion of inland waterway transport, which is currently underdeveloped.
This safe, environmentally-friendly mode of transport with a lot of free capacity on its infrastructure, can contribute to modal shift and ease the congestion problems affecting other transport modes.
It also strikes me that the increase in trade since the enlargement will help develop new markets, such as this form of transport.
The adoption of measures aimed at redressing the balance between different forms of transport is hugely important for the future of a sustainable transport policy.
As such, I am strongly in favour of developing the inland waterways transport network, which, from the developmental stage, can encompass all of the strategic areas that are important in optimising the development of this market.
Consequently, and bearing in mind the diverse characteristics of European territory, it is vital to establish an appropriate legal framework that will allow for the development of markets, which may, in turn, help move traffic over to alternative forms of transport.
As a Portuguese MEP, I therefore support this programme, which does not foster national self-interest, and which I believe will have a positive impact on the transport market in Portugal.
Public-private partnerships are very popular in EU Member States, and, somewhat inevitably, the United Kingdom is the European champion.
Unfortunately, though, they are a euphemism for the privatisation, or preparation for the privatisation, of public assets and services, which will be put up for sale, over the longer term, for private investors to make profit from them.
This, say the proponents, will lead to better risk management.
What they overlook, however, is that private firms keep the profits and the State always ends up carrying the can when the partnership turns sour or fails to deliver the profits that the private businesses were looking for.
This applies right across the board, in areas as diverse as the outsourcing of motorways, the management of hospitals and schools, and the incorporation of investment projects within the scope of the Structural Funds.
They are a means of outsourcing the State's responsibilities, and this is something we find unacceptable.
What is more, this initiative is seeking Community-level legal arrangements.
We therefore have no choice but to vote against the report.
The Weiler report that is being put to the vote today includes a number of positive points on the future of public-private partnerships, particularly as regards the Green Paper and Commission communication.
In this regard, I am delighted at the clear distinction made between public procurement and concessions, and at the call for a legislative initiative on the latter.
Although I bitterly regret the fact that the European Parliament chose not to extend this approach with regard to institutional public-private partnerships, the amendments adopted in plenary represent an acknowledged step forward towards a future definition for 'in house' services, in other words towards a more secure situation for European local authorities.
Although this interim text is not perfect, in my view it presents a set of advances that explain why I finally voted in favour, advances which the Commission now has responsibility for integrating fully into its future proposals on the subject.
in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community legal framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs) does indeed need to be clarified.
However, this clarification needs to comply with a number of principles: in particular, it must indeed relate only to partnerships between the public and private sectors; it must be based on a distinction between partnerships/contracts on the one hand and partnerships/concessions on the other, respecting the characteristic features of each and therefore avoiding new specific regulations for PPPs; it must not call into question the rules of the negotiated procedure applicable to concessions; it must give the national public authorities the freedom to choose the structure (creation of mixed economy companies or other legal forms, a public structure taking control of a private business, outsourcing, etc.); and, finally, it must ensure that any Community initiative is consistent with the needs of the public services and national choices in that regard.
None of this is likely to require the adoption of new binding legal documents, but, since it seems inevitable that the European Union will intervene in such matters, let us at least ensure that it does not lead to the creation of one of the bureaucratic machines for which the Europe of Brussels seems to have the secret recipe.
Public private partnerships are the back door by which the public service sector can penetrate and be handed over to private capital.
They are the basic route by which European capital can appropriate public infrastructures and services and circumvent the obstacles and problems which it encounters.
They are also the mechanism for buying off consciences, disorientating the grassroots movement and limiting support for the public sector, by gradually privatising and commercialising services of general interest, especially at local government level.
The objective is to increase the profits of big business and intensify exploitation.
Any efforts made in the report for conditional use of PPPs and democratic control of them are simply an alibi and wish list which ultimately facilitate the general and exponential transfer of services to the control of private capital, with damaging consequences for the workers, consequences that appear to be concealed in the report itself.
The basic point is not how public procurement rules will apply and how franchise contracts will be configured.
What is important is that the management and transfer of public wealth are accompanied by an attack on workers' rights in order to profit capital.
We voted against the report and call on the peoples to fight against the full frontal attack by capital and the policy of the ÎU.
Mr President, I should like to give my explanation of vote on paragraph 4 of the Schroedter report on the posting of workers.
I support the proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the cruiser vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States.
I was particularly pleased to see Parliament do so too.
I do so because of our experience in Ireland with what has happened to the ferry workers and the workers - most of them foreign - who replaced them at Irish Ferries.
We had a documented situation - and this is quite recent, Mr President - where one particular worker was paid approximately EUR 1 an hour.
It is worth noting that the Irish minimum wage is in excess of EUR 8 per hour.
Redundancies were forced, not voluntary, because the redundancy offer on the table involved substantial wage cuts and significant disimprovement in working conditions.
The vacancies arising from forced redundancies were mostly filled by foreign workers, many of them earning half the minimum wage in Ireland.
That situation simply exploits all workers, offers no protection, promotes xenophobia and certainly fits the description of the 'race to the bottom'.
(SK) The basic EU principles on the free movement of persons and services within the European Union forbid any discrimination on grounds of nationality against workers from other Member States in matters of employment, remuneration or any other work-related matters.
What is the reality of the situation, however?
Some Member States are still clinging to the transition periods that apply to the creation of labour markets.
The Posted Workers Directive is closely related to the Services Directive and, despite an intense and justifiable struggle by MEPs from the new Member States, the European Parliament in the first reading omitted Articles 24 and 25 from the draft Directive on services in the internal market.
We consider these articles to be crucial, as the basic ideas of the Posted Workers Directive are interpreted differently in different Member States, and workers are generally unaware of their rights as guaranteed by the Directive.
Regrettably, I have to note that a Commission Guideline cannot remove obstacles to the free movement of labour and services and therefore cannot solve the problems that enterprises and workers in the Member States are experiencing as a result of the inadequate implementation of the Posted Workers Directive.
I have voted against the Schroedter report because it did not include key amendments aimed at ensuring greater mobility within the EU labour market.
I am concerned that the position taken by the rapporteur would place unnecessary obstacles in the way of job creation and lead to the failure of our bid to make the internal market in services fully functional.
Mr President, I thought you might like to know that I voted in favour of the resolution that we adopted on the basis of the Schroedter report from the Employment Committee, because I think its general thrust, which is that we need better application of the existing legislation, rather than new legislation, is the right one at this time.
However, I think that in due course, once we have evaluated whether we have managed to get this legislation better applied in the near future, we shall need to return to the question of whether the original directive needs amending, updating or improving in other ways.
in writing. Where companies in one country wish legally to post workers to work in another EU country, such a procedure should be made straightforward rather than burdened by yet more bureaucracy.
Parliament should not give its approval to practices deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice and disporportionate by the Commission.
The Schroedter report on the posting of workers calls for extra bureaucracy such as prior declarations from companies intending to post workers and the requirement to keep detailed time sheet records, etc. Such practices are disproportionate, promote protectionism and undermine the services directive.
Sending out this message undermines the EU commitment to the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
The Commission text is sensible and practical.
This socialist report attempts to move the text in the wrong direction.
In this context UK Conservatives have been unable to support this report.
in writing. (SV) The report points out that the Posting of Workers Directive is not being applied in full by all the Member States.
It is thus necessary to adopt a number of measures to enable the Member States genuinely to guarantee minimum standards of protection and conditions of employment for workers temporarily employed in another EU country.
The June List is in favour of the host country's legislation applying to employees working in other Member States.
That is one of the things that we have stated clearly in the debates on the Services Directive.
On the basis of the aforesaid reasoning, I have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole.
in writing. I wish to give a brief explanation on paragraph 4 in the original text of the Schroedter report on the application of directive 96/71 on the posting of workers.
I support the proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the crews of vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States.
I do so because of our experience in Ireland and what happened to Irish workers and the mostly foreign workers who replaced them in Irish ferries.
We had a documented situation where one particular worker was paid approximately 1 euro per hour as a hairdresser, and it is worth noting that the Irish minimum wage is in excess of 8 euro per hour.
After the redundancies - and these were forced, not voluntary, because the redundancy offer on the table involved substantial wage cuts and significant disimprovement of workers' conditions - the vacancies arising from the forced redundancies were filled by mostly foreign workers, many on half the minimum wage for Ireland.
This situation simply exploits workers, offers no protection, promotes xenophobia, and certainly fits the description of the 'race to the bottom'.
The rapporteur quite legitimately wants to counteract the European Commission's unfortunately chronic liberal excesses.
It is unacceptable that the Commission has tried, in its communication, to reintroduce the country of origin principle even though it was rejected by Parliament during the vote on the Services Directive.
I would join with the rapporteur in calling for this directive to be implemented and enforced strictly as soon as possible, and for fines to be introduced.
The Commission must accept Court of Justice case-law, which establishes that there is a difference between self-employed workers and posted workers, and provides more favourable social standards for the latter.
Everything that was excluded from the first resolution on the Bolkestein directive is being restored with the European Commission guidelines on the application of Directive 96/71 on the posting of workers, in order to complete the crime against the working class.
Using the case law of the Court, the Commission is proceeding to overturn even these defective and limited rules of protection acquired by the workers and to abolish all controls on posted workers by the host state, thereby undermining the Collective Work Agreements and the social rights of workers in general.
The political mouthpieces of European capital (the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and social democrats and liberals) who voted for the Bolkestein directive in the European Parliament in February 2006, with a new unacceptable compromise in the report on the Commission communication, are stuttering out lukewarm recommendations, thereby facilitating the EU's attempts to direct the workers' movement.
They are yet again serving the ambitions of monopoly groups to increase their profits by overexploiting the working class.
The escalation of the fight by the working class and of workers in general against the entire anti-grassroots policy of the ÎU is an urgent necessity and the only way to satisfy the contemporary needs of the working-class, grassroots family.
in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP) voted to support the Schroedter report on the Posted Workers Directive as there is a need to improve the implementation of this important legislation to aid the free movement of workers.
However, the EPLP recognises that Member States have different enforcement mechanisms and there may be differences in, for example, information requirements between Member States.
Any requirements must be proportionate and justified.
It is important that this legislation does not add unnecessary burdens to business and interfere with the right of foreign services providers to post workers.
The Posting of Workers Directive 96/71/EC is an important milestone in European labour legislation.
The Schroedter report highlights problems with the directive's application, thus responding to a Commission communication - promised back in 2004 but not appearing until April 2006 - in which the Commission has tried, by referring to Court of Justice rulings, to restrict the control measures available to the Member States.
The Schroedter report redraws the balance between economic liberalisation and social protection.
Accordingly, certain administrative measures (for example, social inspection of bogus self-employment, collective labour agreements) can no longer be seen as restricting the free movement of employees within the EU's labour markets, an opinion also shared by the Court of Justice.
The conditions for minimum pay, working conditions and health and safety at work, as well as the principle of the receiving country, are important instruments in preventing social dumping and unfair competition.
At the same time, they ensure that employees and service providers are treated fairly.
Thanks to this report, the neo-liberal course which Europe has been steering for years is given a more social dimension.
The European Parliament must bear its responsibility with regard to the social protection of workers, and that is why I support the Schroedter report.
in writing. (PL) The Schroedter report on the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive undermines all the valuable provisions enshrined in the European Commission's Guidance on the Posting of Workers, following the compromise reached on the Services Directive.
From a political point of view, this amounts to backtracking from that hard won compromise.
The European Commission set out to indicate (in a non-binding document) that there are upper limits to social protection and administrative regulation of the market, and that these cannot be exceeded in the Member States in order to avoid impinging on the principle of freedom to provide services (until the entry into force of the Services Directive, the Posting of Workers Directive remains the main legal basis for the market in services).
The report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs undermines all the key provisions of the aforementioned Guidance on the Posting of Workers.
It defends the outrageous status quo on the services market, where companies from the new Member States are systematically harassed by the administration in order to restrict competition.
This is a clear and simple case of protectionism, except that it is being implemented in the name of the workers and social protection.
in writing. - (FR) It is a fact: the directive on the posting of workers has not been properly implemented in some Member States and is not fulfilling its objectives.
This is due to variations in the interpretation of certain key concepts (worker, minimum wage and subcontracting), the difficulty of monitoring compliance with the directive, and the difficulty of obtaining information, both for workers and for SMEs.
If we are to have an effective system of cooperation between the Member States, we need to increase the participation of the social partners, provide posted workers with more information on their rights, and provide businesses, particularly SMEs and craft enterprises, with contact partners.
Finally, it is now vital for the European Commission to look into constructive solutions to prevent and eliminate unfair competition, as illustrated by 'PO box companies' or double posting from one country to another, and the social dumping resulting from the improper posting of workers, in particular by means of 'sham self-employment'.
This is not about changing the acquis of the directive, but about improving it.
That is why I voted in favour of Mrs Schroedter's own-initiative report.
Parliament has observed its annual ritual of ratifying the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy.
Although the report calls for prudence with regard to raising interest rates and for investment, its key priorities are price stability and budgetary consolidation, which will undermine economic growth, employment and people's buying power on what they earn.
When what is needed, in contrast with the ECB's fundamental objective, are economic and social concerns, the recipe is more of the same, that is to say, structural reforms in the labour market and in social security, and this comes as no surprise.
By saying that the system of appointments to the Executive Board worked well and that its members should not be chosen on the basis of nationality, the report overlooks the fact that this system always operates on the basis of rotation between the nationalities of the major EU powers.
The net effect of which, in a rotating system on the Board of Governors adopted in 2003, is to exclude the small countries from the vote on monetary decisions.
Parliament has said it is opposed to such a situation, on the grounds of complexity and unfairness, instead proposing a Board of Governors comprising just nine members.
No prizes for guessing who will be in and who will be out.
For all these reasons, we are compelled to vote against.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I see it, Mrs BÃ©rÃšs' report is a demonstration that the monetary policy pursued by the ECB is a failure.
To be honest, the only truly positive points it contains are the profit earned by the Bank and the fact that it has at least succeeded in creating jobs within its own four walls, because its workforce (though God only knows what they do) has increased by 86% in seven years.
We have now reached the point when, in order to make the euro more popular with the people of Europe, the rapporteur is calling for the banknotes to be changed to replace these images of non-existent bridges with real living beings, landscapes or monuments rooted in the culture of our continent.
I and my colleagues in the Front National have taken many, many opportunities here to say exactly what we think of this policy, of its disastrous effect on employment and the purchasing power of the European people, of its focus on financial rather than economic objectives, of the harmful absence of an exchange policy, and now of the policy of increasing interest rates, which will further hinder growth.
Our opinion has not changed.
in writing. (SV) In a referendum, the Swedish people rejected the introduction of the euro by a broad majority.
I support that position wholeheartedly.
The report is redolent of propaganda, to which I cannot give my backing, in favour of the euro.
Paragraph 26 proposes measures that should be taken to ensure that Europeans do not distance themselves from the euro.
Paragraph 27 contains propaganda in favour of the Constitution.
I am opposed to wordings of this type and have voted against the report as a whole.
in writing. The policy of the Conservative Party in relation to the euro is clear: we are firmly committed to keeping the pound.
Nevertheless, as the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular are our largest trading partners, we are ever vigilant of the need for the euro's stability, since this directly affects Britain's prosperity.
We therefore reserve the right to make ourselves heard when we believe that unwarranted political pressure is being directed against the independence of the European Central Bank.
In the last year, as interest rates have been raised from their historic low, the ECB has been under political attack, and an attempt was made to use this report to interfere in its management.
Fortunately, the report in its final form respected the ECB's independence, and we have therefore taken the exceptional step of endorsing it to make known our commitment to a sound monetary policy.
in writing. - (FR) Since the euro was introduced seven years ago, the purchasing power of the people of Europe has fallen considerably.
In the 'Euro zone', we have seen a real increase in prices for household goods and leisure, and an even clearer trend in housing due to a lack of monitoring of speculative funds.
It is therefore the working and middle classes who are hardest hit, even without adding excess debt to the mix.
Economic growth in the 'Euro zone' has even fallen: the GDP volume has gone from an increase of 1.8% in 2004 to an increase of 1.4% in 2005.
The prospects for 2007-2013 are even more worrying, because the Euro will present a greater risk to European growth once the exchange rate with the dollar becomes too favourable.
Not only does this bank, with its ultra-European foundations and philosophy, demonstrate a democratic deficit and a certain lack of transparency, but it will not even achieve any of the European Union's economic and social objectives.
These indicators should make it clear that we should get out of the Euro zone and that the individual nations should regain their competence for economic, social and monetary decision-making in a free Europe where protection and national and Community preference take first place.
in writing. Although I could agree with the broad thrust of this report, particularly in the area of transparency and scrutiny, there is one issue I believe needs a sensitive touch - hedge funds.
It is appropriate for all central monetary authorities to maintain a vigilant approach to hedge funds.
However, the call for research to promote regulation is premature.
The need to regulate could be disproportionate to any potential threat such funds are perceived to have.
Time and time again, the ECB argues that price stability is its contribution to job creation and growth.
In the euro zone, price stability is a reality; in quite a few sectors, indeed, aggregate rates of price increase below two per cent are opening the door to deflation, but as soon as there is the slightest indication of economic recovery in the euro zone, the only way the ECB, with its blind fixation on price stability, knows how to respond is by raising interest rates.
It does that despite the absence of even the least sign of inflationary tendencies, even though there is no change in the prevalent mass unemployment and wages are rising more slowly than productivity, which, in the long term, cannot do other than lead to serious imbalances in the national economies.
It does it even though even the capital markets, with their extremely low long-term interest rates, are indicating that they expect the future to bring neither a substantial increase in prices, nor sustainable economic recovery, and a look across the Atlantic reveals that they have little reason to do so.
As originally drafted, this report was courageous enough to take critical lines.
Lamentably, though, little remains of them following the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, although words of criticism would seem necessary to say the least.
What we really need in Europe is a different monetary policy, one that is guided, not by monetarist dogma, but by social responsibility; one that represents the interests of the vast majority of Europeans rather than only those of the financial sharks and of the European financial elite.
That concludes the explanations of vote.

Tibet
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Tibet.
author. - (PL) Mr President, Tibet has been under Chinese occupation for over 50 years.
The Chinese authorities have been pursuing a policy of discrimination and persecution, aimed at marginalising Tibetans in their own homeland.
The Chinese army has recently carried out yet another barbaric killing.
On this occasion a defenceless Tibetan nun was murdered crossing the border into Nepal.
China denies that shots were fired at Tibetan refugees attempting to enter Nepal, but the entire incident was caught on film.
The House cannot remain silent and indifferent to these latest events.
The policy of force and repression imposed on the people of Tibet by the Chinese authorities can no longer be tolerated.
I hereby call on the Government of the People's Republic of China to stop violating the human rights of the Tibetan nation and of other minorities.
I also appeal to the Chinese Government to guarantee that it will respect international law, international human rights standards and freedom of religion.
Tibet must be granted genuine autonomy and the Tibetan people must be allowed freedom of religion and education.
I also call on the Government of the People's Republic of China to accelerate the dialogue begun with representatives of the Dalai Lama, and to seek to arrive, without further delay, at a solution to the issue of Tibet that is acceptable to both parties.
author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, China's representatives described the events of 30 September on that country's border in terms suggesting that they had been attacked by a band of Tibetans and had had - and with difficulty - to defend themselves.
On this occasion - unlike in many other instances - a video is in existence to clearly demonstrate that the opposite is the case.
This video shows that the Tibetan refugees did not attack; that, on the contrary, the group of people trying to cross the border was composed of young people, children, nuns and monks.
The European Union must firmly repudiate the Chinese account of what happened, and demand clarification of the matter.
It must also demand clarification as to what has become of the children that the Chinese troops took into custody, the present whereabouts and state of these children and refugees and the manner in which such situations on the border are, as a rule, handled.
We in the European Union must make it abundantly plain that Tibet must be accorded autonomy within China's borders, but real autonomy nonetheless, in line with the 'Middle Way' proposed by the Dalai Lama.
author. - (DE) Mr President, there has been another incident with fatal consequences at the border between China and Nepal.
When, on 30 September, a group of Tibetans - all of them unarmed civilians - attempted to flee over the Nangpa Pass to Nepal, Chinese border guards opened fire on them.
Kelsang Namtso, a seventeen-year-old nun, was killed; many people were wounded, and thirty arrested, among them women and nine children.
I wish to echo what was said by the previous speakers.
This tragedy would never have come to light had it not been for a Romanian camera crew that was on the scene by chance and filmed what happened.
The pictures they took appeared on Dutch television at peak viewing time.
Despite this documentation, Peking maintains that there were injuries but no deaths and that, moreover, it had been the Tibetans who had opened fire and the Chinese had been obliged to defend themselves.
We condemn this brutal action on the part of the Chinese security forces and call on the authorities to treat their captives in a humane manner and in compliance with international agreements, for China is a signatory to the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child, which protects minors from arrest and from arbitrary treatment on the part of the state.
What happened at the Nangpa Pass must be investigated with the minimum possible delay, and those responsible must be called to account for their actions.
These attacks on defenceless civilians must be put on the agenda for the next EU/China dialogue on human rights.
I urge those representing the Commission to get an idea for themselves of what is going on, to go to the Tibetan Welfare Centre in Katmandu, as our ad hoc delegation from this House did in July when we went to Nepal, to ask the refugees arriving there about the things they have had to endure, and to do something about it!
(Applause)
author. - (NL) Mr President, this Parliament is right in once more expressing its indignation, and the unfortunate fact is that I expect it will have to do so many times more.
The situation in Tibet is getting worse rather than better, and we may actually be to blame for this.
Even before 1951, the European countries accepted that Tibet should be part of China, even though it was not described as such on maps.
That is how it stayed when in the 50s, the People's Republic of China actually brought this inhospitable region under its control with military means, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.
Tibet has now become more easily accessible from China via the world's highest railway line.
Foreign mountaineers witnessed recently how inhabitants who tried to flee the country were simply gunned down.
The government, and probably the majority of public opinion in China, consider Tibet, above all, as a region that is still virtually empty and that needs to be colonised by Chinese people from the most densely populated areas.
Since the Chinese economy is more than ever intertwined with the European economy, Europe has a powerful lever.
The question is whether we are prepared to use this lever.
Oppression will persist if we do not bring any pressure to bear.
author. - Mr President, China's Communist occupation of Tibet is a long-standing scourge on democracy and an open wound on the principles of justice and freedom.
Time and again, we have strongly condemned the thoroughly indefensible and brutal way the Chinese regime has been treating a small peace-loving nation, isolated at the roof of the world.
In the latest incident, China's occupation forces opened fire on a group of unarmed, defenceless civilians who were attempting in desperation to flee their country through the glacial pass at Nangpa, situated at a height of almost 19 000 feet.
The group included many women and children.
A 17-year old nun was killed; a 20-year old was seriously injured; some individuals are missing and 29 people, including 14 children, were arrested.
Some succeeded in escaping to neighbouring Nepal.
Luckily and thankfully, the incident was witnessed by a number of foreign mountaineers, whose independent and trustworthy accounts, including a video, utterly contradicted the ridiculous lies about what happened put forward in an official statement by the Chinese authorities.
We in Europe have a lot to say when it comes to condemning actions of totalitarian and oppressive regimes, but in practice the severity of our words is not matched by our deeds.
Apart from being regrettable, this is also highly hypocritical, in my view.
The colonial-style occupation of Tibet by China, as, indeed, any colonial occupation of one country by another, has to end forthwith.
To demonstrate that we mean what we say, we must take tangible measures against China.
Yes, we have an arms embargo against that country, but it has little effect.
What would really be effective is if we had a trade import ban on China; that would really cause headaches to the Communist leaders in Beijing and would lead to some sensible responses to our demands for freedom for Tibet.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it is clear that bold action is needed to improve the human rights situation in China.
This recent incident gives us a clear reason why that should be a priority for the European Union.
I find it absolutely appalling that the Chinese state media Xinhua reported the shooting as self-defence, while video footage clearly shows the Tibetan refugees were shot from a distance and in the back.
No force, threat or resistance was offered to the Chinese border guards.
None of the refugees had a weapon of any kind, not even a knife.
I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency and draw attention to its work in the human rights dialogue.
Last week, on 20 October, the Finnish Presidency issued an official statement condemning the incident. I would like to thank the Presidency for that.
Finally, as indicated in the joint resolution on Tibet, we must continue to encourage high-level talks between the Dalai Lama and the Government of China.
I would like to reiterate that this is the only way to find a peaceful and sustainable solution for real autonomy for the Tibetan nation.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, despite the fact that official relations between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama were restored in 2002, human rights continue to be infringed in Tibet on a regular basis.
It is estimated that every year 2 500 people decide to escape from repression and undertake the dangerous journey to Nepal, lasting several days.
The acts of violence perpetrated against unarmed civilians have given rise to particular concern.
These acts include the shots fired at refugees by Chinese border guards in the Nangpa La pass in September of this year.
The group of fugitives concerned was attempting to cross the Tibetan border and included women, children and monks.
To date, the Chinese authorities have not accepted responsibility for this incident, in which one person was killed.
The fate of several children detained by the military is still unknown.
It is incumbent upon international institutions to take decisive and effective action to compel the Government of the People's Republic of China to put an end to its repression of the people of Tibet, its inhumane treatment of prisoners, its use of torture and its extra-judicial executions.
We appeal once again, from the floor of this House, for fundamental human rights to be respected in Tibet.
These rights include freedom of expression and association.
We also call for a genuine dialogue between both parties, aimed at achieving understanding and respect for the religious, political and cultural rights of the Tibetan people.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in the two and a half years that I have been an MEP, this must the third time, or perhaps there have been more, that we have had to discuss human rights violations in Tibet, and I fear that it will not be the last.
The difference this time compared to previous occasions, however, is that we have filmed evidence demonstrating that the Chinese authorities' attempts to deny these events are deceitful and that, at the same time, the Xinhua news agency's attempts to show that this action was in self-defence is entirely without foundation.
We are therefore dealing with an event that clearly requires investigation, as other speakers have said.
I agree with that and I support it, but, furthermore, it also deserves to be treated as a fundamental issue within the framework of European Union-China dialogue.
I would insist that this is not the first time, but it is really becoming rather sad that, since we have the opportunity to hold this dialogue with China, and on the eve of the 2008 Olympic Games, we do not stress over and over again that the Tibet situation could be resolved if there were truly a little political will on the part of the Chinese authorities.
So far we have not seen any such will.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are today debating human rights in China.
We are doing so in the wake of a tragic and terrifying border incident.
On this occasion, people throughout the world were able to see for themselves how China deals with defenceless individuals who do not present any kind of threat to the Communist authorities.
These poor people are simply shot at without compunction.
The incident we are currently debating, and which has rightly triggered discussion of this subject in the European Parliament, reminds us of a bitter truth.
Human rights are being systematically violated in China in almost every aspect of life.
The human, economic and religious rights of the citizens of the People's Republic of China are being infringed.
Unfortunately, we have to admit the sad and unpalatable truth that, all too often, the governments of individual European Union Member States remain hypocritically silent about what is happening in China.
The same applies to the European Union institutions.
If the common values that unite us in this House and across Europe really are common, it is incumbent on us to call, loudly and clearly, for human rights to be respected in the People's Republic of China.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am very glad that Parliament is showing such concern for the people of Tibet.
I do not question the genuineness of it, but I do question the genuineness of the way in which this Parliament acts on such concerns.
Today in the budget vote we rejected three amendments that would have removed EU development funding from government and organisational programmes that included coercive abortion, involuntary sterilisation and infanticide.
Why do Tibetans try to escape from China?
It is because of these very barbaric practices, in addition to religious persecution and political persecution.
This is what blights the life of all minorities and conquered peoples within the territory that China now claims to rule.
I ask you, Commissioner - and I would like an answer - what part does our development aid play in this kind of suffering?
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying to Mrs Sinnott that it is clouding the issue to raise points like that, which are entirely separate from what we are discussing here today.
Approximately 2500 Tibetans - possibly more - annually flee across the border from the Himalayas into exile.
They are certainly escaping from the brutality of China's occupation, but it is not necessarily as Mrs Sinnott suggests.
It is difficult to know how many are caught or shot by the Chinese border authorities, because the allegations have generally remained uninvestigated.
This particularly horrendous shooting incident on 30 September is in violation of the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law-enforcement officials.
It is interesting that there are guidelines as to when law-enforcement officials can shoot, but these require that they should not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury.
Those of us who have seen the video clips of this incident know that the situation was not one involving grave threats to life.
It appeared to be an unprovoked attack.
That is why the motion for a resolution before us is very important, in particular paragraph 8, which urges the Council and the Commission to reiterate their position regarding dialogue between the appropriate authorities.
That is a position we must echo this afternoon: dialogue to resolve this situation.
(PL) Mr President, the resolution we are to vote on today concerns the events of 30 September, when Chinese policemen shot at a group of Tibetan refugees seeking freedom beyond the People's Republic of China.
It was certainly not the first incident of its kind.
It was unusual, however, in that this barbaric behaviour was caught on film.
Television and the Internet enabled us all, along with millions of others around the world, to see for ourselves what the Chinese policy on Tibet actually amounts to.
The fate of the Tibetan people is particularly unfortunate because they are one of the most peace-loving nations in the world.
The Dalai Lama is not demanding independence for Tibet.
The Tibetans are prepared to exist within the framework laid down in the Chinese constitution.
How can it be possible to shoot at such people?
How can they be persecuted and killed, simply because of their desire for a small measure of freedom and for the protection of their cultural heritage?
Can this tragic course of events be halted?
It can be, if orders are issued to ban the shooting of people fleeing from a country they do not wish to live in.
This happened in the past, rather closer to home, on the border between East and West Germany.
Great nations cannot and must not base their authority on the massacre of defenceless refugees.
(PL) Mr President, much has been said in the House today about the situation in Tibet.
The Chinese authorities claim to respect Tibet's autonomy, but their actions tell quite a different story.
I would like to take this opportunity to draw Parliament's attention to the report by Human Rights Watch published on 9 October 2006.
This report mentions how an Internet blog created by Woeser, a leading Tibetan intellectual, was shut down.
The blog was one of the most interesting political and cultural developments in contemporary China.
It told the truth about the situation in Tibet, describing the damage to the environment and to Tibetan culture.
Woeser is one of the most distinguished female intellectuals in contemporary China, and her blog gave a true account of current events in Tibet.
We simply cannot tolerate a situation in which the Chinese authorities claim to have granted autonomy to a particular province, whereas in practice they are closing down leading intellectual online blogs.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members of Parliament regarding the recent shooting by China's People's Liberation Army of Tibetan refugees at the border between the People's Republic of China and Nepal, the subsequent death of one of them and the imprisonment of some of those refugees.
The matter has been formally taken up by the European Union in the framework of the last session of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 19 October, as rightly mentioned by the honourable Member from Finland.
On that occasion, the European Union refuted the claim by China that the shooting had been in self-defence, urged the Chinese Government to undertake a thorough investigation of the incident and insisted that the imprisoned refugees be treated in compliance with international humanitarian standards.
More generally, the Commission is very concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet, and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.
This issue has been regularly addressed during the bilateral dialogue on human rights as well as at the highest level, during bilateral summits.
The European Union is particularly concerned about the number of Tibetans from religious backgrounds who are in prison for political reasons, and has repeatedly asked for their immediate release.
Several of these people are on the list of individual cases regularly submitted to the Chinese authorities on the margins of these dialogues.
The Commission believes that China's policy in Tibet is not consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The early ratification by China of this covenant ranks among the top priorities of the European Union in the field of human rights and we have left China in no doubt as to the need to fully respect the spirit of that covenant, once it has been signed and even before it is ratified.
As part of its overall policy vis-Ã -vis Tibet, the European Union has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet.
We have therefore welcomed and closely monitored the five rounds of talks so far held between the special envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.
The Commission urges both sides to continue this dialogue and use these talks to try to make substantive progress.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at the end of the debates.

Case against Rios Montt
The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the case against Rios Montt.
author. - (ES) Mr President, unlike Tibet, we have not often talked about Guatemala in this House, at least since I have been here.
Nevertheless, it is a small Central America country that has suffered very harsh repression for many years, a brutal dictatorship, and the people responsible for it have so far escaped any form of punishment.
The Spanish High Court has issued an international arrest warrant and what we are doing here is supporting the extradition of General RÃ­os Montt, the person bearing the greatest responsibility, and of five other generals, some of whom were de facto Presidents, that is, dictators, during that thirty-year period in which 200 000 people were murdered, 45 000 disappeared and a tenth of the population was displaced; the enormous majority of the displaced population - 83% - belonged to the Mayan community.
There have also been European victims, however, Belgian and Spanish, particularly priests.
I believe, Mr President, that just as we in this House supported the extradition of Pinochet and of Fujimori, it is right for us now to support the extradition of General RÃ­os Montt and his accomplices, and unanimously if possible.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I naturally agree with what my colleague, Mr YÃ¡Ã±ez-Barnuevo, has just said, because ten years after the peace agreements in Guatemala were signed, a country that has aspirations to be a member of the Security Council and with which an association agreement is being negotiated, has yet to implement the global agreement on human rights.
That is truly worrying in a country which, as has been pointed out, has been the victim of dictatorships, genocides, crimes against humanity, and - most seriously - the people responsible for them are still lording it around the country and around the world unpunished.
We must therefore welcome, as we do in this Resolution, the fact that on 7 July the Spanish High Court issued this international arrest warrant.
This will to a certain extent make it possible to begin to put an end to this impunity and genuinely make the people responsible pay for what they did.
We should do more than that, however.
We must also call for effective cooperation from the Guatemalan authorities in this field.
We must naturally ask them, within this context of increasing cooperation, to be as cooperative as possible, so that, on the basis of this international ruling, they can contribute to the arrest, return and trial of these people.
We must also ask for the cooperation of the banking authorities, which have been holding the profits and wealth that those people have been enjoying, in order to ensure that the latter assume their civil and financial responsibilities.
I would like finally to say that it would be very useful for Europol and Interpol to be able to cooperate in this work as much as they can.
author. - (DE) Mr President, Guatemala has a long and bloody history of violence behind it, and one certainly must not be partial in one's judgment when considering it, for, while there were terrible dictatorships and repressions, there was also an equally cruel and bloodthirsty revolutionary movement in the shape of the Tupamaros.
Over three decades have passed since the eyes of all Germany were fixed on this part of Central America, when the German ambassador Karl Graf Spreti - whose son is a member of my staff - was abducted and murdered.
Karl Graf Spreti was one of the great men who prepared the way for Europe; he was also a member of the German Bundestag for my party, but it was as a diplomat and an innocent man that he was taken away and put to a cruel death in the primeval forest.
Since then, the country has gone through a period of terrible crises.
It is for that reason that we must be very careful, but also very firm, in supporting the peace process there by unambiguously denouncing those who, while in positions of power, had recourse to violence, as well as those who misused the word 'freedom' as a justification for doing the same thing.
Guatemala has also, repeatedly, been the scene of gruesome acts of genocide, and it is cause for gratitude that the resolution does not mince its words about the expulsion of some 10% of the Maya, a people with an ancient culture, and the murder of tens of thousands of them.
We also need to seize this opportunity to tighten up our definition of genocide.
It is said repeatedly that the term 'genocide' may be used only when a group is systematically exterminated.
That is not so: it is also genocide to deprive an ethnic grouping of its basis for existence by robbing it of its homeland by means of expulsion and murderous violence.
That has happened to many ethnic groups, not only to the Maya but also to smaller groupings in Guatemala.
There is no statute of limitations applicable to such crimes, and that is why we must leave no stone unturned in bringing those responsible for them to account rather than turning a blind eye and moving on to the next item on the agenda.
author. -
(The speaker spoke Irish)
During the 1980s and 1990s, Guatemala was constantly in the international news.
Three decades of conflict and a decade-long peace process ensured that people all over the world, including those here in the European Parliament, remained informed.
Colleagues have mentioned some of the stark figures from that period: 200 000 people killed, thousands more displaced, entire villages and communities destroyed forever.
The Government's own investigation confirmed that 93% of all killings were the responsibility of the Government's own armed forces.
The military dictatorship of Rios Montt in the early 1980s was singled out as one of the conflict's most brutal periods.
There was great optimism after the signing of the peace agreements but, ten years later, the reality has changed very little for people in that country, where 80% of the population live in poverty.
Ten years on, not only have the perpetrators of the policy of genocide carried out in the 1980s not been prosecuted, they continue to play prominent roles in public life.
The victims and survivors of the conflict have received neither adequate financial support nor recognition of their suffering.
Indeed, the vast majority of the disappeared have not been found.
Many of those displaced have yet to be returned to their original homes.
I welcome the demand in the resolution, which seeks the support of the Government of Guatemala, the other Central American governments, the Spanish Government and the Government of the United States, for the European order of detention to be facilitated, with reference to the international order of detention, so that those mentioned in the warrant issued on 7 July 2005 - all of whom are charged with crimes of genocide, including Rios Montt - can be brought to justice.
I would also urge Members to be cognisant of the fact that very little has changed for people.
For the majority of Guatemalans, conditions today differ little from those of 1996.
The peace dispensation promised a demilitarisation of society and much-needed land and tax reform, the aim of which was to build a more just and equal society.
Surely today we should remember that, even if Guatemala is not so often in the news, and we should continue to demand and press for an equal and just society.
I therefore welcome and stress the resolution's commitment to the principle of universal justice and the protection of human rights.
Our experience in Ireland has taught us that peace can only be built on justice and respect for the rights of all.
I would explain to our friends in the visitors' gallery, who may have been surprised for a short while at the lack of interpretation, that it was because Mrs de BrÃºn was speaking in Irish, which is not yet an official working language of Parliament, but which will be as from 1 January.
author. - Mr President, Commissioner, it is very sad and shameful to contemplate the fact that, in the vast majority of cases, those who commit despicable and atrocious crimes against humanity, including genocide, remain unpunished.
In fact, most of these callous murderers of largely innocent, defenceless civilians never face justice.
It is even more shameful that in reality many such vicious sub-human criminals not only escape the arm of the law, but enjoy a high standard of living and important political status.
Numerous examples of this disgraceful state of affairs can be found all over the world, throughout history and across most political systems and ideologies, which only goes to prove that, in reality, true administration of justice is a summer night's dream and a fallacy.
We all know it applies to our world, but most of us are too afraid to admit it publicly.
The situation in Guatemala's recent history fully bears out what I have just said.
In the period from 1960 to 1996, more than 200 000 people were murdered in state-sponsored violence orchestrated by a notorious army general turned dictator, EfraÃ­n Rios Montt, and assisted by a string of infamous top officials and high-ranking military officers.
None of these characters was ever punished.
Rios Montt remains in politics today as the leader of the Guatemalan Republican Front, one of the nation's most powerful political parties.
He served as President of the National Congress as recently as two years ago.
We should of course note that Rios Montt was trained by the United States, and his rise to power was accomplished through CIA involvement and with the full political backing and financial assistance of successive US governments.
Honestly, how pathetic can US foreign policy be?
Sometimes one wonders.
Has the US State Department not had any straight-thinking, sensible people with average IQ working in it over the last few decades?
I urge you to support this resolution, which aims at supporting the present attempts by the Guatemalan authorities to bring to justice Rios Montt, as well as a number of other despicable criminals.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the armed conflict in Guatemala lasted for decades, and that period saw terrible crimes committed against humanity, with 200 000 people being murdered, 45 000 taken away from their homes, and some indigenous communities wiped out altogether.
The peace agreement will be ten years old in December this year.
The Global Agreement on Human Rights has still not yet been put into effect in Guatemala, and the victims of the genocide have received no compensation, whether material or symbolic.
The warrant issued by the Spanish Supreme Court in July 2006 for the arrest of Efrain Rios Montt is a sign of hope that the culprits will no longer be allowed to get away unpunished.

We call on the Guatemalan authorities to cooperate unconditionally; they must do everything in their power to investigate crimes against humanity, and the country's ex-dictator and the other seven accused must be arrested and handed over.
Mr President, as Guatemala is preparing to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signature of the peace accords that put an end to 36 years of civil war, the Commission shares the opinion that everything possible should be done to bring justice to those having suffered human rights violations during the darkest hours of the conflict.
In that respect, the Commission takes note of the legal proceedings instituted against former military and political officials for their alleged role at that time.
The Commission once again calls upon all parties to wholeheartedly support the quest for truth and justice and to fight impunity where it prevails.
The Commission welcomes the willingness of the present government, albeit timid, to recognise the state's responsibility for past violations of human rights and to secure compensation for victims.
It furthermore acknowledges the country's commitment to consolidate the implementation of the peace accords, as confirmed by the Congress in August 2005 with a vote on a framework law establishing procedures and mechanisms to secure the effective attainment of the objectives set ten years ago.
Finally, the Commission praises the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman and welcomes the establishment in July 2005 of an Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Sadly, however, the country continues to be marred by the impunity characterising not just past but also present crimes.
This affects all citizens, including human rights defenders who are notably involved in assisting civil war victims.
The government agrees that this situation is not acceptable, but still has to take decisive action to reinforce the rule of law.
A European programme is currently offering support to the judiciary, but more public funds and structural reforms will be required if lasting improvements are to be made.
The Commission is also eagerly awaiting the establishment of a 'Commission of Investigation into Armed Groups and Clandestine Security Apparatus'.
We hope the Guatemalan Congress will provide the necessary support for this, as well as for the pending ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
The Commission believes the European Union should pursue dialogue with Guatemala on key issues relating to the implementation of the peace accords, particularly as the country gears up for the general elections scheduled for the end of 2007.
The Constitutional Court has, by the way, recently declared General Rios Montt ineligible for those elections following the coup he led in 1982.
The issue of impunity for past and present crimes should be central in this context.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at the end of the debates.

Uzbekistan
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uzbekistan.
author. - (PL) Mr President, much has been said in this House concerning the situation in Uzbekistan.
The situation is not improving at all.
In fact, we are witnessing increasing repression.
The latest Human Right Watch report, published on 3 October 2006, describes the situation in detail.
Nobody has yet been called to account for the massacre in Andijan, criticism is still being silenced, and freedom of religion infringed.
There is still no cooperation with international institutions with respect to human rights and fundamental rights.
Two journalists, Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov, disappeared in Uzbekistan in September.
Both men were well known for their independence and for their criticism of the regime.
Eventually, Mr Karimov was found in a psychiatric hospital, and Mr Khaidarov in a prison.
At the same time, the European Parliament's strategy should be directed towards assisting Uzbekistan's return to the community of democratic countries intent on reforming themselves.
We must not take any action that could interfere with that course of events.
author. - Mr President, unusually for us, sanctions are currently in place against Uzbekistan.
Sanctions should be used sparingly and only as a last resort, but we in this House should not be afraid to call for them and indeed to see them implemented, as they are the only real weapon for encouraging internal change within that country.
It is important for the EU to speak with one voice and this motion for a resolution seeks to do just that.
First, we need to agree on a reality check.
In recital C we note the fact that: 'the Government of Uzbekistan has not addressed the conditions the Council set out when sanctions were applied'.
So any moves to lift the sanctions currently in place would be counter-intuitive and bizarre.
It would be a bizarre incentive or reward for, in effect, ignoring us.
And yet, as we say in recital B, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is expected to consider on 13 November whether it will extend the sanctions adopted last year.
We understand there are genuine moves afoot to lift the sanctions.
My group disagrees with that and we hope the House will follow us.
We believe that the sanctions should be extended and widened, particularly in the light of Uzbekistan's continued refusal to allow an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan.
We would like to see provision in paragraph 2 for the sanctions to be extended, with a targeted visa ban on specific key individuals.
That will underline our growing frustration at the lack of progress without any detriment to the Uzbek people themselves.
It is important that we keep up the pressure.
We hope that the House will not lose its nerve.
While I have no doubt that the Commissioner shares our concerns, we hope that she will match our commitment.
author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that this House, rather than averting its eyes from violations of human rights anywhere in the world, should take action in response to them, and the dreadful things that happened in Andijan in Uzbekistan in May 2005 were another case in point; we are a democratic institution and, as such, must not allow human rights to be trampled underfoot anywhere in the world.
Nor, too, however, must we allow cooperation between this House and other parliaments to put diplomatic relations at risk.
When considering the present state of affairs in Uzbekistan, what has gone on there in the past must also be taken into account, and it is on that alone that this resolution must be founded.
Last month, the delegation for relations with the countries of Central Asia - of which I am a member - planned to travel to Uzbekistan.
That nothing came of this plan was not down to any lack of cooperation on the part of the Uzbek authorities, but rather to the lack of interest in any such trip on the part of sufficient Members of this House.
One consequence of this is that we have not been able to form our own impressions of the current state of play in Uzbekistan as regards human rights, democratisation and the establishment of an independent judiciary, and we have been obliged, instead, to rely on information from third parties.

Do not misunderstand me: I, too, take the view that human rights and attempts at democratisation often suffer repression in Uzbekistan, and that serious thought must therefore be given to keeping sanctions in place, particularly the embargo on weaponry, but I do not think that extending the sanctions to include such things as the denial of an EU visa to the President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, would do anything to get us closer to what we want.
To do such things would amount to breaking off diplomatic relations, and that cannot be what we have in mind.
Nothing happening at the present time would justify such a forceful political response, and so I must ask you, as a matter of the greatest urgency, to endorse the amendment I have tabled and vote for its adoption.
Should I fail in this attempt at a compromise, I will end up having to vote against the resolution.
author. - (DE) Mr President, 'Reporters without borders', in their report, now rank Uzbekistan at number 158 - interestingly enough, below such countries as Belarus and Russia.
The state of human rights in Uzbekistan has been a frequent topic of debate in this House, particularly after what happened in Andijan.
The really hot question now is 'what will the European Union's response be?'
We have said that, if there are to be sanctions, they have to apply especially to the movement of weapons and troops.
It is vitally important that the German military base, at Termes in Uzbekistan, should be closed down, for, if sanctions are not actually to be complied with, a major exception must be made, and so it is for that reason that we see this as the litmus test for our human rights policy, not least here in this House.
It is for that reason that we have tabled this amendment to the effect that the German military base in Termes must be closed down.
The base is used by all NATO Member States, not least by those that are also Member States of the EU, and must therefore be closed down.
author. - Mr President, Uzbekistan is an authoritarian republic, previously part of the Soviet Union, which, while struggling for economic and political stability, has been fiercely violating the human rights of its citizens.
The memory of the Andijan massacre in May 2005 is very much alive in our minds today, especially since the numerous requests by the UN, the EU and others for an independent investigation appear to have fallen on deaf ears.
Furthermore, despite some recent attempts to improve the human rights situation in the country, the situation relating to civil liberties is still profoundly anachronistic.
According to credible NGO human rights watchdogs, such as Amnesty International, the most disturbing human rights violations concern torture, arbitrary arrests and restriction of religious freedom and freedom of speech, with members of religious organisations, journalists, human rights activities and political activists, including members of the banned opposition parties, being the main targets.
Despite existing sanctions, the rate and extent of democratic reforms in the country is exceedingly low and distressingly limited.
Therefore, in this motion for a resolution we call on the Council not only to renew existing sanctions for a further year but also to expand the sanctions to include EU visa bans and the freezing of assets held in the EU by a number of top officials in the Uzbekistani Government.
We do this with regret, but we feel that we have been left with no other option than to be tough in order to be kind.
We very much hope and wish that the Uzbekistani Government will understand our resolve when it comes to issues of human rights and will quickly rectify the large democratic deficits still existing in its country.
author. - (PL) Mr President, little has changed in Uzbekistan since the last European Parliament resolution on the situation in that country and the republics of Central Asia.
The Government of Uzbekistan has still not agreed to an independent inquiry into the events that took place on 13 May 2005 in Andijan, where troops sent in by President Karimov crushed a popular uprising.
Several hundred people died in that bloodbath, which the government referred to as a terrorist rebellion.
Most independent journalists and human rights defenders are being intimidated by the security services and some have been exiled from the country.
The recent disappearance of Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov has caused great concern about the future development of Uzbekistan.
Mr Karimov and Mr Khaidarov are said to be the last remaining journalists in the country who have dared to write critically about the government and its leader for the last 17 years.
When these two men were located a few days later, one had received a prison sentence for blackmail, and the other had been committed to a psychiatric hospital.
Civil society in Uzbekistan is demanding a more open society, where personal freedoms and human rights are respected.
The people of Uzbekistan would also like to see real progress along the road to democracy.
The war on terror must be fought without infringing international conventions.
It must never serve as a pretext for annihilating the political opposition, riding roughshod over human rights or restricting civil liberties.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, 15 years after the fall of the empire of evil, which is what the Soviet Union most definitely was, the situation has become fairly clear.
Only those former Soviet republics which decided to build a future according to the democratic Western model can guarantee that they will create a civil society on their territory and respect human rights.
By contrast, those countries that sought shelter under Moscow's protective wings and where governments headed by former Communist leaders remain in power, are giving us cause for alarm and great concern.
However, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we tend to discuss individual cases.
Today, we are specifically discussing one of the many tragedies that have taken place in Uzbekistan.
It is surely time, indeed high time, to draw attention to the fact that the only reason why such events are taking place is because these regimes can count on Moscow's assent.
They are protected by the Russian leadership and are therefore able to act in this way rather than any other.
It really is high time we said no to all of this.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Even in a region trampled on by autocratic dictatorships, the Andijan massacre has managed to put Karimov's Uzbekistan out on its own.
The government says that 169 people died, whereas the opposition puts the figure at 745.
Regardless of the numbers involved, those responsible needed to be identified and brought to justice.
The EU has done this, albeit only partially and half a year late.
In November, the Council adopted an arms embargo and other restrictive sanctions.
A year on, and how have matters developed?
The repression has worsened, with the work of the NGOs and the journalists having been stifled.
In March, the High Commissioner for Refugees was expelled from the country and, worse still, between November and July, in an act of rare hypocrisy, over 250 people were summarily convicted for causing the May massacre, in a series of grotesque, media-circus trials.
All of this demonstrates that it is not only vital that we extend the existing sanctions for a further 12 months, but also that we deepen them by freezing financial transactions and European visas for the main Tashkent torturers, and broaden them to include the ringleader, President Karimov.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly right and necessary to monitor the implementation of human rights, whether one is talking about Tibet, Guatemala or Uzbekistan, because these are inalienable rights in the era of globalisation.
In view of the discussions and initiatives promoted and taken forward by the European Parliament, however, I believe that this body would prefer to deal with human rights violations and related problems anywhere in the world except in the territory of the EU itself.
This leaves us completely indifferent, for example, to the appalling situation of the so-called Russian non-citizens in Latvia, child labour and child prostitution in some Member States, the terrible state of the media and the criminalisation and persecution of the Left in the Czech Republic, and the unparalleled growth of poverty and far-right extremism in Germany.
All the more reason, perhaps, to tackle Uzbekistan and Tibet, or perhaps Belarus and China and the like.
I would venture to say, however, that the conservative majority is deliberately and cleverly turning Parliament into a kind of tame guard dog that is happy to remain on its own side of the fence and bark at the neighbours.
We should always focus primarily on the problems affecting the EU Member States.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, firstly, I have to say that I was completely appalled by the statement the representative of the far Left in the European Parliament has just made.
The situation in Uzbekistan simply cannot be compared to the situation in any European country.
A great many countries certainly do experience problems, but to draw a comparison with the situation in Uzbekistan, where people are dying and being persecuted for their political views, is quite outrageous.
I am saddened to discover that, when it comes to discussing issues such as the defence of human rights, there are individuals in this House who break the consensus on the defence and promotion of fundamental European values such as human rights, democracy and freedom of expression.
The consensus ought to prevail from the Left to the Right of the House.
I shall support the resolution in which we call for an extension of the sanctions against the regime in Uzbekistan, as the European Union is more than a political body bound together by common economic interests.
I firmly believe in the European Union as a community of values and, as such, the Union must set an unequivocal example by condemning all infringements of human rights, regardless of where they take place.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, exactly a year ago we were also debating the situation in Uzbekistan, in the wake of the bloody suppression of a demonstration against President Karimov's totalitarian regime and its infringement of human rights.
Uzbekistan's independence is also constantly compromised by the bitter struggle for influence between the great powers.
In spite of the sanctions imposed, and despite successive Parliament resolutions, human rights defenders continue to be imprisoned and tortured in Uzbekistan.
So too are witnesses to the truth, and we all know that truth cannot be suppressed by decisions, laws or prison sentences of any sort.
The heavy hand of the regime is felt not only by representatives of the opposition but also by the whole nation, as it struggles for independence and democratic change.
Women are particularly affected.
Although they have been granted the right to divorce within the framework of equal opportunities, they very often have to deal with everyday problems on their own, having to provide for their children and families single-handedly.
We obviously call for respect for human rights and support for the resolution.
(PL) Mr President, a single minute is simply not enough time to discuss infringements of human rights in Uzbekistan.
We can only draw attention to the fact that an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan 18 months ago has yet to take place.
These events led the authorities in Tashkent to declare war on independent reporters and defenders of human rights.
According to the UN, torture is still being used in Uzbekistan.
It is true that Islamic extremism is gathering strength in Uzbekistan, but this cannot be used as an excuse for violating human rights.
Uzbekistan plays a leading role in Central Asia, which is all the more reason for demanding that it respects the rules for democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.
Several thousand kilometres away from Uzbekistan lies a similar country, which is also unceremoniously violating human rights.
This country is Belarus.
Visa sanctions have been imposed on both Uzbekistan and Belarus.
Extending these sanctions seems to be a sensible decision and deserves our support.
Perhaps this so-called visa blackmail will enable Uzbekistan to understand what European standards are all about.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, my being here at all is something I owe to the Uzbek people, for my grandfather - an Austrian soldier in the First World War - was captured by the Russians and it was only thanks to Uzbek hospitality that he survived the cold winter around Tashkent.
While we all, I believe, have deep sympathy for the Uzbek people, it is for precisely that reason that we condemn the suppression of human rights there and lament the fact that a regime is in power there that does not in the least meet our standards where human rights are concerned.
I would like to see a quite forthright denunciation of these violations of human rights, and I also want to see the sanctions extended.
However, I regard additional bans on entry of the kind called for in paragraph 2 as worthless.
I do not believe we can sort out problems by grovelling to Mr Putin at one summit and perhaps inviting the Chinese President to the next one, while taking it out on the mini-Putins and tinpot tyrants, and so I recommend that we adopt reasonable standards.
Extend the sanctions?
I say 'yes' to that.
Denounce human rights violations?
'Yes' to that too.
But as for spending part of Thursday afternoon imposing travel bans on every Head of State you can think of, well, that, I have to say, I regard as demagogy rather than credible policy-making.
(DE) Mr President, it is a matter of common knowledge that, on Thursday afternoons, we impose absolutely nothing.
All this House does in response to the various human rights issues around the world is to make demands of one sort or another.
By means of this resolution today, we are demanding of the Council that it extend the policy of sanctions and broaden it to include certain areas that have already been discussed.
The Government of Uzbekistan still refuses to allow an independent investigation of the deaths in Andijan of the kind repeatedly demanded in the past by several international institutions and still called for by them now.
What Uzbekistan should be doing is working towards that sort of independent investigation, together with the OSCE and the UN.
The EU's relations with Uzbekistan are a matter of great importance to us, but they must be founded on respect for democracy, for the rule of law and for human rights.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, although one and a half years have passed, the mass killings at Andijan on 13 May 2005 remain fresh in all our memories.
The Uzbek authorities have rejected international demands for an independent enquiry and no credible investigation of the killings has taken place.
The trials of those persons who took part in the demonstrations that led to the killings have been condemned by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights as patently unfair.
Subsequent developments also give little ground for optimism.
Torture is reported to remain widespread.
No international body has been able to obtain access to refugees returned to Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan refuses to cooperate with United Nations Special Procedures.
Civil society and human rights defenders are subject to constant harassment.
Indeed, many human rights defenders have been imprisoned.
The Commission has noted with particular concern that several prominent human rights activists have been sentenced to several years' imprisonment, while Mukhtabar Todjibaeva remains in detention.
We are aware of many similar cases.
Despite this bleak picture, nothing is to be gained by cutting off all channels of communication with Uzbekistan.
As Honourable Members are aware, in response to the Andijan killings, the European Union adopted sanctions against Uzbekistan, namely as mentioned here earlier, an arms embargo, a travel ban for those individuals responsible for the Andijan killings and the suspension of technical meetings with Uzbekistan.
A decision whether to prolong or extend the scope of these sanctions must be taken by 14 November.
In order to enable Member States to obtain a full and comprehensive picture of the situation in Uzbekistan, a Cooperation Council will be held with Uzbekistan at the beginning of November.
Moreover, this Cooperation Council will provide an opportunity for the European Union to raise directly with the Uzbek authorities, at ministerial level, our many concerns on Andijan and its aftermath.
In the light of this Cooperation Council, the Member States will take their decision on the possible prolongation or extension of the sanctions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at the end of the debates, that is to say in a moment.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law

Tibet (vote)

Case against Rios Montt (vote)
3.
Uzbekistan (vote)
- Before the vote on paragraph 2
Mr President, in my oral amendment, I suggest deleting the first part of paragraph 2 of the joint resolution on Uzbekistan.
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?
(DE) Mr President, I beg your leave to point out that we have, in fact, tabled an amendment to paragraph 2, so it needs to be voted on before the original is, even though the original has been the subject of an oral amendment.
We first need to vote on the amendment that would replace the former wording.
Mr Posselt, I think you are right.
We will ask Mr Pinior to make the necessary clarifications.
Mr President, I suggest we delete the first part of the second point.
As I understand it, it was proposed by members of the PPE-DE Group.
This, then, is an oral amendment to paragraph 2, aiming to shorten the text.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 1
(DE) Mr President, I would like to replace 'sound and future-oriented decision' by 'considered decision with a view to improved future relations'.
That is a more specific way of putting it.
Mr President, I object to that oral amendment because it takes away the sting in our resolution.
We have tangible evidence that the sanctions are slowly working, so we need to expand them further and not weaken them further, as Mrs Jeggle's amendment seeks to achieve.
We are grateful for your comments, Mr Matsakis, but you will have to find 36 other Members to join you to make a total of 37 to oppose this amendment.
However strong your arguments are, I cannot reject the oral amendment if plenary does not oppose it, and I cannot see any other Members standing up.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
That concludes voting time.
(ES) Mr President, I was in my office when I was made to leave by officials of this Parliament who told me that there was a fire drill.
When I came in, I found that the vote had already been taken on the Resolution on Tibet and on another one, and I would now like to inform the Secretariat of the way I would have voted in the votes I was unable to participate in because the services made me leave my office and I was unable to come down to the Chamber.
Do not worry, the services will take all of that into account.

Membership of Parliament
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to make an observation to be included in the Minutes.
Since the decisions of the Italian authorities in relation to changing the representatives of Members elected in Italy refer to the 2004 elections, I do not believe it is appropriate for it all to take effect from 8 November.
It is likely that the change should be backdated and I believe that this should be examined by the competent committee of this House.
We take note of your observation.
I do not know what its legal implications are, but the Secretariat will look into it and, if necessary, pass it on to the most appropriate committee to examine how well-founded your observation is.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 9 November 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed.
Monday:
I have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to postpone the debate on the report by Mrs Bachelot-Narquin on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
Who would like to move this request on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?
(FR) Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests that the debate and the vote on Mrs Bachelot's report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be postponed.
In fact, because COREPER and the Finnish Presidency only finalised their version of the regulation on Friday 10 November, the document did not reach us until the end of the afternoon.
As a result, although we worked with the rapporteur all last week in informal meetings with the Council and the Commission, we were not able to have an initial discussion amongst ourselves between Friday evening and today.
We therefore ask that both the debate and the votes be postponed to the second November session in order to enable us to carry out our examination of the proposals made to us by the Council.
Mr President, I also take the floor with the agreement of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support the position of my fellow Member, Mr Cottigny, and to request that the vote and the debate be postponed.
In fact, as my fellow Member has just said, the latest information concerning the Council's positions reached us only a few hours ago.
Our discussions thus far indicate that the positions of the Council and Parliament, expressed by the two competent committees, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, have come much closer together.
It is not guaranteed, but on this basis we could perhaps reach an agreement at first reading, which would enable us to make this fund operational from the beginning of next year, as hoped for, I believe, by almost all the Members of this House.
That is why I support Mr Cottigny's position.
(Parliament accepted the proposal)
(The order of business was adopted)
Mr President, the proposed Constitution was approved by 500 votes to 137, and confirmed by 382 to 125 votes; so the opponents now have one in four votes in this House, but when we are represented at meetings abroad with the national parliaments, it is only 1 to 14.
The 'no' side was not allowed to be present at Berlin, London or Paris.
Parliament has now sent a total of 58 representatives, 54 from the 'yes' side, only 4 from the 'no' side.
In 7 of the 11 meetings the 'no' side was not present.
Last Thursday the Conference of Presidents approved this discrimination against those of us who oppose the Constitution.
That is a very good example of how badly our D'Hondt system works in relation to minorities in the big groups.
Some of us have established a Fair Chair reform programme.
We call for a Fair Chair instead of a coronation, and fair representation instead of discrimination against small groups and minorities.
We will present our platform at a press conference tomorrow at 2 p.m. in the press room.
Mr President, you are welcome to come.
Mr Bonde, as you are aware, the Conference of Presidents has already taken your position into consideration and has confirmed that the composition of each committee's delegations is the responsibility of the committee members, and therefore it is the committee that must decide on what representation is appropriate.
You made your speech today - and all Members need to be aware of this - after the Conference of Presidents had already examined your concern and reached a decision on it.
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
(HU) Mr President, while we were gathered here on Monday for our last plenary session, events were taking place in Budapest that merit the attention of all Europe.
That is, the 50th anniversary of the 1956 uprising was being celebrated in Hungary.
That celebration, however, took quite an odd turn because the people were not allowed to participate.
One of the high-ranking guests present, an Italian deputy prime minister, said that these celebrations left the people out.
Meanwhile the people on the street who wanted to celebrate peacefully were brutally attacked and beaten up.
The police caused serious injuries by shooting rubber bullets at head level, and they pushed people off the streets.
Peaceable passers-by, who wanted to celebrate 1956 peacefully, were not allowed to do so.
What a shame, what a shame this was in the middle of Europe.
I call upon everyone who strives for human and civic liberties not to support this policy.
(FR) Mr President, I would take the liberty of speaking once again on the subject of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor.
They are still in Tripoli, in the prisons of the Libyan State.
You know, as I do, that they are imprisoned under false accusations.
The review of their trial was supposed to conclude at the end of October.
However, in October, the court again postponed its decision, this time until 19 December.
The court says that it is beginning to take into consideration the opinion of international experts, who tirelessly bring evidence of the innocence of the accused.
Mr President, could we not demonstrate again the great interest that we take in the fate of these prisoners who have been tortured and have been absent from their homes for eight years for having treated young Libyans?
This situation cannot be tolerated, as, month after month, they are promised a trial.
This new trial, the third, is inequitable and unjust and leaves them in the throes of a death sentence.
(HU) Mr President, it is sad enough that the countries of Europe are witnessing ever more frequent acts of violence and destruction, events that signal turmoil and inner tensions.
Stones being hurled, cars set on fire elicit a forceful response from the police forces, and these events show up on the newspaper headlines and television screens.
All this causes damage to Europe, to the protesters, to the forces of law and order, in a word: to democracy.
It is even more detrimental, however, when certain politicians, certain political parties feel justified in pronouncing judgment prior to the inquiry undertaken by the appointed independent judicial body.
The Hungarian socialist delegation read with profound shock the statement by the President of the European People's Party about the events surrounding the 50th anniversary.
What JÃ³zsef SzÃ¡jer said does not surprise us.
The grave allegations by the European People's Party made prior to the conclusion of the inquiry are to be qualified as prejudicial, and as such, on behalf of the Hungarian socialist delegation, we reject them most emphatically.
- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been sixteen years since Lithuania regained its independence from the Soviet Union.
The same time has passed since Lithuania failed to get back its embassy building in Rome, known as Villa Lituania, which was owned by Lithuania until 1937.
Today, the Russian flag continues to fly on this building.
After Russia occupied and annexed Lithuania in 1940, the then Lithuanian ambassador Stasys Lozoraitis presented a note to the Italian Government emphasising the illegitimate nature of the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union and the fact that Lithuanian diplomatic missions in foreign countries should not change their status.
Despite this, Soviet officials occupied Villa Lituania in the presence of the representatives of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the police.
After the restoration of Lithuania's independence, Italy avoided any responsibility and suggested negotiating with Russia concerning the building.
Even though the Italian Government appears to have changed its position now, this matter remains unresolved.
Why would the Italian Government make no attempt to reconsider its past history?
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the reassuring messages and replies from the Central European Bank and the Commission on the cases of forgery of the euro, this phenomenon continues to preoccupy the administrative authorities and Europol.
Just last week we had two particularly worrying cases.
The first concerns the gang of Colombian counterfeiters brought down.
A total of EUR 6 million was seized in forged 50 and 100 euro notes destined for Spain and other countries of the European Union.
The same week in Germany, hundreds of thousands of 5 and 20 euro notes were dissolved in water, with the result that the German authorities were questioned as to the causes, while the citizens of this country hanker after the strong and independent Deutschmark.
What is going on with the euro?
How secure are citizens when they themselves are at risk - even though victims - of being referred for investigation, as we have seen in several countries, on suspicion of counterfeiting or moving forged notes?
How long will the Central European Bank turn a blind eye?
Or is it only interested in when interest rates will rise again and start throttling consumers?
Mr President, I rise to ask you and others in this House to use their best offices to intervene in the case of ten Iranian Ahwazi Arab rights activists who, according to the Iranian media, face the death penalty this week.
The men stand accused of bombing oil installations, but the evidence is unconvincing.
All ten men made confessions under torture.
According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch none of them had a fair trial.
Their lawyers were not allowed to see them before their trial and were only briefed on the prosecution case a few hours before the start of court proceedings, which were held in secret.
The lawyers for the condemned men have themselves been arrested for complaining about the illegal and unjust nature of these trials, and have been charged with threatening national security.
I therefore hope that many Members will make contact with the Iranian authorities to make clear their views on these tragic cases.
(PL) Mr President, one week has passed since the introduction of new baggage restrictions on airline passengers.
However, I am still constantly asked what the matter is, if just days after Great Britain has eased these restrictions they have been implemented Europe-wide?
I still have not received an explanation for this situation even though I am a representative of the Committee for Transport and Tourism.
Another issue is the lack of clarity over the new regulations, which are totally confusing to passengers.
It appears that they have a different interpretation in just about every airport.
At WrocÅaw Airport, for example, which is the one I use, I was told to throw away a stick deodorant, even though it was not in liquid form, as a penalty for not having declared it.
In such a simple matter, would it not be possible to harmonise these rules so that they are interpreted in a uniform way, and that it is not up to the goodwill or otherwise of individual officials?
I hope to receive a reply to these questions.
(HU) Mr President, in 1989-90 Hungary created the foundations for democracy and the rule of law without any violence.
Now, 16 years later, the spirit of coercion has nevertheless been unleashed, because the current government unfortunately saw fit to use intimidation in order to attain its goals, thereby suppressing democratic opposition.
The use of force is to be condemned, let there be no mistake.
Rioting by violent groups is unacceptable, but even in problematic situations respect for the tools of the rule of law is indispensable.
Defenders of Hungarian democracy must seize every legal means to ensure that the violent events of 23 October will never be repeated, when the police violently broke up the crowds and failed to observe the most basic demands of human rights, precisely when people were commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
We Hungarians believe in democratic freedom, which we have struggled so hard to achieve, and wish to make use of our human rights.
Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of incitement to racial and religious hatred in Europe.
Over the past two weeks in the United Kingdom we have had two trials.
One concerned a young Muslim who, during a demonstration regarding, I believe, the infamous Danish cartoons, called for the beheading of those who insult Islam.
He was rightly convicted and imprisoned.
Yet, in contrast, Nick Griffin, the leader of Britain's neo-fascist British National Party, who was caught by the BBC declaring Islam a vile and wicked religion, was found not guilty of the same.
I would ask that the relevant Commissioner considers whether or not at European level we need new and stronger legislation in this area.
This is not an issue of freedom of speech, but freedom from fear.
Comments like those of the BNP leader put the Muslim and minority communities at risk.
The evidence is that, when BNP councillors are elected, racist violence in the relevant area doubles or triples, leading to problems for the whole area.
Mr President, I rise to ask for your support for efforts at EU level to counter discrimination in the workplace, and in particular for the EU-funded 'Work It Out' Programme, which is a project that produces tools to help people with intellectual disabilities, those who support them and European legal experts in this area.
This programme provides information on the framework Employment Directive, which seeks to combat discrimination and unequal treatment at work.
That directive has recently been transposed by Member States and provides vital protection to people with intellectual disabilities who face discrimination at work.
Mr President, I would ask you to ensure that the definition of 'worker' in this directive includes people in sheltered employment.
We must be watchful and ensure that the directive is being implemented correctly in each Member State.
Intellectual disability covers a large range of people with very different capabilities: some people with intellectual disabilities work and live independently in the community, while others have complex or profound needs and require constant support.
However, it is important not to make assumptions about what intellectual disability means, since with appropriate support and preparation many people with intellectual disabilities can be a valuable part of the workforce.
Mr President, I would ask that you devote personal attention to this matter.
(ES) Mr President, to begin with, I should like to thank you in your own language for what you said to President Putin, that we will not trade human rights for energy.
(PL) I would also like to see the ban imposed by Russia on the import of meat from Poland discussed at this meeting.
Russia's accusations are groundless, and the matter has become too long and drawn-out.
I believe that it is not just a matter between Poland and Russia, but between Russia and the entire European Union.
I would like this house to put some pressure on the European Commission to take steps to resolve this abnormal situation.
(FR) Mr President, an unprecedented power cut hit Western Europe on the night of 4/5 November.
It revealed the fragility of the European energy system and the inadequate capacity for producing and transporting electricity, the result of a poor investment policy.
Despite the risk of blackouts, for the last six years European operators have been reducing the level of their investments, which has fallen from 16% to 10% of their turnover.
At the same time, electricity consumption has continued to rise by 1.8% per year.
This fall in investments is the direct consequence of liberalising the energy market.
Rather than investing in the development of new production capacity, operators are concentrating their efforts on profits and on buying out their competitors.
On the one hand, the public has seen electricity prices soar while, on the other hand, security has decreased.
Only a European energy policy could guarantee successful cooperation between Member States and the implementation of necessary investments to the tune of EUR 700 billion between now and 2030.
Electricity is a public good: this should be reflected in the European Union's political initiatives.
(PL) Mr President, despite numerous interventions, discussions and measures by Poland to comply with Russia's conditions, Russia continues to maintain its embargo on Polish foodstuffs, including meat.
Poland has not, and will not be able to resolve this situation until the European Union applies equal market protection rules for all Member States.
It is intolerable that Poland should be facing problems selling its products both on the external market and on the internal European market due to the impact of goods from third countries being dumped on its market.
Poland, like the other Member States, cannot deal with Russia on her own.
The partner that Russia should be dealing with is the European Union as a whole.
For this reason I am raising the fundamental question of whether at the European Union-Russia summit planned for 24 November this year, Poland's problems will be treated as problems which affect the European Union as a whole.
This is certainly an important issue.
I cannot give you an answer because, as you know, we have not been invited to take part in this summit, but I am sure that both the Commission and the Council will bear Poland's problems in mind when dealing with EU-Russian relations.
(PL) Mr President, I would also like to raise the matter of the European Commission's hand luggage regulations.
I do not know whether the President and the Commission are aware of the fact that the food and cosmetics industry is unable to keep up with these regulations, and the majority of cosmetics do not come in 100 ml packaging.
This means that shampoos, lotions and other cosmetics in liquid form have to be poured down the sink and the remainder poured into 100 ml containers because 200 ml containers are not allowed on board the aircraft.
Of course, you can have your baggage checked in, although 5 million pieces of baggage go missing each year worldwide.
Often total chaos and confusion prevails at airports, and the officials responsible are unable to cope.
So it appears that the terrorists are one step ahead of us again, and have got us in a corner.
The way things are going, it will not be long before they have us all flying in strait-jackets and disposable hospital slippers.
(PL) Mr President, 'JEREMY', a joint and extremely valuable initiative of DG REGI and the European Investment Bank for 2007- 2013, is currently being negotiated with individual Member States. The aim of the initiative is to facilitate access to European Regional Development Fund cash for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The aim of JEREMY is to help regional business start-ups and development through all kinds of non-grant based instruments such as microcredits or guarantees.
Unfortunately there is resistance on the part of some Member States - for the decision depends on them - to re-allocating part of their structural funds towards this new initiative.
Some refuse outright to include them in their programmes, even though it is clear that they will be unable to utilise all of their funds and will have problems with uptake.
This means running the risk that JEREMY, a superb instrument capable of supporting business initiative in the regions, will remain unused.
We as the European Parliament have the obligation to encourage Member States to make use of the opportunities offered by JEREMY, because in addition to major investments from the structural funds, it is the development of small business and the generation of business activity that are the powerhouse of regional development, and therefore they deserve particular support.

(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this year, and for the tenth time, the Europa Centre in Graz organised a European youth meeting with participants drawn from all over Europe, devoted to the theme of 'European future objectives' and with the participants giving their attention to the future development of the European Union.
Following an information session on the European Union and its institutions, the participants - over sixty of them - moved to a role-play exercise in which they imagined themselves as representatives of these institutions and worked through a large number of items, producing a twenty-point resolution to the effect that, inter alia, the powers of the Union should be extended, that the budget should be topped up and that there should be no further enlargement before the treaty on a constitution for Europe has entered into force.
Young people are Europe's future, and we should be very strong advocates for their education and further education, for that, too, is where our future lies.
(EL) Mr President, one of the achievements of democracy is university asylum which, of course, does not develop in the same way in every country.
In Greece, suddenly, university asylum means the anarchists, the pockets of terrorism which we pursue hotly in this Chamber, are creating cells and using universities as sites to manufacture Molotov cocktails and attack shops and neighbours.
It is a terrible problem faced by my country, which is unable to find a solution.
It is unable to take them on and that is where the main problem lies.
Can we legislate uniformly in all the countries of Europe for equal respect for asylum, because this situation is spiralling out of control, and not just in Greece?
In other capitals of countries of Europe we have the same problem: the anarchists in asylum are a state within a state.
There should be respect for asylum, but this should not become cells, pockets of anarchy, of all those going around in hoods violating, extorting and plundering the life of the citizens.
Let us at long last legislate for the good of universities, for the good of students, and not for the good of the extremists or certain extremists fighting against the state.
(HU) Mr President, it might become one of the signs of discrimination against the new Member States if administrative costs for 2007 were to be reduced at their expense.
Paring down bureaucracy is a worthy aim, but it puts at risk the filling of eight hundred positions for the new Member States.
These civil servants ought already to have been hired in the first half of 2006.
I call upon the Commission to fulfil its obligations and to continue hiring new civil servants at the agreed pace.
I hope that the European Commission will not listen to the Fidesz party.
I would not wish to see the new Member States suffer from the smear campaign that party has launched, claiming that the new Member States do not deserve to be treated as equals because they are run by post-communists who trample human rights underfoot.
Whatever Kinga GÃ¡l and JÃ³zsef SzÃ¡jer may say in this Chamber, to my mind, it is the interview given today by Elmar Brok, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which holds true: Hungarian democracy and the rule of law are not in danger.
(HU) Mr President, a few days ago, as a result of an energy network breakdown, millions of Europeans were left without power, if only for an hour.
This blackout, unprecedented since the 1970's, has once again shed light on the fact that it is increasingly difficult to bring energy regulation, which is largely within national jurisdictions, into line with the demands of energy security in the 21st century.
At the same time, the dangers with regard to gas supply are becoming increasingly evident.
The conflict over gas prices that has been developing in recent weeks between Russia and Georgia makes it clear that Russia is prepared, in a completely overt fashion, to use its energy resources for political purposes.
This is the reason - one that is all the more frightening for the EU - why Russia, which plays a key role in our gas supply, does not wish to sign the European Energy Charter.
Having thus experienced our dependency on two occasions in recent days, our response can only be a common EU energy policy based on solidarity that speaks with one voice at the international level.
The Energy Green Paper currently being debated in Parliament should serve as a suitable starting point for formulating such a policy.
Mr President, a study carried out by the highly renowned Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical School in the USA in collaboration with the Baghdad Medical School, published last month in the internationally prestigious medical journal The Lancet, showed that approximately 655 000 civilians have died as a result of the violent hostilities in Iraq between March 2003 and July 2006.
Of these, many thousands have been children whose deaths were deemed by vicious criminal terrorists in Iraq and seemingly heartless politicians in Washington and London to be acceptable collateral damage.
Mr Bush's and Mr Blair's invasion and occupation of Iraq has turned into a bloodbath of innocent people, worse than during satanic Saddam's rule of terror.
We can no longer look on passively.
I call upon you to recommend to the Conference of Presidents an urgent debate on the carnage involving civilians in Iraq, in the hope that we might help convert the madness of war into the logic of peace.
Kyoto was and is a blueprint for sane and sensible environmental policies, by way of the reduction of damaging greenhouse gas emissions.
Unfortunately, the reasonable targets set and agreed by Member States have been, and continue to be, ignored in many cases.
In the case of Ireland, for example, we have a tradition of signing up to international agreements and protocols and then walking away from them.
The big offender, however, is the United States of America.
I welcome the results of the United States congressional elections.
The fact that the American people have turned their backs on George Bush because of Iraq may also be an indication that his stubborn refusal to embrace Kyoto is not shared by the vast majority of the American population.
Could it be that the tornadoes and the hurricanes and the natural disasters in the United States caused by global warming are a result of the reckless dependence on and usage of fossil fuels?
As a former British chief economist with the World Bank, Dr Nicholas Stern, put it very succinctly: good environmental practice does not simply make environmental sense, it also makes good economic sense.
Mr President, last week a group of Irish MEPs met in Brussels with a group of mercy sisters who are working very closely with poor and marginalised members of the asylum and refugee communities.
The stories we heard from those religious sisters were very alarming, especially as they came from a country that says it is civilised and treats people properly, though I dare say Ireland is not the only country not to treat refugee and asylum seekers correctly and humanely.
We intend, as a group, to pursue this issue within Ireland.
It would appear that the Dublin II Regulation - evaluation of which we currently await - is not working.
Very often we hear from people working in this area that the theory and the practice do not match.
We need to do something about that.
Of particular concern, however, is the phenomenon of children lost to the system.
Such children are in Ireland but nobody knows where exactly or who can account for them.
That is an appalling prospect in a Member State of the European Union.
We need to look very carefully at how we treat the poor and marginalised in our Community.
We need an independent evaluation of the process and a long-term solution to the issue of why those people should need our support.
(EL) Mr President, I think that developments in universities in connection with the basic issue of education are a cause for concern for millions of workers and students in the Member States.
We therefore need to be extremely careful when we refer to university asylum, which is a fundamental achievement of the student movement in our country.
The student uprising at the Polytechnic is - thirty-three years on - a shining example of the right of the peoples for democracy within universities and of the need for radical changes to be made at this level.
These opinions being voiced in the European Parliament on restricting these basic democratic freedoms are dangerous.
(PL) Mr President, I am shocked by the latest session of the diplomatic heads of the Member States, where the majority of foreign ministers asked for a European Union mandate to negotiate a new agreement between the EU and Russia before Russia lifts the trade restrictions it is imposing on Poland in the form of an embargo on Polish meat and agricultural produce.
In other words, instead of European solidarity, what we have is an agreement with Moscow made over Poland's head, leaving my country to fend for itself.
However,Warsaw is rightly demanding that the negotiating mandate include a ban on trade barriers in relations between Russia and individual EU Member states.
Instead of a few words of support from Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, relations between the European Union and Russia should be based on the slogan of the Three Musketeers, 'one for all and all for one'.
Failure to do this would make European solidarity nothing more than a meaningless phrase, and I say this forcefully in the country of the Three Musketeers.
(ES) Mr President, last week Volkswagen unfortunately announced job cuts at its European factories, which may affect the plants at Pamplona in Spain, Brussels in Belgium and Palmela in Portugal.
In Germany too, 20 000 of the 100 000 workers at the plant may be laid off.
That will mean the loss of one in five workers, and 2 400 jobs may go at the other plants.
If we add to that the problems that we have had with Opel and General Motors in Portugal, it is quite clear that we are facing a very serious problem, an industrial crisis that demands a response.
In my view, we can no longer put off establishing a framework agreement with the entire European car industry and a code of conduct with the multinational companies, basically so as to guarantee jobs.
I think the time has come for the Commission and Europe's institutions to take a very strong stand on this.
(EL) Mr President, the former leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, has been sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity, because he was found guilty of the death of 148 Shiites following an assassination attempt against him in 1982.
I believe that, as repulsive as the crime is, the death penalty is not a solution and is not in keeping with the European acquis.
However, I noted with regret that the British Foreign Secretary, Margaret Becket, expressed her satisfaction with this verdict and stated that those accused of crimes against the Iraqis should be brought to justice.
I therefore ask you, as the death penalty has been abolished in all the countries of the European Union - because it is an insult to human dignity and simply encourages violence, while doing absolutely nothing to prevent crime - how can a Member State of the Union welcome such a verdict?
How can the death penalty uphold the justice cited by Mrs Becket?
(PL) Mr President, the 16th October saw yet another German violation of Poland's territorial sovereignty.
On that day a German vessel was bound for the Polish port of ÅwinoujÅcie.
On entering Polish territorial waters she was boarded by Polish customs officials who discovered contraband alcohol.
When the vessel was a few metres from shore, she suddenly turned about and headed for the German side.
Despite orders from the harbourmaster for the vessel to remain in port, and despite being pursued and ordered to stop by two pursuit vessels of the Polish Border Guard, the Germen vessel left Polish waters with the Polish customs officials aboard.
They were then arrested in Germany on charges of unlawful activity.
The whole affair is an outrage!
I would also like to point out that in August the German Navy conducted manoeuvres in Polish waters without informing the Polish authorities, and causing problems to passenger ferries trying to get to Polish ports.
This is the latest German provocation which ignores the Polish-German border.
It is in breach of international law and jeopardises internal relations within the European Union.
I call upon German politicians to come to their senses and finally acknowledge their country's borders with their neighbours.
(PL) Mr President, we as MEPs have been receiving correspondence from individuals and organisations about the problem of the savage treatment of stray dogs in Romania.
The reason I draw attention to this is that in the European Union we have adopted certain standards: recently, when debating an action plan for animal protection, we accepted the principle that the protection and humane treatment of animals is a challenge for European culture and civilisation in the 21st century.
Romania is about to join the European Union in a few weeks' time and we cannot accept standards that are at odds with European standards.
It is an issue I would like to draw your attention to, and I ask the European Commission also to address this issue and to intervene appropriately.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to draw the Members' attention to the abuse of and negative references made to periods of history, especially the Middle Ages.
We often hear talk of 'mediaeval employment' which is, apparently, being imposed in the resolution on the directive on services or with the promotion of the revised directive on working times.
The Middle Ages were a long period in history during which the foundations were laid in Europe of its present form and work was carried out to combine the Greco-Roman civilisation with Christianity.
Of course, during the Middle Ages, employment relations were typified by an uninterrupted connection with the 'master', the employer, and the place of work, and were organised in the form of professional guilds, which were impenetrable regimes which safeguarded monopolies.
