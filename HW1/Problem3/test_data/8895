The summit is, therefore, an excellent opportunity for defining the strategic framework needed by the European Union to develop a foreign policy involving more balanced association and cooperation with the countries of that area.
Seen in that light, a common EU vision of South America is not just strategically important, it also needs to be encouraged at the political level.
The starting point for this common strategy and for EU policy on Latin America should be the principle of association, and it needs to enjoy the support of both sides.
Implementing this strategy involves adopting an overall approach so as to encourage relations between the various parties in a consistent and organised way.
This does not mean that the European Union should not encourage ever closer cooperation with the individual countries in that part of the American continent, especially given that some of them, such as Argentina and Venezuela, are for various reasons passing through a particularly difficult period.
In this context we think there are many advantages to bilateral partnerships between either the European Union or its Member States and various Latin American countries.
These bilateral cooperation arrangements are the precursor of the successful application of the common European strategy.
The objective of sharing prosperity by creating a free trade area by 2010 is very important and must not fail to take account of the differing weight of the various partners.
In the context of this bi-regional political dialogue, both the European Union and the countries of Latin America need to marshal their forces so as to identify specific initiatives and actions that will provide their relations with a strategic framework which is both authentic and well structured.
For example, we need to define a global plan for combating drug trafficking, and also to strengthen agreements on security, which have become increasingly urgent since the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
It is also essential to step up trade and to encourage investment in both regions, which implies support from private initiatives in the countries of Latin America as a key aspect of this mutual development strategy.
Lastly, we should not lose sight of the need to defend and strengthen human rights and to promote democracy in all the countries of the region, without exception.
I therefore support the proposal for a joint resolution whilst recognising that compromise texts like the one we are debating sometimes lack in clarity what they may gain in parliamentary support.
Mr President, one of my ancestors was the captain of a ship sailing between Scotland and Valparaiso, Chile.
Sadly, he drowned on one of those hazardous journeys.
So trade with Latin America is long established between my country and this great continent.
It therefore gave me great pleasure to attend the EU-Latin American Parliamentary Conference in the same city last April.
I am hopeful that Chile will shortly become the most recent signatory to a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with the EU, as Mexico - whose President Fox is visiting us here in this House today - did following the first summit meeting in Rio in 1999.
Recently, Latin America has been very much in the news.
We have had President Carter's reconciliation visit this week to Cuba, the sole remaining communist dictatorship; the farcical short-lived coup in Venezuela against the maverick President ChÃ¡vez; the sad economic meltdown that we now see in once prosperous Argentina; as well as the ongoing tragedy of Colombia, racked by guerrilla war, political assassinations and illegal drug trafficking.
Nevertheless, in spite of these problems, I retain a degree of optimism that Latin American countries will eventually realise that to reach western-style prosperity and security they will have to put aside their petty divisions - which are small compared to the linguistic and cultural differences that we face here in the EU - and unite in developing strong and stable functioning market economies, based on the Rule of Law, good governance, democracy and human rights.
Initially the EU will have to negotiate bilateral treaties, but I am convinced that in the longer run a Latin American free-trade area drawing on the lessons of the Mercosur and Andean Pact countries' experience will emerge over the next decade.
This will itself be subsumed eventually into the free trade area of the Americas, as agreed by the USA and the Latin American heads of state and government in Quebec last year.
It also established for the first time embryonic clauses on human rights and democracy to which all the states signed up except, shamefully, Venezuela.
I therefore welcome the second summit of the heads of state and government of Latin America, the Caribbean and the EU in Madrid on 17 May.
I wish it well in its challenging project of bringing about much closer cooperation between these two great regions of the world.
Mr President, I am not going to talk about the good news in relation to the Madrid Summit.
I agree with the words of many of my fellow Members, but I believe that one of our obligations is to point out the possible problems and as far in advance as possible.
There is good news about Mexico - today we are going to have the honour of receiving President Fox - about Chile and about other things.
But I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the poorest region of the American continent, that is, Central America.
From 1984, the European Union played a very positive role in the development of the peace processes in the region.
We are seeing political changes which have meant peace and the installation of democratic governments, but also a situation in which the difficulties of economic and social change are being combined with natural disasters and continuing inequality and poverty of staggering proportions.
I believe that the conclusion of a peace agreement should always be viewed as a starting point rather than a point of arrival.
And it would be a mistake to be content with the management of the past and not appreciate that there is a risk in the region, and in the whole of Latin America, of a lack of prospects which leads to the most disastrous thing in political and social terms, which is stagnation, not conflict, but a total lack of prospects, the development of stagnant situations.
This problem is particularly serious in Central America and I believe that the Union has an essential role to play in supporting the regional development of the area in the medium and long term.
To be absolutely frank, I believe there is increasing frustration in Central America in relation to the Madrid Summit, and I would ask the Council and the Commission to do everything possible to prevent this, or at least to alleviate it, by offering prospects for the immediate future.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten hit the nail on the head when he said that the danger of these Summits is that they might turn into talking shops.
We hope that the Summit will achieve real results, but I agree with Mr Salafranca that the presentation by the Commission of a budget in which the contribution to that region is reduced by EUR 30 million is not the best message to send at this point.
However, I would like to refer to another issue: the issue raised by Mrs Frassoni, who has asked us, on behalf of her group, not to include an amendment condemning terrorism.
I believe that this could prejudice the hostages of terrorists and that is a mistake from the methodological point of view.
We cannot become hostages to terrorism, because if we give in at this point, then we are actually inciting terrorists to kidnap our nationals and our representatives.
The Spanish police have just countered a terrorist operation which was apparently aimed at overshadowing the Madrid Summit.
I believe that this should reinforce our desire to combat terrorism both on this side of the Atlantic and on the other, and to cooperate with the democratic governments of Latin America in order to consolidate the democratic options.
Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the Commission's speech, which I believe was very correct.
I would like to state publicly that the Presidency of the Council has had invaluable assistance from the European Commission in relation to fulfilling our desire to give this Summit substance.
It is not my job to pass judgement on budgetary issues which, furthermore, I have no information about, but I can say that the Commission will take account of what the honourable Members have said, although this does not fall within the competence of the Commissioner responsible for external relations.
However, both this Commissioner and the Commissioner responsible for trade, Mr Lamy, have made a huge effort to give substance to this Summit, which - we all agree - must not merely be a talking shop.
The Commission, together with the Member States, has made a great contribution to this.
The panorama we are facing in relation to Latin America is surely one of the most difficult we have seen in recent years.
Following the so-called 'lost decade', everything seemed to indicate, during the 1990s, that the Latin American continent was moving forwards, that democratic systems were being consolidated and that great progress was being made in the social field, which is extremely important, because the great problems of Latin America stem from the huge differences between classes, with a very high percentage of people living in a dispossessed class and living without hope.
Just when we thought that, by means of our fora for dialogue - whether at sub-regional or at other levels - such as the Rio Group, the San JosÃ© dialogue, the Andean dialogue, Mercosur, etc., we were beginning to find a way to improve the region, it turns out that we are now facing a very serious situation.
The truly dramatic situation of Argentina has been mentioned.
There has also been mention of the situation of Venezuela, of Central America ? it is not just one country but a whole range of countries which are not in a position to progress, and - as Mr Obiols i GermÃ  said - they have practically been forgotten.
It appears that the rest of the international community has turned its attention entirely away from Central America.
These are the realities we must confront in a context in which the European Union is fully aware of its historical commitment to the other side of the Atlantic.
There is absolutely no doubt that transatlantic relations are an essential part of Union's foreign policy as a whole.
America as a whole, from Canada to the Magellan Strait, is a continent in which European culture, history and life have had a great influence. The result of this influence has been hybrid societies, differing societies, which are not European but whose value systems are based on everything they have inherited from centuries of our presence throughout that enormous continent.
The European Union's desire is to value the idiosyncrasies and independence of all those countries while at the same time strengthening all those purely European values which are still alive in those societies and which we are obliged to maintain through our policies.
We naturally have to do more than that and that is why we are so involved in the issue of economic development.
We also know, however, that solutions are always long-term, because there are regions, such as Central America or the Andean area, and even the most developed regions, the Southern Cone, which, because of their circumstances, will in reality be very seriously in debt over the coming years, with social consequences which may be extremely dangerous for the future of those countries.
I therefore believe that the examples that have been provided, such as the free trade agreement with Mexico and the one we are now going to sign with Chile, offer a means for fairer and more intense exchanges at the highest level.
The Union has only reached free trade agreements with one Latin American country, Mexico, and now it is going to sign one with another, Chile, but with the rest of world we have no free trade agreements.
This indicates that we must move towards a shared and fairer commercial system, but, at the same time we must not forget that, together with those two countries, which are the exceptions, there are other countries which have very serious problems, which are not going to be resolved purely by free trade agreements, since, as Mrs Frassoni said, trade is not everything, and we must also act on other levels.
This will enable us to take a clear initiative with regard to the policy of the United States which actually is restricted to a great free trade agreement, the FTAA, and offers nothing else.
The added value of our European culture and our historic link to that continent must be that "something more" that we must offer, firstly, through the elimination of differences in wealth and the creation of a more balanced and just society, and, above all, through the promotion of good governance, respect for the Rule of Law and respect for human rights.
These must be the messages and I believe that the Latin American countries are hearing them.
Mr Fox will hear them today - because today we are going to hold a meeting with him - and I believe that all the Heads of State and Government will also hear them within the framework of the dialogue with Europe.
Therefore, the Presidency takes good note of the fact that the European Parliament's sentiment is precisely that: we must go further than the commercial field, without ignoring it, in order to increase the quality of our relations with Latin America through dialogue between closely-related countries, because we share a culture, language, history and values - above all values - and because the values which have made European society what it is must also make Latin American society more prosperous, more egalitarian, more just and more protective of human rights.
It is in this spirit that the Presidency will approach the Summit and furthermore it now has the support of this Parliament in order to move in the direction we consider to be appropriate.
Thank you, President-in-Office.
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
Mr President, I rise to introduce my report on transatlantic relations.
It is a timely debate with the rapidly changing transatlantic relationship today.
As many will know, I have always been a strong supporter of closer transatlantic relations.
It is logical, in an area of globalisation, for Europe and America to think of a strengthened transatlantic partnership based on shared values and common interests.
But logic is not necessarily sufficient.
There are real grounds for concern, the traditional transatlantic ties are now weakening, without new bridges being built; increasing numbers feel that NATO may not exist in five years' time; and certainly the NATO-Russia Council, as we see published today, is fundamentally changing our whole security relationship.
I would like to examine why this is happening, what the concerns are and what we should do about it.
NATO inevitably is changing, no longer is it a defensive organisation against a country which no longer exists.
It is becoming more political, more international.
After 11 September quite clearly one partner, America, feels that it is a nation under attack.
We in Europe do not have that feeling.
It gives a much clearer focus on what should be done in military matters.
Finally, America perhaps is a country which is certainly not used to, and may not wish to, share sovereignty and multinational institutions, as we have become more used to in Europe.
It therefore sees things in a very different light when participating in international institutions, even if it is aware that for market access global rules of governance are needed.
What then are the concerns?
My report is very clear on this.
A number of different concerns have been raised by colleagues, of a political nature: the lack of US participation in the Kyoto Protocol, the biodiversity convention, the Ottawa Convention on land mines and, recently, the refusal to sign the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court.
Secondly, economic concerns.
We have seen two recent instances of American action on steel and now American action to increase agricultural subsidies.
In many ways, these show that they are living in a world of their own, detached from reality outside.
Finally on foreign policy, where the US seems to wish to continue its ideas for action against Iraq, this is seen by many as not perhaps the best way to deal with that problem.
What then should we do?
The report I am submitting to the House, together with my colleague, Mrs Mann, shows that we have many good ideas, but we have perhaps not paid sufficient attention to what we should be doing.
The key element of the report is that we need to continue to update NATO, update the new transatlantic agenda to develop a sustained and strengthened transatlantic partnership based on a new confidence pact and concept of mutual recognition in which our respective roles can be clearly defined.
There are a lot of examples, but I will give a few here to the House.
NATO remains not only the fundamental guarantee of Euro-Atlantic stability and security, it is the essential framework for coalition operations.
NATO needs to respond to new global challenges, realising the form of political and military structures is shifting from collective defence to collective security.
It is essential for adequate defence budgets to be combined with courageous steps towards coordination and greater rationalisation of defence procurement.
Modernisation instead of marginalisation of partnership requires the US to open its defence markets and us, in Europe, to coordinate where possible.
We need to develop a common and comprehensive definition and concept of security and risks to security.
We also need to understand that NATO and the EU need to work closer together, by bringing together the non-military tools at the EU's disposal, combined with the decisive military capabilities available to NATO.
We need a reinforced political dialogue.
My colleague Mrs Mann will deal with the economic aspects, on which there are several excellent proposals.
We need to engage the US in constructive multilateral dialogue and to strengthen parliamentary involvement in this whole dialogue.
What does this mean?
We have made one or two small steps at the EU-US summit on this positive agenda, but there is one major element missing and that is the strategic view of the long-term destination of this transatlantic partnership on which we have no real ideas.
We in this House have always supported a longer-term, deeper transatlantic partnership, that is why we are calling on the Commission to produce a report.
Its own communication is lacking in strategic thinking, and we need to make great progress on that issue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, my colleague's closing comments make an excellent introduction to my intervention.
It is true, we need more strategic thinking and vision.
This is a very, very difficult situation to deal with.
Only if we try and put transatlantic relations on a new footing and make the quantum leap to strategic thinking will there be any permanent rapprochement between us in the long term.
I have focussed, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Relations, Research and Energy, on investigating the economic implications. I came to the following conclusion, which my fellow Members supported and which I should like to thank James Elles for including in his report.
Basically, we started from the premise that the transatlantic market already exists; you can see that for yourselves in several sectors.
However, this has consequences because politicians and the public barely even notice this.
We basically start from the premise that we are competitors.
We are, however, also well aware of the fact that there is a closeness between us and that we are partners.
But this very often finds relatively little expression in political action.
So we need to take more note of economic realities and translate them into political thinking.
That should also give us food for thought for strategic planning.
The consequences are considerable.
We have found evidence of increasingly frequent frustration between us and of alienation setting in.
We have found evidence of segregation and of harping back to national policies - mainly on the American side but, to be fair, we are not completely innocent of this - and an upswing in so-called American and European values.
This leads to more and more trade disputes, which feed on these problems.
The question is: what can we do?
As James Elles rightly says, we need to update the new transatlantic agenda and transatlantic economic partnership.
How can we do that?
I think we need a radical paradigm shift.
We need to move away from mutual observation.
We can achieve this paradigm shift in three ways: first, through a sectoral analysis of economic interdependence, secondly, by strengthening bilateral methods upstream of the WTO dispute settlement procedure and early warning system and, thirdly, through greater rapprochement.
The Commission already set this out at the summit in the form of a positive agenda which the Council confirmed.
And we shall welcome it on Parliament's part.
I do not intend to go into any further detail right now.
The details are there in the report and I trust that the Commission and the Council will support it.
Mr President, I have listened carefully to Mr Elles' presentation of his report and also to Mrs Mann's speech.
In my view, their assessment of the current state of our relationship with the United States and in particular of the Transatlantic Agenda and the future of our relationship merit careful study by the Commission and the Council.
As Mr Elles stated, in recent years circumstances have arisen resulting in changes in our relationship with the United States. Clearly too, the United States has adopted attitudes which are at variance with a number of common principles we felt had been accepted in the context of the Transatlantic Agenda.
Nonetheless, I believe these are mere blips in what is essentially a strong relationship we trust will prove very significant.
In fact, relations with the United States are already established and important, regardless of whether it is incumbent on us to reflect on strengthening them.
Of all the Union's external relationships, the transatlantic relationship is surely the closest one between the European Union and a third country.
The European Union/United States Summit was held in Washington barely two weeks ago.
There can be no reservations in declaring that its outcome was excellent. Both parties maintained a commendable constructive spirit across the whole range of issues discussed.
This exemplifies what I stated earlier. It shows that regardless of some frustration on our side because of our aim of maintaining a more intense relationship with the United States, the fact is that due to the intensity and closeness of the transatlantic relationship the United States is currently one of the Union's very special partners.
We are working together in a number of areas such as the war on terrorism and the joint effort to resolve regional conflicts, notably in the Middle East.
The significance of the fact that a meeting of the so-called Quartet was held immediately after the summit should be noted.
We are also engaged in drawing up and debating a positive agenda on issues related to trade.
It is therefore appropriate to focus on the more important aspects of our mutual understanding rather than keep highlighting those areas where we disagree. The latter mainly involve minor trading issues and, incidentally, amount to less than 5% of the volume of trade between the United States and Europe.
There are therefore many good examples of this transatlantic relationship based on common values and on the close cooperation President Bush himself deems to be unique and important.
From a global perspective and as stated in the press conference following the Summit, a number of conclusions may be drawn from this event.
I should like to mention the main ones as I feel they encapsulate the current state of our relationship with the United States. In the first place, there is a clear recognition of the density and significance of the relationship between the European Union and the United States in economic terms.
After all, together we account for almost half of the world's economy, 40% to be precise.
Only 5% of this is giving rise to dispute, as I stated earlier.
This represents the greatest bilateral relationship in the contemporary world in terms of trade and investment.
There is also recognition of the importance of this relationship in political terms with the renewed joint impetus in the fight against terrorism.
Secondly, the existence of common strategies and challenges was again highlighted.
This means the European Union and the United States are strategic partners.
Terrorism is the main case in point. Negotiations opened on agreements for extradition and legal aid in criminal cases.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted the relevant mandate on 25 April.
Cooperation regarding freezing the assets of terrorist organisations and non-proliferation was strengthened. The updated list of organisations of this nature was finalised on the eve of the meeting to bear witness to our commitment and keep alive the struggle against such organisations.
Thirdly, concerning foreign policy, the close cooperation and concerted action on regional conflicts and reconstruction processes was highlighted.
Examples of these are the agreement on security in the Middle East on the principles of the end to violence, recognition of states and recognition of the Palestinian Authority as a legitimate participant along with support for the Mitchell and Tenet plans. The improvement in the situation in the Balkans was also noted.
Cooperation between the United States and Europe in areas such as Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro was cited. Mention was also made of the close cooperation in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and of the political solution achieved in the framework of the Bonn conference.
Fourthly, both parties stated their position regarding the World Trade Organisation's regulations on all trade issues. They endorsed the principle underlying the positive agenda and the qualitative leap involved in identifying areas suitable for cooperation in future.
Fifthly, and still in the same vein, the wish to cooperate in other fora and international processes was declared. Specific reference was made to the Doha Agenda and the run-up to Johannesburg, that is, the Conference on Sustainable Development.
Finally, it was noted that internal changes within the Union had made themselves felt in all these spheres of cooperation. Two such changes are the enlargement process and the establishment of a common foreign security and defence policy, the consequences of which have been felt in a strengthening of the relationship with the United States.
These, Mr President, are the main conclusions to be drawn from this meeting.
As is usual practice, the meeting began with a closed session.
This was followed by a plenary session devoted to the more political issues. This was in turn followed by a lunch at which the trade issues were dealt with.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will now allow me to present a detailed analysis of the specific content of the negotiations on each of the agenda items, whilst still bearing in mind the ideas I just outlined.
The war on terrorism comes first.
As stated on previous occasions, both parties believe it is a key issue and a priority, especially following the events of 11 September.
In this connection, the draft agreement on extradition and legal aid in criminal cases was considered. As already mentioned, this followed the approval of the mandate by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 25 April and was welcomed by the United States.
Efforts to cut off sources of funding for terrorism come second.
This led to a reference to the point concerning extending the lists of terrorist organisations in order to bring the European Union's in line with the United States'.
There was also discussion on updating the Union's measures with a view to applying United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373.
Parliament is doubtless aware that the Presidency made a considerable effort over this item, to the extent of calling several Clearing House meetings and an extraordinary Coreper to deal exclusively with this issue. The extended European Union list was eventually formally adopted on the very day of the Summit.
As expected, the United States welcomed this further effort. Nonetheless, a degree of disappointment at the omission of Hamas and Hezbollah from the list was expressed.
Both sides undertook to make a greater effort to come up with more consistent lists in anticipation of future amendments.
Lastly, there is the question of non-proliferation.
In this connection, the United States focused mainly on what is known as the 'ten plus ten over ten' programme. This is a ten-year scheme aimed at reducing the amount of radioactive and chemical material in Russia.
The estimated cost is USD 10 billion. The United States emphasised the importance of the role the European Union can play in this regard, given its relationship with third countries such as Iran.
The European Union undertook to include non-proliferation as one of the issues to be dealt with in the political dialogue within the framework of the negotiating mandate for the free trade and cooperation agreement the Union hopes to adopt with Iran.
Furthermore, the European Union took advantage of the opportunity to announce measures aimed at strengthening multilateral instruments.
I should now like to move on to comment on the various issues of mutual interest in the field of regional cooperation dealt with at the Summit. I refer to the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and Afghanistan.
As regards the Middle East, Prime Minister Aznar recalled the need for urgent action not only to achieve a cease-fire but also to give a political dimension to efforts to find a solution.
For the United States, President Bush and Secretary of State Powell recalled that the message of the President's speech on 4 April remained valid. The need to take account of the constructive spirit currently displayed by Saudi Arabia, Jordan and by other moderate Arab states was recognised, however.
The High Representative, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten reiterated the need to rebuild Palestinian infrastructure. They also recalled the conclusions of the ad hoc Contact Group in Oslo concerning the need to avoid a security vacuum in the Palestinian Territories.
It should also be mentioned that Mr Solana drew attention to the unfairness of the accusations of anti-Semitism levelled against Europeans by American public opinion.
President Bush admitted these accusations were unfair.
It is also worth noting that the Quartet, as mentioned earlier, met on the fringes of the Summit, and that the United States felt it was a landmark meeting. The value of concerted international action in achieving a negotiated solution to this particular conflict was therefore recognised.
Basic agreement was reached on the need to develop the political, economic and security dimensions in parallel. Furthermore, both sides expressed their determination to maintain pressure on both the parties concerned.
The United States expressed its appreciation of the efforts made by the European Union in this field and stated that it would always invoke the precautionary principle to avoid compromising American credibility in the area.
To sum up, the Washington Declaration strengthens and reiterates the Madrid Declaration of 10 April.
Concerning the Balkans, the European Union placed particular emphasis on the importance of the association and stabilisation strategy, and also on the common interest in the deployment of the APTF police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina from January 2003. The Union reiterated its willingness to take charge of operation Amber Fox in the Republic of Macedonia.
The United States praised the joint initiatives in the area. In addition, the United States declared its willingness to bring pressure to bear on Serbia to ensure the latter cooperated with the Tribunal at The Hague.
The exchange of views on Russia took place in anticipation of the United States/Russia Summit of 24 to 26 May, the NATO/Russia Summit on 28 May and the European Union/Russia Summit on 29 May.
The European Union highlighted the positive elements of the political dialogue with Russia. Nonetheless, it also referred to politically sensitive issues such as Belarus and Moldova, and expressed its concern over the situation regarding human rights in Chechnya.
The United States welcomed the way concerted action is developing in the area, as this represents tangible evidence of President Putin's Western leanings. In addition, the United States declared its commitment to reach an agreement with Russia on the reduction of nuclear weapons prior to the next summit.
It was reported in yesterday's news that such an agreement has been achieved.
The European Union added a reference to the economic dimension and to the steps Russia is taking with a view to achieving full market economy status. The latter is a requirement for Russia to join the World Trade Organisation.
It is not, however, envisaged that it will become a member before 2004.
The consensual position adopted by both partners over Afghanistan was again much in evidence. The need for bilateral cooperation in the task of rebuilding the country was emphasised.
The United States also recognised the European Union's significant financial contribution for that very purpose.
Turning to matters relating to economics and trade, the principle of avoiding further discussion on ongoing contentious issues was retained. Revisiting such issues often only results in overshadowing the significance of the strong economic links between the European Union and the United States.
We dealt first with the Doha Agenda, then with the Monterrey Summit and finally with the forthcoming Johannesburg Summit.
This item was raised briefly to restate both parties' wish to achieve a consensual position within the multilateral framework of the Monetary Fund, in line with the Presidency's approach.
The Nepad initiative was raised as an item to be dealt with within the framework of the forthcoming G8 summit at Kananaskis. There was also reference to the scope provided at Johannesburg for the development of joint cooperation programmes regarding agriculture and drinking water for example.
More specifically, as regards trade disputes, the exchange revealed the United States' willingness to negotiate. This was evidenced by its commitment to abide by World Trade Organisation rules, in particular regarding the contentious issues involving the Foreign Sales Corporation and restrictions on the import of clementines.
Concerning steel, as is already known, the United States envisages the possibility of reaching a negotiated solution to the issue of compensation in the medium term, without prejudice to the complaint the European Union is to lodge with the World Trade Organisation.
Each party presented a clear statement of its position. However, both sides reiterated their intention of complying with the World Trade Organisation's regulations.
Nonetheless, the European Union continued to argue in defence of its intention to pursue compensation further as the key to protecting its rights.
The item on the Foreign Sales Corporation was dealt with in a positive way, thanks to the favourable climate generated by postponing the panel's decision until June. President Bush undertook to adjust internal fiscal legislation in the United States to bring it into line with the World Trade Organisation.
The issue of clementines was dealt with in the same spirit.
The United States maintained its commitment to speed up procedures so as to avoid damaging consequences for the coming harvest. Clearly, this all dates back to before the advent of the new law adopted recently.
The latter increases aid to American growers. This move could prove to be another bone of contention between the United States and Europe.
It does seem that the United States is failing to send out a positive signal at the very time when we are all jointly committed to reducing agricultural subsidies with an eye to the Doha negotiations. I do however feel that we must draw our own conclusion on this matter, with a view to our negotiating position at the Doha round.
In the positive agenda we have brought together under this heading all those issues on which agreement is likely to be reached in the medium term, and for which the basis of agreement by both parties already exists.
In principle, the following items are to be included: reciprocal access to trading on the stock market, the approximation of regulations for organic farming and its monitoring plus the development of a joint prototype for electronic customs inspections.
Mr President, I must again emphasise the Presidency's positive assessment of the Summit between the European Union and the United States in Washington on 2 May. The Summit's effects will be far-reaching.
In conclusion, the transatlantic relationship is important and we are indeed concerned about it. Nonetheless, the fact remains that it is a cornerstone in the structure of the Union's external relations, and will, I believe, remain as such.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank both the two previous speakers and the two rapporteurs for their work.
I wish to thank them because transatlantic relations are currently going through a very difficult phase.
We must admit that this community of values has been the most successful alliance in the history of mankind; it has brought prosperity, democracy and human rights not just to Europe and North America, but to many other parts of the world too and it has brought about much that is good in this world.
We must also admit, however, that a great deal has gone wrong since this triumph.
There is an excess of unilateralism causing difficulties on the one side and there are weaknesses on the other side, namely our side - mainly our inability to make a military contribution - which generate the difficulties we see on a daily basis, some of which have already been mentioned.
The International Criminal Court, Kyoto, trade issues or the fact that the fight against the fallout from 11 September is making NATO look like it no longer has any teeth; all this gives us great cause for concern and, although it is true that progress is being made in the Middle East, we still have no joint presence in Jerusalem or Ramallah and I think that this is where the starting point must be.
I think that there is no point in starting with individual problems, such as the question of hushkits or bananas, because this is a race you can never win. Just as you think you have got one problem sorted, another two spring up.
So this starting point alone gets us nowhere, which is why I am so grateful to the rapporteur for including mainly structural improvements in his proposals, for suggesting that we move the discussion in a new direction, that we develop structural relations with the United States over and above NATO, which was one of the intentions of the transatlantic agenda in the early and mid-1990s.
The question is: can we find solutions using bilateral trade dispute settlement mechanisms without disturbing multilateralism, do we discuss these issues in connection with the transatlantic market place or do we conclude an agreement between the United States and the European Union, a master agreement as to how relations can be improved here, because this sort of agreement has the incalculable advantage of involving the American Congress.
The European Union has agreements with almost every country on earth except our closest allies, the United States of America.
We run from administration to administration, knowing full well that it is only ever half the game and that the American Congress is immensely important in this game. That is why we need to find a framework which allows American politics as a whole to be involved, a structural reference framework, and I hope that the Council and Commission will adopt more intensive initiatives here than has perhaps recently been the case.
Mr President, in general, following the terrible events of 11 September, Europe has surreptitiously moved the more controversial issues down the Transatlantic Agenda. I was mistaken, as were others.
The laws of physics do not normally apply to politics, with the possible exception of the Archimedes principle.
I do not think I would be dramatising the present situation in saying that disagreements between the European Union and the United States are both new and alarming. So too is the tone of the disagreement between the European Union and the United States, by which I mean the present government of the United States.
We all, or nearly all, bemoan the American unilateral attitude. We do not however accept that this is due to Europe failing to assume its global responsibilities in full.
I agree with Commissioner Patten that we do not need new ideas. We must, however, give up the old ones, including the notion that Member States, or certain Member States, can play a leading role in world affairs.
It is not just desirable but essential to promote a return to the old multilateral attitude adopted by the United States in the forties and fifties. This can best be achieved by the European Union's adoption of a single common foreign policy.
The latter would help to restore the political balance of the Transatlantic Agenda.
Such a new relationship cannot depend on readjusting military capabilities.
This issue still poses a challenge for Europe, however.
We do not have to restrict ourselves to exercising our enormous so-called 'soft power' is we do not wish to do so.
Europe can also have a genuine common defence policy.
This would not, in the first instance, involve a budget increase. Instead, it would require the forging of a single policy, and a great deal of work remains to be done in this regard.
Mr President, since 11 September, we have all said that Europe and the USA must stand shoulder to shoulder because we share common values.
We must support our ally in its time of need in the same way as America came to Europe's aid twice in the darkest hours of the last century.
Yet, this support need not be uncritical. True friends and allies must talk to each other and, more importantly, listen to each other.
Sadly, as the Commissioner has said, there have been too many examples recently of poor communication and the turning of deaf ears in transatlantic relations.
As the Commissioner demonstrated admirably to Mr Elles, candour is sometimes an obligation of friendship.
We must say candidly that on some issues Europe believes the US has got it wrong.
Claims that the International Criminal Court would have untrammelled power to prosecute members of the US military are simply not true.
To disown the body will not prevent it from going ahead, the US will simply lose all influence over the way the rules develop.
American arguments at the UN summit on children against safeguards - because they would prevent judicial execution of minors in Texas - offend the European concept of justice, just as US treatment of Taliban prisoners in the Shibarghan camp in northern Afghanistan seems to us to violate the Geneva Convention.
Staying out of the Kyoto agreement on climate change means that the US is free-riding on the efforts of others to tackle global warming.
How can we expect the developing world to make its industries environmentally sustainable when the world's leading economy passes the buck so shamelessly?
On steel tariffs also, US policy is misguided.
Rather than re-structure its steel industry, the US risks losing the moral high ground in the global campaign for free trade.
However, the breakdown in communication across the Atlantic is due not only to errors of judgment on the US side.
It does not help that the European Union is at sixes and sevens.
Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar looked distinctly uncomfortable with each other at the summit.
The failure of Member States to back the Commission in its response to the steel tariffs dispute undermines the credibility of the Union and weakens our negotiating hand.
The Union's failure to speak with one voice, from Iraq to India, makes it mighty difficult for the US to know where we stand.
For the Union to have a credible foreign policy we need a common security policy.
It is no use establishing a 60 000 strong rapid reaction force if we cannot get it up and running in practice or reach agreement on a common arms procurement policy.
In other areas too, from policing on the ground to a single European sky, we will not be taken seriously by the Americans until we get our own act together.
Finally, the Union could take a leaf out of the US book in its policy towards China over Taiwan.
It is disgraceful that Taiwan, a fully-fledged democracy since 1987, is made a pariah by EU governments which claim to represent democratic values.
It is high time that Member States stood together behind the EU flag to open normal relations with Taiwan and take a stand at the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva against the PRC's human rights abuses.
In conclusion, the European Union would be better placed to engage in a real dialogue of equals with the US, if we displayed more unity and demonstrated more backbone.
Liberal Democrats look to the Convention on the future of Europe to deliver a federal European Union with a real common foreign and security policy, so that Europe can use active diplomacy to strive for a new approach to global development and convince our American friends to follow.
Mr President, the relationship between the United States and the EU is not one of equals.
I am not referring to political, economic or military power; I mean that the EU and the United States are not equal.
They do not have the same level of awareness, they do not have the same definition of security and of their role in the world.
Do not get me wrong, I welcome this difference.
The world does not need two United States, the original and a copy.
The European Union differs, deviates and should continue to do so.
Needless to say, there are common values, common roots and common goals, but there is also a difference in terms of insight into how these goals can best be achieved.
In this area, a European model of some kind is certainly taking shape.
Let me spell it out quite clearly: there is no room for a sense of moral superiority.
The EU is not always right, and the United States does not always come up with the worst response.
Despite this, the EU would do well to highlight this response, this difference, with confidence and force in a discussion, a debate with the United States.
Also because the United States is no monolith.
Debate is most definitely taking place in the United States, and Europe can influence this debate.
What does this mean in concrete terms?
In my view, this specifically means three things.
One: the EU must consistently adhere to multilateral agreements in the area of security, the environment and international criminal law.
This is different from multilateralism Ã  la carte, as is sometimes displayed by the United States, for example their behaviour in NATO.
Two: the EU should further develop its strong points in areas where it has been successful in the past.
As I have already said, these include talking, diplomacy, mediating, conflict prevention and, once conflicts have arisen, tackling reconstruction.
This is not a poor apology, this is increasingly the real thing in international relations.
Third point: the EU must - more so than in the past - be able to solve the problems in its own region, using military means if necessary.
But this does not mean, and I am particularly addressing the rapporteur here, that the EU should spend more on defence, but that it should spend more efficiently.
I often get impatient when I see the silly mistakes the United States is making, for example in Iraq or Iran.
I also get impatient, however, when I notice that the EU is unable to come up with alternatives.
It manages to do so occasionally, for example in the Balkans.
Let us continue along this path, with growing confidence, criticising the United States if necessary.
If this could be done, I am hopeful of a better future for the world.
Mr President, I too wish to concentrate on the relationship between the EU and what Mr Patten calls the 'super-duper power?, namely the United States.
As far as I am concerned, there is no doubt that the United States is aiming to achieve total global military dominance - something which it probably already possesses.
The question, then, is what role the EU is to play in relation to the United States.
Are we to be the United States's puppy or a group of fully paid-up yes-men who cheer the US on whenever it wants us to?
The second possibility is that we tag along as competitors, and that is what we shall do if we launch ourselves into an arms race or suddenly embark upon an attempt to match the United States's military capacity.
The third possibility is for us to choose a quite different role, namely that of being the civilian and global power that can intervene before crises arise and before weapons become necessary.
What we see as primary in the case of the United States is the capacity and need to solve conflicts with the aid of military power.
They have this capacity and need because, in my view, they are quite unable to conduct a proper foreign policy, that is to say a sustainable foreign policy capable of forestalling crises and preventing war.
The EU, on the other hand, has demonstrated an ability to maintain multilateral contacts and so also has the ability to lay the foundation for a more sustainable foreign policy.
That is the best prerequisite for a civil security policy, and we are therefore better placed than anyone to become that particular civil and global factor.
Mr Elles' report does not make for encouraging reading, and I understand that the Commission gave it a mixed reception, but I do not understand the desire to throw all but the first of the EU's options overboard and turn the EU into the United States's puppy.
The ties between Europe and America are old and deep, comparable to a friendship between two school friends that goes back many years.
Despite this, the school friends seem to be growing apart a little.
There has been growing irritation over the past few years.
Disagreements between the US and EU are on the increase.
The European Parliament plays a modest role in the transatlantic relationship, but that does not stop the House from holding strong views.
The criticism levelled at the United States for adopting a unilateralist, hegemonic attitude is widespread and is also included quite expressively in Mr Elles' resolution.
It is true that the behaviour of our partners on the other side of the Ocean sometimes gives us cause for concern.
Especially in the area of trade, the US attracts the criticism that it takes little notice of international agreements.
In addition, I hope that the United States will change its mind about the Kyoto Protocol.
I can support the resolution on these scores.
The criticisms levelled at the States by this Parliament, however, go further.
In all kinds of ways, the EP is hauling the United States over the coals, the alleged unilateralism displayed by the US being designated as the main culprit.
It does not befit the EU, however, to play the role of moralist if the EU itself is unable to pursue an effective and consistent foreign policy.
The EU may have extremely high ambitions, but they still hardly ever materialise in practice.
Pleas for more integration have never been fruitful; the interests of the Member States are simply too diverse for this.
In this light, the criticism in the resolution loses some of its essence.
Indeed: what real alternative does the European Union offer?
And why should this alternative be attractive to the United States?
These questions remain unanswered.
Additionally, it is questionable whether the European Member States always sail the right course.
All we want to do is enter into consultation, thereby avoiding the root of the conflict, as is illustrated in the background to those fatal events of 11 September last year.
Delaying until everyone can strike a weak compromise; is this always preferable to taking action?
The criticism of unilateralism ignores the fact that in many cases, the United States only has the choice between acting on its own or not acting at all.
Especially in the light of the fact that the current threats may require vigorous action.
I gladly refer to the ongoing danger which the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq represents for us.
Even a friendship that goes back many years is not immune to deep rifts.
This would be very detrimental to transatlantic relations.
This is why I regret, finally, that the resolution does not have a good word to say about the different forms of transatlantic dialogue.
Precisely in situations where there is a difference of opinion, these dialogues can help foster mutual understanding and work towards solutions.
I will therefore support the amendments that moderate this criticism, for it is important to nurture friendships.
After all, friendship can never be taken for granted.
Mr President, I fully support the statement, analysis and presentation delivered by the Council and the Commission on the report on transatlantic dialogue.
I too feel that attempts are, in effect, being made in Europe to develop a European identity based on totally unfounded and purely rhetorical anti-Americanism, which is ultimately just irresponsible.
The only way to bring about a more balanced situation is for Europe, for we Europeans, to decide to shoulder a few more responsibilities such as, for example, in the field of common foreign and defence policy, which we are failing to do.
I therefore place great hope in the Convention and the new Treaty and I believe that we must concentrate intensely on that.
It is too easy to use a scapegoat all the time to attempt to conceal our differences, which remain so very obvious to the rest of the world.
There are, therefore, just two points I would like to stress. Firstly, I support the position adopted by the Council and the Commission with regard to the International Criminal Court, for example, but I also see this position as an example of differences in mutual respect, which, however, do not prevent us from proceeding on the basis of a position on which we are united.
I trust, therefore, rapporteur, that you will accept the amendment tabled by the socialist Members to paragraph 14 on the International Criminal Court, which we feel is extremely comprehensive and appropriate.


Secondly, with regard to Afghanistan, I feel, Commissioner, Council representative, that both Europe and the United States are mistaken in their analysis of the situation; in my view, having won the war, we are in danger of throwing away peace; if we do not step up the UN forces ensuring the country's security, restricting ourselves just to making Kabul secure, quite frankly, we will be paving the way for another war and fresh instability in Afghanistan.
I call upon Europe to make this position quite clear in its dialogue with our US friends and for much more durable stability to be achieved in the region.
The rapporteur is right to note that the transatlantic relationship was, in fact, the keystone of our security as long as it was under threat from the East-West divide.
Given the fact that our relationship with the Russian Federation has undergone so much change, there is a need to review our relationship with the US.
For a very long time, there has been talk of the European pillar alongside the American one.
Unfortunately, the European pillar is not much of a pillar.
In some respects, it is more like a pile of loose bricks.
As the meaning of national sovereignties is overrated and this concept is used incorrectly, the Member States are bound to remain satellites of some kind.
Despite this, our ambitions go further than this.
The report deplores American unilateralism.
However, there is hardly any way in which this can be broken, other than by reinforcing the other arm of NATO and of European-Atlantic relations, namely the EU structures.
If we do not strengthen these, we will remain a disconnected bunch.
We will never be able to take a stand; we will simply remain divided.
The lack of a Community approach affects many areas.
Where this Community approach is in place, for example from an economic point of view, as the President-in-Office of the Council illustrated with examples a moment ago, the European Union can most definitely be a strong partner that also prescribes requirements and takes initiatives itself.
This is thanks to the power of the Community approach.
In the case of European security and defence policy, this is still very much lacking.
That is why the report calls for bold steps towards integration.
In my opinion, this is an important position in the report.
As has been stated before, these steps are far more important than the increase in the Member States' defence budget.
After all, as long as the return on our defence expenditure is only 15% of that of the Americans, far more progress can be made by a full-on Community policy.
In addition, I should like to congratulate Mr Patten for his counter-attack.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, transatlantic relations are going through a difficult period.
I feel we must emphasise how paradoxical this situation is, because, as Commissioner Patten said, the expression of European solidarity following 11 September was indeed absolute and exemplary and Europe expressed this solidarity using the resources at its disposal.
We can, of course, always criticise Europe for the disparity between its international ambitions and its defence means or the coherence of its common foreign policy, but the fact remains that Europe did display its solidarity.
There are lessons to be learned from the weakness of our resources and I support Mr Obiols i GermÃ 's comments on this point.
I also believe that we must recognise that the task of the Commission and the Council is made more difficult by the attitude of a US Administration which, whilst continuing to make demands in terms of solidarity, is totally indifferent to the effects of its own policy on its partners, and on developing countries as well, when you consider the consequences that its decisions might have for the agricultural or steel industry.
We all want to strengthen our relationship with the United States, but let us hope that we will not have to sacrifice our European positions to achieve enhanced cooperation.
I do not think that we can criticise the Commission for a lack of strategic vision, as the Commission is defending European positions in the transatlantic relationship. Given the intransigence of the US Administration, however, the response is certainly not to sacrifice our values but perhaps to state more generally, at international level, the strategic vision that Europe is adopting to contend with the sizeable problems of collective security and co-development and with the problems of the future of the planet and the environment.
This should encourage us to bring an end to the confrontation with the United States.
A further reason for our current difficulty is the fact that the United States is finding it hard to accept that the European Union naturally aspires to be an equal partner and on friendly terms, but also to be treated as equal in return.
It is up to us to affirm our European identity, as Mrs Bonino said.
I think that this will greatly contribute to more balanced relations with our American partner.
Mr President, strengthening transatlantic relations is a welcome move.
However, there are several points which are crucial for Europe because they directly affect our lives.
They are - and I make no claim that the list is complete - the Kyoto protocol, the biodiversity convention, involvement in the International Criminal Court and a complete ban on atomic weapon tests.
Even the atrocious crimes of 11 September must not be used as a pretext for aggressive nuclear arming in the USA, which has even admitted it is planning to carry out pre-emptive attacks using mini atomic weapons.
It is highly ominous that the production of tritium for hydrogen bombs, which stopped in 1988, is to start up again and that a new factory manufacturing plutonium parts for atom bombs is to be built.
It is also a matter of acute concern that the USA has indeed signed a comprehensive ban on atomic weapon tests but has never ...
(The President cut the speaker off.)
Mr President, I wish to begin by taking this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
This debate has certainly stimulated interest in what the Commissioner described as one of the most important relationships that exists: the relationship between the European Union and the United States.
The rapporteur was right to state that there was no long-term view.
At this moment in time we must appreciate how difficult it is for Americans to achieve that long-term view because of the events in the United States on 11 September, which, to some extent, meant they turned their attention to other issues, such as their "homeland" security.
At times we Europeans do not understand the effects that 11 September had on the people of the United States.
That does not mean that we cannot move forward in cooperation, indeed, we must cooperate and pursue our dialogue.
Of course, there are many issues that we will always disagree on.
However, we must pursue our dialogue to try to resolve those issues.
No doubt there will be other issues, such as the situation this week with the new Farm Bill, which will cause tremendous problems for the European Union in the longer term.
The steel issue will be resolved eventually.
Thus we have to continue the dialogue and face the challenge.
We must not allow the issues as they come forward to distract us in any way from this vital relationship between the European Union and the United States.
There is a challenge here for us.
Parliament has a modest role to play.
I am pleased that the Commissioner recognised that.
We have to take up that challenge and work together with the Commission and the Council to ensure that we have a long-term view.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on this report.
They rightly assume that we need a proper partnership between Europe and the USA.
And partnership means that both partners have equal rights, although they need not and perhaps should not be identical.
For example, we have different concepts of security and security risks.
We place greater emphasis on the economic, social and ecological aspects of security and security risks and we need to introduce this into the debate.
But we Europeans must admit that security does not come cheap and that perhaps we need to spend even more in order to achieve it.
However, it would be a mistake to say that we need the same level of military spending as the United States of America.
No, what we need most of all is more efficient spending.
What we need is more efficient civil spending which accounts for a higher and probably more significant - by which I also mean materially significant - proportion.
And that will only happen if we move towards common European defence structures.
I hope that Mr Elles is willing to move with us in this direction and create common European defence structures one step at a time.
Mr President, in order to give some substance to EU-US dialogue, which brings together two partners with very different competences, we should focus the dialogue on the areas where we have similar responsibilities.
It seems that this was the approach taken on 3 May, when the specific economic programme was adopted at the Washington Summit.
The controversial topic of agriculture, which so often occupies centre stage at multilateral trade negotiations, should be the subject of in-depth debates and not only, as planned, in the area of mutual recognition of standards for organic farming.
European citizens should not simply regard the new farm bill as an instrument that will disrupt trade, since its objectives, scope and length also acknowledge each country's right to support its agricultural industry, given the practical challenges, such as social, territorial and environmental balance, which cannot be left to the mercy of free trade mechanisms alone.
This considerable rapprochement of ideas on both sides of the Atlantic can only benefit dialogue, Mr President, particularly within the framework of the WTO.
Mr President, I will be very brief as I realise time is short. Furthermore, this debate has not proved controversial.
I think it has been useful to review our position on the important issue of transatlantic relations. As this relationship is a very intense one, almost a 'family relationship', it is sometimes very complex, because we demand so much from ourselves and also from our partners.
We believe that in its dealings with us the United States should adopt the same demanding standards we impose on ourselves.
We shall not to be able to solve this problem as we each have different shortcomings.
We have spoken of America's tendency towards unilateralism and of its unwillingness to make commitments in the context of international mechanisms.
On the other hand, we have also stated that we are aware of our own failings. We do not invest enough, we do not keep up to standard and we often fail to reach agreement on the implementation of certain policies.
It has been said that it was evident that Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar were not of one mind when they met with President Bush. I think that this is an exaggeration of the truth.
In fact, there has always been a broad measure of agreement between the Commission and the Presidency. This is certainly true of the current Presidency and will probably also be true of future ones.
I must say that I could not express the European Union's feelings on relations with the United States better than Commissioner Patten has already done in this House.
Therein lies our weakness, however.
We lack a common policy on many issues and there is still deep disagreement over foreign policy.
The independent Member States of the European Union continue to make their own decisions.
We need to bring our position on major international issues more closely into line with each other.
Nevertheless, there really is consensus between the Council and the Commission on a strategy for our future relationship with the United States. One really does exist.
In addition, there is a willingness to retain the special nature of the relationship.
We must have all this constantly in mind as we deal with the usual blips in the relationship. We should also be mindful of it as we continue to work on this warm, fruitful and vital relationship every day that goes by.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for the detailed summit conclusions it gave us, as well as the appreciation that there was a real need to have a look at a long-term strategic view of the transatlantic relationship, taking into account security and political and economic aspects.
This was at the heart of the report adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by 40 votes to 5.
I would remind the Commissioner not to personalise debates in the way he did - although there was an element of humour about this - because I represent the views of the committee and the amendment he referred to was adopted unanimously by my group.
We hope that in time the Commission will fall into line with most of this House and the Council in understanding that there is a need for a longer-term review.
That is what we have requested, and we expect a strategic report to be presented by 30 September 2003.
I hope the Commissioner can produce that for us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.29 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
The next item is the vote.
Recommendation for second reading in the form of a letter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 of 18 January 1993 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports (6661/1/2002 - C5-0149/2002 - 2002/0013(COD))
Amendment No 1:
Mr President, my group will be withdrawing the amendment.
We had tabled this amendment because we believe that the system with which slots are currently being allocated places a heavy burden on competition in aviation.
We reluctantly accept the Commission's argument that the emergency measure is now necessary in the interest of the European airline companies, but we adhere to our position and, further to Mr Stockmann's report, will also most certainly defend the substance of this position very passionately.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I said yesterday during the plenary debate, the Commission welcomes the agreement on the Caudron report on the Sixth Framework Programme for research.
I would again like to stress the excellent interinstitutional cooperation which formed the basis of the legislative procedure and which enabled us to conclude an important agreement.
I can confirm that the Commission is able to accept the 34 compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 13 May and presented to the House today.
I would once again like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, the shadow rapporteurs, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Alyssandrakis, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now contemplating the possibility that, for the first time, a framework programme for research will be approved without a long and complicated conciliation procedure.
This is the result of the work undertaken with the Council, the rapporteurs from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and also with the Commission and the Council.
Agreement has been reached because the Council shares the concerns expressed by Parliament.
I think it is important to send a signal out to all those involved in science and technology in Europe that Parliament supports the Sixth Framework Programme. This aims to create the European Research Area.
I would like to finish by thanking the Chairman of the Committee for his work. Thanks are also due to the rapporteurs who have worked so hard with the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank all the Members who have helped me over the last year and a half with the work on the Sixth Framework Programme on research. I would point out that the FP6, with a budget of EUR 17.5 billion, is Europe's third largest policy.
My thanks go to Commissioner Busquin and to Mr MarimÃ³n SuÃ±ol, both of whom just reiterated that we reached agreements thanks to the 34 compromise amendments which were adopted on Monday evening by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
As rapporteur, I of course urge my fellow Members to adopt these amendments and these amendments alone which will mean that, today at midday, we will be on the verge of finalising our Sixth Framework Programme and that it can be applied in the best possible conditions as of 1 January 2003.
Thank you all!
It is now my pleasure to welcome to the official gallery a delegation of 20 parliamentarians and senators from Mexico.
The delegation is led by Ms Beatriz Paredes Rangel, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies.
(Loud applause)
As they will have heard, the House extends a very warm welcome to them and hopes their meetings in the context of EU/Latin American relations are fruitful.
We will now continue with the vote.
Report (A5-0131/2002) by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (COM(2000) 438 - C5-0377/2000 - 2000/0179(COD))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0119/2002) by Marit Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC (COM(2001) 452 - C5-0372/2001 - 2001/0176(COD))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0120/2002) by Marit Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the control of salmonella and other food-borne zoonotic agents and amending Council Directives 64/432/EEC, 72/462/EEC and 90/539/EEC (COM(2001) 452 - C5-0373/2001 - 2001/0177(COD))
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(The sitting was suspended at 11.58 a.m. for a formal sitting and resumed at 12. 34 p.m.)
Mr President, it is a great honour and a pleasure for us to welcome you to the European Parliament today.
For the first time, the President of the United Mexican States will address our House, and your presence here today underlines the growing quality of relations between Mexico and the European Union.
For me personally it also carries a special significance: you are the first Head of State to address our House during my presidency.
I should also like to welcome the delegation of the Mexican Congress to our gallery. They have come to participate in the fourth interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the Mexican Congress.
Mr President, your election on 2 July 2000 marked a new stage in Mexican politics and the democratic consolidation of your country.
The priorities that you have marked for your government - strengthening the Rule of Law, reform of the justice system, promoting economic growth and opportunity, developing human resources and dialogue with the Zapatistas - are all priorities which the European Parliament has strongly supported and continues strongly to support.
Mexico shows how a country with an age-old culture can combine its strong historical links with Europe with a new strategic role and partnership in Central American politics.
The links between Mexico and the European Union are strong: your country was the first from all the Americas to sign an Association and Free Trade Agreement with the European Union.
This agreement is a milestone in our relations.
It is important to point out in Parliament today that it is more than just about a market and trade connection.
It is a political commitment of profound significance, covering economics and also political dialogue with a parliamentary dimension, and shared values at the core.
It aims to include the promotion of democratic principles and respect for human rights which, for this Parliament, are indispensable parts of our association agreements and association councils with other states.
As you know, the European Parliament has been a strong supporter of this agreement from the outset.
In a couple of days, in Madrid, you will attend the second EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit of Heads of State, which aims to renew and boost relations between these two regions.
The European Parliament also will be present and earlier today had a lengthy discussion on the summit meeting which you will attend.
Mr President, we thank you for your attendance here today.
We thank you for your visit.
I thank you in particular, as President of the European Parliament, that in coming to Europe and in going to a summit meeting, that you should take the time to address parliamentarians and to celebrate an awareness of parliamentary democracy itself.
For us, that too is a significant act of politics and not merely a gesture.
Therefore it gives me great pleasure, Mr President, to invite you to speak to our House which is, as an elected Parliament, the largest supranational democratically elected Parliament in the world.
I give you the floor, Mr President.
(Loud applause)
Colleagues, before drawing this formal sitting to a close, I should like in particular to acknowledge, Mr President, the presence of my colleague and predecessor, Mrs Fontaine, who on our behalf made an official visit to Mexico in April 2001.
I thank her for the initiative in inviting you here today.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to ask the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group to withdraw Amendment No 1 to this resolution.
This amendment seeks to extend the list of terrorist organisations to a number of organisations.
At the present time when the European Union is involved in a series of negotiations, most importantly with Columbia, and when a number of people - including a candidate from our political family as well as other candidates - are in the hands of terrorists, we feel that it would not be advisable for Parliament to extend lists which will not have any positive effect and which, on the contrary, will impact negatively on the negotiations.
We therefore call upon the two majority groups to withdraw this amendment.
Mr President, it says on the voting list that, if Amendment No 40 is accepted, Amendments Nos 1 and 2 and paragraphs 16 and 17 will be invalid.
We disagree.
We feel that the second part of Amendment No 1 is totally compatible with Amendment No 40.
It is important that we vote on the second part because it reads:
It was deemed incompatible as it would be against the spirit of Amendment No 40, if it was carried, to then vote on Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on paragraphs 16 and 17.
But I am happy to take the advice of the rapporteur on this point.
Mr President, it becomes clear that the Socialists are shifting ground as we go through this debate.
The original text of Paragraph 16 states that it is inevitable that "a significant increase of defence expenditures to fill the current capability gap" will be needed.
I agreed in discussions with the Socialist Group to alter that to "an increase" on the assumption that our Amendment No 40 would be the basis for our compromise.
We then went further, and I agreed to put an oral amendment stating it should be "adequate defence expenditure".
As the Socialist Group has withdrawn its approval of Amendment No 40 at it stands, I suggest we revert to the original wording of Paragraph 16 - "significant increase" - and vote on that text first.
- (PT) Unfortunately, the amendments I proposed to this report on potato starch were rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Let me remind you that those amendments were aimed at creating a common organisation of the market in potatoes for human consumption, something that is particularly important for Portugal.
As it now stands, the report only mentions the Commission proposal on starch and continues to undermine the position we support.
The fact is that the potato starch support system is a significant burden on the Community budget, yet only benefits a few countries.
That is why we consider it important to review this support immediately so as to ensure greater fairness in support for potato production and to assist the majority of potato producers, that is to say small producers and family farms.
We have, therefore, not voted for this report.
The GUE/NGL Group endorses and supports the joint motion for resolution on Euro-Mediterranean relations.
However, I should like to take this opportunity to highlight the importance of the final statement of the contact group of the presidents of the Euro-Mediterranean parliaments.
Especially Article 2 on the application of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the phrase "for peace" and the legal right of the Palestinians to self-determination and to an independent state, paragraph 6 condemning military occupation by Israel and paragraph 7 condemning all forms of violence and terrorism against innocent Israelis.
- (PT) The main reason why we did not vote in favour of this resolution was to protest against the inclusion of the amendment tabled by the PPE and PSE Groups calling on the Council to add to the list of organisations all those groups and organisations that resort to murder, kidnapping, blackmail, extortion and any other type of terrorist action.
This means that it is not made clear what other type of terrorist action is being referred to and accordingly no distinction is made between the actions of organisations fighting for democracy in their countries and true acts of terrorism.
That is unacceptable.
Nevertheless, there are various positive aspects to the resolution, especially as regards stepping up cooperation and solidarity with the countries of Latin America so as to encourage their economic development and to guarantee social services and combat poverty, whilst reiterating the need for the European Union to make available adequate resources for implementing this policy.
We of course believe that it is vital to develop a true cooperation policy and not just trade agreements that essentially benefit multinationals, as has sometimes happened.
Mr President, this is a directive which combats noise, and I was very happy to vote for it because I am against noise.
However, I am against all kinds of noise, Mr President, including the din made by those who act against the interests of pensioners and the elderly.
The news has reached my ears this very day of an extremely serious incident in Milan, where a journalist from the television network Telelombardia, who was going to a home for pensioners and elderly people, the Pio Albergo Trivulzio in Milan, to report on the living conditions of elderly people in nursing homes - in this case, a nursing home in Milan - was treated badly: he was prevented from filming, and the commotion has reached my ears and I want to condemn it in this Chamber today.
Indeed, I believe that pensioners and elderly people have a right for others to know how they live, which must be in peace and calm, not in dubious conditions like, I suspect, those of that old people's home in Milan.
That was inventive as ever, in terms of making the subject fit the item on the agenda.
Report Caudron (A5-0153/2002)
My flights of fancy in explaining why I voted for research will be even more inspired, Mr President, for I am in favour, very much in favour of research.
But what are we searching for?
I feel that we should emulate Orlando in Ludovico Ariosto's opera 'Orlando Furioso'.
Orlando goes to the moon to search for his lost wits.
I feel that we too should search for our wits, in other words our minds, the wisdom that humanity has lost.
That too is research.
It is a difficult project but it is one that should be a high priority in our research activities, for too many people have lost their reason, especially politicians.
What is happening in Palestine and Israel at the moment, and not only there, is evidence that our first priority must be to go in search of our lost wits.
Mr President, the funding of destructive embryo research is against the constitutional position of Ireland, as it is against the constitutional, legal or political position of four other Member States.
The European Union does have competence in research and technological development - Title XVII of the EC Treaty.
This has to be exercised complementing the activities carried out in the Member States - Article 164 of the EC Treaty - and always in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity - Article 5 of the EC Treaty - and respecting the national identities of its Member States - Article 6 of the EU Treaty.
Therefore, contrary to the opinion of the Commissioner for research, the EU does not have the right to overrule national legislation, regulations and ethical guidelines or to insist that Member States have a duty to draw up regulations in the field of embryo research.
I regret the Irish Government's silence regarding the unacceptable situation whereby Irish taxpayers are obliged to fund destructive embryo research under its participation in EU funding and I reject EU funding of destructive embryo research as contained in the Caudron report, in line with the majority view in the PPE-DE Group.
I welcome the concentration on a select number of priority areas under the forthcoming programme.
I believe that in this way Europe can make real added value and move towards its goals of the Lisbon Process.
I fully support the strengthening of links between European, national and regional initiatives.
Decentralised management is most welcome as we all wish to see a less cumbersome and bureaucratic approach to the running of European programmes and drawing down of funds.
I am conscious of the need for continuity in the research area, both in terms of the integrity of the work being undertaken and the engagement of personnel on projects.
We have a responsibility to play our part in ensuring that there is a smooth transition to the Sixth Programme.
Finally, I would like to refer briefly to the ethical aspects of research.
While subsidiarity dictates that each Member State can decide what kind of research may be carried out within its territory, we must not forget that we are talking about European taxpayers' money here.
In my Member State, Ireland, there is a clear ban on any form of experimentation on human embryos or cloning.
I have been a long-standing supporter of European research efforts.
Problems related to research on stem cells and supernumerary embryos must not be tackled in emotional or simplistic terms.
Given the fundamental, high principles and the universal values that we defend, it is our duty to completely rule out the risks of eugenics as well as cloning for reproductive purposes.
We must not hide the fact that many people who are ill are waiting for new therapies to be developed that will offer many of them the possibility of recovery.
Although the legislator's task may be to provide a framework for research, the risk is that it will be bound up in an overly restrictive straitjacket.
We must also encourage a Europe of discovery.
Research also affects the daily lives of all European citizens and priority areas such as food safety, the fight against major diseases and the improvement of public health demonstrate the desire to associate research and well-being.
I am also pleased to note the support for developing research into rare illnesses.
For businesses based in the European Union, the economic implications of a European research policy are far-reaching.
That is why, perhaps in this area more than in any other, we must encourage greater cooperation amongst the Member States.
This is because a successful European research area is one of the key elements of our future economic growth.
However, the definition and scope of the fundamental ethical principles, which the Council common position states must be observed when carrying out research, are not clearly explained.
Attitudes towards research on human embryos differ from one Member State to another.
Recent scientific discoveries can, however, offer us an alternative to the use of embryonic stem cells, namely adult stem cells.
We can therefore now reconcile scientific research with ethical principles.
I therefore regret that we do not have a majority in favour of re-launching this debate which is essential for the future of research.
This may lead to a situation where Member States finance research - research that some of them disapprove of - which is carried out on their own territories.
This is an attack on the respect of national sovereignties but also on the moral sovereignty of Member States and their citizens.
- (PT) Therapeutic cloning, which provides new ways of treating certain diseases, depends on the destruction of embryos, and although it is the technology that has been utilised most, and is therefore the most accessible, it is not the only technology and it is certainly not ideal.
For this reason, I am calling for a legal ban at European level on creating human embryos by cloning, be it for therapeutic purposes or for reproductive purposes.
Nevertheless, there should be two exceptions to this ban: supernumerary embryos and the 64 available cell lines.
However, with regard to financing research, and in particular as regards the Sixth Framework Programme, which is the subject of the Caudron report, I believe that priority should be given to Community financing of research projects on the use of adult stem cells for therapeutic purposes.
. (IT) The European research area is happening: it is an ambitious goal of the European Union, which is proposing to coordinate research activities through the Sixth Framework Programme in such a way as to enable Europe to compete against the other large nations of the world in the field of science and technology.
The actions carried out within the framework of the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development 2002-2006 will, for the first time, be implemented in line with the general research objectives set by the Treaty establishing the European Community, namely:
strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry;
encouraging it to become more competitive at international level;
promoting research activities in line with principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The priority thematic research areas proposed in the Sixth Framework Programme have been defined on the basis of 'European added value criteria', which are:
the intention to assemble and concentrate a critical mass of financial and human resources, limiting dispersion as far as possible;
the need to link the various complementary competences present in the different countries of the Union and to carry out comparative studies on a European scale;
the creation of links with the Union's priorities and interests;
the need for specifically transnational research.
(Text cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (PT) After all the many months of work and wide-ranging interinstitutional discussions, both in public and within the Parliament, I regard it as being very regrettable indeed that the majority of this House has still insisted on rejecting all the amendments inspired by basic ethical imperatives of a humanitarian nature.
A majority of this House has thus revealed that it is absolutely insensitive to basic human values, and displays an unfortunate belief that technology should prevail without any limitations.
I am referring to the rejection of Amendments Nos 89, 91, 92 and 95, which undermines a very important milestone for Europe's scientific community and for EU research policy.
I personally particularly regret the rejection of Amendment No 89, which I tabled, which upheld the "principle of legislative unanimity" which in my view offered the only firm and indisputable legal solution to those issues, while entirely respecting democratic legislative decisions taken by Member States.
Accordingly, we could be faced, because of this obstinate blindness on the part of the majority, with a situation in which - through the European Union - the taxpayers of one Member State in which a particular substance, method or technology is considered illegal could find themselves financing something that is banned or illegal in their own country.
It goes without saying that this would be not only an offence to democracy in the true sense of the word and to national legal systems, but it would also be completely absurd from a legal point of view and would be at odds with the normal legislative hierarchy.
I have voted against the report.
The constitutions of four EU Member States protect the sanctity of life to the extent that they prohibit research on stem cells taken from embryos, or unborn children.
The fact that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are not prepared to take account of this constitutional protection within the framework of the EU common research programme is extremely regrettable.
I was one of the signatories to Amendment No 92, all four sections of which were defeated (193-284 with 22 abstentions; 183-293 with 21 abstentions; 182-303 with 21 abstentions; and 184-312 with 18 abstentions).
This gives the go-ahead to use taxpayers' money to fund an activity that is illegal and unconstitutional in four Member States, including Germany.
There are therefore serious shortcomings in the ethical standards for the Sixth Framework Programme, especially with regard to research involving human embryos.
The Member States have widely differing attitudes towards this type of research, and these must be respected.
It should thus be self-evident that embryos created for in-vitro fertilisation but not used for that purpose, together with research using embryo stem cells, must not be funded by the EU.
Community resources must benefit all countries.
Member States must not be obliged, as is currently the case, to fund research that is illegal and unconstitutional in their own countries.
I welcome this report which represents a big step towards making the EU the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world by 2010.
Without endorsement of this Programme, Europe could never hope to become a world player in the field of research and technology, where we are lagging seriously behind the US.
The Sixth Framework Programme will also respect ethical principles held across Europe; in particular research activity into human cloning for reproduction will be banned.
I feel that the European institutions can congratulate themselves for coming to a reasonable and effective agreement on this issue.
The global advantages of the Sixth Framework Programme need to be fully translated to our citizens: all sections of society, from young scientists to disabled and elderly people are set to gain from its contents.
Indeed, if ever there was a case for European co-operation, the research programme makes it strongly.
I am delighted that European scientists in Europe's regions will get financial reward for their intelligence.
All in all, this will make us more competitive and will help in the fight against serious illness and environmental problems.
Mr President, I basically want to state my views on two proposed amendments in the Schnellhardt report, namely Amendments Nos 129 and 82, and to confirm that I voted in favour of them.
On balance, this is a very even-handed report and I congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his hard work.
I think it is clear from Plenary's acceptance of these two amendments that a sensible compromise can be found between the need for European rules and the use of common sense where small quantities are involved.
In addition, subsidiarity can also be sensibly applied to hygiene rules for hunting and I trust that the provisions in question will find their way into national regulations.
The first Schnellhardt report concerns the regulation on the hygiene of food products in Europe.
As always, as you can see, Mr President, most of the Members of the European Parliament are absent from the Chamber.
Why is that?
Because they have gone to lunch.
I am sure that many of our number are enjoying typical, traditional regional dishes: the Italians, for example, will be eating gorgonzola, lardo di Colonnata, parmigiano reggiano, spaghetti with pesto, fettuccine with truffles, devilled chicken and so on and so forth, all traditional regional products which, I am glad to say - I know that your mouth is starting to water but be patient just a moment longer - are protected in the Schnellhardt report.
Well then, I would like them to have even greater protection and for us to tell all the European citizens loud and clear that their traditional regional products will never be missing from the European tables.
This is how Europe needs to be close to the citizens, Mr President!
It was not so much me who had their mouth watering.
The secretariat started looking forward to their lunch.
Hailing from Ireland, the 'Food Island', I am extremely conscious of the need to convince European consumers that European food products are second to none in the world when it comes to hygiene and safety as well as quality.
Following on from a number of scares in recent years, tremendous steps have been taken to fine-tune the whole food production process so that nothing can be left to chance and so that our consumers can have peace of mind.
I particularly welcome the putting in place of rules which seek to guarantee that food imported from outside the Union must meet with the same rigorous standards that apply to producers within the EU.
As we fast approach enlargement, this must remain high on the agenda so that the standards which European consumers have come to expect can be maintained.
The cornerstone of food safety policy is the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority.
It is a matter of deep concern that almost half a year after the start-up date, the permanent home of the Authority remains undecided. This gives out a very dubious signal to consumers as to the urgency with which European authorities treat the whole question of food safety.
I did vote for this document on hygiene rules for food of animal origin, but I did so unwillingly, Mr President.
I feel that any explanation can be given for a vote, provided it is responsible and humane.
Therefore, should we not propose - and I am doing so now - to be more humane with animals, whether they are fish, cows, sheep or pigs?
Why should we always eat them?
Why should we breed them just to kill them and serve them up at table?
I am not a vegetarian, Mr President, but why should I not defend animals which I am not sure our Eternal Father intended should end up on our tables when he put them on this earth?
I believe that, one day, we might even decide to stop eating animal meat.
That is my suggestion, at least, Mr President.
. (DE) I welcome the differentiated approach taken by the Commission in order to guarantee a high level of health protection using specific hygiene rules for food.
That these rules also apply to wild game on sale to consumers in large quantities is only logical.
Nonetheless, we really must make a distinction between commercial marketing and the private consumption of game bagged in small quantities.
Hunters who give away or sell small quantities of game directly to the local retail trade after the hunt cannot and should not have to meet the same requirements as large meat-processing factories.
We need specific rules for hunters which reflect common practice.
However right and welcome these new rules are, private hunters must be exempted from them.
Our hunters already know a great deal about game hygiene and diseases.
Trained hunters already take full responsibility for the healthy state of the game which they provide and will continue to do so in future.
The European Parliament Committee on the Environment has accepted several proposed amendments which allow flexibility in the marketing of game and game meat without jeopardising food safety and I urgently call on the whole House to support these amendments.
. (IT) In her report - which I voted for - the rapporteur has rightly described the proposal for a regulation before us and the additional proposals as innovative.
It is indeed innovative in terms of the consolidation and simplification of the various rules in existence on the matters in question.
Nevertheless, the rapporteur also poses the question of whether - our food security system having been described as one of the most rigorous in the world - there are not too many gaps in Community legislation or whether, on the other hand, it might not impose too many rules.
In actual fact, we need Community legislation that is more conceptual and less regulatory in that, precisely because of its regulatory nature, gaps - if not contradictions - start to appear in our legislation in the medium to long term with the progress of science and technology and also as a result of new developments in the fields covered by Community legislation and/or changes in the underlying approaches.
In any case, two considerations need to be stressed both with regard to the matter before us today and, if possible, in unprecedented cases which arise in the future. The first is the need for precise definition of the roles, competences and responsibilities of entrepreneurs, Member States and the Commission.
The second is the need for a greater and more effective role for Europe - for the Commission, if you prefer - in international contexts, starting with the WTO.
It is also true, however, that, to achieve the latter, Europe needs institutional reform.
(Text cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (PT) With regard to the first of the two Schnellhardt reports, on the hygiene of foodstuffs, we are pleased that the relevant committee adopted an amendment which will allow Member States to adopt specific measures applying to local markets and to the food companies that supply them, and thus protect traditional production methods and food ingredients, as long as they do not present any risks for food hygiene.
This is certainly an issue that cannot be ignored and on which our efforts need to be focussed in order to improve the wording regarding these special items, given that certain concepts may not yet be worded in the most felicitous and comprehensible way.
The hygiene of foodstuffs is without doubt a basic requirement, but it is important to resist an exaggerated "fundamentalist" approach which on the one hand would subject local markets to disproportionate requirements and intolerable bureaucracy, and which on the other hand would wipe out many kinds of traditional food production by give food industry lobbies their way, thus weakening our peoples' food diversity and delivering a fresh body blow to European agriculture and to our own national and regional cultures.
I welcome this report which calls for a consolidation of existing European food hygiene and animal health inspections.
Food hygiene is something which affects European citizens' daily lives and a topic in which many people have great interest.
It is important, therefore, that all legislation relating to this question should be as clear and accessible as possible.
The call for all food businesses to be registered is also apt.
At present, no such system exists and it is time that food producers became solely liable for food safety.
If this is to become the case, when food safety issues arise, consumers will have less bureaucracy to deal with and a better idea of who is culpable.
Lastly, the call for all meats to be treated equally under the new rules is also welcome.
There is no compelling justification to treat game differently from other meats, as is the case at present.
Indeed, if a European citizen has problems with food safety only to find that there is an exemption for the particular meat in question, it could render this whole package of measures meaningless.
.
(DE) Due to an oversight, a number of motions for separate votes or votes in sections were not tabled in time on behalf of my group and the oral motion for separate votes on three proposed amendments tabled by our coordinator was rejected.
I should therefore like to state, as rapporteur, that I reject Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 17 and only accept the end of Amendment No 11, i.e. the words "The Commission shall inform the competent authorities, the Member States and the European Parliament of the result of the checks carried out", as an addendum to the original Commission text.
I support Amendment No 16 without the words "by means of the early warning system".
However, as the report contains other, far more important amendments, I did of course vote in favour of the amendments voted en bloc and I voted in favour of the legislative resolution itself, even though I do not agree with the content of all the amendments.
Events themselves, with fatal cases of serious "unprecedented" illnesses, should have made us face up to crucial questions about the health of our livestock, the quality of our food and the huge threat to consumers.
Of course, it is also vital that we set out clear legislative rules if we are to have quality standards and ensure that food is controlled.
However, before taking any legislative measures, we must identify the reasons why the food chain has been downgraded and adulterated.
And that means pointing the finger first and coming down hard on the merciless laws of the capitalist market, which turn herbivores into carnivores.
Otherwise, we shall end up tinkering with individual technical aspects which do nothing for public health and misleading consumers in the process.
The root of all this evil is increasingly intensive production, the pressure on producers from traders and processors and huge food and feedingstuff multinationals to squeeze production costs and increase output so that they can maximise their already obscene profits.
Finally, the gradual and ever-increasing shift of power away from veterinary departments in the Member States and towards a Commission super-service, of which they then become outposts, may serve other suspect political objectives to which we are violently opposed, but it does nothing to foster effective control or consumer protection.
- (PT) This initiative, which aims to encompass the various directives in force in this field within a single text, is very important.
There are in fact seven different directives establishing specific hygiene standards for intra-Community trade in products of animal origin and imports from third countries, with a view to preventing the spread of epizootic diseases through food sales, a field in which, as we know, the overall European system is not at all transparent and has led to highly unacceptable instances of discrimination.
On the other hand, I am also following, with some caution I must say, the new approach adopted by the Commission to achieve this unification and simplification of European legislation. That approach is to use a regulation, which as it applies directly will make it possible to overcome another deficiency currently found here: the disparity between the various sanctions applied in the different Member States.
It was with this in mind that we decided how to vote and we will continue to be guided by the same principles on this issue in future.
The GUE/NGL Group has endorsed the joint motion for resolution on relations between the EU and Russia.
I, for my part, would like to point out that:
First: we need to create a pan-European system of security and political dialogue, mainly under the auspices of the ?SCE, in order to forestall any concern on Russia's part about the integration of the Baltic states and Poland into the European Union.
However, it would be a huge mistake to extend ???? eastwards, as Russia would interpret this as an effort to encircle it.
Secondly: the European Union must take a positive attitude towards Russian goods entering the markets of the new Member States following their accession, taking account of the peculiar nature of the competition problems still facing Russian companies.
Thirdly: at a more general level, the European Union needs to promote the perception of and the institutional structures and economic mechanisms for a common European area with Russia, as with the Ukraine.
Conserving cold-war divides at political and economic level under post-cold war conditions would be a policy fraught with danger and bereft of any prospects.
Mr President, I supported the resolution on Kaliningrad by Mrs Hoff.
We have to follow the example given by Mr Patten in his remarks yesterday and make a clear resolution in favour of cooperation with Russia and on the question of Kaliningrad to fit in with the wishes of the people of that small territory.
Mr Putin is a friend of ours, and we should encourage him.
He has brought economic growth to Russia at a time of very great danger in the economic system of that country.
He has sorted out the taxation system, which makes the very valid point that reducing rates of tax very often results in an increase in revenue.
Chechnya is his black mark - we must be critical of the Russian government here.
Mr Putin is sensitive to criticism, and a word of caution should go out from this European Parliament and be carefully noted by colleagues, even if they are not present in this Chamber at the moment.
Mr President, I certainly could not vote against this European Parliament document calling for greater consideration to be given to the enclave of Kaliningrad, which will soon be completely surrounded by European Union territories.
A discussion on Kaliningrad will include mention of the Russian Federation and expression of our opinions on relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union.
In Italy, Mr Berlusconi has clearly stated that he would like Russia to become part of the European Union as soon as possible.
However, I believe - and I want to declare it publicly in this House - that we must first wait for the fruit of an association agreement, a cooperation agreement, and that the Europeans who have been separated from us for too long, in other words the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, should become part of the European Union first.
Much, much later, we might be able to discuss the accession of Russia to the European Union: now is far too early.
The fact that, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia foundered, that its economy collapsed due to plundering by the nouveaux riches and the corrupt authorities, and that its people were plunged into poverty are problems that more often than not fail to cause European leaders any great concern.
Now, however, the enlargement of the European Union towards the east means that a small area of this foundering Russia - the region of Kaliningrad - will be completely landlocked by two Member States. This will have implications in terms of pollution, trafficking in drugs, weapons and human beings.
We suddenly find out that it is in the best interests of the EU to take an interest in this matter.
How can it resolve these problems? The European Union does not, in fact, have a solution, and the report acknowledges this.
It reiterates its fervent wishes as well as proposing to organise European-Russian border patrols on both sides of the border, in order to make it more difficult than at present for those who live there to cross the border.
As for the subsidies that the EU is preparing to grant Kaliningrad, and which are designed to transform it into a 'pilot region' acting as a bridge between the EU and the rest of Russia, we all know that these will only be used to line the pockets of the local ruling mafiosi.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Once upon a time, East Prussia was a threatening German enclave in the middle of the Slavonic and Baltic areas.
Soon, the Kaliningrad oblast, the northern half of former East Prussia, will be a Russian enclave surrounded by EU Member States.
This is a region that enjoys a much lower level of prosperity, which suffers from considerable environmental pollution and needs free passage through the Polish-Lithuanian border region to Belarus and Russia.
Due to the introduction of compulsory visas for current and future EU Member States, this region threatens to become cut off from the state to which it belongs.
Over the past decade, western Europe has occasionally mooted the idea of assigning the Kaliningrad region to Volga Germans who lost their own Soviet Republic during the Second World War, or to other population groups, such as the Russian minorities in the Baltic states, without taking into consideration the current population which flocked in from all corners of the former Soviet Union between 1945 and 1991.
Fortunately, the rapporteur is making a deliberate attempt not to reclaim Kaliningrad for Germany by separating it from Russia and replacing the current population with another.
I support the course taken, namely to treat the Kaliningrad oblast as an experimental part of Russia that, with Russia's approval, is strongly involved in its EU surroundings and is granted financial aid for this purpose.
Mr President, stability and growth programmes are what allow governments to trample on the weak and the poor, including pensioners and the elderly, telling them that they have no money to support them or pay their pensions because they have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact.
That is not true, as we are all aware.
It would be possible to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and pay and increase all the pensions, giving the poor people who have nothing the means to live, but reducing the State's less useful outlays.
I therefore call upon all the elderly citizens of Europe, instead of dividing their votes between all the right- or left-wing parties that exist in their States - thus breaking up 33% of the votes, for the elderly represent 33% of the electorate - to form a pensioners' party, which would then receive 33% of the votes and send 208 representatives to this House, who would certainly be more effective than a single representative.
The Marinos report that the European Parliament has just adopted presents a very comforting view of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes within the framework of the EMU.
We do not share this view.
It is true that the Stability and Growth Pact is a natural consequence of the interdependence that the euro creates between Member States - for better, for worse.
It aims to achieve budgetary rectitude, which in principle is healthy.
The first months of its implementation have unfortunately been littered with increasingly serious incidents involving Ireland, Italy, Germany and Portugal.
Now it is the turn of France to be in the hot seat.
These differences of opinion express, with increasing urgency, the need for the national economies and societies to develop at their own pace, in accordance with their own specific characteristics, without being encased in a rigid straitjacket that aims to make everything uniform.
Therefore, the logic of the euro is beginning to frustrate the logic of nations. These two approaches will soon clash head-on.
Which is the more important for democracy?
It is clearly the logic of the nations.
But which is the more powerful?
The answer to that is more difficult, and this is why we have always thought that the euro adventure gives cause for concern.
- (PT) We voted against the Marinos report because it essentially supports the application of the Stability and Growth Pact, as the Commission has indeed just advocated in Commissioner Solbes's speech, which emphasised the importance of stability and of achieving a near-balanced or surplus budget outcome by 2004 at the latest.
In various parts of the report what emerges most clearly is the reliance on neoliberal revenues which means that it is always the same people who bear the burden of budgetary and economic difficulties - the workers.
Thus it advocates a moderate wage policy combined with respect for a 3% budget deficit limit and the "the implementation of structural reforms in sectors of the economy, particularly in the products and capital markets, including the pension sector, as well as in the transport, energy, communication and labour markets".
In other words, more of the same!
With regard to the situation in Portugal and Germany, the report criticises the failure to rigorously apply the Stability and Growth Pact, which is unacceptable and deeply inequitable, firstly because it is not comparing like with like, and secondly because it does not take into account socio-economic reality in Portugal, which has the highest rates of poverty in the European Union.
What is needed, as we have advocated, is for the Stability and Growth Pact to be suspended, rather than the measures that the Portuguese government has just taken in its amending budget.
. (DE) Economic growth in the EU as a whole fell to 1.6% in 2001 (compared with 3.3% in 2000), the unemployment rate remained more or less stable at 7.7% in December 2001, compared with 7.9% in December 2000, the rate of inflation rose from 2.1% in December 2001 to 2.5% in January 2002 with the introduction of the euro and the ratio of investment to European GDP is far lower than that required for sustainable growth.
Instead of public investment, a radical employment policy programme and meaningful concepts to guarantee health care and pensions, the rapporteur calls for strict compliance with the stability and convergence pact as an end in itself.
His proposals for achieving this are as old as they are misguided: he calls for expenditure to be capped (naturally with social transfer benefits as the main source of savings) instead of calling for improvements on the income side and he calls for wage restraint at a time when wages are generally falling in real terms and transnational groups are making a killing and often do not even have to pay any tax.
How is this sort of strategy expected to force demand?
I cannot vote in favour of such a report.
The report insists on the strict application of the stability pact, which has reduced the standard of living of huge swathes of the population and, despite all the publicity it has received, has done nothing to help turn the European economy around or achieve high rates of growth.
It reinforces the anti-grass roots policy of constantly higher profits with proposals which provide cover for the rampant neo-liberal economic and social policy of the ?U and its tragic consequences.
At a time when the social and economic situation is worsening and inequalities are spreading, it advocates a policy of structural reform to apportion unemployment, make flexible forms of work and job uncertainty and insecurity the rule, condemn millions of citizens to poverty, penury and marginalisation, reduce wage costs and ensure that big business keeps making bigger and better profits.
It calls, for the sake of sound public finances, for faster dismantling of pension systems and full liberalisation of the markets, offering the monopolies blanket unaccountability in the process.
Calls for budgetary prudence are merely an attempt to justify the constant reduction in expenditure on social protection, education, health and public utilities, while expenditure to strengthen big business remains untouched and the unfair taxes paid by the workers keep rising.
We are voting against the motion because the policies of the ?U and the Member States are incompatible with the needs of workers, farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises and are dictated by and serve the interests of big business.
We stand by those in society who oppose and are fighting to overturn the insensitive economic and social policy imposed by the Stability Pact.
- (PT) For a Portuguese Member of Parliament from the CDS/Partido Popular, a party which has been notable for its opposition to and criticism of the very negative way in which the Socialist government routed in Portugal's elections on 17 March has run the economy and the public finances of our country in recent years - and, indeed, during the period under review - it was particularly difficult for me to formulate my position on Mr Marinos's important report.
On the one hand, we support many of his criticisms and the way he has drawn attention to worrying situations in various countries.
But on the other hand, we cannot support him in advocating that the Council should have adopted more draconian measures.
Nevertheless, it really is regrettable that things should have gone this far.
When it comes to Portugal it seems that what is most important now, rather than complaining about the past, is to focus the attention and will of everyone interested in these issues on vigorously supporting the redoubled efforts of the new Portuguese Government, in very difficult circumstances, to get things back onto a more positive track as soon as possible. An example of this came at the end of yesterday's debate when, in response to me, Commissioner Solbes specifically recognised this.
I am certain that these efforts on the part of the new Portuguese authorities will be recognised and appropriately supported at political level by all the European institutions and that those efforts will be supported by a majority of Members of this House.
Mr President, when we look at relations with the United States, we have to ask ourselves whether or not the United States is prepared to adhere to multilateral agreements.
We have seen what has happened in relation to Kyoto; we saw the attempt to sabotage the UN Conference on the proliferation of small arms and we now see the Farm Bill, which threatens to exceed the limits set out in the WTO in terms of subsidies for farmers.
What is worrying about this is that in the Doha agreement both the EU and the United States promised the smaller countries that they would have access to our textile and agricultural markets.
Now the US seems to be going back on that, just as it has done with textiles in relation to the Caribbean countries.
The real danger is not only the message the Farm Bill sends out to the poorer countries, but that it will also encourage those Members of the EU who are opposed to our own farm reform.
We have made enormous progress in CAP reform, but a lot more is needed.
I would hope that the actions by the United States in pursuit of "pork barrel" politics, because of the elections in November, are not going to encourage those Members of the EU who are opposed to further reform.
Mr President, in the context of the previous report, we talked about relations between the European Union and Russian Federation.
Now, this report by Mr Elles discusses relations between the European Union and the United States of America.
I voted for the motion because I feel that relations should be closer.
Indeed, I would go so far as to propose that an interparliamentary committee be created, made up of members of the US Congress and Members of the European Parliament and meeting several times a year.
First of all, however, I would like the United States to abolish the death penalty and reduce the indiscriminate sale of weapons in all large stores, in all the department stores in the country.
That would greatly help to further improve the already excellent relations between the European Union and the United States of America.
- (PT) There are many aspects of the resolution approved today by the European Parliament which give rise to criticism and profound disagreement.
One of these is the way NATO is seen as a central pillar in defining relations between the countries of the European Union and the United States, and in particular the desire to achieve a partnership for world domination, with priority being given to the establishment of a "European army" and the development of the arms industry.
Despite the timid references made to the United States' failure to observe the terms of various key international protocols, conventions and treaties, the resolution fails to criticise or condemn the USA for its responsibility for the present deterioration in the international situation, for the war, for increasing military interventionism, for the arms race, and for its responsibility for supporting the criminal policies being pursued by the Israeli Government against the Palestinian people.
What also needs to be stressed is the EU's timid reaction to the United States' non-compliance with international trade rules, in particular in the case of steel and aid for agricultural exports, while there is a total absence of any condemnation of the United States' embargo against Cuba, or the so-called Colombia Plan, to name just a few examples.
The basic purpose of this report is to ensure that the ?U does not play second fiddle to the USA when it comes to planning and carrying out aggressive warfare, dividing up markets and implementing a strategy to subdue the popular movements opposed to the "new world order".
As far as the ?U is concerned, ???? is a "fundamental guarantee for the Euro-Atlantic stability and security [and] the essential framework for coalition operations" and the EU aims to be a "coherent, reliable and equal partner to the US" in the context of NATO.
The report therefore recommends that the Member States increase their military spending.
Imperialist intervention in Afghanistan, the threat of global war, the US withdrawal from the ??? Treaty, preparations for star wars, the prospect of the nightmare of nuclear war and the abolition of basic democratic rights are either completely ignored by the rapporteur or are broached with regret, because the US has acted without consulting the ?U, ???? or the UN.
Competition between the imperialist powers finds expression in the report's call for the US to honour its commitments to the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank.
That Plenary voted in favour of the report is proof positive of the fact that Parliament has ambitions for a more autocratic, militaristic and aggressive ?U. That comes as no surprise to us Communists.
The fact that the people of the ?U and throughout the world have realised this and are fighting against is an encouraging sign.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
- (PT) In general, the Elles report is a very good one.
Its main objective is to add to the debate on enhancing relations in a new global context by setting out the Parliament's official position in this area.
We consider that the strategy adopted in drawing up this report was reasonably effective.
The rapporteur from time to time stresses, with a certain regularity, the concept of "new global challenges".
This applies both to security and to the economy, thus justifying the present need to reinforce transatlantic relations.
Nevertheless, this report, and thus the resolution contained in it, make a clear appeal for the communitarisation of the ESDP, as in Paragraph 9 of the resolution.
I do not agree with that, and I consider that the criticism of the foreign policy of the United States is inappropriate. This criticism does not contribute to the climate of confidence needed to resolve these questions openly, nor to reinforcing the indisputable common heritage that unites and should continue to unite Europe and the United States.
That is why I have abstained.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.19 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Before we proceed with our agenda, I just note for the benefit of Members in the House that last week I made a brief working visit to Cyprus.
As you know, this is a very crucial and decisive time for the whole enlargement process and especially for Cyprus.
There is now an unprecedented window of opportunity to try to press for a comprehensive settlement in which the imminence of European Union accession can play a role.
It certainly represents a compelling deadline.
I mention this because today, the United Nations Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan is in Cyprus.
I would like to express to him, on behalf of Parliament, our hope that his visit will lend a new impetus to the face-to-face talks taking place in Cyprus through his good offices.
I would ask this House to join me in sending a message of support and encouragement to both parties to seize this moment of opportunity.
The next item is the statements by Mr Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the Commission on the situation in the Middle East.
Mr President, firstly I would like to apologise because I was not present on 24 April when I was supposed to come and take part in the debate with Commissioner Patten.
But I was in a very different place on that day, namely at a meeting with the President Arafat who was still in the Mukata without freedom of movement.
I am sure you will understand that I could not be with you.
Mr President, unfortunately the situation in the region is still very critical.
There are enormous restrictions on the Palestinian people, military action is persisting, terrorist actions are persisting and, as has been said here, last week another fifteen civilians were murdered and more than fifty were wounded.
We must take account of the fact that no democratic society can endure weekly terrorist actions without demanding that its leaders act.
In addition, on a political level, we have witnessed the regrettable resolution approved by Likud, the importance of which we should not overestimate since luckily it is a minority view within the Knesset and also within Israeli society, as indicated by the opinion polls mentioned by Mr Solana, just as the statements by the leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas do not naturally represent the views of the Palestinian National Authority.
However, there are some hopeful signs.
The huge demonstration by citizens in Israel calling for an end to the occupation, President Arafat's statements against terrorist actions, ordering police action and indicating his willingness to accept co-existence with a Jewish State, which coincide with the statements made in Sharm-el-Sheikh by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Libya, and also the end of the confinement of Mr Arafat and the siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, are naturally extremely positive.
The hand of the European Union is clearly evident in some of these hopeful signals - and we should bear this in mind since we often tend to underestimate our own capacities.
The mediation of the European Union is crucial and we must therefore roundly reject the unfair and unfounded accusations that Community contributions are being misused.
I am happy with the speedy and thorough explanation by Commissioner Patten, but, as he himself has said, we must be very scrupulous.
On previous occasions my group has expressed its concern about the destination of certain aid for education.
The parties in the conflict recognise that the participation of the international community is essential.
We must contribute to consolidating the existence of the Quartet so that it may ensure the staging of an international conference, which of course incorporates the Arab countries, and let there be no doubt that the European Union will play a prominent role in that conference.
Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the information presented today by the High Representative gives us hope despite the gravity of the situation.
It is true that attacks are still taking place and it is also true that there are still summary executions, but there has been a change over the last month: there is the Mukata Agreement, the issue of the solution to the problem of the Church of the Nativity, and there are other important issues.
One of them, which has been mentioned by the High Representative, is the vote in the Likud Congress.
We must remember that Mr Netanyahu, who makes Mr Sharon look like a moderate, and Mr Sharon signed the Wye Plantation Agreements as executives of the State of Israel and that brings responsibilities.
Something else has happened, and that is the demonstration by more than one hundred thousand people in Tel Aviv asking for immediate peace and, finally, a fact that is not usually mentioned, and that is that the Israeli Government has demobilised the reservists it had called up to punish Gaza, which I believe to be an important shift in approach.
Knowing as we do that our action, the action of the High Representative and of our representatives in the region, is more effective in terms of its content than in terms of publicity - where the United States are ahead of us - I believe we must encourage them to continue along this road even if they do not appear in the European Parliament.
I believe that the absence of Mr Solana on 24 April was fully justified; we have not asked him to explain it.
Secondly, I believe we agree that we must speed up the creation of a Palestinian State, and I refer to the resolutions which began in 1948, at the time of the creation of the State of Israel.
The High Representative said during his last appearance that, surely, on the basis of the Mitchell and Tenet plans, what we had to do was speed up and create a Palestinian State.
And as he has said that we must ensure that the Palestinian State - or the Palestinian Authority - increasingly comes to resemble a State, I believe that the process needs to be speeded up, because one of the consequences of what is happening is that the identity and sense of responsibility of the Palestinian people has been strengthened enormously.
I therefore believe that we must try to ensure that this process is as quick as possible.
Turning now to the possible Peace Conference, Mr President, I believe that it must take place under the auspices of the UN - we must never forget that Israel was born as a result of a UN decision.
On behalf of my group, I regret that there has been no follow-up to what happened in Jenin and that the International Commission of the United Nations has not been allowed to investigate events; if there has not really been a genocide, I believe that that investigation would even have helped Israel to present and justify its action.
In any event, I believe we have to continue working with the Quartet and with the Arab League in order to stage this Conference without excluding anybody.
I believe that the Israeli Prime Minister's insistence that he wants to decide who to negotiate with is completely unacceptable: everybody has to represent themselves.
Finally, Mr President, with regard to the accusations which have been made in certain sections of the media in the United States and also in the US congress - and we have just approved our resolution on transatlantic relations - branding us as anti-Semites, I would like to refer to the resolution we approved last month which reiterates our condemnation of anti-Jewish attacks in Europe.
But I believe we should also tell those sections of the media and congressmen that they should reread the Bible and that both peoples are Semitic, they descend from Shem, son of Noah, and they also have a common ancestor in Abraham; both Arabs and Israelis are therefore Semitic.
I am speaking on the basis of one fact, and that is that I feel more Semitic than anything else since, as I said in the Knesset, we Spaniards say that we have traces of Moorish and of Jewish blood.
Therefore in reality the anti-Semites are the ones who really want to monopolise this issue.
We believe that we have to try to ensure that these two peoples who have been brothers for five thousand years find a solution which allows them to live together, and therefore I believe that to make this type of accusation is not only unjustified, but also it makes absolutely no contribution to the necessary peace process in the Middle East.
Mr President, Mr Solana, I do not envy you your travel schedule.
May I congratulate you on your successes in Reykjavik.
As a Swede, I can only deplore the fact that Russia now has greater influence over NATO than does Sweden.
That is not, however, what we are here to discuss.
My Israeli and Palestinian friends and those who want peace wonder why we in Europe only talk and do nothing.
Of course, we are powerless to stop the violence and bloodshed.
Yet the accusation is extremely unfair.
I am convinced that the commitment, travelling, money and resources invested by Mr Solana, Mr Patten and all the institutions will have long-term benefits, both in providing a solution to the Church of the Nativity problem and, in the longer term, in bolstering the Palestinian Authority.
We cannot, of course, talk violence away, but not many other options are on offer.
Negotiation, discussion, dialogue and compromise are the tools we have used to build our European cooperation.
I really would like to believe that they might work in the Middle East, too.
Violence is no solution.
The terrible suicide attacks must cease.
Killing innocent people can never be justified.
There can be no peace as long as they continue.
Nor are the Israeli attacks justifiable.
They have not put an end to the suicide attacks.
The current internal debate in the Likud Party and the potential leadership crisis must not be used as an excuse to kill more innocent Palestinians.
It is also deeply tragic that the independent UN investigation into the events in Jenin did not go ahead.
If Israel had nothing to hide, then it had an opportunity to show the world that no massacre had taken place.
No serious observer has said that there has been a massacre.
However, if injustices have taken place, then they must be investigated.
Naturally, as Commissioner Patten says, Israel must provide evidence for the very serious accusations that the EU has funded terrorism.
It is clear that corruption - on an enormous scale - exists within the Palestinian Authority.
We have discussed this on several occasions.
Doubtless, some resources have ended up in the wrong pockets, but to say that we are funding terrorism is a very, very serious accusation.
I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for taking the matter seriously, and for attempting to find out what is happening and report back to us.
A few words about the conference.
It is good that a conference is to take place.
It is good that the international community is involved, but also that the Arab League is to take part.
This is not the first conference.
There is a certain conference-weariness, but some knots can perhaps be unravelled.
The Palestinians must, of course, be allowed to send their representatives.
It is unacceptable that Mr Sharon has vetoed the presence of Mr Arafat, since he is their spokesman.
What should actually be on the agenda, then?
Should we try to solve all the issues, or should we just take one step at a time?
What should our point of departure be?
Those I have spoken to on both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides give different answers: Oslo, Camp David, Mitchell, Taba, the Saudi proposal or the various UN resolutions.
There is no agreement here.
Yet it is important to try to draw up a common basic agenda.
It would be very helpful if Mr Solana could clarify what he realistically believes will be on the agenda.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, we discussed transatlantic relations.
We failed to note that the weapons used by the Israeli army are weapons paid for by US taxpayers and that they have been used to destroy buildings and institutions belonging to the Palestinian Authority which are financed by European taxpayers.
This is also an established fact of transatlantic relations.
I feel that the time has come to stop complaining and I agree that we should try to define how far we can move forward.
The International Conference must have an aim, namely to prepare the ground so that, before the end of the year, the UN General Assembly can make a formal declaration on establishing a Palestinian State, following the same model used establishing the Israeli State.
It is the United Nations, therefore, which is assuming responsibility just as it assumed this responsibility for the Israeli State, which proved to be fair for some and unfair for others.
All that has been said regarding the need to help establish a Palestinian Government is based on straightforward common sense, because a State needs a government.
Given this context, I feel that the statement by the Likud is to be welcomed, for the simple reason that it at last requires Israeli society and the Israeli leaders to shoulder their responsibilities.
Israeli political leaders have been saying for years that they support a Palestinian State whilst doing everything they can to thwart it.
In this context, I believe that the statement by the Likud will stimulate the debate, because peace, one of the keys to peace, is to be found in Israeli society; the 70% of Israelis who say that they are in favour of the Palestinian State must take political action!
This action is urgently needed so that those Palestinians who support the recognition of the Israeli State stop the massacres against Israeli nationals.
If we achieve this, the UN declaration will be perfectly acceptable, because it creates a political framework which forces everyone to decide to take action.
I would therefore like the political representatives of the European Union, who are paid by the European taxpayer, to say firmly to the American and Russian representatives that the problem can be resolved by the UN making a formal declaration on establishing the Palestinian State.
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, many of us here today visited Israel and the Palestinian territories during the last part-session. For some Members, it was their first visit.
When one is on the ground and is able to listen to the evidence of the long-suffering populations, to assess the scale of the physical destruction and to guess how deeply the moral scars run, one can gain a better understanding of the meaning of the news that is now coming from the region.
One can also grasp the significance of the vast demonstration that took place in Tel Aviv at the end of last week.
Once again, ten of thousands of people assembled, which, given the size of the entire population of Israel, is an impressive gathering.
They put forward very firm demands relating to conditions that must be met, namely the end of military occupation, of colonisation and of the despicable crimes committed by an army of a country that aspires to be a great democracy.
At the end of April, we met the representatives of most of these movements in Tel Aviv.
I feel that their work does Israel great credit.
These groups, like the Israeli political leaders taking part in the coalition for peace led by the former Labour minister Mr Beilin, in conjunction with the Palestinian minister Mr Rabbo, embody the hope that things may in future change in Israel.
The renewed strength of this current is, without doubt, the manifestation of some more profound changes which are surfacing within a section of Israeli society that seems to have strong misgivings about using the policy of force as a method of promoting Israeli security.
There seems to be a greater degree of questioning, especially after the terrible revelations in relation to Jenin, about the consequences of the military offensive against Palestinian towns and camps in terms of Israel's image around the world, and even about the possibility of international legal proceedings against Israeli leaders.
Lastly, there is great interest in favour of the historic proposal from neighbouring Arab countries to return to good relations with Israel in exchange for a withdrawal from the occupied territories.
It is most certainly in response to these signs that the extreme Israeli right wing members are behaving increasingly aggressively in order to reaffirm, in a deliberately provocative manner, their opposition to any prospect of a Palestinian State.
This extremely dangerous policy is one that the Likud is stating in its resolutions and one that Sharon is exercising on the ground.
His staunch opposition towards the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafat, his decision to systematically destroy the infrastructure and assets of the embryonic State established by the Oslo Accords, the construction, according to Peace Now, of 35 new settlements and the organised dividing up of Palestinian territories leave no doubt whatsoever as to the strategy being pursued, unfortunately with complete impunity.
It is in this context that the European Union is gambling its credibility.
I urge the Fifteen to consider this appeal from a young girl living in the Jenin refugee camp to a visitor who came to express his solidarity. 'I do not want aid', she said to him, 'can you give me justice?'
Justice, of course, means reconstruction but it also means the end of impunity by the occupier and the end of the occupation, respect for international law, recognition of the two States and the guarantee of security of both peoples.
This is the clear message that, on behalf of our peoples and the majority of the House, an official delegation made up of Members from Parliament's highest level, should now take to Israel and Palestine.
Mr President, what Likud's resolution in reality does is openly to signal a policy which Sharon has been conducting all the time, namely a policy designed systematically to undermine any hope that a Palestinian state might be set up.
That is why the EU is now being accused of helping to finance terrorism.
That is the explanation for going in and destroying villages and all the Palestinian structures.
We must be careful not to fall into the same trap by saying that whoever governs the state must be responsible for security, for it is obvious that Arafat wishes to do all he can to combat terrorism but uncertain whether he can control it.
We must therefore take care not to reproach him if the terrorist attacks continue.
If we wish to see a Palestinian state established that resembles other democratic structures as closely as possible, I should like to hear what we in the EU intend to do to ensure that the leaders concerned are able to meet each other.
In the last year and a half, the Palestinian Authority has not had the opportunity to meet physically.
How is it intended to put pressure on Sharon to make that possible?
A government that cannot meet will not of course be able to start operating properly.
It is important that, in the international conference, we associate ourselves as closely as is humanly possible with the Saudi peace proposal, for it is this that will secure peace for Israel.
It will secure recognition for Israel, and that is what Israel has been working towards for very many years.
I believe it is absolutely crucial for us to do everything in our power to support that initiative.
Mr President, I would like to start by condemning the European Parliament delegation for relations with Israel, which held a formal inaugural meeting in March, for not holding its first official meeting until 12 June.
We have the utmost consideration for the personal problems of its chairman, but I feel that it might have been preferable for the delegation to have met and been able to debate during these extremely difficult and sensitive months for Israel and the Middle East.
High Representative, this House has always condemned the unilateral vision of the majority of the European political groupings, which are unable to distinguish between democratic countries committed to respecting human and civil rights against all odds, and corrupt, despotic regimes.
Europe has, to date, been almost unilaterally condemning outright the actions of the Israelis to control and eliminate terrorism while voicing only mild, routine criticism of the actions of the suicide bombers striking in Israel, who were under the same clear, cynical orders as those who struck in the United States.
Even with regard to Jenin, High Representative, Commissioner, Europe stirred itself up into a fury and lynched Israel, accusing it of mass slaughter without any actual evidence.
Now, at last, it is becoming clear that there can be no peace without freedom or democracy.
Mr Solana, you have assured us that Europe will continue to call for a more democratic Palestinian Authority which shows greater respect for the rights of the Palestinians.
Indeed, we can delete the word 'greater'.
However, this means acknowledging that the principle cause of the tragedy we have witnessed in recent months and years was the denial of freedom and democracy to the Palestinian people and all the other peoples who live in that region under the yoke of tyrannical regimes, satrapies and dictatorships.
We must not be racist.
We must be cautious but it would be wrong to forget that the Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian citizens are entitled to freedom and democracy; we must condemn the fact that it is often precisely those States that foster terrorism which refuse to contemplate the idea of freedom and democracy in their territory.
Commissioner, when Binyamin Netanyahu wonders what our opinion is on the Likud motion, when he raises the question of the nature of the Palestinian State - whether it is a free, democratic State or a State full of unlawful activity and terror which, as a result, breeds terror - he might be asking us, asking you too a valid question.
We welcome the launch of an electoral process in Palestine. However, we are mindful of the fact that Yasser Arafat should have been re-elected in 1999 but that no elections were held, and that was before the start of the intifada.
Mr President, my reason for taking the floor in this debate is to repeat to the House the appeal that was made by the participants of the 'Promote Peace' meeting which was organised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 13 May.
Mrs Leila Shahid, the Palestinian representative, Mrs Dayan, Mr Vilan, who are both members of the Knesset, met to remind us, as if it were necessary, that the European Union should, firstly, continue to condemn all forms of terrorism, whatever their origin, and, secondly, should encourage the search for a solution, which they believe involves the implementation of both the Mitchell Plan, which, in my view, has not yet been exhausted, and the Saudi Arabian initiative adopted at Sharm-el-Sheikh.
The Likud talks that are currently underway do not appear to support the application of either plan.
I have before me the initial conclusions adopted two days ago by the European Union's General Affairs Council.
I condemn the fact that the Member States have not yet managed to deliver an opinion on the possibility of the international conference, the urgency and importance of which Mr Solana has just emphasised.
In any case, I regret that, the day after Likud announced its position, the Council did not reiterate the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and call for them their application.
Lastly, I am concerned that Likud will push ahead regardless, even against the advice of Ariel Sharon, and I would like to know, Mr Solana, taking into account your knowledge of the situation on the ground, how you see the situation in Israel unfolding, were the coalition that is currently in power in Israel to collapse.
Mr President, I too feel that it is appropriate in this debate to assess the new developments in the current tragic situation.
I include among the positive developments the resolution of the crisis of the Church of the Nativity, although I do feel that we must clarify the status of the 13 Palestinians and the European legal framework for receiving them.
I also include among the positive developments President Arafat's daily statements before the Palestinian Legislative Council and the efforts to bring about reform and relegitimisation of the Palestinian Authority, as well as the launch of the electoral process, the condemnation of the attacks against civilians and the opposition to terrorism.
We must, of course, monitor and support this desire for reform.
In all this, we agree with Commissioner Patten.
Among the negative developments I would include the disturbing decision of Likud.
We must remember, Mr Galeote Quecedo, that Likud is expressing the position of Israel's Head of Government here, which is certainly not something to be played down and which, moreover, I am sure is likely to generate more terrorism; terrorism is not on the wane, for Hamas is still voicing its intention to continue with the attacks.
In any case, we have become familiar in recent months with the unhealthy relationship between the Israeli right and terrorism, in which each fuels the other.
I, like General Morillon, would urge you to express your opinion of the Israeli government now, for it is important that Shimon Peres has made the statements you quoted, Mr Solana, but Shimon Peres must also tell us the position of the government of which he is currently part.
Lastly, I would like to say that the resolution of the incident of the Church of the Nativity should encourage Europe in its role.
On that occasion, Europe's role was that of negotiator.
It is therefore apparent that there is a useful role for Europe to play, subject to certain conditions.
We therefore call unequivocally on the Council to be more courageous and more consistent in its actions, for Europe does have a genuine role to play and is capable of discharging it successfully.
High Representative, along with other Members of the House, we went to celebrate Europe Day in Jerusalem, to celebrate a day of peace.
We met the Israeli and Palestinian political leaders as well as NGOs.
Words cannot, of course, express the atrocity of the massacres, but I would prefer to pass on to you the message that they gave to us.
If the European Union wishes to remain true to the values that it defends, it must urgently demand the withdrawal from the occupied territories and the recognition of Palestinian State, reaffirming the 1967 borders, which requires the breaking up of settlements, the boycotting of products from these settlements and sending an international peacekeeping force to guarantee the protection of the people.
On Saturday 11 May, more than 70 000 Israeli citizens gathered in Tel Aviv to show their support for peace. This gathering shows us that we need to go further than humanitarian discussions and to start to take action.
The European Parliament shouldered its responsibilities by adopting resolutions.
These are not designed to give it a clear conscience and they must not be forgotten.
It is now up to the Council, as it alone can give force and vigour to our resolution, to agree to implement them.
As you know, the European citizens working on the ground form an effective force for peace.
They have been a constant presence by willingly forming a human shield.
I formally appeal to you to be worthy of these citizens: would the international conference not give us the opportunity to recognise the Palestinian State alongside the Israeli State?
This recognition would give confidence to the Palestinians and could set in motion genuine reform of the institutions of the Palestinian Authority.
We can only welcome the end of the occupation and the siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem: this is a glimmer of light at the end of an extremely dark tunnel.
The prospect of peace in the Middle East began to fade when the two cornerstones that are equally necessary for a political agreement to be reached were called into question. These are the legitimacy and the security of the Israeli State and the need for the Palestinian people to own a State.
These two cornerstones have recently been subject to particularly formidable attacks, however.
By adopting a strategy of terror in the form of the second uprising, which sees suicide bombers blowing themselves up in order to slaughter civilians, the Palestinians have plumbed new depths in their pursuit of anti-Israeli violence. This violence now serves to take them one step further away from the Palestinian State.
The greater part of the majority party in Israel has just declared itself against a Palestinian State, thus undermining one of the bases of a political resolution.
We must, on both counts, find a way out of this dead end.
Mr Solana, you spoke - and this is the key to the resumption of the peace process - of the urgent need to reform the Palestinian Authority, which will involve exercising a genuine sense of responsibility and the rejection of terrorism.
Only the Palestinian people can take this step, but our aid must be strictly linked to these changes.
European taxpayers, Mr President, will no longer agree to continue to provide ambiguous aid to an ambiguous Authority; they will only agree to grant justified aid to an Authority which behaves like a constantly evolving State.
Mr President, the attitude of the Council towards the Middle East is characterised by extreme leniency. This is, without doubt, because of the unanimity of opinion.
Every day, for many weeks now, the International Red Cross, Amnesty International, MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres, the United Nations agencies, as well as the Israeli and European NGOs that are present on the ground have all been telling us and telling you, Mr Solana, that serious breaches of human rights and humanitarian law have been committed in occupied Palestine and that the conduct of the Israeli army is unacceptable.
In a sickening act of vandalism, human excrement was smeared and urine was poured over the shredded files and ransacked offices of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture in Ramallah.
Despite this outbreak of brutalities, the Council has not taken into consideration our resolution of 10 April which calls for the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel.
The Council has not yet ordered the embargo on arms exports to Israel, which is a flagrant breach of the 1998 Code of Conduct, in which the Member States banned arms exports to regions in crisis.
What is worse, unlike the President of the Commission, who clearly explained his views on this subject, the Council has not formally protested against the UN Secretary-General's withdrawal of the investigation team into the Jenin massacre.
This is a dark moment in the history of the United Nations, which is unacceptable in law, unacceptable in actual fact.
MEPs would have preferred to see their ministers on the front line making Mr Sharon give in to the requirements of international law.
Through the Association Agreement, Mr Solana, you have the means to make yourself heard.
If you sit back and do nothing, you must not be surprised if violence prevails over law in the Middle East and throughout the world.
Mr President, inconsistent and contradictory events are currently taking place within the Israeli State and society.
It is true that the 100 000 peace demonstrators in Tel Aviv on 11 May offered the hope of a social reaction to the barbarity of Sharon.
The slogan of that demonstration was meaningful enough: "For the sake of Israel's salvation, we must withdraw from the occupied territories".
However, other forces of a different kind are working hard to eliminate not just the process, but also the spirit of Oslo.
It is true that Netanyahu took it upon himself to create a Likud central committee according to his own wishes before losing power in 1999.
Perhaps this puts the recent vote of that body against the creation of a Palestinian States into perspective, but the resolution exists.
As if that were not enough, Netanyahu has just said: A state, with all the rights of a State [a Palestinian State, that is], is not possible.
Not with Arafat; not with any other leader; not today and not tomorrow.
Likud has acted just hours after the Heads of State of Egypt, Jordan and Syria - Syria, no less, and I stress this - said literally: we reject all forms of violence; we confirm our desire for a genuine peace with Israel.
As we know, the Israeli Parliament yesterday agreed that Israel would not reopen political negotiations with the Palestinians until two requirements are met: a complete end to violence - I stress the adjective 'complete' - and a thorough reform of the Palestinian administration.
Sharon stresses this: there will be no peace with a dictatorial, corrupt and tyrannical regime.
There must be another Palestinian Authority.
A few hours ago, President Arafat made some excellent comments: accepting external involvement, he told his Parliament that the time has come for changes, reforms and elections and he condemned suicide attacks.
