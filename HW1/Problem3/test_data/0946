Well, you will not criticise me for having faith in Parliament when I say that, in this area and with regard to this text, I believed that the improvements made by Parliament were excellent and in fact made it possible to respond to a number of valid criticisms.
That is the situation, however.
I am aware that there are two schools of thought among you.
There are those who say that the initial text is not amendable, and then there are those who say that it could be corrected.
That is your rapporteurâs theory.
MrÂ President, my task is a difficult one.
I want to affirm my respect for Parliament: on the one hand, I have to respect the work done by your committee and, on the other hand, I also have to respect the opinion that will be expressed during a vote.
Is it not in fact sensible to wait for the vote so that I can draw all the necessary conclusions?
It seems to me that, in a healthy democracy, there can be the opportunity to vote. That is what I believe, and I am not offending Parliament when I tell it to reach a verdict, while I perhaps regret the fact that this procedure does not allow it to reach a verdict on a text that has been improved â I have no hesitation in saying this â by the committee.
Be that as it may, MrÂ President â and I say this somewhat solemnly â on having listened carefully to this entire debate, it is quite clear that I will draw all the necessary conclusions from tomorrowâs vote by Parliament.
I believe that doing so is a way of respecting Parliament and I acknowledge the strength of a number of arguments, which will enable me, I might add, to better devise an overall port policy for Europe.
I wish to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and, once again, I undertake to do only one thing: to draw the necessary conclusions from your votes, once they have been cast.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday â therefore tomorrow â at 12 noon. It is up to you to draw all the necessary conclusions from it.
Â Â  In quashing this second proposal for a directive, before our first reading and notwithstanding the fact that the Jarzembowski report brought about some real progress and constituted a solid base from which to work, the left and certain trade unions are going to plunge the port services back into a situation of legal uncertainty and political instability.
The withdrawal of self-handling and the recognition of criteria relating to maritime safety and to professional qualifications in the selection procedure for service providers were advances on the first proposal for a directive.
European ports have to invest if they are to develop and respond to the increase in maritime traffic.
A port like Marseilles needs European competition that is fair and equitable if it is to defend its assets and its jobs.
Our Community fleet needs efficient and competitive port services.
This proposal, while admittedly imperfect, would have brought legal certainty and stability to a booming sector.
I remain opposed to the rejection of the text, an action that amounts to our abandoning our responsibilities.
If the text were to be rejected, then I should like the Commission to propose a Green Paper on port policy and to consult all of the parties concerned.
I will conclude by thanking the French law enforcement agencies, which kept Parliament safe in the face of yesterdayâs intolerable demonstrations.
Â Â  . â The next item is the joint debate on
- the report by MrÂ El Khadraoui (A6-0403/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on developing the agenda for the Communityâs external aviation policy (2005/2084(INI)); and
- the report by MrÂ ZÄ«le (A6-0375/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on relations with the Russian Federation and China in the field of air transport (2005/2085(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their good cooperation.
Although we did not see eye to eye in every respect, I do think we managed to agree on the essence, and we will in that way help bring about a European strategy on a subject that is only set to increase in importance in the next few years.
As you know, this discussion was sparked by the famous 2002 open skies judgment by the Court of Justice, from which it was evident that the European Community has exclusive competence in international airline services, more specifically automated booking systems, intra-Community ticket prices and the distribution of slots or landing rights.
All existing bilateral aviation agreements between the Member States and third countries must be brought into line with the judgment, with the consequence that no fewer than 2Â 000 aviation agreements across the entire Union are up for review.
There are two ways of going about this.
Either the Member States take it upon themselves to hold bilateral negotiations with third countries in order to bring their bilateral agreements into line with Community law (58 agreements were harmonised in this way), or negotiations are held at Community level under the so-called horizontal mandate.
So far, 22 countries have already accepted horizontal agreements with the Community, as a result of which 327 bilateral agreements have been adapted.
This brings the total to 385 agreements, which means that there is still a long way to go before all 2Â 000 agreements are amended.
I therefore make a case in my report for bringing all bilateral agreements into line with the open skies judgments as soon as possible in order to avoid legal uncertainty.
I personally prefer Community agreements, since one set of negotiations is enough to replace all existing bilateral agreements with a particular country in one fell swoop.
After all, the European Community can throw far more weight into the balance during negotiations than can, for example, a Member State on its own, but this does require common, cohesive vision.
I would stress that we should conclude agreements with our key partners and up-and-coming countries, such as China, the United States and Russia, as soon as possible, whilst not forgetting our immediate neighbours.
That is important for economic reasons, as well as political reasons in terms of aviation, such as safety and security, and that is why I have tabled an amendment on this very topic in readiness for todayâs vote.
When Community agreements are concluded, it is crucial that the European Community should consider three major factors.
Firstly, the agreements must be balanced, and equivalent access to each otherâs markets is important.
This means that aspects such as landing rights, rights to cabotage, equal establishment and ownership rights, as well as state aid must be taken into account.
I tabled an amendment before todayâs sitting to ensure that the issue of state aid will be added to the list.
That is not unimportant in view of the tougher security measures that were imposed on all airline companies in the United States following 11 September, with the US Government providing funding for US airline companies but not for the others, which amounts to distortion of competition.
Secondly, my report underlines the fact that the opening up of markets should always be preceded by convergence of regulations, and the need for the degree of liberalisation to be coupled to fair and competitive conditions.
The European Union is either working on, or already has, rules on social matters surrounding safety, security, the environment, state aid and competition.
It is unacceptable that these high standards should be eroded by the advent of market operators bound by less stringent rules.
Certainly in open skies agreements, where it would be possible for airline companies of the European Union and third countries to have unrestricted access to each otherâs markets, it is essential that there is a level playing field between the legislation of both parties.
Otherwise, we could end up with distortion of competition and there is also the risk of relocation, as a result of which European airline companies would move to states with less clear-cut rules.
That is why I have tabled an amendment to include the convergence of regulations surrounding security, state support and competition in my report, so that regulatory convergence will take place in those areas too.
If it proves impossible to reach an open skies agreement, the Commission would then be asked to develop fair and transparent mechanisms for dividing up traffic rights among the Member States.
Thirdly and lastly, the Commission should also consult and inform all parties involved in the aviation industry and the European Parliament during the negotiations about the many fresh aviation agreements which will be concluded between Europe and the rest of the world in the next few years.
These three important factors are also reflected in MrÂ ZÄ«leâs report with regard to Russia and China.
Here too, the principle of reciprocity must apply.
The high levies which Russia demands for flying over Siberia must be abolished.
Asia, after all, is gaining in importance, and the shortest route to fly to it is still via the Russian Federation.
Mr ZÄ«le, therefore, also deserves all our support.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and those who put forward motions on the European Commissionâs report; as a result of this, in my view, we in the Committee on Transport and Tourism managed to achieve a good result.
I think that we all had a common goal to give those from the European Commission that are conducting talks both with Russia and with China something to work with and, of course, also to send a political signal to the Council for the giving of a mandate.
In these terms too, in my view, we managed to formulate a very clear position on the most essential issues.
With regard to relations with China, taking into account the rapidly growing Chinese aviation market in ten yearsâ time, for example, China will be the largest market in Asia for cargo flights we had several principles in our work.
Firstly, there needs to be swift progress in creating a comprehensive aviation agreement between the European Union and China.
Secondly, the agreement would have to be based, of course, on a horizontal agreement.
As MrÂ El Khadraoui, my colleague, just mentioned, we would very much like to see very rapid development on this foundation in relations with China.
Thirdly, at the same time as preparing a comprehensive agreement we would like to see an extension of the mandate, so that it would also cover requirements for the safety infrastructure of airports and for the quality of Chinaâs air traffic control.
Fourthly, the report placed particular emphasis on the need to achieve a result without delay in the field of air cargo transportation that would allow European companies to compete sooner in the potentially largest Asian air cargo market.
With regard to Russia, the most important aspect is that the Transport Committee regarded as totally unacceptable the practice whereby each year Russia, in contravention of the Chicago Convention, of which Russia itself is a signatory, collects from European Union airlines more than EUR 250Â million for overflights of Siberia.
Most of this money is invested in the Russian airline Aeroflot, which thus makes over USDÂ 100Â million profit per annum and is enabled to retain approximately 38% of the air transportation market between the European Union and Russia.
I am pleased that my colleagues on the Transport Committee considered that the European Commission ought to be far tougher in talks with Russia, both within the framework of the World Trade Organisation and on projects for aviation modernisation.
In our view, it is unacceptable for these payments to continue as they are and in a very non-transparent form until 2013.
In addition, for many European airlines these payments create discriminatory obstacles when it comes to acquiring parts of the previously mentioned Chinese market.
The expression in the draft motion for a resolution is even stronger no other forms of payment to replace the Siberian overflight charges are acceptable to the European Parliament.
We in the Transport Committee also considered that in talks between the European Union and Russia all European Union airlines must be given equal non-discriminatory legal status in order to enable them to acquire permanent take-off and landing rights at Russian airports.
Finally, may I say that we in the committee would like to see more information both about negotiations and about their status, which would thus give the European Parliament the opportunity better to defend the interests of Europeans both airlines and passengers in the sphere of other countriesâ aviation markets.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely wish to thank MrÂ ElÂ Khadraoui and MrÂ ZÄ«le for their work and for the spirit of cooperation that has governed our work.
I also wish to thank the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for having put a great deal of effort into this important debate.
I would point out, MrÂ President, that this debate is timely, given that I have to prepare new aviation agreements during 2006.
It was very helpful to have Parliament enlighten me on the Communityâs external policy in the field of air transport.
These two reports genuinely constitute an important contribution to the interinstitutional dialogue on Community action in this field.
Throughout the past 20 years, the Community has seen its responsibilities increase in the aviation sector.
The Member States have brought down the barriers of their national markets in order to have only one market now â the Community market â which is henceforth based on a full set of common rules, including in fields such as security, safety or air traffic management.
This Community governed by the rule of law is the foundation of a market that has become increasingly important as the years have gone by.
There are now 600Â million passengers and 60Â million tonnes of goods transported each year.
To go from a bilateral system between states to one of agreements negotiated at Community level provides new and significant prospects, thanks to the opportunities afforded by the large European market and to the opportunities for developing cooperation in the Community.
This transition from a bilateral system to a Community system also constitutes a legal requirement in terms of ensuring that our regulatory acquis is recognised and respected in the aviation sector.
MrÂ El Khadraouiâs report addresses a series of key problems for our policy.
Firstly, the importance of taking steps to align the bilateral agreements, which, ever since the Court judgments, have been the subject of legal uncertainty.
MrÂ El Khadraoui, we are engaged in this task alongside the Member States in a spirit of close cooperation and using all the levers provided by the EUâs external policy.
Secondly, you highlighted the need â and I thank you for doing so â always to respect the following dual objective: the opening up of markets and regulatory convergence.
This priority accorded to regulatory convergence enables us to develop our international activities and the international activities of our industry in an environment of healthy and fair competition.
We must simultaneously pursue both of these objectives.
The efficiency and credibility of the Community in the negotiations depends on our doing so.
Finally, this regulatory cooperation has to rely as far as possible on technical cooperation in order to guarantee a high level of convergence in such vital areas as security and safety, not forgetting, of course, in the problematic environmental and social areas that form part of our European social model.
With Parliamentâs support, we are going to continue to call for new negotiating mandates.
The integration of Ukraine into the European area, an agreement with Australia and Chile and the start of negotiations with China and India will be the priorities for 2006.
China and Russia are the subjects of two communications by the Commission, on which MrÂ ZÄ«leâs report is based.
I will begin with Russia and with the issue of Siberian overflights.
I should like to thank you for your support on this issue and for your very legitimate demands.
We are determined to put a stop to these charges, which clearly contravene all international rules, and, before contemplating a comprehensive aviation agreement with Russia, we need to resolve this specific issue by also taking into account Russiaâs willingness to join the WTO.
I have been increasing the tempo of the negotiations with the Russian Government over the past few months.
The issue was brought up during the EU-Russia Summit in October following a letter sent by MrÂ Barroso to MrÂ Putin.
I have had two meetings with the Russian Transport Minister, MrÂ IgorÂ Levitin, during which I laid a great deal of emphasis on the urgent need for a solution.
We are resolute in our position: we are calling on the Russian Government to establish a transparent and non-discriminatory system and gradually to reduce the charges before they stop altogether in 2013, which was the date agreed in 2004 between the Russian Government and the Commission.
Finally, we are calling for the restrictions on the number of Siberian overflights by European airlines to be abolished.
Through lack of sufficient reactions on the part of the Russian Government at this stage, we need to bring up this issue at all levels.
A solution needs to be found to this issue before Russia enters the WTO.
As regards the booming Chinese market, there are obvious advantages to a Community approach, as MrÂ ZÄ«le demonstrated.
The prospect of an agreement with China is crucial for European operators in the long term.
Yet, our approach with regard to China needs to be gradual and methodical in order to strengthen our cooperation, while developing a level of regulatory convergence that is acceptable to our industry.
The first phase of negotiations must unquestionably be devoted to improving the regulatory framework and the conditions relating to commercial operation.
Our airlines are suffering from unjustifiable restrictions that must be lifted immediately.
These aspects related to âdoing businessâ will be our priority.
In any event, MrÂ President, I should very much like to thank the European Parliament for its contribution to the success of these important negotiations, which will enable the European Union to increase the opportunities for its air transport industry, which I believe is an industry that deserves credit for creating jobs in Europe and for showing us a particularly dynamic side to Europe and a Europe in which the development of transport goes hand in hand with a high level of security and with high-quality transport.
I should once again like to thank MrÂ El Khadraoui and MrÂ ZÄ«le, and I should also like to thank your committee.
Â Â  . Mr President, I express my appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, for his extremely thorough work.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism accepted his report as an appropriate compromise.
Therefore, on behalf of myself and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express the opinion that the report basically corresponds with the position of Parliament.
In laying down the general principles, we have correctly emphasised that when, in accordance with the ruling of the Court, an issue falls within the competence of the Community, any type of discrimination between partners within the Community must be pragmatically excluded, on the one hand, and âopen skyâ agreements should be concluded, to the extent that it is possible, on the other hand.
Existing bilateral agreements can now be harmonised using this dual approach.
At the same time, it still remains to be decided how we are going to divide between Member States the number of flights that will now be negotiated with foreign partners, in cases when the number of flights is limited.
The Commission will soon have to submit a concrete paper on this sensitive issue to Parliament.
In addition to this, I believe that another important principle is found in the approach of the Commission and Parliament, which emphasises the necessity of increased technical harmonisation with external partners.
This is how we can primarily help maintain flight safety, the cornerstone of our foreign policy, and this is how we can indirectly facilitate the implementation of environmental and competition priorities.
However, I do not agree with ideas of extending European or mainly Member State social rights to agreements concluded with third countries, and to aircraft flying under the flags of other nations.
Let them comply with the provisions of the internationally applicable labour law and safety and competition standards.
Anything more than this even within the European Union would only increase the unnecessary publicity campaign against new Member States, under the pretext of the non-existent social dumping.
I also reject the taxation of air transport for reasons of environmental protection, since on the one hand there is no compulsory international regulation in this respect, and on the other hand, this competitive sector must finance itself, including airports, from its own revenues.
The best environmental protection is to ensure the development of technical safety, not to impose new tax burdens.
We have only accepted the inclusion of air transport in the Emission Trading Scheme as part of the compromise, but direct taxation is out of the question.
As a Member coming from a new Member State, it is particularly important to me that neighbouring regions, the Balkans and large market partners such as China, the USA and Russia enjoy priority.
Finally, I would like to say that in order to ensure transparency of negotiations, Parliament should be continuously involved in the negotiation rounds.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Mr President, I should like to start by saying that MrÂ ZÄ«le and MrÂ ElÂ Khadraoui have both tabled excellent reports, for which I should like to thank them.
The fact that we are considering these reports together is also good news, since it will give an idea of our policy on civil aviation in general, and in particular with regard to China and Russia.
The latter are key countries in economic, political and population terms, and also countries where aviation is developing at a very fast pace.
The report tabled by MrÂ ElÂ Khadraoui provides us with a basis for a common EU aviation policy towards the rest of the world.
This will place the EU in a stronger position, and my group very much welcomes this approach.
MrÂ ZÄ«le stressed in his report that the Committee on Transport and Tourism did not have access to the negotiating mandate beforehand, and I can assure the Commissioner that the Commission will be asked to be more open towards Parliament as far as negotiating mandates are concerned.
We believe that the position on Russia outlined in Parliamentâs report is âfriendly but firmâ, and I am delighted that the Commissioner too has expressed his support for such an approach.
We agree entirely with the demands made regarding service quality standards, environmental protection, technical equipment for airports and air traffic control, including safety issues.
We are fundamentally opposed to charges for flights over Siberia, and we believe that this issue should be resolved along with the other matters that will be negotiated with Russia.
We would stress that the principle of mutuality needs to be observed, in relations with both Russia and China.
This holds particularly true when it comes to debates on the rules ensuring a common level playing field for competition in the field of aviation for the EU Member States, and also for Russian and Chinese operators.
I am therefore very much in favour of these two reports being adopted, and the rapporteurs deserve our thanks for their work.
I am also delighted that the positions of the Commission, the Commissioner and Parliament coincide in a great many respects.
Â Â  . That air transport is one of the major sectors that has an impact on growth is not a matter of dispute, and it is something of which we have all been made aware during the debate on these two reports.
Particularly intensive consideration has been given to two issues, namely flight safety and, of course, the protection of the environment.
Where flight safety is concerned, there is an urgent need for reciprocal rights of inspection, not least within the SAFA (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft Programme), along with something that is an important step into the future, and one that we in this House have already discussed, that being the training of inspection staff and the exchange of information with third countries.
It has to be said, though, that air transport has played just as significant a part in frustrating the achievement of the Kyoto target.
If no action is taken, air transport will claim for itself all the room for manoeuvre in emissions accorded by the Kyoto Protocol in which the other sectors have made reductions.
What that means is that industry has reduced emissions; private households have reduced emissions, and air transport will use them up unless we take action.
That is why the debate on possible courses of action â whether these be fiscal in nature or involve emissions trading â must remain open-ended.
That is a question to which we will have to address ourselves if we want to take Kyoto seriously.
At the same time, we have to raise â not least at the international level â the issues of noise pollution and regionally-adapted bans on night flights, and make social dumping impossible.
Within the âopen skyâ, though â where important actions have already been taken â Europe needs to speak with confidence and a single voice if balance is to be maintained and no one nation or group of nations is to enjoy advantages in global competition that are denied to others.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, aviation in general has been a life-long interest of mine, if not to say passion, and it is 40Â years since I started flying myself.
I always have been and still am proud of the fact that this field of human endeavour â and I refer in particular to air travel â can serve as an example of effective and broad-based international cooperation, in which such things as ideological differences are overlooked.
Amongst other things, this ensures thatÂ air travel is in fact the safest form of transportation.
For these reasons in particular, I will on the whole be happy to vote in favour of todayâs reports.
Their aim is to step up international cooperation, which will help make aviation better, safer and more efficient.
I cannot, however, lend my full backing to one of the reports on account of the recommendation made in it to block Russiaâs accession to the WTO, because charges for flying over Siberia have not been abolished.
Let there be no mistake; I am not an advocate of the charges as such, since they do not represent a logical solution.
As I see it, however, it is intolerable that what amounts to a threat should be used against a sovereign state and that one obstacle should effectively be removed in order to make way for another that in my opinion is much more serious.
I am in favour of tough and transparent negotiations, but they should be negotiations nonetheless.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to pay tribute to the two rapporteurs for their work and also to congratulate them.
It is good news that the EUâs proposal for a Community aviation policy takes into account economic, technical, legal, social and environmental concerns, without neglecting safety requirements.
The importance of these latter becomes particularly apparent in the event of accidents, poor weather conditions or strikes, or whenever there is an escalation of the terrorist threat.
I would add that passengers must not be treated as a necessary evil whenever such situations arise, which unfortunately is what happens at present.
I should like to touch briefly upon a number of key issues.
In view of the âopen skiesâ policy, I believe it would be useful to increase the number of airports in those EU Member States that serve as hubs for international flights.
This would make it a great deal easier to transport both passengers and goods.
Wherever appropriate, EU funds should be used to modernise airports, and I am delighted that an announcement has been made to this effect.
Secondly, a similar level of services should be offered to EU citizens when checking in at any airport and the same should apply to the service culture and to flights to locations outside the EU.
Thirdly, there should be a guarantee that appropriate conditions will be in place for disabled air passengers both within and outside the EU, and indeed we held a debate on this matter only a few weeks ago.
Fourthly, the Community as a whole should be involved in negotiating such issues as charges for flights over Russian territory, and in fact these charges should be abolished without delay.
Fifthly, I would suggest that all planes used by EU airlines, regardless of where they have been manufactured, should employ similar technological solutions in terms of passenger safety.
I should like to conclude by saying that carriers should be encouraged to step up their cooperation with each other.
This cooperation should cover price and schedule flexibility, since the goal should be for passengers to feel as though they are the focus of the carrierâs activities, and not a troublesome piece of freight, as is sometimes the case.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner for Transport, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking as rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the report on the European Unionâs relations with Russia and China in the field of air transport.
I would like once again to tell you about the conclusions we originally reached in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteurs, both Mr El Khadraoui and Mr ZÄ«le.
I believe, Mr ZÄ«le, that your work has been entirely positive, since it has allowed all of the parliamentary groups to appreciate the scope of this proposal and the need to create a genuine common air space in order to consolidate our position in the world.
The European Union must create closer ties with its partners, which include Russia and China.
Ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a priority for the European Union, not just as a neighbouring country, but also for a series of reasons relating specifically to it, both from economic and political points of view.
With 75% of external passenger traffic destined for the European Community, the European Union must be able to present our Russian partners with a proposal aimed at a future global agreement in the aviation sector, which, we believe, must be implemented in phases and once the problem of the payment of rights to fly over Siberia has been resolved.
This last issue, ladies and gentlemen, is a genuine obstacle to the beginning of negotiations and we believe that the European Union must maintain a very firm and demanding position towards our Russian partners.
In this regard, we are pleased with the words expressed here this morning by Commissioner Barrot.
With regard to China, we are also in favour of reaching a global agreement, since China offers immense market opportunities to the European Union.
Over the coming years, the Chinese giant is expected to show a sustained growth in the commercial aviation sector of between approximately 9% and 15%.
Furthermore, China is carrying out a process of reform and liberalisation in its aviation sector, facilitating foreign investments and implementing a significant airport construction programme.
Nevertheless, in order to begin negotiations successfully with our Chinese partners, China must firstly reach a horizontal agreement with the European Union and resolve the problem of overflying Siberia, which European airlines are obliged to do in order to reach China.
Â Â  Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to seize the opportunity to sincerely congratulate the rapporteurs on the work they have done.
Reform of international air transport must also, I think, make it possible to establish a common aviation area with uniform standards.
Considerations such as the efficiency and safety of flights are not just a contribution to the EUâs neighbourhood policy, but are also very emphatically in our own interests.
It is, therefore, of enormous importance in the interests of our own safety that uniform air safety standards be incorporated in any new air traffic agreements with third countries, for this is the only way in which future air disasters can be prevented and a uniformly high safety standard guaranteed.
We have to consider, though, the possibility of support being made available to those states that are unable to meet these technical standards.
What matters is not just compliance with common rules in the field of aviation safety, but also, and above all, with those relating to social and environmental policy.
There are few, if any, references to such rules in the bilateral agreements currently in force.
Under no circumstances must the opening up of the aviation area be accomplished to the detriment of workers who may, in third countries, be employed under less stringent social security regulations.
Were that to be the case, it would mean not least a considerable risk to safety if these workers were to perform their duties under intolerable conditions.
If all those who become active in the market do so subject to the same rules, then there is no likelihood, in future, of safety in the air losing out as a result of social dumping.
Â Â  Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, of course, do no other than agree with those members of my own group who have already spoken, whilst extending my thanks to both rapporteurs.
There is one point I would particularly like to highlight.
It is a very good thing that there should be such agreement on this issue within this House and with the Commission, and I am very happy about that.
I would like to point out, though, that not all the Member States take the same positive view as we do of this idea of a single aviation policy to the benefit of our airlines, those who work for them and those who travel with them, and there are airlines that are often happier to be represented in their dealings with third countries by their national governments rather than by the Commission.
That is why we must take care that the Commissionâs negotiations with such third countries as, for example, the USA, provide the Member States with evidence that a single European aviation policy is preferable to 25 different policies on aviation with reference to third countries.
This is a dimension of which we must never lose sight.
We are convinced that it is right and in the interests of the industry, workers in it and of airline passengers, to pursue a single policy with regard to third countries.
Several governments, though, remain to be persuaded that this is indeed the case.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr ZÄ«le and Mr El Khadraoui.
I would like to congratulate the latter on his excellent work, which is particularly significant as a milestone on the road towards the creation of single skies between the European Union and third countries, and which will now enable us to reflect upon what has been achieved and the challenges that remain, and which require certain conditions of social and environmental equality.
Furthermore, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner, who, with admirable diligence, is successfully fulfilling the Community mandate and who, by gradually overcoming obsolete and increasingly inefficient bilateralism, is enabling us to take forward the initiative that often increases our credibility in the negotiations aimed at creating European single skies.
In this regard, his particular reference to the move from national airlines to European airlines is extremely hopeful.
I would, however, like to stress certain aspects that are of concern to us; mainly the delay in the agreement with the United States.
We know that this is a well-known delaying tactic in negotiations: while hoping to acquire greater benefits, in the end they must join in with everybody else.
The Kyoto Protocol has demonstrated this.
We would therefore urge you to be firmer in this regard.
Furthermore, I would like to stress the need to overcome bilateralism in the negotiation with Russia and, of course, its unacceptable policy of surcharging, which is entirely contrary to international legislation.
These are lessons that we will clearly have to apply to the negotiation underway with China.
We would also like the strengthened European Air Safety Agency to have an agreed and unequivocal means of coordinating with Eurocontrol, in order to overcome the apparent conflict between the two bodies, which could turn out to be contradictory.
Finally, I would like to say that, in the case of the application that is taking place within the agreements or the requirement for environmental rules and legislation on social rights, we would like this negotiation to move increasingly towards international rules that are closer to the stricter European rules, in other words, they should be harmonised upwards.
In this regard, I would like the Commissioner to tell us about the current situation of the conversion of the JAR OPS to EU OPS, that is to say, all the rules on flying times and rest times following the agreement reached in the Council, which we also believe to be important within the framework of the negotiation of the Unionâs foreign policy in the aviation field.
Â Â  â Mr President, the own-initiative report by Mr ZÄ«le gives a complete picture of relations between the European Union and the People's Republic of China and Russia in the field of air transport.
However, the important thing is the differences which exist as far as flights over the territory of the two countries are concerned.
As the rapporteur rightly points out, on the one hand we have the process of developing, modernising and liberalising Chinese civil aviation, which is well under way; on the other hand, however, in the case of Russia, problems persist, mainly as regards the point that, contrary to competition law, all efforts to manage and control air traffic are being used in an effort to subsidise Russian airlines.
In both cases, the interventions by Commissioner Barrot are considered to be catalytic, although so far, in the second case, the issues pending still remain.
In the case of the People's Republic of China, I welcome its progress, especially its adaptation to the rules of good cooperation with the European Union, the main features of which are the opening up of air corridors by its government to European companies, in order to serve fully passengers and the movement of freight by increasing flights.
As a member of the delegation for relations between the European Union and the People's Republic of China, I welcome the Commissioner's general stand, especially the action by Commissioner Barrot towards the completion of agreements on flights, although I would point out that, for Parliament, it would be logical for it to have access to the terms of the negotiating mandate which the Commission is seeking from the Council in relation to China.
Finally, I agree with the rapporteur that an overall agreement with Russia should not be concluded unless a resolution is found to the problem of flights over Siberia which makes provision for the abolition of overflight charges.
I hope that we shall reach the most harmonious of agreements, because both sides, Russia and the European Union, need each other within the framework of the general interests of our peoples.
Â Â  Mr President, I have three comments to make.
The first is that, while we welcome the Commissionâs move towards the progressive extension of Community agreements with third countries, the far-reaching effects on the transport sector as a whole, on the environment and on competition and the internal market prompt me to urge you to again consider whether foreign policy as it relates to air transport ought not really to be dealt with via the codecision procedure.
Secondly, what we expect of the Commission is not only that it should set out its strategic approach, but also that it should draw up a list of countries with which an agreement is a priority and seek to conclude one with them.
The Commissioner briefly sketched out what this might be like earlier on.
Thirdly, all agreements must be guided by the principle that the first priority is the mutual opening up of markets on an equal basis, it should be borne in mind in the current negotiations with Russia and China that, if the problem with Russia relating to the overflight charges is not sorted out first, an agreement with China would go against the requirement for reciprocity, for the overflight conditions Russia imposes on China are not the same as those imposed on the European airlines, and that is something we cannot accept.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to join with all those colleagues who have remarked on the excellent work of the rapporteurs, MrÂ ElÂ Khadraoui and MrÂ ZÄ«le.
I support the view of the rapporteur concerning the necessity of developing a common external aviation policy for the EU.
However, in addition to the EU aviation policy, we must be able to develop bilateral aviation agreements with third countries, as many of our partners have difficulties in committing to those common Union agreements.
Nevertheless, I underline that those bilateral agreements should be in addition to and complement â not replace â the common aviation policy.
Most importantly, the normal functioning of air traffic should be assured without useless confrontation while we are negotiating.
As the rapporteur has stated, we have noted the difficulties in negotiating a comprehensive agreement with Russia.
The charges imposed for flights over its territory are clearly against international law and are not acceptable.
Sad but true, it seems that Russia will always somehow utilise its airspace for strategic purposes.
I do not believe that we will get rid of those charges even though Russia would no longer collect overflight charges.
Every year we in the European Union pay aroundÂ EURÂ 250Â million in such charges.
Unfortunately, a major part of that sum ends up in the accounts of Russian airline Aeroflot. That is also bad for the competition situation in Europe.
For Finland these charges are significant, as the only realistic option to fly to Asia is over Siberia.
We should ensure that a level playing field exists for all EU operators.
Today that is not the case, as those charges are often arbitrary and differ from one airline to another.
As Russia seems to prefer bilateral cooperation, it is with happiness that I note that a more open attitude prevails in China.
I would hope that the Council would agree to start negotiations with China and give the Commission a proper mandate for achieving a common aviation agreement.
Finally, by ensuring sustainable economic and regulatory conditions for air traffic to Asia, we also revitalise the European aviation industry and ensure the possibility of offering efficient flight connections and routes, including in the more sparsely populated and geographically distant areas of Europe, such as the northern part of Finland.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I wish to thank the Members who were keen to react to the excellent reports by MrÂ ElÂ Khadraoui and MrÂ ZÄ«le.
On this occasion, I am very willing to confirm my intention to inform Parliament on a very regular basis about the strategic guidelines of our policy of international negotiations.
Once again, I wish to thank our two rapporteurs for their excellent work.
There is a great deal of scope for developing the aviation sector, and this is an integral part of our transport policy.
I am obviously delighted with your very broad support for regulatory convergence, which, as an objective, goes hand in hand with markets being opened up.
With certain partners not doing enough to guarantee a fair and efficient commercial environment, regulatory convergence is a priority.
Markets can only be opened up gradually when a more careful approach is required.
At times, we even need to adopt a firm stance.
This is already the case, and it will increasingly become so where Russia and the issue of Siberian overflights are concerned, as MrsÂ Kauppi highlighted a short while ago. There is also the fact that these overflights are the subject of arbitrary charges.
I am therefore delighted with your clear and unequivocal support on this point.
I intend to pay a great deal of attention to safety and security issues, which sometimes urgently crop up in this sector.
Aside from competition, we must be vigilant in ensuring that the social and environmental standards are fully complied with.
In this regard, I wish to say to Parliament that the fact that we have a European strategy and that we can sign horizontal agreements is advantageous, because that enables us to influence international civil aviation law.
A united Europe is far more able to bring about the development of certain standards and to steer them towards a higher quality, as much for the environment as for the social dimension.
With this in mind, allow me to take the liberty of telling you, MrsÂ Kauppi, that the âoperating standardsâ text is currently at the stage of being finalised with a view to a common position being adopted by the Council.
The lawyer-linguists need to translate this text, and the intention is then to send it back to Parliament for a second reading towards March or April.
Finally, I should like to say that the progress of the âopen skiesâ negotiations with the United States should give the necessary impetus to the Community approach, which follows on from the Court of Justice judgment.
In this regard, it is premature to give a precise assessment of the situation: we are awaiting a clearer insight into the US Transport Ministryâs new interpretation of the control rules for US airlines.
It is true, however, that we have made a great deal of progress, particularly with regard to regulatory convergence, on which we have practically reached an agreement, and I hope that these negotiations will give a determined and decisive boost to the Community approach.
This approach is clearly far preferable to bilateral agreements, which will never be as effective for our European industry.
This is a fine illustration of the fact that, in certain areas, the Union would do well to speak with one voice.
You will understand, MrÂ President, that I wish to thank Parliament in particular for strongly supporting the Commission in this strategy to promote a specifically European style of negotiation, which I believe must also be beneficial to each of the Member States, as well as to our entire European industry.
I thank our rapporteurs and Parliament for having taken an interest in this aspect of external relations and of our international negotiations.
This aspect will become more important, given the increasingly significant role the aviation industry is required to play in the world.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I would be grateful if you could pass on to President Borrell our thanks for his very kind words yesterday in memory of our colleague, Phillip Whitehead.
I know I speak not only for the whole of my delegation but also for the whole European Parliament, because Phillipâs fair-minded and judicious approach to politics won him friends throughout this Chamber.
My delegation has placed at the entrance to the Chamber a book of condolence, in which we hope colleagues throughout Parliament will feel free to put their memories of Phillip.
We will be presenting this book of condolence to his family at his memorial service, which will take place at Derby Cathedral on 29Â January.
My office will provide details to any Members who wish to attend.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Titley. I think that our colleagues and friends will have made a note of all these unfortunately very sad arrangements.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  That concludes the first voting session of 2006.
Â Â  The delegation to the European Parliament abstained on the Brok report because it considers the following points to be indispensable prerequisites for Croatiaâs accession to the European Union:
1.
To call for the suspension of EU accession negotiations for so long as the Croatian authorities maintain their ban preventing Community citizens of Italian nationality from having access to the property market, in clear contradiction of the principles of the ;
2.
To call for full compensation for the property confiscated from the thousands of citizens of Italian origin expelled from Croatian territory since 1946, as a condition for Croatiaâs accession;
3.
To call on the Croatian authorities to accept their responsibility, now historically proven and documented, for the deportations, atrocities, massacres and ethnic cleansing perpetrated against thousands of people of Italian origin by the Communist regime since 1946.
Â Â  . As the rapporteur in the last Parliament on the issue of relations with the Republic of Korea in the field of science and technology, I recognise the importance for Europe of relations with this growing economic power in Asia.
I therefore welcome this report and I support it extending as it does our framework trade and cooperation agreement to the new Member States of the Union.
We now have the mechanism in place for a growing partnership between the EU and the Republic of Korea.
The important thing now is to use it.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report before us, in view of the issues it raises, namely the true financial extent of the difficulties facing the Maldives following the tragedy of just over a year ago, quite apart from all of the countryâs previous problems, and Parliamentâs responsibility in this area, in technical terms, which differs from that of the financial institutions.
Â Â  . It is clear, and I hope uncontroversial, that the Maldives should be included in the list of countries eligible for aid in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster of 2004.
I was glad to support this move and hope that we can move as quickly as possible to provide useful practical aid to the country.
Â Â  Mr President, the Catania report on citizenship of the Union, which we voted out a moment ago, can claim to be one of the most undoubtedly incoherent and ill-considered texts that this House has ever produced, which is saying something.
The long and short of it was that it granted the general right to vote for all elections to everyone who happens to be on our territory more or less legally.
Willingness to integrate did not come into it, any more than did language command or conditions of nationality.
In short, the aliens were accorded all rights, but no duties.
This was indeed madness.
This was the work of a handful of blinded ideologists who refused to recognise the reality of the totally failed multi-cultural model.
Moreover, the sovereignty of our Member States was fundamentally damaged in this report.
State citizenship and all associated rights, including the right to vote, must remain an exclusive competence of the Member States.
Europe should not interfere in this.
We had every right, and reason, to reject this idiotic report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my extreme bitterness at the fact that the Catania report has not been adopted by Parliament.
Sometimes progressive trends can be seen in Parliament, while at other times decidedly conservative trends prevail.
My deepest regret is that my own group was divided on the vote on this report, which should have been accepted in the most genuine spirit of liberalism.
It is true that European citizenship is âwork in progressâ and is additional to citizenship of one of the Member States, but it is a goal that we should be striving to attain through political actions.
In doing so, Europe must endow itself with the dignity it deserves, and it must attempt to interpret as well as it can the new needs and rights of citizenship, which emerge in any case even before the law can take account of them.
While explaining my regret at the rejection of the report, I should also like to express, therefore, my total solidarity with MrÂ Catania, as I have collaborated with him and support him on the amendments as well.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a declaration of vote to make on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian Peopleâs Party.
We believe that the Catania report on the Commissionâs fourth report on citizenship of the Union completely missed the point.
At a time when the vast mass of the population take a sceptical view of much of what goes on in the EU, the issue of citizenship of it needs to be addressed with some seriousness.
It is lamentable that this report does no more than discuss the situation of immigrants and has nothing to say about the needs of Europeâs citizens.
Let me make it quite plain that those who want to enter the European Union from third countries, namely as immigrants or asylum seekers, deserve to be taken far more seriously and treated with much more respect than they are by this report, and it is for that reason that we have voted against it.
Â Â  . My party strongly supports measures which assist the upward harmonisation of human and civil rights for all citizens of Member States.
I strongly endorse those elements of the Catania report which sought to raise the issue of migrant workers' rights, particularly their civil and political rights to citizenship and electoral participation.
Sinn FÃ©in strongly believes that migrant workers should have full access to civil and human rights and that Member States should have a fair and equality-focused process of naturalisation for those migrant workers who choose to avail themselves of such mechanisms.
I abstained in the final vote on Giusto Catania's report on the Commission's Fourth report on Citizenship of the Union (A6-0411/2005) on the basis that Sinn FÃ©in policy regards issues of citizenship, elections and political participation as matters whose primary location should be within the governing institutions of the Member State.
Â Â  .Nothing in MrÂ Cataniaâs report on European citizenship was worthy of support.
However, two proposals were particularly shocking.
Firstly, the demand for a form of European citizenship that includes the right of all residents of a country, irrespective of their nationality, to vote and stand for election, in local, national and European elections.
Secondly, the demand for citizenship rights in the Member States to be harmonised, on the pretext that the differences between these rights bring about discrimination against non-Europeans who wish to acquire European citizenship as currently defined in the Treaties.
Where will this madness end?
The only possible way of acquiring citizenship of a country is by having the nationality of that country.
It is exclusively for the sovereign Member States to determine the conditions to be fulfilled before nationality can be conferred.
Granting foreigners the right to vote, irrespective of their nationality, comes down to granting them a dual right: the one that they can continue to exercise in their country of origin plus the one that they can exercise in their country of residence.
In reality, therefore, this is an unfair measure.
Being someoneâs guest does not give you the right to interfere in their business.
For all of these reasons, it is a good thing that this report has been rejected.
Â Â  The report is aimed at strengthening citizenship of the Union by making it independent of national citizenship and by requiring harmonised rules for the granting of national citizenship.
We, for our part, believe, however, that citizenship is one of the cornerstones of the sovereignty of nation states and that each Member State must be free to make its own decisions about granting citizenship.
Of course, there may be arguments in favour of reforming the rules concerning the acquisition of national citizenship following a fairly long period of continuous residence in a country and concerning the opportunity to vote and eligibility to be a candidate in local, regional and national elections.
The issue of citizenship of the Member States is, however, exclusively an issue for the countries concerned, applying their own legislation.
It is up to each Member State to establish the conditions under which citizenship is acquired or forfeited, as well as the effect citizenship is to have.
The European Union has no powers in this respect.
Citizenship of the Union is, then, subject to national citizenship and is thus to be defined by national laws on citizenship.
Moreover, the report contains a number of wordings concerning the introduction of an EU tax, uniform European party lists for elections to the European Parliament, the significance of a European Constitution in strengthening European solidarity and common bases for incorporating the European dimension into the curriculum of every school.
Â Â  .The concept of âcitizenship of the Unionâ, which is not even qualified by the word âEuropeanâ, is a device designed to destroy our national rights to identity and sovereignty.
MrÂ Cataniaâs report is proof of that, insofar as its aim is to impose one huge group in which the French, the Poles, the Spanish, the Italians, the Germans and the British will have disappeared, only to be replaced by âcitizens of the Unionâ who benefit, in particular, from the same political rights.
Thus, Article 17 of the report, which calls on the Member States to grant the right to vote, and stand for election, in national elections to any resident who is a âcitizen of the Unionâ, âirrespective of nationalityâ, would enable a Czech living in France to take part in the election of the President of the Republic.
This right to vote would even be extended to non-European immigrants insofar as Article 18 proposes extending the rights of citizens of the Union to third-country nationals residing in the European Union.
The nations of Europe, under threat of being flooded by immigration on a global scale, do not need European citizenship. Rather, they need to have their national rights reaffirmed.
An increasing number of French people, in particular, are demanding that the nationality code be reformed on the basis of the principle âyou either inherit French nationality or you earn itâ.
Â Â  Even though Europe is experiencing a crisis both of representation, seen particularly in the French and Dutch rejections of the European Constitution, and of democratic participation, with growing numbers of people staying away from European elections, year after year since the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht it has not ceased trying to force us to swallow the pill of European citizenship.
Once again, what we have here is a machine for crushing nations and national identities so that they can ultimately be replaced by a European identity.
This new âpackageâ, which comes straight from the upper echelons of Euro-federalist bureaucracy, is an integral part of the submersion and immigration/invasion process desired by the Commission.
The right of every citizen to move and to reside freely on the territory of the Member States is intended as the central right of European citizenship.
It is therefore easy to understand why Brussels is trying to simplify and relax the rules for entering and residing in European territory because it is on them that the acquisition of this new citizenship depends.
The mindless dictatorship is systematically destroying national values and identities.
It takes real courage today to display and defend a national awareness.
Â Â  . We have voted for the report, keeping in mind that some elements of the text were not appropriate to be considered in this report, including some elements of EU citizenship, the positive stance on the constitution of the EU, election of some MEPs on the basis of transnational lists, the proposal on the European tax, etc.
We voted against these elements of the text, but finally voted for the report in pursuing the better course of the migrant people in Europe.
We kept in mind that this was only an own-initiative report without legal consequences.
Â Â  . I welcome the report regarding citizenship of the EU with relation to third country nationals.
The report's key issue is that EU citizens should be able to vote in national elections in Member States other than their own, provided they are resident there.
I regret that the report was rejected as it was a worthy report.
However, I abstained on the amendments to paragraphs 11, parts one and 2, paragraph 12, parts 1 and 2 and paragraphs 13, 21 and 28 as I felt that, at this stage, they went too far.
Â Â  . It is apparent from the falling turnout at elections, the negative messages received from referenda and increasing frustration with the EU that the European citizenry are not going to be won over by sharing in an anthem or a banner.
Far from being interested in how the EU presents itself â by way, for example, of the draft constitution â they are much more concerned about what it does or does not accomplish.
Making more of citizenship of the Union will do nothing to turn EU-sceptics into the enthusiasts some might like them to be; it will certainly do no such thing for as long as we lack EU-wide minimum standards for the grant of citizenship and fail to do away with abuses of the asylum system.
The attacks in London, the murder of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh, and the street battles in France are evidence of the fact that we must, in future, carefully examine those who seek citizenship as to their capacity for integration into the majority culture.
The failure of Europeâs Moslems to accept the European legal and cultural order is a fact, and it is one that the EU can no longer gloss over on the pretext of âmulticulturalismâ.
The practice of mass legalisations, too, whereby millions of illegal immigrants have been turned into âEuropeansâ, must be stopped, and the Schengen information system must in future be able to give indications of when there are embassies with a mass-production approach to handing out entry visas.
For as long as the Schengen Agreement is ineffective and we fail to get a grip on the problem of parallel societies, for as long as we are unable to guarantee the protection of our indigenous European peoples â for as long as these things are going on, the dream of EU citizenship is one that we can do without.
Â Â  . The issues raised by this report are highly interesting and worthy of far-reaching discussion.
I should like to point out, however, that it does not fall within Parliamentâs scope â or that of any other European institution, for that matter â to hold this debate in the first place.
Acquiring citizenship is an exclusively national issue, a keystone of each Member Stateâs sovereignty and, in my view, non-negotiable.
I disagree with a great many of the premises and conclusions in this report, and accordingly voted against it.
I therefore welcome the rejection of the report.
Â Â  It is a human right to be able to participate actively in the democratic process, and we are vigorously endeavouring to bring about a situation in which everyone has this right.
It is not, however, defensible for the EU to use this as a lever for developing its ambitions to take control of the Member States' democratic structures and so increase its powers.
Â Â  . This report deals with citizenship, a very controversial subject, and I would generally be of the view that such matters should be purely matters for Member States, and that any EU rights flow from Member State citizenship.
However, this report, which is non-binding, attempts to explore ways in which each Member State can be encouraged to raise standards of equity and fairness, as there are instances of EU countries treating minorities poorly.
The eventual rejection of this report does I think reflect a mature decision on the part of Parliament, much as I still believe that these issues need to be examined and will return to the house before long.
Â Â  â âEuropean citizenshipâ is an ideological construct of no practical value, given that citizenship is granted by the Member States.
The role which the report attempts to ascribe to 'European' citizenship has purely ideological characteristics, creating the false impression of a non-existent 'European citizen' on a single 'political and cultural territory', so that it looks as if there is no going back from an imperialist and reactionary EU.
Basically, the report attempts to introduce through the back door aspects of the reactionary European Constitution rejected by the peoples of the ÎU, such as the taxation of European citizens directly by the ÎU, the strengthening of European parties, supranational ballot papers and so forth. The Euro-lust dominating the report is such that it goes as far â and this is unprecedented anywhere in the world â as establishing the right to acquire non-existent 'European' citizenship of persons who have been residents 'over a long period of time' and who will, however, be deprived of citizenship and rights in the countries in which they reside.
We unreservedly support and are fighting with immigrants for the safeguarding and broadening of full political and social rights, such as the right to vote and stand for election, full employment, wage, insurance and pension rights, the granting of citizenship to persons who have been resident over a long period of time and so forth.
However, the acquisition of these rights has nothing to do with the misleading ideology of âEuropean citizenshipâ; it is the fighting ground of the mass grass-roots movement in each Member State and at European level.
Â Â  We have, of course, wholeheartedly endorsed this report by Mrs Prets, and we are also very glad of the considerable improvements that the amendments have made to it.
It was a matter of particular concern to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that it should be made clear that prostitutesâ clients should also have cause to fear punishment if they are aware of forced prostitution.
Our intention in this is that it should be spelled out that forced prostitution must not only be fought against by means of the law, but must also be treated as repugnant by society at large, and we are particularly pleased that this House has taken note of our 8 March initiative against forced prostitution during the football World Cup, which is being played in Germany this year.
Our intention is to make it clear that forced prostitution must be shown the red card, and fair play must mean our making every effort to get rid of it.
I hope that this House will thereby send out a clear message about sporting events, for we can combat forced prostitution only by sending out such clear messages to every stratum of society, and not only by means of legal initiatives, and the boom in forced prostitution really must prompt us to get stuck into fighting it.
Â Â  Mr President, the trade in human goods, which is even more lucrative than that in weapons and drugs, has done well out of the disintegration of state structures in a multicultural society, the transition to a market economy in states of Eastern Europe, the consequent encouragement of corrupt and criminal organisations, and the mass immigration brought about by the opening of borders.
As the victims are too ashamed or afraid to testify and half the trafficked women and children who return home end up back in circulation, the perpetrators generally get away scot-free and so the sort of preventive action that is needed involves educating potential victims at as early a stage as possible and the fostering of popular awareness of the problem.
Not only that, but there must also, at long last, be tough punishments for paedophilia throughout the EU and even tougher ones for the organised trafficking in human beings.
Â Â  . The UK Independence Party voted against the Prets Report on the trafficking of women and children due to the nature of articles contained within the report.
We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery, but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues, and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution.
All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation, and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation, which would have resulted in negative consequences.

Â Â  . I voted against the ALDE Group on paragraph 46 concerning criminalizing the clients who deliberately exploit persons in a situation of coercion.
Whereas the ALDE Group line was to vote âNoâ to this I believe that people that deliberately buy women/girls who are forced into prostitution should be seen as committing a crime similar to the crime of buying stolen goods â that is, fencing.
And I think even the Member States that today are against criminalizing the buying of sex could introduce this as a criminal offence.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the report on the trafficking of women and children.
We believe that peopleâs safety is best ensured through common efforts to combat cross-border crime, particularly crime that violates peopleâs basic freedoms and rights and their human dignity.
With a view to giving legal effect to the demands being made and so raising the profile of the issue, the Swedish Conservative delegation also wishes to emphasise that the issue of trafficking should be dealt with in the European Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs rather than in its Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality.
We are, however, opposed to proposals in the report that interfere in the Member Statesâ areas of competence, for example that of how the police are organised.
Â Â  The own-initiative report concerns important issues, and the June List supports many of the basic ideas that permeate the report.
Sexual exploitation and human trafficking must be combated.
Nor can the serious crime that is often a consequence of cross-border human trafficking be overlooked.
It is therefore extremely important to make it easier to cooperate and to exchange information within the EU.
The June List believes, however, that, on these issues too, each Member State must itself be permitted to choose its method and way of working.
The June List therefore chooses to vote against the own-initiative report.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues applaud the recognition in this resolution that tackling trafficking is a key component of the fight against organised crime.
Consequently, any measures taken in this regard should be consistent with the overall strategy against organised crime.
Therefore, this should not be used as a pretext for pursuing the objective of full communitarisation in this area.
Rather, we support effective national policies and strong inter-governmental co-operation to stamp out this evil trade.
Â Â  Trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of children are increasingly forming a sizeable parallel economy in Europe.
According to the United Nations, nearly 4 million women and children are being abused or sexually assaulted.
Inevitably, we are also seeing the methods of trafficking in human beings becoming more diversified.
The growth in sex tourism and in demand for children for economic exploitation (as beggars, pickpockets, dealers, moonlighters, and so forth.), are all forms of crime and exploitation which in most cases are in the hands of organised criminal gangs.
The dangerous Schengen Agreements, which abolished all controls at the European Unionâs borders, allow them to be used as drug smugglers or robbers.
Moreover, because they are minors, they cannot be prosecuted if they are arrested by the authorities.
If we want to prevent all forms of human trafficking, we must tackle these mafias, these illegal trades that are constantly growing in a Europe that is wide open.
Additional Community programmes and pious hopes from the many NGOs will achieve nothing.
Only if people and our elites wake up to the ultraliberal pro-immigration policy being pursued by Brussels can we hope to eventually feel safe in Europe.
Â Â  . I welcome the report emphasising the importance of introducing and promoting gender mainstreaming and child-sensitive approaches in all EU policies.
Trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation is a violation of human rights and between 600Â 000 and 800Â 000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders each year.
Approximately 80% of those cases are women and girls and 50% are minors.
I agree that data on trafficking is lacking and that there is a need for a more harmonised approach between Member States on how data should be collated and, equally, that data on children should be kept separate from the data on men and women.
It is essential that prevention strategies address both victims and traffickers.
The most vulnerable groups should be focused on, first by improving education and employment opportunities, fighting the problem of the feminisation of poverty, discrimination and inequality.
Furthermore, more campaigns should be introduced, with a common EU logo and international help lines, and more information on legal rights to health services for victims in other countries must be provided.
Finally, I agree that law enforcement must prosecute and strictly punish traffickers and fight corruption.
Â Â  . The Prets Report on combating the trafficking of women and children is an important contribution to the tackling of one of the most distressing and accelerating problems facing vulnerable women and children who face modern slavery, particularly in the sex industry in Europe.
The problem must be tackled with maximum consideration for the victims of trafficking so that they do not suffer a 'double punishment' in the justice systems of EU countries.
Â Â  The sexual exploitation of women and children is a scourge of humankind that is becoming an ever-greater problem as time goes on.
I fully agree with the idea of providing for severe punishment for the clients of sex slaves.
That is not enough, however.
A common, effective strategy is also needed.
Trafficking in human beings, which is controlled by a real Mafia-like multinational of organised crime, feeds on the desperation and poverty of men and women who flee their own countries of origin in search of jobs and a better life in the rich countries of the world.
Although trafficking in women and children is mainly directed towards sexual exploitation, it is also, unfortunately, used for other purposes that are equally despicable and degrading for a human being: forced labour, slavery and â something I find even more ignominious â the export of organs.
Sexual exploitation is known to be part of a larger complex of criminal activity that includes sex tourism, drug trafficking and the smuggling of arms and radioactive waste.
In order to help fight the Mafia and similar criminal networks, I again propose â as I did in March 2004 â that a European observatory should be set up to monitor organised crime and to propose ways of harmonising the laws on punishing it across the European Union.
Â Â  . I do not need to repeat the arguments, which are so clearly set out in the report before us.
That being said, I feel it is worthwhile pointing out that we should condemn in the strongest terms the trafficking of human beings (not only of women and children, even though they are the most vulnerable groups), be it for the purposes of sexual or any other form of exploitation.
It is not enough to be firm in protest, however; we must also be resolute and proactive in deed.
As is abundantly clear from so many parliamentary reports and so many journalistic reportages, the fight against trafficking of human beings will have little chance of success without cooperation at Member State level.
I therefore feel that greater cooperation, improved coordination and stronger determination are required.
Â Â  Estimates of the number of women and children who fall victim to trafficking across the world vary from 700Â 000 to 4 million a year.
According to the United Nations, 1.2 million are children.
My colleagueâs report takes as its starting point the tragic fact that despite the measures so far taken by the Member States and by the European Union itself, trafficking in human beings is today considered the fastest-growing criminal activity in comparison to other forms of organised crime.
Sadly, this global phenomenon will not be stopped by piling up Community texts, resolutions or countless NGO reports on the subject.
Indeed, while the causes have been identified: poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, the lack of border controls allowing the development of underground networks of all kinds of organised crime, violence against women, education, the explosion of pornography or the disappearance of moral reference points, the solutions proposed in this report are very vague, general and incomplete.
If we are to combat all this organised human trafficking effectively, the first thing we must do is restore controls at the Member Statesâ internal borders.
Their abolition with the Schengen Agreements was one of the main reasons for the development of this entire sex industry in Europe.
Â Â  There is a link between combating, on the one hand, human trafficking and, on the other hand, the demand for related services from those who buy sex.
Criminalising this type of crime at EU level might, however, lead to penalties not adapted to the national systemsâ internal logic and might also lead to a ban on criminalising those who buy sex.
Â Â  .
Nobody can deny that organised trafficking of women and children is a pressing issue facing the countries of the EU, and coordinated action across the EU is necessary to fight it.
This report demonstrates how cooperation will lead to better results than the individual Member States acting alone, and I am pleased to support it.
While I have reservations about some of the sentiments contained in the report, I am of the view that the EU itself must take action to combat this problem, in conjunction with the Member States themselves.
Â Â  . The UK Independence Party voted against the Prets report on the trafficking of women and children due to the nature of articles contained within the report.
We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery, but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues, and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution.
All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation, and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than creating yet more EU legislation, which would have resulted in negative consequences.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â There is no denying the fact that the future of air transport is currently at a crossroads.
Last yearâs steep rise in oil prices led to major problems for a number of airlines.
Several of them will be faced with significant losses, and some in the US are even receiving government assistance again.
Low-cost airlines are a second problem that we face, and we must ask ourselves to what extent these carriers, which are based in developed countries, meet International Civil Aviation Organisation and International Labour Organisation standards and the OECD guidelines for multinational companies.
The key question is whether we are capable of ensuring that they comply with the requirements of the EC directives referred to in paragraphsÂ 24 and 25 of the report on developing the agenda for the Communityâs external aviation policy, and whether we are capable of monitoring this compliance effectively
In the same vein, I am aware of the problems posed by negotiations, in particular those with our largest partners, or in other words Russia and China.
This is a subject covered in the report on relations with the Russian Federation and China in the field of air transport.
The situation is probably most complex when it comes to negotiations with the United States, where relations constantly border on unfair competition.
Yet in spite of the major problems that the Community faces when negotiating with its external partners, I should like to stress that such negotiations are urgently needed and of key importance, and that air transport will not develop any further without them.
This means that particular importance should be attached to the closing comment of the El Khadraoui report.
The place where a person is deemed to work when carrying out cabotage operations in an EU Member State is the Member State in question, which means that working conditions should be of an appropriate standard.
Furthermore, cabotage in the field of air transport should be regarded as employment within the European Union.
I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that this approach of extending the scope to cover an entire service sector should be supplemented by best-practice methods.
It would then be possible, both in this and other sectors, to start negotiations on the opening up of the market and on the liberalisation of cabotage.
This approach could also open up fresh opportunities for negotiations on the directive on services, including services of public interest.
Adopting these two reports therefore provides us with a fresh opportunity for negotiations on both air transport and other matters.
What is more, the opportunities for applying new principles to which I have referred may represent a real breakthrough, and they are very much welcomed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
Â Â  . I believe that the establishment of a coherent development strategy for the Unionâs external aviation policy is of significant importance.
This common external policy can be set up either by adapting the existing bilateral agreements to Community law, or by concluding new agreements between the Community and third countries.
It has become clear in the various discussions in committee, however, that this strategy cannot develop without agreements with the USA, the Russian Federation and China.
In view of the new realities facing the global market and in the context of the various initiatives implemented by the Commission and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, this report is worthy of my support.
Â Â  . The Union is pursuing its general strategy for the creation of a common aviation area with its neighbours.
The vote on the report by Mr ZÄ«le on relations with China and Russia in the field of air transport forms part of this context.
These countries share high levels of growth in the aviation sector and face challenges relating to consolidation, liberalisation and modernisation.
We never lose sight of the specific nature of these two countries and raises issues such as the abolition of overflight charges, and the need to extend the scope of the mandate to cover questions concerning airport and air safety infrastructures.
I therefore feel that this report is a highly significant step in ensuring legal clarity through a transitional process that does not undermine the economic stability of the sector.
I voted in favour of this report, which forms part of the broader question of the development of the EUâs external relations concerning aviation policy.
Â Â  Yesterdayâs minutes have been circulated.
Are there any objections?
Â Â  Mr President, I was present yesterday and I cannot find my name in the Minutes.
Would you please make a note of that?
Â Â  That will be corrected, Mr Poignant.
Â Â  Mr President, I would ask that the damage sustained by the Parliament building as a result of yesterdayâs demonstration be paid for by those who caused it.
Â Â  Mr RÃŒbig, that has already been discussed at yesterdayâs meeting of the Bureau.
Fifteen police officers were injured and 20 window panes smashed.
We discussed the security aspects and also how the damage may be made good.
Â Â  We now come to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the security of energy supply â and in particular that of gas.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, the events in the first week of January surrounding the dispute over gas between the Russian Federation and Ukraine have made it abundantly clear to us that we cannot take the security of our energy supply for granted.
Gas imported from Russia accounts for over one quarter of that consumed in the European Union, and, since up to 80% of that is transported via Ukraine, the uninterrupted and continuous supply of gas from Russia via Ukraine to the European Union is absolutely vital to households and businesses.
The fact is, though, that there was up to a 50% shortfall in supply in some EU Member States on the first and second days of January this year.
A diplomatic initiative on the part of the Commission and the Austrian Presidency of the Council helped to put a speedy end to this situation.
This leads me on to mention Moldova and Russia, and to ask both of them to return to the negotiating table in search of a longer-term solution to the problems existing between them.
It appears from reports in the media that an agreement has been reached for a period of three months, but that is certainly a very short-term solution.
What matters now is that we learn the right lessons from what has happened.
As I see it, there are three things we need to do if Europeâs supply of natural gas is to be secure in the long term, and I shall now set out what they are.
Firstly, there is a need for diversification in the sources from which natural gas is supplied and the routes by which it is transported.
Plans are in hand for a series of new pipelines with the capacity to transport a total of 140 billion cubic metres per annum, and these must be built without delay.
One project that looks likely to be successful is the âNabuccoâ pipeline, 3Â 300 km long and running from Austria to the area around the Caspian Sea via Turkey, which, when finally completed in around 2020, will be able to transport up to 31 billion cubic metres of natural gas along a new route into the European Union.
Secondly, we need to push forward the use of liquefied natural gas.
The current capacity of existing facilities amounts to some 60 billion cubic metres per annum.
Projects are up and running in certain countries to establish new terminals or extend existing plant.
It is to be expected that capacity will increase to 160 billion cubic metres per annum by 2010.
The European Union should aim for a five-fold increase in the quantity of LNG that it imports by 2010, which will enable it to receive supplies from other regions not capable of being connected to the EU by means of a pipeline.
There is, thirdly, a need for greater transparency on the hydrocarbon markets in order to make prices less volatile and to ensure stable prices that reflect the market, while also improving the quality of information on the quantities of natural gas imported, and in this a considerable level of investment is essential.
It is crucial that there should be as inviting a prospect as possible for investment in energy if businesses are to be prepared to actually make these investments at all.
In the short term, we will have to give consideration to how we avoid situations of this sort coming about, or how we can deal with them without fallout.
One option, to be sure, is greater integration of the supply network in the European Union, which would have the effect of simplifying the exchange of gas within the Community, thus reducing the dependency of individual Member States on certain states by which gas is supplied or through which it has to pass.
Having more gas traded within the Community does, of course, presuppose the availability of gas in the necessary quantities and that is why we also have to work at supporting the establishment of liquid wholesale markets.
Another short-term instrument is without doubt the storage of gas reserves to bridge the gap when supplies are interrupted for up to two months, although account will need to be taken of specific national requirements, such as whether to use geological voids, power stations or industrial premises for storage purposes.
The Austrian Presidency will give priority to energy policy and in particular to secure energy supplies.
Security of supply, alongside competitiveness and of course sustainability, is one of the pillars on which European energy policy reposes, both at national and at Community level.
Europe must redouble its efforts to be equal to the challenges presented by energy policy, for by 2030 the world will be using 50% more energy and Europe will become even more markedly dependent on the importation of fossil energy sources.
All things considered, if we want to guarantee the European public and industry a secure supply of energy, we will have to opt for an approach that incorporates various strategies.
Within the European Community, we will have to further diversify energy supply by making more use of renewable energy sources, which may entail a three-fold increase in the use of biomass by 2010.
European energy supply is to be founded, , on the cost-effective use of renewable energies.
Other options for Europe will include the use of coal with clean technologies and, in the long term, of hydrogen.
The Austrian view, however, is that the use of nuclear energy is not an option.
Where supply is concerned, it will be necessary to press on with our efforts to create a European single internal market and increase investments in energy supply.
Turning to consumption, on the other hand, energy efficiency in the Community needs to be improved.
There are at present great disparities between the Member States in terms of energy efficiency, defined as energy consumption per unit of the gross domestic product.
As our basis for this, we can take the agreement between Parliament and the Council on the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.
What happened at New Year also showed how important are the European Unionâs relations with its partners.
These partnerships need to be sustained consistently both at multilateral level â whether through the dialogues in the International Energy Forum or under the energy treaty with South-Eastern Europe â and at bilateral level as part of the EUâs dialogues with Russia and the OPEC.
Willingness to cooperate is an absolutely essential element in securing energy supply.
There are, then, a multiplicity of options available to us.
It is for us to make effective and speedy use of them.
As securing the European Unionâs future energy supply is in the interests of all Member States, I am convinced that we will succeed in doing that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for finding time today to debate the security of energy supplies and particularly gas.
In a way, it is a continuation of the debate we had on high oil prices last year.
The current price of oil is more than USD 60 per barrel.
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia triggered the debate on the security of supply to the European Union.
The gas dispute hit the headlines at the beginning of this year when Russia stopped its supply to Ukraine for a day and a half.
That also had an impact on the EU through a reduction in the amount of gas reaching the European Union.
While it is reassuring in the short term that an agreement was reached between Ukraine and Russia, we must be under no illusions.
The issue has not gone away.
Commercial negotiations between the two sides will continue in order to find a price adjustment formula that is mutually acceptable.
We have also seen the repercussions internally in Ukraine, with the vote of no confidence in the government last week.
Nor must we forget that the gas price dispute between Russia and Moldova was resolved only yesterday, with more detailed negotiations in the near future.
I firmly believe that everyone needs to learn the lessons from the events at the beginning of the year.
So, what are the lessons the EU should draw from this dispute?
Firstly, in the context of this particular dispute, the EU was, and should be, proactive.
We not only maintained close bilateral contacts with both parties throughout the dispute but also urged them to resolve this dispute.
While it is evident that the EU could not and should not take sides, we made it clear to both sides that it was in their strong interest to come to an agreement rapidly.
In such a situation it is very important to have close cooperation between the Council â in particular the Presidency â and the Commission.
Secondly, the dispute has underlined the usefulness of the energy dialogues with Russia and Ukraine.
Those dialogues have provided us with the contacts necessary to impress our concerns and views upon both parties in a framework of mutual trust and common interest.
At the same time, it clearly underlines the need to give greater momentum to dialogue.
Thirdly, this dispute has underlined the importance of and the need for a clearer, more cohesive and proactive EU-wide energy security policy.
While it is true that the Commission and Parliament have argued for this for many years, the time is now right to make real progress on this.
I should like to stress the importance of developing a common approach to energy, which was highlighted at the Hampton Court informal summit and in the meeting between the Presidency and the Commission at the start of the Austrian Presidency.
In his speech today, the President-in-Office clearly indicated the importance the Presidency attaches to this particular issue and that many concrete and clear proposals have been made.
During the crisis we witnessed a certain lack of transparency in the European gas market that has made it quite challenging to monitor and assess accurately how this shortfall was being handled.
The 2004 directive concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supplies, once fully transposed, should assist.
Addressing those kinds of issues is one of the objectives of the energy market observation system which is under development in my services.
More generally, this incident has thrown into sharp focus our increasing dependency on external energy supply.
The necessity of adopting and developing a common EU approach will be addressed in a green paper on energy policy that the Commission is currently preparing.
Clearly, the development of a common approach to the external energy dimension will be a fundamental element in the green paper.
This external energy dimension should be based on a diversification of different energies, as well as on different energy sources, routes, suppliers and transit networks.
There is a clear need for more investment in LNG terminals, in gas pipelines for diversification of supplies and gas storage facilities.
While the EU has been engaged, via its technical assistance programmes, in promoting the development of new supply routes, and upgrading and enhancing existing routes, it is clear that other major energy consumers also take a very proactive and political approach to this issue.
Europe will have to learn some lessons here, although one should not underestimate the complexity of this task.
There are also, of course, the internal aspects of an EU energy policy to consider: firstly, the need to ensure that an internal EU-wide energy market is a practical reality.
There is still some way to go to achieve a real internal market in both electricity and gas.
Then there is the need to facilitate the necessary infrastructure investments required to ensure that the various national energy markets in the EU can really become more integrated.
Here it is important for us all to recognise that this calls for the necessary means also to be provided including, where necessary, financial support.
We also need to ensure that sufficient policy and financial support is given to research in priority areas and to ensure that more efficient energy technologies, including cleaner coal and renewable energy technologies, can penetrate the market.
We need more actively to pursue policies and measures that can achieve real energy savings and efficient use of energy and thus diminish our external dependency.
We have adopted ambitious legislation.
Now it is time to implement it.
Finally, we need to improve energy security measures to enhance the solidarity mechanisms to face the challenges of possible disruptions to energy supplies.
One should keep in mind that this particular dispute, as it affected the EU, was resolved in a very short time, but we must be prepared for longer-lasting disputes.
In conclusion, this dispute has again been a real wake-up call for us all.
While it is true that energy is just a commodity, it is a commodity that is fundamental for our continued economic development and wellbeing.
We must learn the lessons from this episode, which I will sum up as a need for a common European energy policy.
This policy needs to be clear, coherent and effective both internally and externally, corresponding to the goals of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.
Â Â  . Mr President, the recent gas supply crisis is a wake-up call for the European Union.
The PPE-DE Group welcomes the fact that the security of energy supply and sustainability of energy production and consumption are one of the Austrian Presidencyâs priorities.
It is high time, since energy security is becoming increasingly important for the overall security of the European Union, and especially its economic security.
Any difficulty, even temporary, that has the effect of reducing supplies of energy from third states also causes serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Union.
We were recently made aware of how the problem of energy security does not solely concern the areas of industry or economics.
Energy has been used as a weapon and foreign policy instrument, and hence should be discussed in the context of foreign and security policy.
The recent energy crisis between Russia and Ukraine has exposed the vulnerability of many Member States of the European Union that are to a dangerous extent dependent on one supplier.
It is absolutely essential, therefore, for the EU to extend joint action to the energy field and take steps to create a proactive energy policy.
It is clear that all the efforts taken at national level are not sufficient as they do not guarantee the long-term interests of the Union as a whole.
Action at EU level is therefore clearly justified, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
Moreover, if we treat the idea of a common market seriously, we should endow economic operators, not to mention citizens, with equality in energy security and supply.
In this light we assess very positively the Presidencyâs plans to finalise the decision on the trans-European energy network early this year.
We should, however, move beyond that.
One of the main principles of European integration â that of solidarity â encompasses the obligation to assist all those States that are in danger or in difficulty, and that includes problems relating to energy supply shortages.
The Union should take concrete steps towards the diversification of energy sources and supply and the sharing of reserves.
All potential avenues for enhancing the Unionâs energy self-sufficiency should be explored.
Nor should we forget the principles of transparency and equal access.
The EU should propose a code of conduct on relations with its main energy suppliers.
We should make all the necessary efforts to establish new sources of financing for all the undertakings aimed at increasing the EUâs energy security, both from the EIB and from the EU budget itself.
We should not just think about ourselves.
Energy security should constitute one of the cornerstones of the Neighbourhood Policy.
Reality calls for courage.
Close cooperation in the energy field and the possibility of sharing energy reserves constitute one of the most effective and indispensable confidence-building measures both within the Union and between the Union and its neighbourhood.
Our citizens will appreciate the tangible results of our actions to secure energy supplies.
The PPE-DE Group will be tabling a resolution on this for the next part-session in Brussels.
Â Â  . Mr President, while endorsing what the Council and the Commission have had to say about European energy policy, I do believe that there are areas in which we have to be rather more definite and specific.
For a start, the big consumers â the EU, the USA, China and India â must do more to have a joint effect on the market, rather than only competing against one another for energy supplies.
Secondly, we should turn our attention to infrastructure, and give thought â not as a state, but with our firms and businesses â to having the infrastructure owned and managed on a common basis, so as to avoid monopolies.
Thirdly, we have to do something about the situation in which the WTO has procedures for settling disputes on everything from textiles to shrimps, but not on products as important as gas and oil.
Fourthly, we need to develop the infrastructure, one example being the Nabucco project, to which the Minister referred, which is very important and which the European Union should support.
Fifthly, all the Member States must diversify and come up with proposals on the basis of which a single European project can come into being.
My sixth point is that renewable resources must, of course, be given priority.
I share the President-in-Officeâs scepticism about nuclear power, but the debate will go ahead and we have to ensure that it takes into account all the positive aspects and points of criticism and does not leave out the issue of how to dispose of the waste.
We certainly cannot â and this is my seventh point â insist on a single energy policy with every country; only by taking national differences into account can we â particularly in the eyes of the outside world â justify a single energy policy.
You, Commissioner, will recall how, at the hearing, I asked you for a programme that combined energy policy and foreign policy.
I made the same request of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, but nothing, unfortunately, has as yet been forthcoming.
I really would press you to put forward such a programme as a matter of urgency, in the Green Paper at the latest, so that we will have a consistent policy that we can defend to the wider world.
Let me conclude by making it quite clear that, while we want â and need â partnership with Russia, its latest actions are unacceptable.
We need Russia to treat its neighbours fairly, for they are our neighbours too.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, energy resources are among the fundamental economic and production factors ensuring the competitiveness of an economy and the wellbeing of people.
EU Member States assure their energy resources by concluding bilateral agreements.
Russia is taking advantage of such agreements, including the forthcoming German-Russian gas pipeline, and is dividing the European Union by providing individual Member States with different degrees of access to energy supplies.
Individual countries are easier to influence than the European Union as a whole.
By constantly emphasising the importance of Russia as a strategic partner and its exceptional position among other countries, the European Union is granting Russia concessions.
The main reason for such concessions is the growing dependency of the EU on Russia in terms of energy.
However, the recent issues with gas supply between Russia and Ukraine show that Russia may resort to the same tactics in supplying gas to European Union Member States.
The alternative sources of energy which must be used in order to avoid absolute dependency on Russia, that is, Norwegian gas resources, are limited and will not be able to meet the growing demands of the EU economy in the future.
Is this, then, not the right time to reconsider nuclear energy, the most ecological form of energy, as an alternative to dependency on the unpredictable supply of energy from Russia?
Another very important issue being widely discussed in the EU is common energy policy.
With the European Commission as the energy supply partner representing the interests of all 25 Member States, Russia would have to show more respect.
Russia will not be able to completely cut off the supply of gas to the EU; it would simply not have any other way to dispose of it.
Therefore, I invite everyone not only to discuss the development of a common energy policy, but also to take actions to develop the common energy policy and, in particular, a single energy system without delay, thus ensuring energy as well as political security for the entire EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bartenstein, I would like to start with Ukraine, having been rather surprised that the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which is an annual event nearly caused us in Europe to treat it as a European gas crisis.
Ukraine, and later Moldova, found themselves in a situation that had been brought to the point of crisis, but Europe did not.
Europe was able, as it has been before, to rely on stable trading relations with Russia.
As I see it, what this situation has shown us was that we in the European Union cannot regard Ukraine as nothing more than a safe transit country, but must rather, by means of energy policy, help it to free itself from dependence on Russia and thereby improve its prospects for the future.
A great deal of change is needed here.
Quite apart from that, I see this whole debate as an object lesson in the weaknesses of European energy policy, which are more or less marked from one Member State to another.
A coordinated approach could, without a doubt, help to improve the situation in the Member States and across Europe.
We have now learned the real value of natural resources.
It has to be said that we right across Europe, are, to say the least, wasteful in our use of gas, and of oil too, and this was the subject of more vigorous debate at the time of the Iraq war.
For some considerable time, our squandering of these raw materials has been something we have not been able to get away with.
If we want to learn the right lessons from this, then we must, I believe, be much more consistent in doing as Commissioner Piebalgs suggested at the time he took office.
We have to pursue natural resource productivity and energy efficiency if we are to be less dependent on others; I would be dead against striving for a fully self-sufficient Europe, which would be a naive approach in terms of the overall debate, but we do have to work towards a Europe that makes adequate use of raw materials.
This is something we have been talking about for decades, for as long as there has been a Club of Rome, so let us at last come up with something of some practical use.
Let those who think that the use of nuclear power is the right response to the reduced â or indeed finite â supply of gas, just for once put forward a serious case for their chosen approach; how many reactors do they want to build over the next few years, and where?
What do they propose to do with the waste that has been produced in Europe for decades?
A few weeks ago, we debated the report on the decommissioning of power reactors.
Right now, the whole business of nuclear waste disposal is a disaster area.
If that is to be the shape of the future, then I urge them to make their case in clearer terms, but please can they spare us a debate on lifetime extension of the sort that is resuming even on the subject of the reactor at Ignalina?
If you really do want to do no more than extend the working life of superannuated technology, then you are increasing the risks inherent in energy production rather than delivering us from them.
Â Â  . Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the world continues to see the burning of fossilised matter.
It is estimated that in 2030 humankind will still be producing 80% of its energy using fossilised fuels.
The earth has a confirmed 179 trillion cubic metres of gas deposits.
A quarter of the gas is in Russia, and another quarter in regions less stable, in Iran and Qatar.
It can be estimated that at present consumption rates the EUâs own supplies of gas will be enough for just six or seven years.
The use of Norwegian and North African gas for the EUâs needs increases the time perspective for gas consumption by 20 years, but it is 50 years in the case of Russia.
If the EU is planning to satisfy the entire growth in its energy requirements in the next few decades by means of gas, there are no alternatives to imports from Russia.
The next few years will see the development of cheaper methods in the liquefaction of gas, which will allow for a wider range of possibilities in importing gas.
At the same time it will also make them narrower in scope.
Liquefied Russian gas can then be sold to the United States of America, which needs gas, without the need for a pipeline.
Americaâs own gas reserves will not be enough for even 10 years.
Western Europe has been dependent on the gas pipeline that comes from Russia via other countries.
The planned pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea will reduce this dependence.
The project is understandable, because some of the countries the pipeline now passes through are hostile towards Russia.
We in Finland have not had the slightest problem with the gas supply in 40 years.
There is something in the gas agreement between Russia and Ukraine that needs explaining.
Who owns the supply company Ros-Ukr-Energo?
On the basis of published data, I have worked out that it unaccountably benefits from the agreement to the tune of USD 600â800 million a year.
The oligarchs in both countries have been involved in this, and what is the role of these countriesâ presidents in generating huge sums of hidden profit?
Our group supports good partnership relations and cooperation on energy with Russia.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the recent events referred to by the international press as a âCold Warâ between Ukraine and Russia over gas, and the less recent project involving the construction of a gas pipeline between Germany and Russia, bypassing the Baltic countries, including Poland, are ample proof that certain countries are using electricity and gas supply networks, especially the latter, as political weapons in their relations with others.
The Member States expect the Community to provide them with assistance in finding a solution to this problem.
The Community should pursue a cohesive and integrated policy on the above-mentioned supply networks, as well as on natural disasters, pandemics and the terrorist threat.
Such a policy would make it possible to safeguard the security and diversification of supplies.
It is unacceptable for one Member State, Germany for example, to form a coalition with Russia on such matters, since this harms the interests of other Member States, including those that only recently joined the EU.
This is one of the rare instances when the European Union should respond, and when it should respond promptly and decisively.
A passive attitude on the part of the EU means that it consents to the principle of solidarity being destroyed, and that effectively it has no influence when it comes to the economic and political problems that are of real importance for Europe.
That being so, there is no reason why the Union should not go on issuing meaningless resolutions and statements or directives that work to the detriment of Europeâs citizens.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, it is a simple fact that Russiaâs energy strategy is based on the use of gas and gas suppliers to achieve its political goals in certain regions, including Europe.
The recent gas crisis is a test of sorts for the European Union.
Its effects were intended to be felt, and indeed were felt not only by Ukraine and Moldova, but also by eight EU Member States, including Germany, France and Italy.
By provoking such a crisis, Russia has forfeited its status as a stable and reliable partner.
The only question that remains is what conclusions will be drawn by the European Union and the individual Member States.
Will they decide that the construction of the Baltic pipeline should continue, although it will make Europe even more dependent on Russia, or will they realise that what is needed is a genuine diversification of gas supplies for Europe as a whole and a system of energy solidarity for EU Member States and their immediate neighbours?
Russia hopes we will draw the first of these conclusions.
All those who no longer harbour any illusions about the new Russiaâs imperial policies hope for the second.
I shall take the liberty of making one final comment namely that the Houseâs difficulty in adopting a common resolution on this matter is an embarrassment for Parliament.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Current international political events and also economic factors, including the constant increase in the price of oil, are forcing the European Union to sit up and take notice of a situation that is both obvious and familiar: we have a structural energy supply problem and an increasing level of dependence.
World demand for energy is rising, global resources are not limitless and, in any case, our Union does not have enough to meet its own needs.
Recent events have shown how the energy supplies on which our economy is currently based can be put in jeopardy, and that is a risk that we absolutely must not take.
It is essential to promote a closer international synergy, including through signed agreements such as the European Energy Charter, which creates a cooperation framework between Europe, Russia and Mediterranean countries.
Energy cooperation with third countries is, in fact, a core element in the European supply strategy and helps to consolidate stable international political relations.
Within this framework, clear, well-defined, concrete, lasting agreements must now be made, particularly with Russia.
It is now urgent, therefore, for Member States to put into practice the recent recommendations on implementing energy saving measures, which will require a serious commitment on the part of the EU institutions, the Member States and every individual citizen.
Furthermore, we must at last hold that complex and comprehensive debate on choosing technologies for the future and on the production and use of alternative and renewable energies.
Despite the various crises, some of them recent, that have marked Europeâs economy over the last 40 years, this debate has, unfortunately, not yet been held.
This is a delay, a failing and a gap that we must try to make up for as quickly and as urgently as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Piebalgs for his role in convening the Gas Coordination Group and thereby making a major contribution towards resolving the dispute between Naftagas and Gazprom earlier this month.
This situation between Russia and Ukraine has served as a wake-up call to those who may not have been aware how dependent the EU Member States are on imported fuels in general and on natural gas from Russia in particular.
However, it is important that we retain a sense of proportion about this matter.
The trade in gas between Russia and EU Member States remains commercially viable just as long as each has something the other wants.
The import dependence of the EU Member States and the related increasing dependence on natural gas is hardly a secret.
We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have long been aware of this situation and have been debating the need for measures to address this dependence.
Ten years ago, I submitted a report to Parliament on prospects for gas supply in Europe and was criticised by the industry for suggesting that we could become over-dependent on gas if it provided over 25% of our energy requirements.
Let me remind the House of the wide range of measures that are already in hand which address our security of supply needs: both legislative measures, such as the TENs Directive, and actions by the industry in building pipelines, storage and LNG facilities.
We must take note of Russia as it flexes its muscles internationally, but I suggest that a measured, practical approach to maintaining diversity of supply and encouraging appropriate investments to that end must be our response as a long-term solution.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in twenty years or so we will actually be 90% dependent on imports of gas.
That is quite an achievement.
The amount of gas used by the Member States and stocks vary greatly; in other words, the degree to which one is susceptible to a crisis varies very much.
The further east a Member State is, the more dependent it will be on gas from Russia.
The European Union has put pressure on Russia to abandon the practice of the dual pricing of energy, including gas, which goes on inside the country.
We regard it as a condition of WTO membership.
I therefore do not believe that the dual pricing of energy can last very long in Russiaâs foreign trade either.
Of course, in business deals it is permitted to grant discounts to good, regular customers in general, and that happens in many other sectors, but it obviously depends on the relationship between the seller and the buyer.
Turning off the gas tap was certainly the wrong solution and a very unwise one.
Such things are not done in European trading; it does not go on very much in less significant areas, let alone in such major contexts.
The situation with regard to energy in the European Union is continually on the verge of a crisis.
It only takes a storm on the other side of the ocean or the Ukrainian event to start a crisis or even a panic.
We must have viable and diverse energy sources quickly, with a wide range of supply arrangements and networks of conveyance, and time is of the essence: our bedrooms could get cold at any time.
We urgently need the Commission to produce an energy crisis programme.
The resources that we now have are not sufficient.
How are we preparing for a longer cut in the power supply, Commissioner?
What kind of solidarity mechanisms could enter the framework, and does the forthcoming Green Paper deal with energy crisis issues?
Â Â  Mr President, the recent crisis between Russia and Ukraine over gas supply has shown that it is more important than ever to have a European energy market that is less dependent on imports.
This will provide not only enormous opportunities for the European energy industry, including renewables, but also a window of opportunity for tackling climate change, boosting growth and creating new jobs.
In order to achieve this we want more transparency, better regulation, a renovated and functioning grid, a European energy strategy, debate on self-sufficiency and solidarity between Member States, and rules that enable consumers to decide on their own consumption in a workable way.
We therefore welcome the green paper as well as the Presidencyâs programme.
There is much to be done, but I think we can do it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that the way the talks are going between Ukraine and Russia makes it unmistakeably plain that Europe â which is more than just the European Union â needs a new and modern all-embracing energy policy.
While one can debate the point to oneâs heartâs content, the dispute between Russia and Ukraine was, at the end of the day, one between a supplier who wanted more money, and a customer who was unwilling to pay up.
Both sides in the dispute had known that for ages.
If, so to speak, a political course is set that makes this sort of crisis inevitable, without the attempt being made to find a solution in good time, then both governments have been negligent.
Although I do indeed welcome the Commissionerâs announcement that a Green Paper will be appearing, I do of course hope that it will not contain such old ideas as the negotiation of codes of conduct for the countries by which energy is produced and those through which it passes, new pipelines or even nuclear power.
Rather, I believe that we have to rely, as is already being done in many countries, on other sources, such as biomass, the sun, wind, water, geothermal energy and cogeneration, while also, at the same time, saving energy, making more efficient use of it, and reducing subsidies for long-established fossil fuels.
That is something we have to bring about.
The supply of energy is a service of public general interest, and we ought perhaps to consider whether responsible policies ought not to be regarded as a higher priority than attempts at liberalisation or the use of liberalisation measures as a solution to this problem.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the lack of a common and long-term energy security strategy is proof not only of the EUâs short-sightedness, but even that a conflict of interests exists between its Member States.
One of the reasons why oil prices have tripled is that the EU has failed to adopt an intelligent energy strategy.
The rise in oil prices works to the advantage of the large fuel companies, but it works to the disadvantage of the EU Member States and of the citizens of these Member States.
It is a mistake for individual Member States to attempt to reach an agreement with Russia, as Germany has done, sacrificing the interests of the Baltic States, Poland, Austria and other Member States in the process.
Along with the EUâs passive attitude, this has encouraged Russia to blackmail Ukraine by threatening to cut off gas supplies.
There is an urgent need for the EU to draft and implement an energy security strategy as soon as possible, and indeed this can be viewed as a test of the extent to which the European Union is still a community.
The EUâs energy security strategy should be based on the criteria of the weakest link, which can be summarised as follows.
The efficiency of a system can be measured by its resistance to crises in those countries and regions which are most dependent on one supplier, or which have the worst transmission and distribution systems, or the highest generation costs in relation to national income.
Our concern should focus in particular on neighbouring and transit countries.
To echo Hamlet, âto be or not to beâ is the dilemma we face with regard to energy security in the EU.
In this context, I regret to say that no provision whatsoever has been made for a common European energy security strategy in the EUâs 2007-2013 budget.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
The Christmas greeting from the Russian President to gas consumers in Ukraine was in no way a surprise.
With its interruption to the gas supply in the very middle of winter, Russia reminded not only Ukraine but also the worldâs energy markets, that power currently lies with energy suppliers.
Energy consumers will have to take this into account for an unforeseeably long time.
I would like to express my gratitude to Commissioner Piebalgs, who during the Russia-Ukraine gas crisis made use of the European Unionâs influence early enough to prevent an energy crisis in Europe.
With regard to the conclusions to be drawn following the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, the European Union must itself display and must ask the other countries in Europe for total openness regarding information about developments in gas prices.
I believe that recent events give the Commission special authorisation to implement the legislation that has been passed, to implement decisions for the acquisition of alternative, energy-efficient resources and the creation of a truly liberalised energy market, and to secure the integration of European energy networks.
Naturally, today almost all the speakers have mentioned this point: the need for a genuinely common energy policy for the European Unionâs common market, which would facilitate long-term political stability not only in Europe but also in the global energy market.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is in a state of shock following the crisis that has taken place between Ukraine and Russia.
This is largely because, to date, even at time of intense internal upheaval, Russia had always shown itself to be a reliable energy partner, and at no point in the past have the Member States of the Union seen their supply of gas interrupted or reduced.
Those three days of crisis were sufficient to bring countries such as Italy to the point of releasing their strategic reserves and, above all, for the Union as a whole to realise once again that its supply system is extremely vulnerable.
The time has therefore come to consider seriously the possibility of investing in alternative supply routes, improving dialogue with stable partners, such as the Republic of Kazakhstan, for example.
We must begin to think about importing gas from that country via Turkey, for example, which is a candidate country and hence an extremely secure one.
Furthermore, we must maintain and enhance, at European level, research and development in new energy sources and achieve more efficient use of those we already have.
Naturally, Mrs Harms, we cannot ignore any primary energy source.
Not one.
We must look beyond ideological preconceptions and face reality.
If you want to commit energy suicide, you are free to do so, but your sacrifice must be an individual one.
Do not expect us all to commit suicide against our will.
Finally, Mr President, I shall end by calling upon the Commission to carry on putting pressure on the Member States to create a common energy policy, and this crisis has shown us beyond any doubt that we need one.
Let us not wait until there is another crisis and then take measures that are more drastic and that may well be too late.
Â Â  Mr President, I must keep it brief.
My concern is that attention be called to the foreign policy aspects of what we have witnessed in recent weeks, when Russia threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.
This did not come as a total surprise to those who, like me, have worked with those countries for many years.
After all, Russia has previously threatened to use energy as a weapon with a view to exerting political pressure on its immediate neighbours and has even, if you ask me, done so on one occasion.
Obviously, the outcome of what happened also came as a shock to the European Union and forces us to have this discussion today.
As I said, I will keep it brief.
There are three conclusions that are important for us where those foreign aspects are concerned.
Firstly, we should diversify our supplies, our sources.
Given that most of the countries from which we get our energy are unstable, the more countries we can use as sources the better.
Secondly, we must reconsider the pipeline situation in Europe.
We are particularly vulnerable since most gas is supplied via Ukraine.
Are there any possible alternatives?
Thirdly, we must make it absolutely clear that in the longer term, we can safeguard our energy supply only if we can join forces with partners who are reliable and democratic.
Finally, it has in my view become evident that energy policy more than ever goes hand in hand with foreign and trade policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to focus our attention on proposals concerning possible solutions for energy problems.
First of all, the European Union must promote the more efficient use of energy in its external policy by making this one of the priorities of the EUâs Neighbourhood Programme.
It may even be worthwhile to establish the criteria for the energy efficiency as a condition for the provision of European Union support.
In so doing, we will also facilitate democratisation processes in the neighbouring countries; our experience with reforms in Lithuania shows that modernisation of the economy provides the stable background needed for the development of democratic processes.
In European domestic policy, greater attention should be paid to the development and implementation of an innovation centre dedicated to the new generation of small-scale energy plants based on nuclear and other technologies.
We already have a successful aviation project, the remarkable Galileo programme; therefore, we can no doubt also have an innovation centre for the implementation of energy programmes.
Such a centre could operate in countries with the greatest dependency on a single source of energy.
I would like to believe that, apart from the general talk about a common energy strategy, the Commission will finally do something specific and that such a centre might provide the best evidence of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, contrary to opinion, including opinion within this Chamber, the Ukrainian gas crisis was not a one-off, first-time event justified by the need to move to market policies.
On the contrary, it is a consistent policy and has everything to do with politics.
First, Ukraine had a contract, signed in 2004 and lasting until 2009.
It was terminated because Ukraine elected the wrong president and because of forthcoming parliamentary elections.
Second, the Russian Government is the majority shareholder in Gazprom, a monopoly headed by the deputy prime minister.
It is not a company.
One cannot speak of market prices and a government-controlled monopoly in the same breath.
Third, the one-off issue: Moscow stopped oil and gas deliveries to stymie Lithuaniaâs independence movement way back in 1990.
After independence, the Russian Government used the same weapon to punish the Baltic States for not joining the CIS and for demanding the removal of Russian troops.
When Lithuania tried to privatise the Mazeikiu oil refinery, again supplies were cut off so that Russian investors could move in.
It successfully followed the same policy when it came to Georgia, which gave up its gas pipelines.
To sum up, Russia has consistently used a government-owned monopolistic energy company to put political pressure on countries â market practices and existing contracts be damned.
Empiricism is wiser than wishful thinking.
The experiences of the new Member States, and of Ukraine and Moldova when they adopted a pro-EU stance, clearly show the dangers of lacking a robust EU policy on energy security.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I do believe that the Commission and the Presidency have done the right thing.
In the absence of sufficient information, we refrained from apportioning blame in any way and did not want under any circumstances whatever to express agreement with any one party to this dispute or even to betray the least hint of it.
What is clear is that the situation could very well become critical, for one new Member State had problems with the energy supply to its industry from day one, but we and the Commission are deliberately not talking in terms of a critical situation rather than of a crisis.
We must not lose sight of the fact that dependence on fossil energy sources and on imports thereof cannot do other than markedly increase; the Commission estimates that the proportion of our energy that we derive from these sources will, by 2030, increase from just under 50% â which is what it is at present â to something like two-thirds.
It will be possible to influence this to some degree by the use of renewable energy sources and by improving energy efficiency, but I do not myself take the view that we can bring about any fundamental about-turn in this trend.
The presidency looks forward with great interest to the Green Paper, or rather to the appearance of the first parts of it in time for the Spring Summit.
When, if not now, are we to discuss the development of a common European energy policy?
What prompts us to go further down this road is the gas issue, Russia, Ukraine, and the problem of supply, as well as oil prices, climate change and many other considerations too.
Both I personally, and the presidency as a whole, endorse the Commissionâs proposal for the creation of a two-month reserve similar to that which already exists at another level for oil.
Your House will have an opportunity to discuss the details of this later on.
As I said in my statement on Moldova, we have sought in many respects to give priority to that country in our neighbourhood policy.
Despite Mr Swobodaâs assertion that having Russia as a member of the WTO would open up certain possibilities in this respect, even then, it would be possible to do but little within the space of 36Â hours.
What is interesting is that Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter, and so there can be no recourse to the dispute resolution procedure for which it provides.
It is, then, energy efficiency that must quite clearly be given priority, along with renewable energies and the fostering of the awareness that we must, in various ways, and to an even greater extent than before, address the issue of gas imports.
It remains for me to observe that, over the coming years and decades, Russia and Russian natural gas will become the backbone of the European Unionâs gas supply.
Speaking as an Austrian, I would like to point out that it was an Austrian company, OMV, that was, in 1968, the first to conclude a supply contract with Gasprom, which has been absolutely reliable for nearly forty years.
We need to win trust, and perhaps, to some extent, to rebuild it.
I have already, in my speech, discussed the alternative route in the shape of the âNabuccoâ pipeline through Turkey.
Absolutely necessary though it is to diversify supply, this cannot be accomplished overnight; we must learn our lessons from the critical situation that lasted for 36Â hours.
With this in mind, I am grateful to your House for this very important debate and will close by highlighting the importance that we attach to this chapter as an item on the agenda for the Spring Summit in March.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for this debate, which clearly indicates there is general support for developments towards a common EU energy policy that respects subsidiarity.
It is interesting that the first calls for such vital developments were made 30 years ago, during the first oil crisis.
At that time, for obvious reasons, they came not from Parliament but from the Council.
The situation today is definitely more complex than it was then, and will probably have longer-lasting consequences in the energy area than was the case 30Â years ago.
Given these circumstances, the Council, the Commission and Parliament must act.
On the security dimension, I would like to mention two particular aspects.
Firstly, enlargement definitely brought new challenges for the European Union.
Security of supply was certainly a far bigger challenge for the new Member States than for the older Member States.
Secondly, the paper we are preparing at this stage has two authors: Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and myself.
Therefore, the issues that Mr Swoboda raised will be addressed.
We also look into action at times of crisis.
As I mentioned, this crisis was very short and some speakers referred to it as a mini- or even non-existent crisis.
One should not underestimate the importance of the situation, because some countries did feel an impact.
In most countries, the only impact felt by citizens was a media one.
However, in some countries economic measures were taken in respect of the supply of gas.
It was a real crisis and we should look at how we could react more effectively in the future.
At the same time, we should act immediately.
We already have a lot of instruments that could be applied vigorously.
On energy efficiency, we have a building directive entering into force which should be applied vigorously.
The same applies to combined heat and power, and renewable energies: we have legal instruments and we should apply them. The same is true for renewable energy.
The Commission will do everything possible.
It is already taking positive steps, such as trying to mobilise all possible resources.
Let me turn to the New Neighbourhood countries, with which we have very good relations.
Unfortunately, it is true that energy issues have been neglected.
A memorandum of understanding with Ukraine on the implementation of energy policy was signed only this year during the summit.
Therefore, we really need to help not only to deal with external supply issues but also with energy consumption, because the energy intensity in those countries, and energy losses, are tremendous, and no country could bear the energy costs arising from that situation.
The same applies to Moldova.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has done a good job in Ukraine, but it could intensify its activities.
We could draw on other resources to strengthen these and harness New Neighbourhood instruments for strengthening policies.
We will do this, and do the same as regards development policy, because otherwise there can be no solution.
I should like to thank you once again for this debate.
I am sure that this will not be the last time we debate these issues, and I draw a lot of inspiration from such debates.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on
- the report (A6-0391/2005) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (COM(2005)0263 â C6 0243/2005 â 2005/0118(CNS));
- the report (A6-0392/2005) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (COM(2005)0263 â C6-0244/2005 â 2005/0119(CNS)), and
- the report (A6-0393/2005) by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the European Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (COM(2005)0263 â C6-0245/2005 â 2005/0120(CNS)).
Â Â  . Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank MrÂ Daul, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Mr Fazakas and MrsÂ Morgantini for their proactive involvement in this dossier, and to praise the impressive work accomplished by the rapporteurs, Mr Fruteau, MrÂ Glattfelder, MrÂ Wynn and Mrs Kinnock.
Let me also thank the members of the Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development, International Trade, Budgetary Control and Development for their strong commitment, their helpful input and the very constructive debate.
These impressive contributions certainly have produced results.
The reform of the common market organisation that has remained practically unchanged for almost four decades is a major undertaking; in fact this reform is long overdue.
Sugar policy has many facets.
The list of legitimate interests that need to be met is very long: the hundreds of thousands of farmers who grow sugar beet in the community; the sugar producing and consuming industries and their workers; the consumers; and, last but not least, our trade partners, including those countries enjoying longstanding preferences.
From the beginning, I have been aware of the need to strike a fine balance between the different needs and the different demands.
As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, I am fully aware of the social, economic and environmental relevance of the sugar sector, both inside and outside the Community.
That makes sugar policy particularly challenging, which is why I have committed myself so deeply to the reform of this sector.
I believe that the present proposals in their entirety respond to the needs of the Community.
They are the result of careful reflection and are in tune in the CAP reform package and our international commitments.
We have been ambitious and far-reaching.
I am convinced that the future of the sugar sector cannot be based on short-term approaches.
The reform package seeks to give the European sugar sector a viable and competitive future.
It offers long-term certainty and generous assistance to help both farmers and sugar producers with the process of adjustment.
By acting now, we will have the funds available to ease the painful restructuring process that is absolutely vital and at the same time compensate our farmers.
Delaying this necessary reform would result in nothing but a more drastic reduction of Community production and a much more severe restructuring process.
We also need to ensure the compliance of the future regime with the WTO panel, and our proposal fulfils that requirement.
Finally, we have to ensure that the European Union remains an attractive market for developing countries, and offer our ACP partners the necessary financial assistance to adapt to these unavoidable changes.
Much useful work has been done since the first communication from the Commission was presented in the summer of 2004, both in the European Parliament and in the Council.
As a result, today we have the contours of a reform that has to a very large extent been shaped by Parliament.
Most obvious is that the entire reform is built on the basis of a restructuring fund, which was an idea originally introduced by the European Parliament in the report by MrÂ Fruteau and Mr Daul at the beginning of last year.
There are many other examples of the European Parliamentâs influence on this reform: the retention of the intervention system during a transitional period; the reduction of the price cuts and its extension over a four-year period with a generous compensation scheme; all the measures taken to more adequately ensure the management of supply; the possibilities of making a real difference in those areas that will be most affected by the restructuring; and the allocation of the restructuring aid, of which at least 10% would be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors âÂ an amount that could be increased by Member States according to their specific situations.
All these fingerprints show that we have had collaboration that has gone beyond the expression of intention and has delivered a real political result.
I want to express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for its cooperation.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is today faced with the necessity of reforming its sugar sector.
As we all know, this reform is unavoidable.
It is necessary because we need to bring the common organisation of the market in sugar into line with the guiding principles of the new common agricultural policy.
It is also necessary in order to adapt to the changing rules of world trade.
All the same, we must not lose sight of the consequences of the coming changes for the men and women who make their living from producing sugar in the fields and factories of the Community and in the developing countries.
With this in mind, it is important that the changes to the European sugar sector do not result in the dismantling of our common organisation of the market in sugar, in the gradual closure of our production capacity or in the sacrifice of our producers and those of the poorest countries in consequence of an uncontrolled opening of world trade.
Reform is essential, that is true, but it will only meet its objectives if the quest for efficiency respects the requirements of social justice.
This twin perspective, which makes for balance, is the common thread running through the three reports on which the European Parliament is to vote this week and which were adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 29Â November last.
These texts are the fruit of several monthsâ discussions and hearings in the Committee on Agriculture and of exchanges of views with yourself, Commissioner, with your services and with the various parties concerned in the industry.
They represent a compromise negotiated and approved by a large majority of the political groups in this Parliament.
There are four major aspects to this compromise.
The first is the introduction of flexible regulation of the sugar market.
Flexibility, then, through the gradual introduction of market logic into the sector; I am referring to the reference price, which will make the sector more competitive.
Regulation, too, however, to avoid the disastrous consequences of a totally deregulated sugar market.
Internally, this means maintaining the intervention system for a time so as to guarantee market stability during the next four years, which we all know will be difficult economically.
Turning to the external aspect of the reform, the need for regulation means keeping control of sugar imports from the least developed countries.
It is in fact essential today that we take account of the damage caused by the uncontrolled opening of trade, as the recent example of the western Balkans has shown.
With this in mind, in order to avoid any incentive for fraud once the âEverything But Armsâ initiative has taken full effect, the Committee on Agriculture argues in particular for the establishment of a commercial safeguard in the form of a safeguard clause limiting exports according to the net exporter principle.
This arrangement would enable us to prevent destructive triangular trade while ensuring for the least developed countries that their local populations working in the sugar-producing sector will actually benefit from the preferential trade regime with the European Union.
It would not affect the growth prospects of the LDCsâ sugar industries and would be fully compatible with the objectives of the âEverything But Armsâ initiative.
The second major theme of the compromise before Parliament is European solidarity with, in particular, the most fragile regions.
While the establishment of trade regulation will allow us to stabilise markets and avoid excessive price fluctuations in the future, it must in fact be accompanied by measures to cushion the reformâs impact on the communities most affected by cessation of activity, above all those which are most fragile.
These include, first of all, farmers; they must receive substantial compensation for their loss of income, and some of the aid provided by the restructuring scheme should allow those who will lose their delivery rights and will be forced to make new investments in order to switch to other crops to be indemnified.
Then there are the people employed in sugar factories.
They are totally dependant on the sectorâs future restructuring, and it is essential, where there is cessation of industrial activity, that they be considered by strengthening the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to receive aid from the restructuring fund.
Finally, to avoid the most fragile regions being the main casualties of the restructuring of Community production, it is essential that the Member States should still have the final say over whether production ceases or continues on their territory.
It is also essential that due and proper account be taken of the specific situations and constraints of the outermost regions.
The growing and processing of sugar cane are essential to those regions and irreplaceable, in economic, social and cultural terms.
In this connection, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being such a good listener and for the efforts you have made to ensure that these regions receive special treatment, especially as regards compensation and sales aid.
I am sure that such schemes, for which Parliament has called, will enable the people of those regions who make their living from sugar cane to look to the future with greater equanimity.
The third aspect of the reform is concerned with the sectorâs future through the development of alternative outlets.
In a world context characterised, on the one hand, by rising oil prices and, on the other, by the need to fight greenhouse gases, alcohol production in the sugar sector in fact offers a major asset for the development of alternative energies.
In view of the impact of the reform of the COM on production levels, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore proposes anticipating these trends by means of a proactive policy involving both the agricultural and the industrial aspects: the agricultural by means of measures to improve access to aid for energy crops in particular, the industrial by adapting the restructuring scheme to encourage the development of bioethanol distilleries.
These tools form part of a coherent legislative proposal that would encourage the development of the bioethanol industry, a source of outlets for both farmers and manufacturers in the sector.
Finally, the fourth and last major thrust of our work, but not the least: prices.
By contrast to the Commissionâs original proposals, which would have a drastic effect on the sector, the rural fabric and the developing countries, the Committee on Agriculture in the end came out in favour of a slower and more moderate 30% reduction in sugar prices over four years.
Such a level of price reduction would guarantee the reformâs economic effectiveness while helping to soften its impact on the sectorâs players.
In so doing, it would better guarantee continued activity in the production regions, safeguarding hundreds of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly related to the sector.
This more moderate approach is also in line with the Communityâs development commitments and will enable the ACP and LDC countries which export part of their production to the EU to continue to practice remunerative prices.
At the end of November, in anticipation of the World Trade Organisation conference in Hong Kong and without waiting for Parliamentâs final vote, the Ministers of Agriculture of the twenty-five Member States reached an informal, provisional compromise on the main directions of the future reform.
While the real purpose of that agreement was to arrive at a common political line, the way it was immediately exploited by the various signatories in the media as meaning that the reform had been settled ahead of schedule nevertheless sends a clear message: I believe it expresses the desire of the Commission and the Council to bypass the European Parliament, whose prior opinion is nevertheless mandatory before any decision is taken.
In this respect, I find the procedure totally unacceptable and it must be condemned in the strongest terms.
However that may be, that compromise is now on the table and while it does not follow the Committee on Agricultureâs proposed amendments to the letter, it has to be said that, as it stands, it is a remarkable confirmation of how far the Council has moved from the original proposals.
The compromise marks an appreciable shift towards the more moderate and more balanced measures proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the four major topics I have just mentioned.
In terms of regulation, it takes up the idea of maintaining the intervention system for four years, before moving to a reference price, which will mark the introduction of the logic of the market into the common organisation of the market in sugar.
Secondly, and more importantly, it confirms the soundness of Parliamentâs analysis regarding the need to retain some ability to manage the supply of sugar on the Community market.
While the measures proposed are different, their philosophies converge along the lines of adapting the âEverything But Armsâ initiative.
Concerning the implementation of European solidarity, the Council backs the increase in aid to farmers, proposing a compensation of 64.2% of lost earnings instead of the 60% initially proposed.
It also takes up the idea of transferring to farmers 10% of the money provided for restructuring aid.
Parliamentâs proposal for a partial coupling and a modulation of aid for the less-favoured regions was not adopted, however.
Concerning the third line of approach, alternative outlets, the Ministers of Agriculture of the twenty-five Member States confirmed the possibility of a partial dismantling of factories, enabling bioethanol distilleries to be developed.
Nevertheless, the hoped-for financial incentives for the development of energy crops have not materialised.
Finally, in the field of prices, the 36% reduction over four years envisaged by the Council is not so quick or drastic as the initial proposals and is entirely consistent with the work done by the European Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture.
Despite this undeniable progress, which must be welcomed, a number of proposals have not been taken up, in particular as regards tightening up the conditions that manufacturers will have to satisfy in order to qualify for restructuring aid.
It is in this regard particularly regrettable that the Council has up until now disregarded all the social criteria that must be complied with and the fact that it is ultimately up to the Member States to approve or otherwise any cessations of production.
Moreover, even if it means departing from what is, strictly speaking, the subject of this debate and of my reports, I really must at this point express my outrage at the way the ACP countries are treated.
In the light of a reform, and in particular a price cut, the consequences of which will be disastrous for a great many of them, the sum of EURÂ 40 million allocated by the Council for 2006 can only be considered derisory and insulting.
The European Union really will have to find the resources necessary to remedy this situation, which contrasts with what the Heads of State or Government have repeatedly said about helping the poorest countries to develop.
It is clear, ladies and gentlemen, that the Ministers of Agriculture will have to continue their efforts during the February negotiations if they are to reach a final agreement that is acceptable to all.
With this in mind, I would like Parliament to vote in favour of the three reports before it with the largest possible majority in order to send a strong signal to the members of the Council so that the remaining gaps in Novemberâs provisional compromise are closed and the COM in sugar is reformed in a way that is both fair and efficient.
Â Â  . Madam President, I thank the Commissioner and Mr Fruteau for dealing so well with what is an extremely contentious and difficult issue.
Clearly the reform of the sugar sector is essential, but I cannot agree that the collateral damage of what is an internal European Union reform should be felt by some of the small, vulnerable economies with whom we have very special relationships and partnerships.
Throughout the discussions the ACP countries have made the case for a gradual price cut, an end to dumping and for additional long-term funding to help them deal with what is a drastic reform.
By and large, their pleas have been rejected.
It is the view of the ACP countries, as Mr Fruteau has intimated, that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what is on the table now.
They have no guarantee of where the money is to come from in the long term to help them restructure and to diversify both within and outside of sugar.
In the Caribbean alone the losses as a result of the cuts are expected to be in the region of EURÂ 125Â million.
The ACP Sugar Protocol countries supplied tropical sugar when Europe needed it.
Now they are asking that we understand the inevitable dependence they have on that commodity, one upon which they depend for foreign exchange earnings which have brought stability to them and have ensured that they maintain democracies.
Compensation amounting to EURÂ 7.5Â billion is on the table for European farmers.
So far the ACP has EURÂ 40Â million, which is to be divided between 18Â countries, and it is not even clear how it is going to be divided.
In addition, Commissioner Mandelson warned last night in the WTO debate that the figure of EURÂ 190Â million, which the Commission has proposed, is now threatened by a 20% cut agreed in the EUâs budget negotiations.
Commissioner, where exactly is that money going to come from?
Is it yet again the intention of the Commission to raid the development budget to cover the cost of these accompanying measures for the ACP?
I hope that the Commissioner for Development, MrÂ Michel, will stand firm and that, in the spirit of what you said about your interest in developing countries, you will give your support for new and additional money to cover the accompanying measures.
Another concern relates to the effects of the regulation on LDCs.
I refer you to the amendments that I have submitted on that issue.
Almost all of the worldâs least developed countries are members of the ACP group.
Therefore they have an enormous interest in the appalling suggestion that we should pull back on our commitments to Everything But Arms.
From 2009 all least developed countries should benefit from the same guaranteed price as that provided for in the ACP Sugar Protocol.
There should be no delay in the fulfilment of Europeâs commitments to provide duty-free, quota-free access on a stable and long-term basis to LDCs.
The safeguard clause that was agreed by the Council calls for an upper limit of a 25% increase per year on LDC imports. That makes an absolute mockery of EBA.
LDCs are set to lose EURÂ 783Â million of potential earnings in the first year alone.
I hope that this Parliament will not accept a situation which jeopardises a European initiative of which we have been justifiably proud.
We must not vote for any delay on the implementation or indeed for a safeguard clause, which would limit the promise offered by EBA.
In line with the objective of having coherence between agriculture and development priorities, I would recommend support for amendments on the elimination of export subsidies and the abolition of C sugar exports. If we fail to act we will be giving absolutely the wrong signal to millions of the worldâs poorest people, at a time when Europe is meant to be focusing on making poverty history.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Committee on International Trade prepared a recommendation for the draft report debated today.
This had three main elements.
The first element stated that the Committee proposes a moderate price cut.
We proposed that the European Union restrict imports more efficiently and that sugar producing farmers in the European Union receive higher compensation.
These proposals are significantly more beneficial for the European sugar sector than those tabled by the European Commission.
It is unfortunate that the decision of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, adopted in November, is extremely disappointing, as it does not take into account sufficiently the interests of European agriculture, and in fact it is even questionable that a decision adopted in this manner would lead to the development of a stable sugar market in the European Union.
Today, Parliament can only hope for minor changes, but we are still very determined in respect of a few details.
For instance, we would like to make it possible for sugar beet growers to be able to receive up to a fifty percent share from the restructuring fund instead of the current ten percent.
I would like to draw attention to the fact that in the opinion of the committee, the effective restriction of imports is extremely important.
For instance, even the United States of America restricts imports under preferential conditions.
If the United States does not allow cheating, then the European Union should not allow it either because it undermines the international reputation of the European Union.
Furthermore, a system that imposes strict quotas on producers in the European Union, but allows importers to supply the markets of the European Union without any restriction is extremely meaningless and unjust.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that when she first presented her proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I applauded.
I realise that I was the only person who applauded in that committee, which put me at odds with many of my colleagues.
I applauded because I have wanted reform in this sector ever since I read the 1991 report by the Court of Auditors.
I have sought changes in the regime from a budget control point of view, from a budget point of view, from a development point of view, from a WTO point of view and from a consumer point of view, which puts me at odds with MrÂ Fruteau, for whom I have the greatest respect and whom I genuinely admire.
